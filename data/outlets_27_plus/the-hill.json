Most of the speakers were students from Stoneman Douglas or students affected by gun violence.\n\nAfter the Stoneman Douglas shooting, the high school students began to organize and advocate for gun reform, largely targeting the National Rifle Association and politicians supported by the group.",

No elected officials took the platform, although many were spotted marching among the crowd in D.C.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe BidenJoseph (Joe) Robinette BidenBiden: 'I shouldn't have said' I would fight Trump in high school Biden: I would only fight Trump in high school Biden praises Parkland students fighting for gun reform: 'They're going to win' MORE surprised the crowd marching in his home state of Delaware.\n\nTwo fellow Parkland survivors showed up to the rally in D.C. despite having healing gunshot wounds.",

Image: @DigitalGlobe pic.twitter.com/cp10gRXJbV -- Washington Post (@washingtonpost)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nThe aerial images shows a sea of people packed onto Pennsylvania Avenue, the street leading from the Capitol to the White House, causing road closures throughout downtown D.C. along the National Mall.\n\nOther cities across the country including Boston, Chicago, Houston and New York City saw crowds numbering in the tens of thousands marching in protest of gun violence and demanding action on gun laws.",

The students called for lawmakers to pass stricter gun measures to curb violence at schools.\n\nKashuv said he wasn't invited to speak at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally, despite him being in favor of gun reform.\n\nHe also criticized his fellow student David Hogg, who has become an outspoken advocate for gun control, for ending a call with the White House looking to invite him to an event on curbing violence in schools. Kashuv called the move \"dumb and immature.\"\n\n\"It paints a bad light on my entire generation,\" he said.\n\nKashuv said that he spoke with people at Saturday's rally and found that they don't understand what they are marching for, pointing to the group's website.\n\n\"They think they are marching to end school violence but in reality, the 'March for Our Lives' website has it listed that they want to ban assault rifles,\" Kashuv said.\n\n\"If you don't know what you are marching for, that is an issue.\"",

March For Our Lives protest on Saturday, where she became ill onstage before finishing her speech in front of thousands of assembled students and other protesters.\n\nFuentes along with more than a dozen others were injured last month when a gunman attacked Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, killing 17 students and faculty in a deadly rampage.\n\n\"The truth is, I am not here for me. I am here for you. So you don't have to fear of getting shot in your own classroom,\" Fuentes said before the episode.\n\nThe high school student became ill and threw up onstage while the cameras were still rolling, before being comforted by another organizer and helped back to the podium where she resumed speaking for several minutes.\n\n\"I just threw up on international television!\" Fuentes said after returning to the podium. \"And it feels great!\"\n\n\"We're not asking for a ban, we're asking for compromise,\" she continued, calling for tougher gun restrictions alongside about 200 of her fellow Parkland students.\n\n\"Our mission is simple and our ambitions are unbeatable. Let's keep the guns out of the hands of the wrong people and keep them in the hands of the safe and reasonable,\" she said.\n\nFuentes previously made headlines last month when she told reporters she was disappointed in President TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE after receiving a phone call from him following the shooting.\n\n\"He said he heard I was a big fan of his, and then he said, 'I'm a big fan of yours, too,' \" Fuentes said in February.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure he made that up,\" she continued. \"Talking to the president, I've never been so unimpressed by a person in all my life. He didn't make me feel better in the slightest.\"",

Noir addressed the parkland survivors, saying \"nobody would know your names\" if their classmates were still alive.\n\n\"To all the kids from Parkland getting ready to use your First Amendment to attack everyone else's Second Amendment at your march on Saturday, I wish a hero like [Ofc.] Blaine Gaskill had been at Marjory Douglas High School last month because your classmates would still be alive and no one would know your names, because the media would have completely and utterly ignored your story, the way they ignored his,\" Noir said.\n\n\"They're running Season 5 of their gun-control reality show, featuring the freshest cast of characters yet in their modern march on Washington,\" he went on. \"Except this time for less freedom. These kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structure.\"\n\nThe NRA and politicians associated with the gun lobby have become top targets for Parkland students seeking gun law reform in the wake of the shooting, who have accused the organization of having undue control over members of Congress that stifles gun legislation from passing.\n\nGaskill was lauded as a hero this week by Maryland authorities after police say the school resource officer shot and killed Austin Wyatt Rollins, who injured his ex-girlfriend and another student this week.\n\nMaryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said that Wednesday's shooting should be a \"call to action\" to protect schools in the state.\n\n\"Although our pain remains fresh and the facts remain uncertain, today's horrible events should not be an excuse to pause our conversation about school safety. Instead, it must serve as a call to action,\" he said in a statement.",

                "body": "The \"March for Our Lives\" rally in Washington D.C. had a long list of speakers and performers but not a single one of them was an elected official.\n\nThe rally, which was organized by the student survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting that left 17 people dead, featured mainly student speakers throughout the day.\n\nWhile a number of politicians were spotted marching among the crowd on Saturday in D.C., not one took the stage. Some lawmakers, including civil rights icon Rep. John LewisJohn LewisClinton, Pelosi, John Lewis to eulogize Slaughter Gun protests sweep nation as House passes school safety bill John Lewis to student gun protesters: 'I will be with you all of the way' MORE (D-Ga.), took the stage at marches in their districts.\n\nDuring the event, Parkland student Emma Gonzales emphasized the short period of time it took for the shooter at Stoneman Douglas to kill 17 people. Eleven-year-old Naomi Wadler reiterated that the students, no matter how young, are not being used by adults and are speaking out because they understand the issue of gun violence.\n\nPerformers, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato, also sang at the rally.\n\nMany politicians -- mainly Democrats -- expressed their support for the march on social media and some participated in rallies held in their districts.\n\nOrganizers of the D.C. march estimate that at least 800,000 people turned out for the rally. D.C. metropolitan police have yet to release their own estimates.",

McMaster as national security advisor. Pompeo, the hawkish CIA director, will replace Rex TillersonRex Wayne TillersonTrump rattles White House with Bolton shake-up Kellyanne Conway on White House departures: 'Get with the program or get out' Petraeus: Watch how Pompeo tackles lagging State Department appointments MORE as secretary of State.\n\nThe changes shift Trump away from a more establishment-friendly team, and in the direction of one that would change today's order.\n\nAnd it comes after other moves that also suggest Trump is embracing the disruptive nature of his campaign -- including the imposition of new tariffs on steel and aluminum that led to the resignation of former economic adviser Gary CohnGary Davivd CohnKellyanne Conway on White House departures: 'Get with the program or get out' White House aides planned to announce McMaster with other departures: report Trump considered ousting Kelly and serving as his own chief of staff: report MORE.\n\n\"The broader context is that you had previously -- if you're looking at McMaster, Tillerson, [Defense Secretary James] Mattis and Cohn -- you had a pretty standard national security establishment team,\" said James Goldgeier, former dean of American University's School of International Service.\n\n\"You could have imagined that four in any recent administration,\" Goldgeier said. \"So you're starting to see a shift away from an establishment team more toward a team that fits Trump's more disruptive style.\"\n\nTrump seems to agree, in that he's said he is making moves to get the \"Cabinet and other things that I want.\"\n\nAnd the latest changes are likely to have a huge impact on policy.\n\nThe Iran deal was already hanging by a thread after Trump announced earlier this year he would reimpose nuclear sanctions on Tehran in May if European allies do not agree to a supplemental agreement to punish Iran for issues not addressed in the nuclear accord.\n\nOn North Korea, Trump has recently embraced diplomacy, agreeing to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But he's previously threatened \"fire and fury\" if Pyongyang doesn't curb its nuclear threats.\n\nPompeo is a fierce critic of the Iran deal, which he has said \"virtually guaranteed that Iran will have the freedom to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nBolton, meanwhile, argued the case for a pre-emptive strike on North Korea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in February and encouraged Trump to \"abrogate the Iran nuclear deal in his first days in office\" last year.\n\n\"I hear the drumbeats of war,\" Rep. Barbara LeeBarbara Jean LeeDeVos battles lawmakers in contentious hearing Senate Dem denounces Farrakhan's remarks Women's March leader defends attending event where speaker made anti-semitic remarks MORE (D-Calif.) said in a statement reacting to the Bolton news.\n\nVoices who wanted to improve the Iran deal but not scrap it suggested that is now a lost cause.\n\n\"I think my long-standing hope for a fix to the Iran deal just died. Time of death: Afternoon of March 22, 2018. Now what?\" tweeted Foundation for the Defense of Democracies CEO Mark Dubowitz.\n\nAfter Pompeo's nomination last week, one former State Department official said that Trump is likely to send a signal that he has no interest in fixing the Iran nuclear deal. By installing a staunch opponent of the agreement as his chief diplomat, the official said, Trump could preemptively weaken the U.S. position in negotiations.\n\n\"I think the real risk here is that the Europeans see the writing on the wall and believe the president has no intention of making an agreement work to try to salvage the deal, and decide to go their own direction, and see what they can do to try to preserve things with the Iranians,\" the official said.\n\nBrian Hook, the State Department's policy planning director who's in charge of Iran deal negotiations, declined to comment during a briefing this week about how the transition to Pompeo's leadership would affect efforts to hammer out changes to the agreement.\n\nNot everyone thinks the personnel changes will lead to significantly new policies.\n\nJames Carafano, a defense policy expert at the Heritage Foundation who's close with the administration, said he does not anticipate a shift.\n\n\"I never bought into the axis-of-adult narrative,\" Carafano said of the idea that Tillerson, McMaster and Mattis temper Trump's policies. \"Trump from day one has been the decider-in-chief.\"\n\nCarafano also argued that many big policy stances have already been staked out in documents such as the National Security Strategy and the National Defense Strategy.\n\n\"I just don't think at the end of the day Trump wants a war. He keeps holding up Reagan as his model,\" he said. \"Reagan wasn't a warmonger. He wanted to show a strong face to have enemies' respect, but he didn't want to fight wars, and I don't think Trump wants to a fight war.\"\n\nStill, Carafano said he thinks some \"tactics\" might change as he believes Trump moved Pompeo and brought in Bolton for his vision to move faster and to have out-of-the-box ideas to achieve that vision. Carafano highlighted previous actions such as cutting off aid to Pakistan, moving the U.S. embassy in Israel and agreeing to meeting with Kim, suggesting such unconventional decisions could happen more frequently now.\n\nWith similar worldviews, Pompeo and Bolton could forge a closer relationship with one another than their predecessors, potentially resolving the issue of competing power centers among Trump's foreign policy team.\n\nMcMaster and Tillerson were known to clash often. On North Korea, for example, Tillerson urged a more cautious approach to the crisis, while McMaster held out a potential military strike on the Korean Peninsula as a real option.\n\nBut others have warned Pompeo and Bolton's uniform viewpoint could be an issue.\n\n\"Trump will now be surrounded by people with very similar views on key issues,\" John McLaughlin, former acting director of the CIA, told the Cipher Brief. \"This can be a problem and can close off options unless Bolton rises to the occasion as a national security advisor -- whose principal job is always to tease out a range of views and present them fairly to the president and lay out the pros and cons of each option.\"\n\nGoldgeier highlighted Mattis' continued place in the administration as a possible temper on Trump's more hawkish tendencies, saying Mattis is a \"formidable figure\" with a strong department and allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut, he added, \"it's always a question as to whether anyone can temper Trump's impulses,\" and Pompeo and Bolton could reinforce those impulses.\n\n\"He has people in place who are going to reinforce his own instincts, and I think, particularly with Iran, we've heard for some time from him that he wants to walk away from the Iran deal. Now has a national security advisor that's going to say, 'Yeah, you should do that,'\" Goldgeier said. \"I think we should be worried that we have people who have argued that military force against Iran and North Korea would solve the problems that we have associated with those two countries.\"",

Twirling encouraged. #marchforourlives pic.twitter.com/ZIfEEDIEHk -- Alex Roarty (@Alex_Roarty)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\n\"These politicians act so ridiculous, so we're going to show them just how ridiculous they really are,\" Aaron Overman, a member of the group from D.C. told the newspaper.\n\nHe noted that even though the event can be somber, people are still looking to have fun and socialize.\n\nEarly estimates from organizers reported that as many as 800,000 people attended the rally in D.C. The rally was largely organized by student survivors of the Florida school shooting in February.\n\nSister marches are also taking place on Saturday in hundreds of cities around the world.\n\nD.C. metropolitan police have yet to release their own estimates of the crowd size.",

                "body": "Two students injured in last month's school shooting in Parkland, Fla. attended Saturday's March For Our Lives in Washington, D.C. despite still recovering from their injuries.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School students Kyle Laman and Ashley Baez attended the Washington D.C. rally alongside fellow Parkland students and organizers of the national anti-gun violence movement that Saturday saw rallies in all 50 states.\n\nThe Miami Herald reports that the two students attended the rally with about 200 of their fellow Parkland students, Laman in a wheelchair while Baez used a cane to walk. The two were shot in the foot and leg, respectively, when a gunman attacked their school in February killing 17 students and faculty.\n\nBoth of them reported feeling overwhelmed by the massive scope of Saturday's rally in Washington, which police say was attended by at least 800,000 people.\n\n\"I genuinely was afraid to come,\" Baez said. \"It's such a big group, and you never know what's going to happen.\"\n\n\"It's kind of overwhelming,\" Laman added. \"I don't really know what to expect.\"\n\nDuring the rally, fellow Parkland students including David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez addressed the crowd, calling for tougher restrictions on guns while calling out politicians supported by the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\n\"I'm going to start off by putting this price tag right here as a reminder for you guys to know how much Marco RubioMarco Antonio RubioRubio: 'Hyperventilating' about Bolton unfounded George Clooney writes Parkland students: 'You make me proud of my country again' Biden praises Parkland students fighting for gun reform: 'They're going to win' MORE took for every student's life in Florida,\" Hogg began his speech.\n\n\"The cold grasp of corruption shackles the District of Columbia,\" Hogg added in his remarks. \"The winter is over. Change is here. The sun shines on a new day, and the day is ours.\"",

One of the claims involves an alleged incident that happened more than 10 years ago.\n\n\"I am alleged to have attempted to touch a woman inappropriately while we were both riding in a transport van on a movie set,\" Bailey said in a memo released on Friday. \"That did not happen.\"\n\nThe memo states that Bailey has not commented on the allegations so far because he wants to \"allow the Academy process to play out.\"\n\nThe Academy is currently reviewing the allegations and has not commented on the case since a statement put out on March 16 stating its process for reviewing complaints.\n\n\"The Academy treats any complaints confidentially to protect all parties,\" the Academy told ITK last in a statement. \"The Membership Committee reviews all complaints brought against Academy members according to our Standards of Conduct process, and after completing reviews, reports to the Board of Governors.\"\n\nBailey, who was elected president o the Academy in August, headed the organization when it expelled Harvey Weinstein a few months ago after reports of sexual harassment.\n\nSince Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct, a number of prominent men in the entertainment industry -- as well as media and politics -- have lost their jobs because of accusations of sexual misconduct.",

Thousands of Americans have reignited the national debate over gun control and school safety after the shooting at Gonzalez's school last month.\n\nHalf a million people were expected to attend just Washington D.C.'s rally, while video and pictures showed thousands gathering around the country in similar marches.",

That attack, which left 17 people dead and 14 others injured, prompted a renewed debate over gun control.\n\nTrump appeared willing to back a comprehensive plan to strengthen firearms restrictions shortly after the shooting, but has since reversed on that position.",

Trump is visiting his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.\n\nA White House press pool report detailed how the president's motorcade diverted from its normal route on Saturday, and instead took a longer path.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the route change was prompted by the protests.\n\nThe March for Our Lives was organized in the wake of a deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., near Fort Lauderdale, that left 17 people dead and 14 others injured.\n\nSince then, students from the school have led a nationwide call for stricter gun control laws.",

John LewisJohn LewisClinton, Pelosi, John Lewis to eulogize Slaughter Gun protests sweep nation as House passes school safety bill John Lewis to student gun protesters: 'I will be with you all of the way' MORE (D-Ga.) declared Saturday that he was \"proud\" to have received an 'F' rating on his position on gun rights from the National Rifle Association.\n\nSpeaking at the March for Our Lives rally in Atlanta, Lewis boasted that he and many other Democratic lawmakers bore failing grades from the powerful gun rights lobbying group.\n\n\"You know the NRA gave me an 'F,' and I'm proud, I'm proud to wear that 'F,'\" he said. \"So on the Democratic side of the House of Representatives, many members of Congress are wearing an 'F.'\"\n\n\"I can flunk out of the NRA university over and over again,\" he added.\n\nThe rally in Atlanta was one of dozens taking place across the country on Saturday to protest gun violence and call for stricter gun control measures in the wake of a deadly shooting at a South Florida high school last month.\n\nThe NRA's influence on lawmakers has come under particular scrutiny in the aftermath of that shooting, with protesters and gun control advocates calling out politicians who have taken campaign contributions from the group.",

Many support gun ban. But many others see it as infringement of #2A that won't prevent shootings. Protest is good way of making a point,but making a change will require both sides finding common ground,\" Rubio wrote.\n\nToday many are peacefully exercising their #1A right to march for gun ban. Many support gun ban. But many others see it as infringement of #2A that won't prevent shootings. Protest is good way of making a point,but making a change will require both sides finding common ground -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nRubio's remarks came after a survivor of the Parkland school shooting last month that killed 17 people in Rubio's home state mentioned the senator by name on stage at the march in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I'm going to start off by putting this price tag right here as a reminder for you guys to know how much Marco Rubio took for every student's life in Florida,\" student David Hogg told attendees, referencing Rubio's campaign contributions from the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nRubio is one of the top recipients of NRA campaign contributions in the Senate, having received more than $3 million in donations from the gun rights group and its affiliates, according to data attributed to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe Florida senator has been frequently criticized by survivors of the Florida high school shooting, which reignited a debate about gun rights and the influence of the NRA over Washington politicians.",

Most importantly, we must listen carefully to our students as they express the real problems they face,\" Love wrote in a Friday op-ed for Deserete News.\n\n\"They have a story to tell, and our deeper understanding can very well save their lives,\" Love said.\n\nLove, an ardent supporter of gun rights who holds a concealed-carry permit herself, told readers that she shares \"this nation's deep concern about safety in our schools\" and \"I'm listening.\"\n\n\"This is a complex issue with many contributing factors, and it's important that we look at everything that is contributing to these devastating events. It's equally important that legislative solutions are informed and truly enhance school safety,\" Love explained, signaling her openness to several of the legislative pushes by lawmakers in response to the school shooting epidemic.\n\nOn Saturday, tens of thousands of people flocked to the nation's capital for a rally urging Congress to act to prevent mass shootings at schools, a response to the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting that left 17 people dead last month.\n\nWhile Love said arming teachers in classrooms, an approach suggested by President TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE, may not be a viable solution, she said she would support a ban on lethal gun modification accessories such as bump stocks.\n\nLove has been endorsed for her Utah district by the National Rifle Association, which has given her an \"A\" grade for her support of gun rights.",

March for Our Lives on Saturday.\n\nYolanda Renee King spoke at the rally, invoking her grandfather's words in her call for gun control.\n\n\"My grandfather had a dream that his four little children would not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character,\" she said. \"I have a dream that enough is enough, and that this should be a gun-free world, period.\"\n\nKing led the crowd in a call-and-response chant: \"Spread the word. Have you heard? All across the nation. We are going to be a great generation.\"\n\nThe D.C. march was just one of more than 800 that took place around the world on Saturday.\n\nIn every U.S. state, students gathered to demand congressional action on gun control and school safety. In sibling marches on every continent except Antarctica, young people marched in solidarity with the U.S. students.\n\nThe March for Our Lives was organized by survivors of the February school shooting in Parkland, Fla.",

People have said that I am a tool of some nameless adult. It is not true,\" Wadler said onstage at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington D.C.\n\nThe student said that, even though she might be young, she understands the issues that are currently being debated and is looking forward to the day she and her classmates can vote.\n\n\"My friends and I might still be 11, and we might still be in elementary school but we know. We know that life isn't equal for everyone and we know what is right and wrong,\" Wadler said. \"We also know that we stand in the shadow of the Capitol, and we know that we have seven short years until we too have the right to vote.\"\n\nWadler told the crowd that she was speaking for the African-American women who are victims of gun violence and asked others to join her in advocating for these women.\n\n\"I urge everyone here and everyone who hears my voice to join me in telling the stories that aren't told,\" Wadler said. \"To honor the girls and the women of color who are murdered at disproportionate rates in this nation.\"\n\nThe March for Our Lives rally in D.C. was largely organized by survivors of the Florida high school shooting that left 17 people dead.\n\nSister rallies were organized in hundreds of cities around the world. In D.C., the organizers obtained a permit for 500,000 people to attend the rally downtown.",

Marco RubioMarco Antonio RubioRubio: 'Hyperventilating' about Bolton unfounded George Clooney writes Parkland students: 'You make me proud of my country again' Biden praises Parkland students fighting for gun reform: 'They're going to win' MORE (R-Fla.) on Saturday for putting what he called a \"price tag\" on the lives of students affected by gun violence.\n\nTaking the stage at the March for Our Lives in Washington, Hogg placed a price tag on a lectern, representing the amount of money Rubio's campaign took from the National Rifle Association for each of the 17 victims of the Parkland shooting.\n\n\"First off, I'm going to start off by putting this price tag right here as a reminder for you guys to know how much Marco Rubio took for every student's life in Florida,\" Hogg said.\n\nThe student's comments were the latest on Saturday to decry the NRA's influence on lawmakers. Rubio is among the top recipients of NRA contributions in the Senate, having received more than $3 million in donations from the gun rights group and its affiliates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nRubio has faced frequent criticism since the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. That attack, which left 17 people dead and 14 others injured, reignited a national debate over gun laws and prompted scrutiny of the NRA's influence in Washington and elsewhere.\n\nThe shooting also prompted gun control advocates to organize the March for Our Lives, which drew thousands to Washington and other cities on Saturday.",

I don't know [if gun control legislation can be passed], \" McCartney said. \"But this is what we can do, and I'm here to do it.\"\n\n\"One of my best friends was killed in gun violence right 'round here,\" he added, referring to Lennon's murder outside his Manhattan apartment in 1980. \"So it's important to me.\"\n\nLennon was killed by Mark David Chapman in 1980 outside his home after returning from a studio with his wife, Yoko Ono.\n\nMcCartney was one of thousands of people who attended marches against gun violence in all 50 states, Washington D.C., and countries around the world on Saturday to commemorate victims of gun violence and call for tougher gun control measures.\n\nThe former Beatles member has spoken out in defense of liberal causes before, including last November when he criticized President TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE directly for his views on climate change.\n\nMcCartney endorsed Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonRepublicans invest nearly 0,000 in red Arizona district Al Franken: Sessions firing McCabe 'is hypocrisy at its worst' Papadopoulos encouraged by Trump campaign staffer to make contact with Russians: report MORE during the 2016 presidential election, tweeting a picture with the candidate captioned \"She's with me.\"\n\nThe march was organized by students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 students and faculty in a mass shooting last month.\n\nSaturday's marches were attended by numerous celebrities and politicians, while others tweeted support for demonstrators around the country.",

I have given - I can't count the number of speeches, I've had countless interviews ... They're all out there on the public record. I've never been shy about what my views are,\" Bolton said on Fox News hours after news of his White House appointment broke.\n\nBolton, who made a name for himself as a controversial official under former President George W. Bush, has served as an informal adviser to Trump, been a frequent Fox News commentator and has worked as a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nHere are five things to know about Bolton's past and present views as the hawkish new senior aide moves to take over for H.R. McMaster as Trump's third national security adviser on April 9:\n\nBolton has favored preemptive military strikes\n\nBolton has repeatedly called for a preemptive strike on North Korea, arguing as recently as last month that the United States must use force to resolve the nuclear standoff with Pyongyang.\n\n\"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current 'necessity' posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first,\" Bolton wrote in a Feb. 28 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"Given the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute. That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation.\"\n\nBolton has taken just as hard a stance against Iran, writing in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in January that the United States should \"end the Islamic Republic before its 40th anniversary.\"\n\nIn numerous television appearances and op-eds, Bolton has called for bombing Iran as the best way to stop Tehran's nuclear arms research.\n\nHe's been a controversial boss\n\nThe Senate first blocked Bolton's 2005 appointment to become U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in part over claims that the former State Department official had bullied subordinates.\n\nWhile undersecretary of State for arms control and international security in 2002, Bolton had his staff create a document arguing that Cuba had an active biological weapons program and even transferred such technology to rouge states.\n\nWhen the State Department's top bioweapons analyst refused to approve the claim, Bolton attempted to get him and another top official transferred, the analyst told Congress.\n\nThe Washington Post reported at the time that Bolton was furious at the analyst, called him into his office to scold him, and called him a \"munchkin.\"\n\nAnother former State Department intelligence analyst told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he viewed Bolton as a \"serial bully.\"\n\nIn addition, a government contractor working on a project in Moscow detailed in a letter to the Senate panel aggressive steps Bolton would take to talk with her in 1994, including chasing her down a hotel hall and banging on her suite door.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate eventually failed to confirm Bolton as ambassador, but Bush in August 2005 appointed him to the position while the Senate was on recess.\n\nHe's not a fan of the State Department\n\nBolton has made no secret of his disdain for government agencies and career officials, and has clashed time and time again with State Department officials.\n\nAt the time of Bolton's nomination proceedings in the Senate, 60 retired diplomats sent a letter to committee lawmakers opposing his nomination.\n\nIn 2016, shortly after Trump won the presidency, concerns were again raised over Bolton after his name came up as a potential deputy secretary of State.\n\nSen. Rand PaulRandal (Rand) Howard PaulMichael Steele: Congress must lead on cannabis reform and stand with the American public Lawmakers renew call for end to 'black budget' secrecy McCain asks Trump's CIA pick to explain ties to torture MORE (R-Ky.) early on promised to block the nomination, telling The New York Times that \"there is something to be said for one of the top diplomats in the country being diplomatic.\"\n\nEven Rex TillersonRex Wayne TillersonTrump rattles White House with Bolton shake-up Kellyanne Conway on White House departures: 'Get with the program or get out' Petraeus: Watch how Pompeo tackles lagging State Department appointments MORE, Trump's ultimate pick for secretary of State whom he ousted earlier this month, expressed concerns with having Bolton under him, according to the Times.\n\nOthers have defended the hawkish Bush administration official this week, including Sen. Marco RubioMarco Antonio RubioRubio: 'Hyperventilating' about Bolton unfounded George Clooney writes Parkland students: 'You make me proud of my country again' Biden praises Parkland students fighting for gun reform: 'They're going to win' MORE (R-Fla.).\n\n\"John Bolton is a great addition to the White House. Some of the hyperventilating I am seeing online & on cable news is ridiculous. The one's who should be freaking out are #Iran Maduro #NorthKorea & terrorists. Bad news for them,\" Rubio tweeted Friday.\n\nBolton has been a fixture of Fox News and conservative radio\n\nBolton became a regular on Fox News and conservative talk radio after he left his ambassador role in December 2006.\n\nHard-leaning conservatives were delighted with his bluster and take-no-prisoners approach while at the U.N., where he famously said that if the headquarters in New York \"lost ten stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\"\n\nConservative viewers also welcomed Bolton's hard-line views on North Korea, Islam, the Obama administration and conflicts in the Middle East. Bolton, boosted by his airtime as a Fox New contributor, even considered a run for president in 2012 and 2016 and regularly speaks at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington.\n\nBut Bolton's views have also drawn praise from other areas, including anti-Islam activists known as the counter-jihad movement. The group has championed the false claim that President Obama was a Muslim and not born in the United States.\n\nHe's at odds with Pentagon leadership on stated military goals\n\nBolton will enter his new role with views on Iran and North Korea directly opposite those of Defense Secretary James MattisJames Norman MattisScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump rattles White House with Bolton shake-up MORE.\n\nOn North Korea, while Mattis has championed diplomacy in dealing with the isolate nation - arguing in January it \"should impose reason on Kim's reckless rhetoric and dangerous provocations\" - Bolton has taken a far different tact.\n\nBolton argued in September on Fox News that the \"only diplomatic option left is to end the regime in North Korea.\"\n\n\"Anybody who thinks more diplomacy with North Korea, more sanctions ... is just giving North Korea more time to increase its nuclear arsenal,\" he said.\n\nAnd although Mattis has privately pushed for Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal, Bolton long called for the U.S. to pull out, calling it \"fundamentally flawed.\"\n\nIn the past several years Bolton has also pushed for regime shakeups in Syria and Libya, to be brought about by military action. Pentagon leadership, in contrast, have steered clear of such involvement.\n\nUnlike his soon-to-be predecessor McMaster, Bolton also does not have a prior relationship with Mattis, a retired four-star general.\n\n\"I'm not sure I've ever met General Mattis,\" Bolton said during his Fox News interview.\n\nAdditionally, others have noted that Bolton's views also seem to contradict Trump's campaign rhetoric of staying out of other countries.\n\nThe president on March 4 called the 2003 invasion into Iraq \"the single worst decision ever made.\"\n\n\"Frankly, what I've said in private now is behind me,\" Bolton said on Fox News after his appointment this week. \"The important thing is what the president says and what advice I give him.\"",

Saturday marks the 102nd day he has spent at one of his golf properties, and the 136th he has spent at one of his properties since taking office.\n\nWorldwide, young people and other gun control activists gathered for more than 800 separate demonstrations as part of the March for Our Lives in every U.S. state and on every continent except Antarctica.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., alone, more than 500,000 are expected to join the march, demanding Congressional action on gun control and school safety. The march was organized by survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month.\n\nThe Palm Beach Post reported that protestors in the area plan to walk Trump's motorcade route on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe White House released a statement Saturday morning applauding the gun violence protestors for \"exercising their First Amendment rights.\"",

Congress only had a few hours between the release of the bill and its passage before a Friday night government funding deadline.\n\nPaul called the $1.3 trillion package the \"terrible, no good, rotten deficit spending bill\" and the \"crumni-bus.\" The fiscal hawk previously forced a brief overnight government shutdown last month when he filibustered a stopgap measure over a list of what he said were wasteful federal expenditures buried in the text of a resolution to carry over funding between spending bills.\n\nHe criticized the recent bill as so large that many lawmakers didn't even know all the provisions within. But Paul said it has \"never been my goal to shut down government,\" when asked by Fox News host Tucker Carlson if he would pull a similar stunt on Friday.\n\nPresident TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE reluctantly gave signed the bill into law on Friday, after threatening to use a veto hours before he was slated to approve it.\n\nThe bill included millions of dollars for additional domestic spending and projects considered a boon to Democrats, as well as funding for border security that came in well under Trump's original request.",

                "body": "Valerie Jarrett, the former senior adviser to President Obama, said Saturday that lawmakers should stand up to the National Rifle Association (NRA) and address gun violence.\n\nJarrett, speaking to CNN in an interview on the ground in Washington as thousands of protesters were expected to rally against gun violence, said lawmakers should take cues from high school students pushing for gun controls.\n\n\"What we see here is young people saying, 'We're not asking for permission, we're not intimidated by the NRA. We are empowered to ensure that we change our country.' And they're doing that,\"\n\nJarrett made the comments amid the \"March for Our Lives\" rally in Washington, D.C., and cities across the country pushing for action to curb gun violence.\n\n\"No one should be able to buy a weapon of mass destruction like they can now on the internet without going through a background check,\" Jarrett said.\n\nJarrett said that elected officials, at the federal and state level, are going to have to take action as the push for gun control escalates.\n\nPresident TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE announced on Friday that the Department of Justice will issue a rule banning bump stocks, a device that makes semi-automatic rifles fire more rapidly.\n\nTrump blamed Obama for the legalization of bump stocks. In 2010, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said the devices could not be regulated because they didn't meet the definition of a machine gun.\n\nAsked to respond to Trump's attack on Obama, Jarrett touted the Obama administration's efforts to get Congress to pass \"sensible background checks\" and to close loopholes.\n\nJarrett also praised students affected by the Parkland, Fla., shooting last month for advocating against gun violence in less affluent communities.",

Trump had been pressuring Congress for months to include both funding for his wall proposal and a legislative fix for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.\n\nThe first deadline for DACA protections to end passed on March 5. Nearly two million undocumented immigrants were affected by the administration's decision to end the program last year.\n\n\"Yeah, because you'll be impeached,\" tweeted Coulter, who went on to imply that Schumer had personally defeated Trump in the battle over the bill.\n\nDrudge, who runs the right-leaning news aggregation site Drudge Report, targeted Trump for failing to follow through on a threat to veto the bill Friday with the headline \"Fake Veto\" displayed on the website's homepage.\n\nDuring an impromptu bill signing at the White House, Trump complained that \"nobody read\" the 2,232-page piece of legislation, which Congress passed quickly to avert a third government shutdown this year.\n\n\"It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what's in it,\" Trump said.",

                "body": "The National Rifle Association (NRA), the nation's leading gun lobbying group, increased its online ad spending sixfold after the deadly mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month, according to a new report.\n\nWhile the gun lobbying group briefly went silent online after the shooting, pausing all website and social media advertising, it redoubled its efforts within four days with an aggressive advertising push, the Chicago Tribune reported Friday, citing a review of online data from analytics company Pathmatics.\n\nDaily spending by the NRA in the 24 days before the Parkland shooting averaged $11,300 but leapt to $47,300 on average in the 24 days after the shooting, Pathmatics found, a push that included heavy advertising in the state where the shooting took place.\n\nFlorida was the focus of a massive NRA effort on Facebook, jumping from the gun-rights group's ninth to third-most targeted state in the aftermath of the tragedy, the review found, according to the Tribune. The NRA's daily Facebook advertising dollars jumped from $4,400 to $34,000.\n\nSome pro-gun NRA ads also showed up in videos for high school-age viewers, according to the report, following the shooting at the Florida high school that left 17 people dead and more than a dozen others wounded.\n\nThe online push was punctuated with fiery speeches blasting gun control efforts by NRA president and CEO Wayne LaPierre and spokeswoman Dana Loesch at an annual conservative gathering near Washington just weeks after the shooting.\n\nA student-led march against gun violence will take place in Washington on Saturday that is expected to bring hundreds of thousands of protesters to demand gun control measures from Congress.",

                "body": "Former Vice President Joe BidenJoseph (Joe) Robinette BidenBiden: 'I shouldn't have said' I would fight Trump in high school Biden: I would only fight Trump in high school Biden praises Parkland students fighting for gun reform: 'They're going to win' MORE said Friday that if he doesn't run for president in 2020, he doesn't want it to be because he's afraid of losing.\n\nBiden said \"the jury's still out\" on whether he will launch a Democratic bid for the White House against the sitting Republican president.\n\n\"Honest to God I don't know,\" he said when asked by a reporter at Southern Connecticut University on Friday, as reported by the Hartford Courant.\n\n\"I have to be able to stand in front of a mirror and look in the mirror and know that if I don't run it's not because I'm afraid of losing, it's not because I don't want to take on the responsibility, it's because there's somebody better to do it and/or because emotionally I'm not positioned to be all in,\" he said. \"And so the jury's still out.\"\n\nBiden has previously said he would only run for the Democratic nomination if he didn't think anyone else in the party was up to the challenge.\n\nWhile Biden, who would be 78 by the time of the 2020 elections, had planned to run in 2016 following his stint in the White House under former President Obama, he postponed the plans when his eldest son Beau became ill with terminal cancer.\n\n\"I had planned on running for president,\" Biden said. \"But then my son, my soul, Beau, was diagnosed after he came home from having volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. ... He got a diagnosis which was essentially a death sentence. ... I knew I couldn't run,\" he said.\n\nBiden's remarks come after a Twitter spat with President Trump earlier this week. Biden said at a rally that in high school he would have taken Trump \"behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\" over his lewd comments about women. He later said he shouldn't have made the comment.",

He said they were necessary to protect the national security of the nation.\n\nNumerous countries represented at the WTO meeting rejected that logic, Reuters reported.\n\nSouth Korea warned that nations should be careful in invoking national security as justification for trade barriers as it could lead other countries to try to justify measures they take to protect their industries, according to the report.\n\nMany other countries also expressed fears that the U.S. tariffs could lead to a \"domino effect\" that could be harmful to the unity of the WTO.\n\nThe New York Times reported this week that Trump's unilateral action flouted WTO rules because the United States did not first seek to adjudicate through the organization. However, the U.S. is looking to the WTO to act on accusations of unfair Chinese trade practices.\n\nChina's representative said that new tariffs were \"groundless\" and violated several WTO rules, according to a trade official who spoke with Reuters.\n\nRussia and China are reportedly preparing retaliatory measures to offset the effects of the steel and aluminum tariffs. Russia has asked the U.S. to explain the basis on which they chose certain countries to temporarily exempt from the tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. has exempted the EU, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, South Korea and Brazil from the steel and aluminum tariffs and left open the possibility that others could be added to the list.",

                "body": "The Justice Department on Saturday cancelled two studies into school safety after the funding for the programs was cut under the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that President TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE signed Friday.\n\nA message posted on the website for the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) states that funding for the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative (CSSI) and the Research and Evaluation of Technologies to Improve School Safety solicitation was cut under the omnibus spending bill and reapportioned to the recently-passed Stop School Violence Act of 2018.\n\n\"With the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, the funding planned for these solicitations is no longer available for research and evaluation. Instead, it will be used for other purposes under the Stop School Violence Act of 2018,\" reads the notice.\n\nThe two studies were enacted by Congress in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting to fill gaps created by a ban on Center for Disease Control (CDC) research into gun violence. That ban was also lifted in Friday's spending bill.\n\nThe two programs were funded by $275 million in government funding over the past three fiscal years, according to The Crime Report, but was \"not intended to be a permanent funding stream\" according to a statement from the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs, which includes NIJ.\n\nThe funding cut, however, turns the programs into another example of congressional waste as most of the funded programs had begun research yet were still in the process of producing final reports.\n\n\"The results of currently funded projects will continue to provide evidence about what works (and what does not) in keeping our schools safe and to inform future resource decisions. Almost all CSSI-funded projects are still active and final reports have not yet been published,\" the office said in February.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said earlier this month that President Trump is waiting to see a congressional plan to combat gun violence before endorsing specific provisions, such as universal background checks.\n\n\"He wants to see what that legislation, the final piece of it looks like,\" she said at a press briefing. \"Universal means something different to a lot of people. He certainly wants to focus and improve on the background check system.\"",

For our own sake,\" he said. \"I'm going to encourage anyone who is involved with giving money to any member of the Republican party not to give money to these candidates that will not endorse this plan.\"",

                "body": "#ICYMI part of the opening monologue from tonight pic.twitter.com/Gd8m5n0iIO -- Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson)\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday criticized Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students for speaking out for gun control.\n\nCarlson said on his program that the students who survived the school shooting are not fit not be making policy but, because they have been so outspoken, should still be taken seriously.\n\n\"They have a right to their views obviously, that is a given. This is one of the rare shows that supports the rights of people we disagree with to talk,\" Carson said. \"But the rest of us also have rights, including the right to assess what they are saying and decide whether it ought to become law to which we are subject.\"\n\nCarlson's comments came on the eve of the \"March for Our Lives\" gun control rally that was largely organized by the student survivors of the February 14 Florida school shooting during which 17 people died.\n\nThe Fox News host argued that two of the student activists from Stoneman Douglas, David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez, are not fit to be involved in the gun control debate because they are still recovering from the shooting.\n\n\"He is a kid. He has just been through unspeakable tragedy,\" Carlson said of Hogg. \"And that's why adults shouldn't be using him or his friends to push their agendas to the rest of us.\"\n\nHe also accused the students of arguing that anyone who disagrees with them want to kill children. According to Carlson, such ideas disqualify them from making policy decisions.\n\n\"You're definitely not fit to be making policy for the rest of us. You are by definition an extremist,\" Carson said. \"You should not have power if you really believe anyone who disagrees with you is evil and wants to kill the innocent.\"",

They're not good enough to make it on their own, but if we give it a leg up, maybe they won't take their rejection out on the whole country,\" Maher said on the left-leaning late night show.\n\n\"It's not our fault that your celebrities are Ted Nugent, Pat Sajak and Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE,\" he said elsewhere in his monologue.\n\nMaher mentioned the A-list roster of musicians and celebrities who appeared at the inauguration ceremonies for former President Barack ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaYou just can't keep good health policy down Obama Foundation announces new job training program for Chicago students Biden praises Parkland students fighting for gun reform: 'They're going to win' MORE as opposed to Trump's in 2017.\n\n\"And then there's Dana Loesch, who America has come to know as the fiery voice of the NRA, blaming gun violence and all our problems on Hollywood and its liberalism,\" said Maher.\n\nThe HBO host noted that a producer said the gun rights activist once pitched him an idea for a sitcom based on her life as a talk show host.\n\n\"The same thing happened to both the founder of the right wing Breitbart website, Andrew Breitbart ... and to his successor there Steve BannonStephen (Steve) Kevin BannonBannon: If Kelly leaves White House, Trump won't replace him Overnight Cybersecurity: Trump-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica attracts scrutiny | House passes cyber response team bill | What to know about Russian cyberattacks on energy grid Massachusetts launches probe into Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data MORE, also a show biz reject who didn't' have the talent to cut it here, who spent the rest of his life hating Hollywood and by extension all liberals,\" Maher said.\n\nThe website's late founder said in his memoir that he originally came to Hollywood to be a comedy writer, while Bannon spent years writing historical documentaries that were met with a tepid critical response.\n\n\"That is why I implore tonight all Hollywood execs next time a conservative comes to you with a really dumb idea for a movie or a TV show, just f------ do it,\" Maher said to applause.",

That's the way it's gotta be.\"",

If you can't, or won't, let someone take your place.\"\n\nAlhadeff writes that she has created \"Make Schools Safe,\" an organization dedicated to preventing school shootings.\n\nShe adds that her daughter's generation gives her \"hope\" beyond the \"grief and outrage.\"\n\n\"I stand with these students, in Alyssa's honor, and I will cheer them on as they fight for much-needed change,\" she writes. \"It is on us, the students, the adults, the elected officials to make sure no one ever forgets what happened in Parkland.\"",

McRaven, a former Navy SEAL, has served as chancellor since 2014.\n\nKent Hance, a former chancellor in the Texas Tech university system, told the Journal that Tillerson's most attractive qualities to the school were likely his connections to Texas' state government.\n\n\"The most important aspect of the role is having a relationship with members of the state legislature,\" said Hance, who is described as Tillerson's longtime friend. \"He would be great at that.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Tillerson made his final remarks as America's top diplomat, praising his fellow State Department officials but not directly thanking the president.\n\n\"Never lose sight of your most valuable asset, the most valuable asset you possess: your personal integrity,\" Tillerson said Thursday, adding, \"Only you can relinquish it or allow it to be compromised. Once you've done so, it is very, very hard to regain it.\"",

There investigators gathered evidence of the firm's online data gathering techniques that Facebook says violated the platform's user agreement.\n\nAfter leaving the London headquarters Saturday morning, the regulator said it will \"consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions.\"\n\nIn the U.S., lawmakers are planning to conduct interviews with top executives at the social media company, questioning why Facebook failed to prevent Cambridge Analytica from improperly gathering and using profile data on nearly 50 million users in order to microtarget political ads.\n\nFacebook has provided information to both Congress and the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nCambridge Analytica also reportedly worked on the 2016 Brexit referendum, according to Reuters.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nSpecial counsel Robert MuellerRobert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE has reportedly made an offer to Donald Trump's legal team on the parameters of an interview as part of the Russia investigation. If true, this is a deal the president should seriously consider.\n\nAccording to the press, Mueller is offering an interview on four main areas: the Trump Tower meeting with Russian sources and Donald Trump Jr.Donald (Don) John TrumpTrump's legal team considering possible conflicts of interest for diGenova: report Bannon: If Kelly leaves White House, Trump won't replace him Trump says he has 'tremendous support' on college campuses MORE, the president's role in putting out a misleading account of that meeting, the firing of former FBI Director James ComeyJames Brien ComeyHouse Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents House Judiciary chair to subpoena for FBI documents WATCH: Judiciary chairman questions whether Comey lied to Congress MORE, and the meeting of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Notably missing from that list are the subjects that should be the greatest concern for Trump, including his financial dealings (including deals on a Trump Tower in Moscow) and the payments to alleged paramours Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal and others to remain silent before the election.\n\nWhat is most striking about these areas is that they happen to be the areas where, even if things go badly, Trump has strong defenses. It does not mean that Mueller could not charge on these allegations, but he would likely lose on the evidence currently known. Obviously, this will require careful preparation and Trump would have to exercise uncharacteristic levels of control in his answers. The president's just-resigned counsel, John Dowd, reportedly may have doubted the ability to keep Trump out of a perjury trap. Yet, with the exception of a false statement or some undisclosed bombshell evidence, these limits are as good as it is going to get, and it could get worse.\n\nTrump Tower\n\nThe meeting of Trump Jr., former Trump presidential campaign manager Paul ManafortPaul John ManafortPapadopoulos encouraged by Trump campaign staffer to make contact with Russians: report Mueller investigates, Peters quits Fox, White House leaks abound Trump's tweets against Mueller investigation might hit the mark MORE and Trump son-in-law Jared KushnerJared Corey KushnerJim Carrey paints Kushner as 'self-unmade man' The Daily Show jokes Trump's new legal counsel is a TV Mueller investigates, Peters quits Fox, White House leaks abound MORE with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others in Trump Tower in New York was based on a promise to share evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation. Rod Goldstone, a promoter acquainted with the Trumps, told Trump Jr., \"This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n\nOnce at the relatively short meeting, Veselnitskaya reportedly focused on sanctions of the Magnitsky Act, including the bar on Russian adoptions. Veselnitskaya had worked for years against the ban and raised it with Democrats and Republicans alike. Indeed, when she was turned down for a visa during the Obama administration, she was granted a \"special immigration parole\" to enter the United States by President Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch.\n\nIf the meeting were part of a secret collusion, this would be a rather curious way to go about it, calling a conspiratorial meeting in an email at Trump Tower with unknown attendees. What is clear is that, as late as June 2016, a meeting with the Russians had to be arranged through a friend with a promise of criminal evidence to secure a meeting. Goldstone has admitted publicly that he \"hyped the message\" to get a meeting with Trump Jr. Even if Veselnitskaya had supplied evidence of criminal conduct by the Clintons or opposition research, it would not have constituted a crime.\n\nMoreover, the Clinton campaign not only paid a huge amount to gather potentially incriminating evidence on Trump but the resulting dossier was composed by a former British spy with information from Russians. The Clinton campaign long denied any connection to the dossier and only admitted the funding relatively recently, when confronted by reporters. If Mueller wants a criminal charge on that record, he will likely lose.\n\nAir Force One\n\nRather than taking the obvious path of making full disclosure, Trump Jr. issued a misleading statement about the meeting. The statement said that he and the Russian lawyer had \"primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children\" and emphasized that the subject of the meeting was \"not a campaign issue at the time.\" The statement, reportedly dictated by President TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE on Air Force One, did not disclose the stated purpose of the meeting or promise of material from the Russian government.\n\nLike the Trump Tower meeting, the statement was another self-inflicted wound. Nevertheless, there was no crime in holding the meeting, and it was not a crime to spin the resulting controversy. Politicians have long spun scandals. When confronted about NSA leaker Edward Snowden's disclosure of a massive surveillance program on American citizens, President Obama went on Jay Leno's show and proclaimed, \"There is no spying on Americans.\" His CIA director, James ClapperJames Robert ClapperRand Paul live tweets his reading of spending bill Senate bracing for possible long weekend Jeh Johnson: Media focused on 'Access Hollywood' tape instead of Russian meddling ahead of election MORE, went before Congress and denied the existence of such a program, a statement he admitted later was a lie.\n\nFor her part, Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonRepublicans invest nearly 0,000 in red Arizona district Al Franken: Sessions firing McCabe 'is hypocrisy at its worst' Papadopoulos encouraged by Trump campaign staffer to make contact with Russians: report MORE adopted a series of denials and defenses in her email scandal, including statements now established as false. The State Department later refuted her claim that she was given approval to use her personal server for State Department business. Obviously, some spins can become criminal matters, such as Bill ClintonWilliam (Bill) Jefferson ClintonKentucky candidate takes heat for tweeting he'd like to use congressman for target practice Will Sessions let other 'McCabes' off the hook or restore faith in justice? Progressive group launches anti-Trump 'We the Constitution' campaign MORE lying under oath that he never had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky and then insisting that it depended on \"what the meaning of the word 'is' is.\" If Mueller wants to charge Trump with spinning a scandal, he would have to frog march virtually every member of Congress and every living president to federal lockup.\n\nJames Comey\n\nPerhaps the greatest blunder of this administration was Comey's firing. Trump not only fired him in the midst of the Russian investigation but raised the investigation repeatedly with Comey before firing him. The problem is that Trump had ample reason to fire Comey, despite the poor timing of the decision. While Trump admitted in an interview that he was thinking of the Russian investigation when he fired Comey, he did not say that was the reason for the firing.\n\nIn a memo, Deputy Attorney General Rod RosensteinRod Jay RosensteinGowdy: Trump's lawyers doing 'disservice' by framing Mueller probe around collusion Nine Iranians charged, sanctioned over sweeping hacking campaign Bernie Sanders to Trump: Firing Mueller 'an impeachable offense' MORE listed former attorneys general, judges and leading prosecutors who believed Comey \"violated his obligation to 'preserve, protect and defend' the traditions of the department and the FBI\" and \"violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition.\" He also noted that Comey \"refused to admit his errors.\"\n\nMoreover, Comey himself admitted under oath that Trump agreed with him that the Russian investigation should run its course. (Trump was reportedly angry that Comey had told members of Congress that he was not under investigation but refused to confirm that publicly). Firing Comey would not have ended the Russian investigation, and there is no evidence that Trump sought to bar further investigation. Even if Mueller were to secure an indictment on that mixed record, he would have to call Comey, who is damaged goods, as a witness.\n\nNot only did Comey leak information to the press after his firing but, according to fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabeAndrew George McCabeMcCabe defends himself against firing in Washington Post op-ed Al Franken: Sessions firing McCabe 'is hypocrisy at its worst' House Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents MORE, Comey knew of his giving sensitive information to the press on the Clinton investigation. Comey expressly denied leaking information or approving such leaks by subordinates in testimony to Congress. Mueller could call Comey as a witness, but a jury might have difficulty seeing the moral high ground from where Comey is sitting.\n\nMichael Flynn\n\nFinally, there is Michael Flynn, charged with misleading federal investigators on his discussions with Russian diplomats. There was nothing illegal or unprecedented in Flynn meeting during the Trump presidential transition with the Russians, or his discussion of sanctions. However, he reportedly denied discussing sanctions and pleaded guilty to making a false statement.\n\nTrump asked Comey to go easy on Flynn after Flynn resigned. This has been widely portrayed as evidence of obstruction or witness tampering. However, Trump could simply argue that he felt Flynn had already suffered enough with the resignation and was expressing loyalty for a longtime friend and supporter. Mueller could always try to portray the comments as obstructive rather than empathetic, but that is pretty thin soup for a criminal case against Trump.\n\nNone of this means Trump cannot get himself into serious danger in an interview, with incautious or false statements. There also is the possibility of undisclosed evidence, particularly as a result of Flynn's cooperation agreement. However, these four categories represent the most predictable, frontal assaults on Trump where the armor is the thickest. Trump will have counsel present and can insist that any later questions or issues be addressed in written interrogatories to counsel. In an otherwise bad situation, that is not a bad deal.",

He refused to provide any hints or examples.\n\n\"People better be honest, because they haven't been honest in the past, relating to this relationship, relating to the bullying tactics, relating to the threats and intimidation,\" Avenatti told Blitzer. \"It is time to come clean.\"\n\nAvenatti is currently representing Daniels in her lawsuit against Trump to scrap a nondisclosure agreement she says is invalid because Trump never signed it.",

I think it's the other way in this country.\"\n\n\"America's being run by Steve Doocy,\" he added, referring to the \"Fox & Friends\" host.\n\nIn December, Mediaite named the \"Fox & Friends\" hosts the \"most influential\" in media because the president watches and responds to them frequently.\n\nTrump praised the show following the award, tweeting that \"the many Fake News Hate Shows should study your formula for success!\"",

He has also floated the idea of responding on Twitter, where he often lashes out at political opponents and defends himself against critics.\n\nTrump has yet to personally respond to the two lawsuits against him by the former porn star known as Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who are both seeking to end their nondisclosure agreements and speak freely of their alleged affairs with the president.\n\nBut Trump's advisers are reportedly saying that such a response could be inappropriate for a sitting president.

                "title": "March for gun control takes over Washington",
                "body": "Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to flood the nation's capital on Saturday for the \"March for Our Lives\" to support tougher gun controls and protest Congress's refusal to consider them.\n\nOrganizers received a National Park Service permit for 500,000 people, an audience to rival enormous demonstrations like the \"Women's March\" staged in Washington the day after President TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE's inauguration.\n\nStudents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., organized and inspired the event after a gunman killed 17 of their classmates and members of the school faculty on Valentine's Day.\n\nThe killings re-energized the movement for gun control, creating activists out of young student survivors who have harnessed the power of social media to bring global attention to their cause.\n\n\"We students have become victims of our government's glaring inaction, but never again,\" Demitri Hoth, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, said Friday at the Capitol. \"We have come here today to hold accountable politicians and their disturbing inaction.\n\n\"Never again will our voices -- students' voices -- be shunned into silence.\"\n\nThe young advocates have a tough road ahead, facing fierce resistance from a Republican-led Congress and the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA), both of which have resisted tougher gun laws for years. While the Florida killings had prompted President Trump to sound early calls for new gun limits, there was little appetite for such reforms among GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. And Trump has since backed off his initial push for significant restrictions.\n\nSaturday's march is designed precisely to keep the movement's momentum from petering out.\n\n\"I don't think these students are going to take no for an answer,\" said Sen. Amy KlobucharAmy Jean KlobucharDems ask FTC to probe if other companies also obtained Facebook data Students bash Congress for inaction on gun control Overnight Cybersecurity: House Intel votes to release Russia report | House lawmakers demand Zuckerberg testify | Senators unveil updated election cyber bill MORE (D-Minn.) said Friday. \"This march isn't the end, it's the beginning.\"\n\nThe student protests have already had some immediate impact on the congressional debate. The $1.3 trillion omnibus that Trump signed into law on Friday includes efforts to bolster background checks before gun sales and empower federal researchers to study gun violence as a public health issue.\n\nBut gun reformers in and out of Congress say it's not enough.\n\n\"Those are baby steps,\" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.\n\n\"It's not even nibbling around the edges, what they did,\" said Rep. Mike ThompsonCharles (Mike) Michael ThompsonDems fear overreach as left presses assault weapon ban Dems want gun control, but worry it could cost them midterms Lawmakers feel pressure on guns MORE (D-Calif.), who heads the Democrats' gun-violence prevention task force. \"It's something, but it's not a lot.\"\n\nYoung activists have been blunt in speaking of their disappointment, while accusing the adults who lead the country of cowardice.\n\n\"Students are stepping up to the NRA because our elected officials are afraid to,\" Antiqua Flint, a 15-year-old high school student from North Minneapolis, Minn., said Friday during a press briefing outside the Capitol. \"The solution to violence is not more guns. We need to pass sensible laws to keep guns out of dangerous hands.\"\n\nSupporters of gun control hope their march on Saturday will lend new force behind their cause.\n\nIn a press conference this week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the event is scheduled to take place on Pennsylvania Avenue in the Northwest part of the city between 3rd Street and 12th Street from noon to 3 p.m. It will end a few blocks shy of the White House.\n\nPop stars Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Common, Jennifer Hudson, Vic Mensa and Andra Day are all scheduled to take the stage.\n\nBroadway star Ben Platt and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda are also expected to perform. The duo donated a portion of the proceeds from their new mashup song \"Found/Tonight\" to the march.\n\nOther celebrities have also contributed. The Washington Post reported Oprah Winfrey and George and Amal Clooney each donated $500,000 to the march. The New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft lew Parkland survivors and victims' families to D.C. on the team's plane, The Boston Globe reported.\n\nWatts said that over 800 \"sibling marches\" are planned around the world.\n\nRep. Ted DeutchTheodore (Ted) Eliot DeutchStudents bash Congress for inaction on gun control Judiciary Dems warn Trump: Don't fire Mueller, Sessions during House recess Gun protests sweep nation as House passes school safety bill MORE, a Florida Democrat who represents Parkland, said the march \"will remind people that universal background checks, that have the support of over 90 percent of the American people, need to have a vote on the floor of the House and Senate.\n\n\"This is the defining issue for them and their generation,\" he added, referring to the student protesters. \"This is not a march that they're going to participate in and then go back to their regular lives.\"\n\nIf Congress doesn't take action this year, organizers also hope their efforts will result in change at the ballot box -- where gun rights supporters have seemed to have more muscle than those on the other side of the divide.\n\nWatts said Saturday's march marks the beginning of a months-long push leading up to the midterm elections to educate voters about where their lawmakers at the local, state and federal levels stand on gun control.\n\n\"This march is a way to get Americans off the sidelines,\" she said, \"but it's now on them to join this army of volunteers, who are fighting in our state houses and corporate boardrooms, to change laws and policies.\"",

He told Congress that he would \"never sign another bill like this again,\" but signed it because of the need to fund the military.\n\n\"It pains me to say this, but the president did have a choice,\" Ingraham said Friday. \"He could have called Congress back to town and make them pass a continuing resolution until his priorities were funded and we explain this mess to the American people. I tried, in vain, to warn him many times this week.\"\n\nTrump said he would veto the bill because it did not include the level of funding he wanted for his proposed wall on the border with Mexico or a fix for DACA.\n\nHannity also said that he thinks Trump should have forced Congress to stay in Washington and vetoed the bill.\n\n\"I personally wish the president vetoed this bill, made them stay in Washington,\" he said. \"Make them keep their promises. What happened to the Republican party--whatever happened to the party that believed in fiscal responsibility?\"\n\nHannity warned that the GOP \"will have nobody to blame but themselves if they lose\" in the midterm elections.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nDonald TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE's detractors and critics -- and I am usually one of them -- are gleefully noting that yet another story has emerged that shows the president to be an uneducable loose cannon. This time, however, Trump's opponents should think about the damage that has been done not only to our national security but to the ability of future presidents to receive confidential advice.\n\nApparently, during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump was shown a page from his briefing book that said, in capital letters, \"Do not congratulate,\" meaning \"Do not congratulate Putin for winning a sham election.\" This was sound advice. Putin won nothing but a farce, in which his best possible opponent was jailed and the numbers were likely fraudulent.\n\nOf course, American presidents often \"congratulate\" odious people on assuming the leadership of a state, as a matter of diplomatic courtesy, a kind of nicety that means nothing but also costs nothing to say. Ronald Reagan \"congratulated\" Soviet dictator Yuri Andropov in 1983, and Barack ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaYou just can't keep good health policy down Obama Foundation announces new job training program for Chicago students Biden praises Parkland students fighting for gun reform: 'They're going to win' MORE congratulated Putin in 2012.\n\nThis was different. \"Do not congratulate\" was not just a symbolic issue but, instead, reflected what Trump's advisers believed was a previously agreed-upon policy that this White House did not consider Putin's election a real event, and that it was important to signal a worsening of relations with a state that is engaged in open political warfare against the United States.\n\nTrump threw all of that out the window and freelanced the conversation, including his congratulations. An aide then leaked the page to the press. The president is reportedly furious and, for once, Trump is right and his advisers are wrong. Make no mistake: What Trump did was reckless. His advisers gave him good counsel, and he should have taken it. I am a Russia expert who thinks Trump's policies toward the Kremlin are utterly dangerous, and I would have given him the same advice.\n\nYet, those defending this leak are taking multiple positions, all of them wrong. Some, like former CIA official Ned Price, are arguing that staff have a constitutional duty to inform us of Trump's policy shifts, as though the president has committed a crime. Others note that Trump shows no loyalty to his staff and therefore deserves none in return. Trump's fiercest critics on social media simply invoke his generic awfulness and claim he has no right to anything and isn't really the president anyway.\n\nFirst things first. Trump is, in fact, the president and, like every political leader, he has a right to confidential advice -- and a right to reject it. Despite the schadenfreude that always floods us whenever Trump steps on a rake, we are losing sight of an important reality of the American system of government: Policy is not what a group of advisers decides ahead of time. Policy is what the president says it is.\n\nI was an adviser many years ago to a senior U.S. senator during the first Gulf War. Sometimes he didn't take my advice and, in a few cases, he rejected my counsel with a healthy dose of well-known Anglo-Saxon verbs. It would never have occurred to me to call a journalist and explain how the boss's vote was completely against my best advice. This, as every Washington staffer knows, violates the First Rule of Staff Club: \"You are not the story.\" (The Second Rule of Staff Club: \"You must never become the story.\") A principal and an aide are not peers, and any staffer, no matter how senior, who thinks so is in the wrong job.\n\nMore important, secrecy is crucial. Briefing books are classified documents. Even one page, however anodyne its contents, is sensitive material. Price disagrees on this but, as an analyst of Russian affairs, I can only say that I would consider just one page of Putin's briefing book to be solid gold. I would frame it (if it were ever declassified) and hang it in my office, like a hunting trophy, if I had it. That's because a good intelligence analyst can make sense even of very small things. To know what a leader was advised to say, as opposed to what he or she actually said, is deeply revealing of the internal dynamics of any government.\n\nFinally, there is an important issue here for the future: If we decide that staffers are the ultimate arbiters of policy, why stop with Trump? Do Democrats really want to establish a precedent in which a future liberal chief executive runs afoul of the policy preferences of a staff member who then feels free to explain how the boss didn't do what he was told, and thus destroy any expectation that an aide's advice is confidential?\n\nLeaks are a fact of life in Washington. No White House can avoid them. Many times, administrations actually encourage them. While leaking is a dirty game, sometimes it may, in fact, be necessary. But if a member of the president's staff feels that the Constitution is in danger or that the commander in chief is about to embark on an action so dangerous that the public should know immediately, there are always options. Capitol Hill is walking distance. Washington is laden with good law firms to protect whistleblowers.\n\nIf all else fails and the country is in peril, resign, tell your story, and let the chips fall. But a bruised ego over rejected advice -- even if it was great advice the boss should have taken -- does not clear the bar for violating the pact between an aide and his or her principal. And it is never a reason to endanger national security.\n\nTom Nichols is a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College and an adjunct professor at the Harvard Extension School.

It was expected that he would recommend Trump allow transgender troops to remain in the military.",

                "body": "Wisconsin Republicans signaled Friday that they will hold a special election to change election law rather than facing special elections in two heavily Republican legislative districts.\n\nOn Thursday, Dane County Circuit Judge Josann Reynolds ordered Gov. Scott Walker (R) to call special elections in two legislative districts that have been vacant for months.\n\nWalker's attorneys had argued state election law did not require him to fill the seats, because they were made vacant during an off year. The legislators who occupied both seats quit to take jobs in Walker's administration.\n\nBut the judge rejected those arguments, ruling in favor of voters from both districts and the National Democratic Redistricting Trust, a group led by former Attorney General Eric HolderEric Himpton HolderJudge orders Walker to hold special elections Holder: 2018 vote crucial to combating gerrymandering Holder: Sessions needs to 'have the guts' to say no to Trump MORE, who argued that Walker's refusal to call special elections denied voters their right to representation in Madison.\n\nReynolds, who was appointed to the bench by Walker, ordered the governor to declare vacancies next week, thus setting up special elections that would be held later this spring or summer.\n\nBut in a joint statement released Friday, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R) and state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R) said they would ask Walker to call the legislature back into session in order to change Wisconsin's special election law.\n\n\"After consulting with [the state Department of Justice] and others, we have decided it's best to move forward on an extraordinary session in order to clean up the statute on special elections and ensure that it aligns with the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act,\" Vos and Fitzgerald said.\n\n\"It's clear that little thought was given to the impact of the special elections ruling,\" they went on. \"In essence, there will be two elections occurring simultaneously for the two offices. It will undoubtedly lead to voter confusion and electoral chaos. Also, holding the special elections after the conclusion of the regular session is a waste of taxpayer dollars and local government resources.\"\n\nIn his own statement, Walker blamed Holder's group for forcing Wisconsin \"to waste money on special elections.\"\n\n\"It would be senseless to waste taxpayer money on special elections just weeks before voters go to the polls when the legislature has concluded its business,\" Walker said. \"This is why I support, and will sign, the Senate and Assembly plan to clarify special election law.\"\n\nNeither the legislative leaders nor Walker addressed costs associated with a special session.\n\nWisconsin Democrats castigated Walker and the GOP for what they called a singular focus on keeping power, and a disrespect for the judge who ruled against them.\n\n\"Gov. Walker and legislative Republicans' sole focus is maintaining their grip on power and once again they are changing the laws to ensure their control,\" said state Sen. Jennifer Shilling (D), the Democratic minority leader. \"They want to undercut our judicial system and deny thousands of Wisconsin families their constitutional right to equal representation. The Republican efforts to prevent court ordered special elections from being held is the height of corruption and desperation.\"\n\nThe special elections -- one in a Senate seat south of Green Bay, one in an Assembly seat north of Madison -- would ordinarily favor Republicans. President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE won the Senate district by 18 points in 2016, and he won the Assembly district by 14 points.\n\nBut Wisconsin Republicans were rattled earlier this year when Democrats won a special election for a rural state Senate seat that Trump had won by 17 points in 2016. In a tweet after that election, Walker said the results should be \"a wake up call for Republicans in Wisconsin.\"\n\nSince President Trump's election, Democrats have netted 17 state legislative seats in special elections, in areas ranging from suburban Seattle to rural Oklahoma, from the Miami-Dade area to rural Missouri.",

Trump threatened to veto the bill before ultimately signing it, decrying the bill's lack of funding for his border wall proposal.\n\nLieu mocked Trump on Friday after the bill's signing, saying that Trump was \"rolled\" by Republican leaders in Congress who failed to secure a deal with Democrats over border wall funding or a legislative fix for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients.\n\n\"Dear @realDonaldTrump: You wimped out. You failed to deliver on your veto threat. Now we in Congress will believe you even less,\" Lieu tweeted.\n\n\"The Republican controlled Congress just rolled you. And they will roll you again. Because when the moment of truth came, you showed great weakness,\" the California lawmaker added.\n\nDear @realDonaldTrump: You wimped out. You failed to deliver on your veto threat.

Because when the moment of truth came, you showed great weakness. https://t.co/qpN2LBp07C -- Ted Lieu (@tedlieu)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nLieu's tweet came after Trump made remarks at the White House prior to signing the bill, in which he threatened to \"never\" pass a bill in this manner ever again. Lawmakers from both parties remarked this week that they had just hours to read the more than 2,200-page bill before it was passed by both chambers of Congress.\n\n\"I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again,\" Trump warned. \"I'm not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what's in it.\"\n\nTrump however begrudgingly signed the bill, citing a need to secure funding for America's military as a top priority for his administration.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill. But we were, in a sense, forced to if we want to build our military,\" the president said at the White House.\n\n\"My highest duty is to keep America safe,\" he added. \"Nothing more important.\"",

Trent FranksHarold (Trent) Trent FranksGOP women's group endorses challengers in top Senate, House races GOP dodges bullet in Arizona race to replace Franks Real-time data insights have become a powerful political tool MORE. The district has not elected a Democrat since being drawn in 2011.\n\nTipirneni's spokesman responded to the Post on Friday by saying the RNC investment was a sign of GOP fears over a lack of \"enthusiasm\" for Lesko's campaign.\n\n\"Spending more than a quarter-million D.C. dollars for door-to-door outreach is a bit surprising,\" Tipirneni's spokesman Jason Kimbrough told the Post. \"It just shows how worried they must be about enthusiasm for their ethically challenged nominee. Dr. Tipirneni's a strong candidate, especially when compared to career politician Debbie Lesko, who's obviously in trouble.\"\n\nArizona's 8th Congressional District voted for President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE over Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonWhite House would like to see Biden 'in the boxing ring' in 2020 House Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents The suit to make Electoral College more 'fair' could make it worse MORE by a margin of 12.1 percent. In 2016, former Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) won his seat over Green Party candidate Mark Salazar by a 37.1 point margin.\n\nRepublican candidate Debbie Lesko currently leads her Democratic challenger Hiral Tipirneni by about 14 points, according to internal polling released by Tipirneni's campaign.\n\nDespite this, Tipirneni began the campaign with slightly more cash on hand than did Lesko, the Post reported, with the election to replace Franks to be held in April.\n\nFranks resigned in December over claims from an employee that he urged her to become a surrogate mother for his child.",

Some of the hyperventilating I am seeing online & on cable news is ridiculous,\" Rubio tweeted. \"The one's who should be freaking out are #Iran Maduro #NorthKorea & terrorists. Bad news for them.\"\n\nJohn Bolton is a great addition to the White House. Some of the hyperventilating I am seeing online & on cable news is ridiculous.

Bad news for them. https://t.co/qXmPPPIZgD -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nRubio linked to a Washington Post op-ed by conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt defending Bolton.\n\nTrump named Bolton as his replacement for current national security adviser H.R. McMaster earlier this week in a move that signaled a shift to the right for the president's foreign policy.\n\n\"It's still sinking in, so I haven't thought about it a great deal,\" Bolton said after his appointment on Fox News.\n\nRubio was quick to praise Bolton's appointment on Thursday, writing in a tweet that he knew Bolton \"well\" and calling him an \"excellent choice\" to lead the NSC.\n\n\"I know John Bolton well and believe he is an excellent choice who will do a great job as National Security Advisor,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"General McMaster has served, and will continue to serve, our nation well and I thank him for his service.\"",

Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what's in it.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that according to White House sources, Trump has been behaving more erratically with tweets and comments amid administration chaos in recent weeks.\n\n\"Never been this wild,\" one source told the paper.\n\nThe president disputed reports last week that he would fire national security adviser H.R. McMaster, telling advisers the reporters were \"total f -- ing bullshit,\" according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHe announced Thursday that he would replace McMaster with former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.",

                "body": "Uber's self-driving cars already lagged well behind competitors in terms of reliability ahead of a fatal crash Sunday in Arizona, according to a new report Friday.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Uber's self-driving technology worked on average for just 13 miles in Arizona before requiring human correction to avoid a crash, compared to an average of 5,600 miles for one of Uber's top competitors in the market, Waymo, in nearby California. Uber has not released data for its self-driving car tests in California.\n\nOn Sunday, a self-driving Uber car in Phoenix struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was crossing the street at night, while the car was in autonomous-driving mode and travelling at 40 miles per hour in a 45 mile per hour zone.\n\nPolice say the car, which at the time had an Uber employee in the driver's seat, did not slow down before striking the pedestrian and killing her. Uber suspended testing of their autonomous vehicles in the wake of the crash.\n\n\"As we develop self-driving technology, safety is our primary concern every step of the way,\" Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, said after the crash. \"We're heartbroken by what happened this week, and our cars remain grounded. We continue to assist investigators in any way we can.\"\n\nThe company moved from dual-operator tests to single-operator tests earlier this year despite concerns from drivers that the monotonous hours behind the wheel solo during tests could be distracting for solo drivers.\n\nAccording to Uber sources, in dual-operator tests one driver was responsible for monitoring the autonomous driving for errors, while the other was in charge of data entry.\n\nA video released this week from inside the vehicle involved in the crash shows the driver not paying attention to the road until seconds before the crash.",

                "body": "The National Security Council (NSC) is expected to recommend that President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE expel a yet-unknown number of Russian diplomats from the country in response to the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in Britain that both governments believe was committed by Russian agents.\n\nCNN reports that the NSC is expected to make the recommendation late Friday. Trump could act on the recommendation as early as next week, according to a CNN source involved in the discussions.\n\nThe president met earlier this week with the NSC to discuss multiple responses to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, an ex-Russian spy who was poisoned along with his daughter in Britain earlier this month. The recommendation will be the outcome of that meeting, according to CNN's sources.\n\nAt least 20 people have been hospitalized as a result of possible exposure to the poison, a deadly Soviet-era nerve agent that U.S. and British authorities say is most likely linked back to Russian intelligence.\n\nIf the U.S. does expel diplomats, the move would follow a similar decision by the U.K. last week to expel 23 Russian diplomats from the country.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May laid full blame for the incident at Russia's feet, calling the attack \"a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil.\"\n\nThe U.S. government has agreed with May's assessment of the attack and earlier this week joined the British government in refusing to attend a Russian-held briefing meant to present an alternative explanation for the attack.\n\n\"US & UK were right not to send our Ambassadors to @mfa_russia briefing to hear wild accusations and implausible denials,\" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert tweeted. \"#Russia was responsible for the nerve agent attack. Attempts to deny responsibility follow a familiar script: Crimea, MH17, Donbas, Litvinenko, doping, etc...\"\n\nRussia has denied responsibility for the poisoning, and condemned the U.S. and U.K.'s responses to the attack.\n\n\"It's another vivid example of the absurd situation when questions are asked and an unwillingness to hear even any answers is demonstrated,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.",

And it's about time we men stand up.\"\n\nBiden made the comments in the interview with former Obama staffers who host the podcast after they suggested several names for Biden and Trump's \"fight,\" including the \"Scranton Squabble,\" \"1600 Punchsylvania Avenue\" and \"Spar-A-Lago.\"",

I did not knowingly mislead or lie to investigators.\"\n\n\"At worst, I was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me may well have been confused and distracted -- and for that I take full responsibility,\" he wrote. \"But that is not a lack of candor. And under no circumstances could it ever serve as the basis for the very public and extended humiliation of my family and me that the administration, and the president personally, have engaged in over the past year.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff SessionsJefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsFeinstein, Harris call for probe of ICE after employee resigns House Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents Sen. Gardner won't let Jeff Sessions tread on Colorado's cannabis boom MORE fired McCabe last Friday, alleging that he leaked information to the press and misled congressional investigators.\n\n\"Not in my worst nightmares did I ever dream my FBI career would end this way,\" McCabe, a more than 20 year veteran of the bureau, wrote in his op-ed.\n\nThe No. 2 FBI official was also fired just two days before he was set to retire with a full pension.\n\nMcCabe has pushed back firmly on the claims surrounding his departure, saying that his firing was an attempt to discredit the special counsel investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the election.\n\nPresident TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE tweeted Saturday that McCabe's firing was \"a great day for democracy,\" which McCabe said saddened him.\n\n\"I was sad, but not surprised, to see that such unhinged public attacks on me would continue into my life after my service to the FBI,\" he wrote. \"The president's comments about me were ... hurtful and false, which shows that he has no idea how FBI people feel about their leaders.\"\n\nIn the op-ed, McCabe also wrote that public service, particularly in the FBI, is \"no greater responsibility, but there is no greater reward.\"\n\nHe also encouraged young people to pursue careers in the FBI and other agencies despite the political climate.\n\n\"We cannot afford for young people to be dissuaded from lives of public service by the divisive politics and partisan attacks that now so characterize our national discourse and that, I believe, played a major role in the end of my FBI career,\" he wrote. \"Set the headlines aside and give in to what draws you to this work. The country needs you.\"\n\nHe added that working for the FBI is the \"best job you will ever have.\"\n\n\"Even if a president decides to attack you and your family,\" he adds. \"Even if you get fired on a Friday night, one day from your retirement.\"",

It's really, really bad...I know he wanted more money for the military, and that's incredibly important, but he sacrificed everything else to get it.\" #TheFive pic.twitter.com/sL9bVfY2gj -- Fox News (@FoxNews)\n\nFox News host Jesse Watters on Friday said the spending bill President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE signed earlier in the day was \"a huge defeat for the president on a signature issue.\"\n\n\"It's really really bad. There's no way to spin it,\" he said during a discussion on Fox News Channel's \"The Five.\"\n\nAccording to Watters, who is often a fan of Trump, the president gave up too much - including funding for his proposed border wall - in order to increase military funding in the omnibus budget deal.\n\n\"Well, I know one thing. Mexico's not going to pay for the wall, and neither will we. Because it says there's only going to be $1.6 billion for the wall, and you can't even use the new concrete prototypes that [Trump] surveyed. And it's only supposed to be for 93 miles,\" Watters said. \"The border is 3,000 miles, and the only fencing that is going to be done is backup fencing and repairs.\"\n\nHe noted that Sen. Charles SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerAmtrak to rename Rochester station after Louise Slaughter Conscience protections for health-care providers should be standard Pension committee must deliver on retirement promise MORE (D-N.Y.) got funding that will be used for the Gateway rail project out of the deal, a project Trump had opposed as part of the deal.\n\n\"Cryin' Chuck SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerAmtrak to rename Rochester station after Louise Slaughter Conscience protections for health-care providers should be standard Pension committee must deliver on retirement promise MORE gets all the money he wants for a tunnel... and there's no border wall funding,\" Watters said.\n\n\"I know he wanted more money for the military, and that's incredibly important,\" Watters added. \"But he sacrificed everything else to get it.\"\n\nWatters questioned how Trump would keep his promise to \"never sign another bill like this again,\" asking how the president would change the dynamics in Congress to ensure future spending bills contained funding for his legislative priorities.\n\n\"I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again,\" Trump said when signing the omnibus legislation on Friday. \"I'm not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what's in it.\"\n\nTrump signed the massive $1.3 billion spending bill despite threatening to veto the bill. He expressed his displeasure over Congress' inability to compromise on funding for his border wall as well as a legislative fix for nearly two million Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill. But we were, in a sense, forced to if we want to build our military,\" the president said Friday during an impromptu event after he signed the bill at the White House.\n\n\"My highest duty is to keep America safe,\" he added. \"Nothing more important.\"",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nThis month, approximately 6,000 foreign medical students were matched with residency programs in congressional districts across our nation. Hospital administrators and program directors depend upon these young doctors to fill the residency spots not matched by American graduates.\n\nIn July, these newly minted physicians arrive on J1 or H1B visas. They begin residency program alongside American medical graduates. These residents immediately begin treating patients in underserved areas after they have finished their residency training.\n\nIn some instances, a resident might match in an inner-city training program at an institution overwhelmed with patients lacking preventative care and basic health literacy. In other instances, these young doctors might go to rural America and join a small team of specialists serving multiple counties.\n\nThese doctors will go anywhere and serve. They are committed to the health and well-being of their patients.\n\nPersonally, I serve in rural Ohio as a pain specialist. While I was born and educated in Pakistan, America is my home and I am a proud naturalized citizen. I see patients of all ages, races and religions. While performing spinal cord stimulation, discectomies or vertebroplasty, I meet patients from across the political spectrum and every segment of our society.\n\nThese young physicians, just like I was and continue to be, are citizen ambassadors. In an increasingly complex world, our patients are exposed to the best and brightest minds from Pakistan, a nation where many Americans have never traveled. The proud families of these young physicians learn from the nightly phone calls they make back home just how diverse and welcoming America is.\n\nMost importantly, these young physicians serve a critical need as our nation braces for a major physician shortage. If current retirements continue and patient populations grow, our nation will need to find upward of 90,000 new physicians by 2025. In coming years, patients will be faced with either longer wait times or receiving care from doctors with a mediocre academic pedigree. Naturally, neither option is inviting. Foreign medical graduates - the best of their accredited foreign medical schools - are an important part of this future planning.\n\nRoughly 25 percent of all physicians across our country were trained overseas. Each year, Pakistan is one of the top five countries supplying its best medical minds to fill this gap. These young physicians serve American patients in medically underserved areas. Today, across the United States, there are more than 12,000 licensed and practicing physicians who are graduates of Pakistani medical schools.\n\nAs these promising medical students are preparing for their final exams, they have traveled to American consulates across Pakistan for their visa interview. Sitting across from Consular Officers, they discuss their schooling, their dreams, their finances and their family tree. They present letters from American hospital administrators requesting that they start their residency programs the first week of July.\n\nHowever, many of the current crop of medical students are now being denied visas at a rate we have never seen. This neither serves them nor the American patients that need care.\n\nWhen I immigrated to the United States to begin my residency in general surgery and physical medicine, I reflected nightly on the Hippocratic Oath. Living in the swing state of Ohio, I know that the campaign trail is dominated by talk of immigration reform and the future of the Affordable Care Act. With the midterm elections fast approaching, Congress must remember the basic principal of the Oath - do no harm. Congress should debate these important public policy topics, but not forget the critical role foreign medical graduates play in serving American patients.\n\nCongress must, therefore, do all it can to ensure that visas for these doctors continue well into the future, for their sake and ours. This is the true essence of America, a country we are proud to both serve and call home.",

Commerce spokesman James Rockas said in November that Ross had \"fully divested\" his Diamond S Shipping stake.\n\nA\n\nThe Commerce Department spokesman told HuffPost that the filings for Diamond S Shipping would be released in \"due time.\"\n\nRockas said the divestments did not show up in the filings because the investments in both companies had been transferred to an irrevocable trust for protection while he serves in office, but would not say who the trust's beneficiaries were, apart from saying it did not benefit his wife.\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics requires government officials to publicly disclose such trusts that benefit family members in their confirmation process.",

                "body": "Legislative Director - National Wildlife Federation\n\nhttps://nwf.applicantpro.com/jobs/747089.html\n\nFounded in 1936, the National Wildlife Federation (NWF or Federation) is America's largest and most trusted grassroots conservation organization with 51 state/territorial affiliates and more than six million members and supporters, including hunters, anglers, gardeners, birders, hikers, campers, paddlers, and outdoor enthusiasts of all stripes. The Federation's mission is to unite all Americans to ensure wildlife thrive in our rapidly changing world through programming focused on conserving wildlife, restoring habitats and waterways, expanding outdoor opportunities, connecting children with nature, and addressing the causes and consequences of climate change.\n\nThe Legislative Director for the National Wildlife Federation takes the lead in planning, overseeing and executing communications with Congressional and Executive branch offices to educate, advise, and advocate for NWF's interests and policy priorities. Communication of NWF's interests will be guided by the goals and milestones laid out in the Strategic Plan, and the recommendations of NWF program, regional, and senior staff as to the key policy priorities associated with accomplishing those objectives.\n\nThe LD is expected to broadly build and maintain bipartisan relationships with key Congressional and Executive branch offices, remaining aware of timely developments related to issues, staffing, and new or ongoing challenges in realizing NWF's policy goals. Working with NWF senior staff, the LD will further NWF's interests by preparing and wisely deploying staff in both ongoing and urgent conversations with Congressional and executive officials as needed, being sure to collaborate strategically and on priority campaigns with other program staff, regional offices and NWF state affiliate groups. The LD will look for opportunities to develop new tools, alliances and tactics to broaden and enhance NWF's influence. In particular the LD is expected to continually assess and evaluate the ability to include and spotlight the work of affiliates in his/her work.\n\nThe LD will be skilled at juggling and prioritizing competing program interests and needs, and implementing efficient approaches to allow for specific and focused successes in the midst of broader political undertakings. The LD will regularly and effectively communicate across the organization regarding the status of NWF policy priorities and other issues of interest to staff at NWF's Headquarters, National Advocacy Center (NAC), seven Regional Centers, and to its NWF state affiliate groups. The nature of the work is intense and fast-paced, as NWF is frequently a leader or a participant in important and urgent campaigns.\n\nIn this role you will:\n\n* Build and sustain bipartisan relationships with key Congressional and Executive branch offices.\n\n* Maintain awareness of status of basic and/or strategic NWF policy and legislative priorities, and opportunities for advancement of same, at all times.\n\n* Clearly advocate NWF's interests to Congressional and Executive branch decision makers, and, as appropriate and in collaboration with the NWF communications team, to the media.\n\n* Directly supervise federal lobbying staffer. Guide and assist NWF program staff in developing effective political strategies to meet program goals. Coordinate Congressional and Executive outreach and activities of NWF lobbyists, program staff, and NWF state affiliate groups.\n\n* Prepare briefing materials for NWF's President (and senior staff as appropriate) for meetings and events, including strategic and/or tactical presentations for Board and Annual meetings.\n\n* Prepare and distribute weekly legislative and agency updates for the NAC and senior NWF leadership.\n\n* Conduct trainings, several times a year, on the basics of lobbying and effective techniques for Congressional office visits for groups of NWF members and activists participating in \"fly-ins\".\n\n* Be responsive to addressing requests, questions, problems from regional offices and affiliates on legislative matters.\n\n* Lead or assist as appropriate in coalition tasks, such as serving as a lead point of contact or liaison with other conservation and sportsmen groups.\n\n* Maintain an in-house Congressional targeting system that includes updated and timely status of priority and non-priority items.\n\n* Compile and organize essential political data for NWF needs (e.g., seats up in an election year).\n\nActions are at all times expected to reflect the staff values of the National Wildlife Federation: collaboration, mindfulness, empowerment, inclusivity, and mission focus.\n\nQualifications:\n\n* A Bachelor's degree is required. An advanced degree (Master's or J.D.) is favored.\n\n* A candidate must have 7 - 10 years of experience in advocacy and lobbying, with at least 5 years of experience in federal legislative lobbying, which can include specific service as congressional staff and/or federal lobbying experience.\n\n* The candidate must possess excellent communication skills, be a strong and quick writer, and have good political instincts.\n\n* He or she will be a self-starter who works well with others, and a capable leader and negotiator. The candidate must have a proven capability to reach out to members of Congress from both political parties, and to work collaboratively with a broad set of internal and external coalition partners and interests.\n\n* He or she must be patient, comfortable playing the \"long game\" and accepting setbacks with an eye toward the next opportunity for success.\n\n* He or she must also have a sense of humor, prioritize collegiality, and function in an exemplary manner in the servant-leader tradition of NWF's mission.\n\nThere will be some travel in this role, approximately six times a year, 12-14 nights per year.\n\nWe aspire to be an inclusive multicultural organization that celebrates the rich dimensions of diversity such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical ability, and religious and political belief. Diversity at the National Wildlife Federation translates into understanding and valuing each other's perspectives.\n\nThe National Wildlife Federation offers excellent benefits, competitive compensation, and a family-friendly, flexible work environment. We are committed to building a diverse team and strongly encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. If you meet more than 75% of the qualifications of this description, we encourage you to submit an application. A background check will be conducted on the selected candidate.\n\nInterested candidates should submit both a cover letter and resume at NWF's website.",

                "body": "U.S. stocks suffered their worst week in more than two years after closing Friday with heavy losses.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 percent Friday, a 424-point drop, to close at its lowest level since November. The index fell 5.7 percent this week.\n\nIt is down 11.6 percent from its 52-week high, entering a formal correction, which is a 10-percent drop from an index or stock's 52-week peak.\n\nThe Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 2 percent Friday, driving its weekly loss to 5.9 percent. The S&P took heavy losses from battered financial stocks, though the index avoided hitting correction level.\n\nThe Nasdaq fell 2.4 percent Friday, losing 6.5 percent on the week, weighed down by fading technology stocks.\n\nThis week was the worst for U.S stocks since January 2016, according to CNBC, and comes as a series of political pressures weigh on an increasingly volatile stock market.\n\nPresident TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE rattled markets Thursday when he announced his plan to impose up to $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports in response to intellectual property theft from U.S. businesses. The Dow ended Thursday down 722 points, a 2.9 percent drop, and briefly fell into correction territory.\n\nThe Nasdaq fell roughy 2.4 percent, while the S&P slid 2.5 percent. It was the worst day for U.S stocks since Feb. 8, when the Dow lost 1,033 points amid a massive sell-off.\n\nWall Street fears the new U.S. tariffs will spur retaliation from China and hinder global economic growth. Trump also announced tariffs earlier this month on imported steel and aluminum, triggering alarm among traders and GOP lawmakers opposed to protectionist trade policies.\n\nWhile Republicans are far more supportive of Trump's tariffs on China than the levies on steel and aluminum, both announcements sent traders into a panic. Shares in major U.S. exporters have fallen as U.S. trading partners pledge to retaliate.\n\nTechnology shares have also dropped during Facebook's growing scandal over the mishandling of user data. The company's stock has dropped more than 10 percent this week after reports that Cambridge Analytica, a firm that worked on Trump's 2016 campaign, used personal data from roughly 50 million Facebook users for political purposes without their knowledge.\n\nMultiple congressional committees have asked Facebook CEO Mark ZuckerbergMark Elliot ZuckerbergOvernight Tech: What we learned from Zuckerberg's media blitz | Opening arguments in AT&T-Time Warner trial | Trump plans new tariffs on China Bannon swipes at Zuckerberg after Cambridge Analytica reports Overnight Finance: Stocks bleed as Trump seeks new tariffs on China | House passes .3T omnibus | Senate delay could risk shutdown | All eyes on Rand Paul | Omnibus winners and losers MORE to testify, and the Federal Trade Commission has reportedly opened an investigation into the company.\n\nFacebook's troubles spurred heavy losses for technology stocks this week as traders feared a broader regulatory crackdown on tech firms.",

McMaster with former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, whose views are more in line with those of the president.\n\nThat sudden move comes after Trump replaced his secretary of State and national economic adviser in recent weeks -- long-anticipated changes that nonetheless happened abruptly and sent shockwaves through Washington.\n\nThe staff shakeup reveals the president's frustration with members of his old team who encouraged him to back away from or delay key policy decisions, which he frequently makes based on gut instinct.\n\nBolton, the hawkish former Bush administration official, has pledged to implement Trump's agenda, even on matters in which they might disagree.\n\nThe president's allies had grown frustrated with McMaster, believing he slow-walked the president's agenda or sought to implement his own.\n\n\"Bolton is coming in to prosecute the president's agenda, which sets him apart from McMaster who tried to advance his own policies and beliefs,\" said a former White House official. \"If Bolton sticks to that plan, he will be a success. The president wants people in the administration who, when he makes a decision, will follow through on it.\"\n\nBolton will be Trump's third national security adviser in just 14 months, adding to a level of turnover the White House not seen in decades.\n\nThe reshuffle is far from over.\n\nThe National Security Council is now bracing for a shake-up under Bolton's leadership. There is hope among Trump's allies that Bolton will put an end to the damaging leaks from the NSC and rid the council of Obama-era holdovers -- or anyone viewed as insufficiently loyal to the president.\n\nSources close to the NSC say spokesman Michael Anton and deputy national security adviser Nadia Schadlow could be among those on the way out.\n\nOne of Bolton's top advisers, Richard Grenell will not be joining Bolton in the White House. Trump has tapped Grenell to be ambassador to Germany, although Grenell is still waiting on his Senate confirmation.\n\nBut Bolton has other advisers who could be in line for key posts, including Sarah Tinsley, a long-time ally who is currently at Bolton's super PAC, and Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst.\n\n\"Obviously, you have some folks on the NSC who are completely against this,\" said one administration official. \"They are bracing for a shake-up when he comes because we know he'll want to bring in his own people. But he's also bringing a much different worldview than what they've had there. It could be a tenuous situation early on.\"\n\nBolton is not in lockstep with Trump on all national security matters. He has a strong personality and could clash with Defense Secretary James MattisJames Norman MattisOvernight Defense: Trump replaces McMaster with Bolton | .3T omnibus awaits Senate vote | Bill gives Pentagon flexibility on spending | State approves B arms sale to Saudis State Dept. announces B in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia Mattis: Saudi Arabia 'part of the solution' in Yemen civil war MORE and chief of staff John KellyJohn Francis KellyMORE, both of whom eventually soured on McMaster.\n\nBolton is said not to be the favored pick of Kelly or Mattis.\n\nBut his choice was cheered by Trump allies, who predicted he would find more success than McMaster, who also had ideological differences with Trump.\n\n\"It is a good move,\" said Walid Phares, who was one of Trump's national security advisers during the campaign.\n\n\"The White House and Congress both need him there at this particular junction,\" Phares said.\n\nIn addition to serving as George W. Bush's U.N. ambassador, Bolton also held key roles in the George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan administration.\n\nHis critics have cast him as a \"warmonger\" whose impulse is always for military intervention.\n\nBolton has been vocal about ripping up the Obama administration's deal with Iran -- a position that the president shares. But he has also advocated for a military strike on North Korea at a time when the administration is pushing sanctions and potential talks between the countries.\n\nBolton's allies say his reputation as a \"warmonger\" is overblown and that, at the end of the day, he and Trump both prescribe to Reagan's \"peace through strength\" maxim.\n\n\"John understands that people view him as a warmonger but he's really not,\" said one person close to him. \"He's never worked in military planning or the Pentagon. He's a diplomat who understands there's no better reinforcement for American diplomacy than having the credible threat of military action behind you and he uses that to gain a diplomatic edge. You need hard-edged diplomats like that to avoid wars. You get into wars with weak diplomacy.\"\n\nTrump's abrupt personnel changes are still reverberating throughout the White House.\n\nTrump's move to replace McMaster with Bolton caught Kelly and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders by surprise. Less than a week ago, Sanders insisted that there were no changes coming.\n\nThe Bolton episode highlighted Trump's volatile decision-making process, which has frustrated some members of his team.\n\nRumors of McMaster's exit had swirled for months, and Kelly worked behind the scenes to craft a transition plan that would allow McMaster to land on his feet.\n\nAfter Trump axed Secretary of State Rex TillersonRex Wayne TillersonWhite House aides planned to announce McMaster with other departures: report Trump considered ousting Kelly and serving as his own chief of staff: report Trump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser MORE last week, speculation mounted that McMaster would be the next to go. But White House officials, including Sanders, publicly batted down the speculation after huddling with the president.\n\nBolton himself seemed to be taken by surprise by the offer, which followed a Thursday afternoon meeting in the West Wing.\n\n\"Obviously it caught us off guard,\" said an administration official.\n\nBut Trump's allies say White House staff understand Trump's volatile nature and will get over it. In the long run, they believe Bolton gives the administration a well-regarded establishment figure with broad support in the conservative foreign policy sphere.\n\n\"Bolton is a hard-nosed guy. He is not a wallflower,\" the official said. \"He also knows how to operate the levers of power. He is not a rookie at this, so he will be a force to be reckoned with.\"",

Gardner won't let Jeff Sessions tread on Colorado's cannabis boom MORE, multiple woman accused Moore of sexual harassment and assault, including Corfman, who said she was 14 at the time.\n\nBannon, Breitbart and President Trump continued to defend Moore amid the allegations, even as more mainstream Republican groups pulled their support.\n\nIn a statement to the Post, Moore confirmed that Lantrip and Davi had attended campaign events for him but said that no one in his campaign had been instructed to offer money for false statements.\n\n\"I nor anyone else in the campaign offered anyone money to say something untrue, nor did I or anyone else authorize someone else to do such a thing,\" Moore said.\n\nLantrip and Davi \"did not have any special access to Judge Moore, nor were they ever commissioned with any special tasks by the campaign team,\" a spokesman added.\n\nIn an interview with the Post, Davi confirmed a longstanding relationship with Bannon but denied that the former White House aide knew anything about the offered payment.\n\n\"Our effort was really to let the truth come out,\" he said. Lantrip declined to comment on any offers of payment to the attorney.\n\nSexton provided the Post with a handwritten copy of the statement the two provided him in exchange for the money, which disparages Corfman's case as \"lacking credulity.\" He says he does not know who actually wrote the statement, which he says was presented to him in the presence of two Breitbart reporters.\n\n\"After reviewing the allegations, after taking Leigh Corfman as my client, I believe there is not sufficient evidence to back up the allegations and that the case lacks credulity. I decided that since I would have difficulty representing a client that I don't believe I have to recuse myself from this case. I hope the best for Leigh,\" the proposed statement reads.\n\nRoy Moore was defeated by now-Sen. Doug Jones (D), in Alabama's special election in December.",

                "body": "Tumblr said Friday it has taken down 84 accounts used by Russia to spread disinformation ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe social media platform said it discovered the accounts, which are linked to the Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency, last fall and has since terminated the accounts.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert MuellerRobert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE last month indicted 13 Russians and three Russian entities associated with the Internet Research Agency who are accused of orchestrating an elaborate plot to spread divisive messages to U.S. audiences on social media ahead of the election. The individuals face multiple charges, including identity theft and bank fraud.\n\nTumblr said in a statement Friday that it provided information on the 84 Russia-linked accounts from its investigation to the Justice Department.\n\nTumblr joins several other social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, that have identified and suspended accounts linked to Russia's interference campaign.\n\nFacebook disclosed last year that accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency purchased $100,000 in political advertisements on the platform before the election.\n\n\"These accounts were being used as part of a disinformation campaign leading up to the 2016 U.S. election,\" Tumblr said. \"After uncovering the activity, we notified law enforcement, terminated the accounts, and deleted their original posts.\"\n\nTumblr said the Russia-linked accounts were solely focused on spreading disinformation by posting \"organic content.\" The company found no indication that the accounts purchased any advertisements.\n\nThe platform says it will notify any users who interacted with the accounts and provide them with a list of usernames they engaged with. Tumblr also disclosed that it will keep a public record of usernames linked to the Internet Research Agency or other state-sponsored disinformation efforts for the sake of transparency.\n\nTumblr said it plans to counter disinformation going forward by \"monitoring\" the platform for propaganda, removing associated accounts and their posts, and notifying law enforcement.",

The president also faulted the Obama administration for the 2010 decision.\n\n\"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nObama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nThe decision Friday follows a letter sent by GOP senators in October urging the administration to review the decision after a mass shooter using the technology killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we are all now keenly aware of how this device operates and believe that this renewed review and determination will keep our citizens safe and ensure that federal law is enforced,\" the nine Republicans wrote last year.\n\nBump stocks are special attachments for semi-automatic rifles that allow the weapon to mimic fully automatic fire by making \"bump fire\" easier. \"Bump fire\" is the act of using a weapon's recoil to fire shots rapidly.\n\nFully automatic weapons have been banned in the U.S. since 1986, but bump stocks were described by the ATF in 2010 as \"a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.\"",

Debbie Lesko made the comments during a debate with her Democratic opponent, physician Hiral Tipirneni, when asked how much such allegations against the president concern her during her bid to join the GOP congress.\n\n\"He needs to address them, obviously. It needs to be investigated,\" Lesko said of Trump during the debate televised on KPNX TV in Phoenix.\n\n\"I don't know that he can lead on that issue, but he certainly needs to deal with it and it has to be investigated. I'm not the president and I don't use his rhetoric, and I'm certainly not going to sexually harass anyone.\"\n\nDuring Trump's presidential campaign, a handful of women accused him of various degrees of sexual misconduct. A video also emerged in October of 2016 showing Trump in 2005 talking about groping women without their consent.\n\nHe apologized for the video but denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, denials that have been repeated by the White House since he took office.\n\nLesko and Tipirneli both won their primaries in February and are battling to replace Rep.

It's a solid Republican stronghold in the state that includes a significant retirement community. But Democrats are hopeful that their recent ability to outperform in special elections can make the race competitive.",

                "body": "A Pennsylvania school district has armed its students with rocks to defend themselves in the event of a school shooting.\n\nDavid Helsel, the superintendent of Blue Mountain School District in Schuylkill County, said at a state House Education Committee hearing on school safety this week that his district's classrooms are equipped with 5-gallon buckets of river rocks.\n\n\"If an armed intruder attempts to gain entrance to any of our classrooms, they will face a classroom full of students armed with rocks,\" he said. \"And they will be stoned.\"\n\nHelsel emphasized to Buzzfeed News that the so-called \"go buckets\" are a \"last-resort\" effort in the district's active school shooter defense plan, which also includes automatic door-securing technology and lock-in and lockdown procedures.\n\nHelsel said that the buckets have been in classrooms for two years. Media outlets picked up the story this week after he spoke about the plan at the hearing. He said that he thinks news outlets have taken the plan \"out of context to make it look silly.\"\n\n\"If you have a 5-gallon bucket full of river stones, and we have 25 students and a teacher, it will serve as a deterrent,\" he said. \"We have some people who have some pretty good arms. They can chuck some rocks pretty fast.\"\n\nSchool safety procedures have come under the national spotlight in the weeks since the school shooting a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration unveiled a series of proposals on school safety and gun restrictions in the wake of the Florida shooting that left 17 dead.\n\nThe proposals included a push for states to provide firearms training for school staff members.",

                "body": "Seven Democratic states on Friday threatened to sue the Trump administration for its delay in enforcing an Obama administration rule on air pollution from landfills.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was supposed to, by Nov. 30, approve state plans to comply with the 2016 landfill methane rule or impose federal compliance plans on states that do not comply.\n\nBut the agency did not complete that step of the process, which the states say is a violation of the EPA's responsibilities under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\"Climate change is the most important global environmental issue of our time. We must act to address it now for the sake of our children,\" California Attorney General Xavier BecerraXavier BecerraAnti-abortion clinics take First Amendment case to Supreme Court Court: EPA broke law with smog rule delay A Sanders-Warren ticket could win big in 2020 MORE (D), who is leading the effort, said in a statement.\n\n\"EPA Administrator [Scott] Pruitt has a legal responsibility to enforce this critical landfill methane regulation. If he fails to do his job, our coalition is ready to go to court.\"\n\nThe states are obligated under the Clean Air Act to file notice 60 days before they can file a lawsuit.\n\nThe EPA did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBlue states have filed dozens of lawsuits or other challenges against the Trump administration, including many on environmental or energy policy issues. In the environmental arena, Becerra alone has achieved nine legal victories and has not lost any case.\n\nThe 2016 landfill rule was meant to reduce the output of methane from landfills. Decomposition creates methane, a greenhouse gas that is at least 80 percent more potent than carbon dioxide.\n\nThe rule was part of an administration-wide crackdown on methane emissions under former President Obama. But it faced opposition from industry and Republicans, who complained that it was too costly to implement.\n\nIn May, Pruitt said he would reconsider the regulation and put a 90-day halt on its implementation. But that halt didn't explicitly change the deadlines for states or the EPA to take action.\n\nPruitt still hasn't said what, if any, parts of the rule he's interested in changing and hasn't indicated if he has finished the reconsideration process.",

                "body": "The United Kingdom's top privacy watchdog on Friday was granted a warrant to search the offices of Cambridge Analytica after recent news reports revealed the firm obtained data from millions of Facebook users without their consent or knowledge.\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) tweeted that officials were \"pleased\" to be granted the warrant to investigate Cambridge Analytica's dealings.\n\n\"We're pleased with the decision of the judge and we plan to execute the warrant shortly. This is just one part of a larger investigation into the use of personal data for political purposes and we will now need time to collect and consider the evidence,\" the ICO tweeted.\n\nICO granted warrant: We're pleased with the decision of the judge and we plan to execute the warrant shortly. This is just one part of a larger investigation into the use of personal data for political purposes and we will now need time to collect and consider the evidence -- ICO (@ICOnews)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nThe ICO, headed by an information commissioner appointed by the British Crown, has the power to levy fines against companies that misuse customers' personal data and information, among other authorities.\n\nIn 2013, the office levied a fine of 250,000 pounds against tech giant Sony after the company was the target of a data breach that exposed names, payment information and other personal information of Sony Playstation users. The ICO found that Sony had obtained an improper amount of data from customers, and had not secured its systems properly.\n\nCambridge Analytica was accused this week of obtaining the Facebook data of roughly 50 million Americans through Facebook without their knowledge or consent by utilizing the friend networks of a smaller group of users who gave data willingly to the firm.\n\nThe data served as a crucial part of the Trump campaign and was founded by former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, billionaire right-wing donor Robert Mercer and CEO Alexander Nix in 2013.",

Sessions later was forced to recuse himself from the federal Russia probe.\n\n\"That the attorney general would fire the man who was tasked with investigating him raises serious questions about whether retaliation or retribution motivated his decision. It also raises serious questions about his supposed recusal from all matters stemming from the 2016 campaign,\" Franken said of McCabe's firing.\n\nTrump has long been a critic of McCabe, who helped oversee the FBI investigation into his former presidential opponent Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonWhite House would like to see Biden 'in the boxing ring' in 2020 House Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents The suit to make Electoral College more 'fair' could make it worse MORE, and openly pressured Sessions to fire the veteran law enforcement official, claiming he was biased against him.\n\nSessions fired McCabe last week, citing a watchdog review and internal recommendation that he be terminated.

I'll be the guest of the great team at the @WashBlade @losangelesblade! -- Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nGriffin sparked major national backlash after posting a photo with a bloody, decapitated head meant to look like President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE last year. Trump tweeted at the time that Griffin \"should be ashamed of herself.\"\n\nGriffin was interviewed by the Secret Service over the photo shoot and was fired from her annual job of co-hosting CNN's New Year's Eve special.\n\nThe comedian, who canceled her 50-city U.S. tour amid the outcry over the photo, said in December that she wishes she could tour in the U.S.\n\nShe announced earlier this month, however, that her upcoming show at Carnegie Hall sold out in one day. Her return to touring in the U.S. begins just weeks after D.C.'s annual \"Nerd Prom.\"\n\nTrump declined to attend the 2017 dinner during a particularly contentious period between him and the media, and has not yet said whether he will attend this year's event.\n\nHe was the first president to miss the dinner in more than 30 years.\n\nComedian Michelle Wolf, a former writer and contributor to \"The Daily Show,\" will be the evening's headliner.",

                "body": "Popstar Taylor Swift on Friday shared a post on Instagram expressing her support for Saturday's March For Our Lives and the students calling for gun control and school safety.\n\nThe march, which will take place in Washington, D.C., and other cities nationwide, is being organized by survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month.\n\n\"No one should have to go to school in fear of gun violence,\" the famously apolitical Swift wrote in a caption. \"Or to a nightclub. Or to a concert. Or to a movie theater. Or to their place of worship.\"\n\n\"I've made a donation to show my support for the students, for the March For Our Lives campaign, for everyone affected by these tragedies, and to support gun reform,\" she added. \"I'm so moved by the Parkland High School students, faculty, by all families and friends of victims who have spoken out, trying to prevent this from happening again.\"\n\nThe post is a rare move for Swift, who typically shies away from commenting on political issues.\n\nThe singer joins dozens of other celebrities who have made contributions or vocally supported the movement. George and Amal Clooney and Oprah Winfrey made donations of $500,000 within days of the movement first being announced last month.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nConor Lamb, the Democrat who recently won an upset victory in Pennsylvania's 18th District, is a devout Catholic, who public endorses Catholic social teaching. Four months ago, Doug Jones, a progressive Methodist, won an Alabama Senate seat running against Judge Roy MooreRoy Stewart MooreRomney officially files to run for Senate DNC chair: RNC might outraise us but 'they're morally bankrupt' Setting the record straight on charities and political speech MORE, a stalwart of the Christian right, who was embroiled in an alleged child abuse scandal during the race.\n\nAs a Christian and a Democrat, I hope to see more Democratic candidates leaning into their faith. The Bible overwhelmingly supports progressive ideas. Too often, Democrats are stymied by narratives that pit progressive ideas about marriage equality and family planning at odds with their faith. Both Lamb and Jones serve as reminders for why Democrats should cite the Bible more frequently. Nearly 80 percent of Americans subscribe to religious beliefs. Faith can inspire real conversion and social change.\n\nOver 2,000 verses of Christian scripture demand that we protect immigrants, strive for economic equality and liberate those oppressed by unjust laws. Democrats should cite scripture as they defend the Affordable Care Act, call out corporate greed manifest in Trump's tax bill and defend the social safety net.\n\nDecades ago, Democrats and the progressive movement made a strategic mistake: they ceded the powerful language of faith to Republicans. As the Christian right gained traction in the eighties, the progressive movement countered with a weak argument. Rather than challenge the Moral Majority on religious terms, they argued that religious leaders had no right to impose their viewpoints on others. In doing so, we not only failed to take advantage of religious argument, we came across as anti-religious.\n\nThe conservative movement and political operatives who created and funded the Christian Right could not have been more pleased with this outcome. For decades, Democrats made it easy for Republicans and party activists to advance the ridiculous assertion that Democrats were \"Godless.\" Many Christians were torn between their beliefs and their political positions with no-one to show them connection between the two.\n\nIf we had we recognized the Christian right as a political movement before it captured the hearts and minds of white evangelicals, we might have prevented the political and religious polarization we see today.\n\nToday, we rail against the hypocrisy of white evangelicals who voted for Trump. I share that rage. But we should recognize that we progressives are complicit when we fail to make a strong religious case for why Christians should vote for Democrats and their policies.\n\nOur failure to speak to people's faith brings about moral impoverishment in a country increasingly burdened under greed, racism, corruption and inequality. The belief that all people are created in God's image is the one thing standing between us and the nihilism of white nationalist, Randian, and Koch brothers wings of the Republican Party that would strip millions of Americans of health care, rip families apart through deportation, deny entry to refugees and the needy, gut the safety net while giving a tax break to billionaires, and reinstate voting restrictions.\n\nFaith has inspired radical movements for justice like the Civil Rights movement. If we continue to allow conservative operatives to hijack religion or co-opt it to do violence to others we are complicit. Those of us comfortable speaking to our religious convictions, as Lamb and Jones did, should do so.\n\nDr. King wrote: \"It is my sincere conviction that no religion has a monopoly on truth.\" So too no party should have a monopoly on religion. King's vision, expressed in Judeo-Christian language, enabled America to take one more step toward addressing our original sin of racism. We still have a long ways to go. We'll get there faster if we reclaim Christianity from those who hijacked it for political gain.",

                "title": "John Bolton is already a lame duck  --  and he knows it",
                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nThe baffling decision by President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE to select John Bolton as his next national security adviser is shaking the Washington foreign policy establishment on both sides of the aisle. Democrats are reacting furiously and Republicans are trying to remain calm, but there's one person who already knows that he's in trouble: John Bolton.\n\nThe choice of Bolton makes no sense for Trump, on several levels. First, Trump ran as an anti-war candidate and just picked the most pro-war national security adviser he could find. Second, Trump ran against the Washington swamp, yet picked a classic Republican foreign policy Washington insider, as Bolton has essentially spent his entire career in D.C. And third, Trump prides himself on being a success, yet he's picked someone who has been at the heart of the greatest foreign policy failures of the past two decades.\n\nExpert in the classic D.C. maneuvering in order to get the job, Bolton must know that videotape is hard to completely erase. And he knows better than anyone else what he's said and done both on video and in print -- while it's likely that Trump does not.\n\nOne of the more curious issues to think about regarding this choice is how Bolton, while being a neoconservative, didn't become a never-Trumper during the 2016 presidential campaign like most of his cohort. Perhaps that's because he was toying with becoming president himself, or because he was fundraising for his super PAC (now known to have been one of the first to hire Cambridge Analytica). How these items play out within the context of the Mueller investigation is anyone's guess.\n\nWhich brings us to the heart of the matter. In a mere couple of months, President Trump will have to decide about what to do with North Korea and Iran. He's already committed to meeting with North Korea's leader, yet Bolton just weeks ago called for American bombing of that country. And Bolton was behind the termination of the last nuclear deal we had with North Korea -- the Agreed Framework -- in 2002. That decision directly led to our rudderless policy on North Korea for the past 15 plus years.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the North Koreans agreeing to a deal, as Trump would want, with Bolton sitting across the table.\n\nAnd on Iran, if Trump were to pull out of the Iran deal at Bolton's behest -- as many in Washington now thinks he will -- then he'll be unleashing Iran's nuclear program from the constraints it's currently under. This would be an ironic outcome, as it took the latter years of the Bush administration (when Bolton was gone) and much of the Obama administration to restrain that program through tough, punishing sanctions. These were a reversal from the Bolton years, when there was minimal financial pressure on Iran due to American unilateralism.\n\nYet the biggest dissonance that the Trump-Bolton partnership may bring is on the question of war versus peace, as symbolized by Iraq. I was a career foreign affairs officer at the State Department when Bolton was the undersecretary for arms control and international security. I remember how Bolton helped lead us straight into that disaster -- one that Trump rightly pointed out during the Republican primaries was a complete mistake.\n\nYet unlike Trump, after all the thousands dead, trillions spent, the unleashing of Iran across the Middle East and the destabilization of the Arab world, Bolton has never said such words, and still defends it as the right thing.\n\nSo John Bolton must know all this, and he must know that President Trump probably doesn't know all the details yet. And he must be hoping that Trump won't learn them any time soon, because if the past 14 months is prologue, Bolton must already know that time in this administration is not on his side.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nToward the end of the film \"There Will Be Blood,\" Daniel Day-Lewis, playing a ruthless oil baron who started out a lone prospector, explains slant drilling technology to a rival. By angling his drill horizontally, he can tap the petroleum reserves underneath his rival's property. He compares it to having a long straw to reach across a table and dip into the other's beverage. \"I drink your milkshake!\" he crows triumphantly in the film's signature line.\n\nDid Cambridge Analytica pull off the digital age equivalent against Facebook? Although the exact details are still being sorted out, in 2015 the U.K.-based data firm, which was briefly hired by the Trump campaign, ended up with personal data from some 50 million Facebook accounts through a personality polling app software application. Although only 270,000 users responded to the app, Cambridge Analytica designed it to scrape data from the profiles and feeds of all the Facebook friends of those original 270,000, according to Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower in the case. As a result, Cambridge Analytica harvested a motherlode of information proprietary to the social media giant. It drank Facebook's milkshake.\n\nWhen it comes to regulation and fines, I always prefer a cautious approach. Investors already are punishing the company, as is appropriate in a market economy. On a basic level, Facebook was extremely careless. Although some are characterizing Cambridge Analytica's data harvest as a criminal breach, that charge is debatable. Consumer bank accounts, passwords, health and financial records were not exposed.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Cambridge Analytica's harvesting was in line with Facebook's terms of use at the time. Popular apps such as FarmVille and Tinder used similar wide-scale collection tools. The Obama campaign also used data harvested from social media, including Facebook, to target voters.\n\nSo perhaps we should turn down the volume of moral outrage and see this for the business issue it is. If there was a breach of contract, civil law should apply. If Cambridge broke the law, it should be held accountable. Facebook should not have waited two years before disclosing the loss, but we until we understand the scope of any violation, Washington should avoid creating regulations or imposing penalties out of an emotional reaction.\n\nMost of that emotion stems from the case being framed within the controversy over \"fake news\" and whether it improperly affected the outcome of the 2016 election. As of now, it's not clear whether the Cambridge Analytica used the data it collected and if so, if it got any measurable results.\n\nBut before we get carried away, let's recall that audience manipulation is not a crime. On the contrary, it's the whole point of advertising, politics not excepted. To this day we argue whether images of a nuclear bomb detonation juxtaposed with a little girl picking flowers or an African-American man in a revolving prison door were outside the rules of political engagement. They had an undeniable influence on the elections held those years, but no ad agencies or television networks were investigated or fined.\n\nBut Facebook's not off the hook. If the company wants a hand in policy direction it first needs to take responsibility for what it's become. It seems pathologically reluctant to admit that it has become a major media company that brings to market unique algorithms that advertisers can use, with amazing accuracy, to target, profile and manipulate individuals.\n\nConsequently, third parties like Cambridge Analytica are becoming more adept at understanding and exploiting the value of Facebook's own resources than Facebook itself. It doesn't help that CEO Mark ZuckerbergMark Elliot ZuckerbergOvernight Tech: What we learned from Zuckerberg's media blitz | Opening arguments in AT&T-Time Warner trial | Trump plans new tariffs on China Bannon swipes at Zuckerberg after Cambridge Analytica reports Overnight Finance: Stocks bleed as Trump seeks new tariffs on China | House passes .3T omnibus | Senate delay could risk shutdown | All eyes on Rand Paul | Omnibus winners and losers MORE, through his silence and no-shows, gives the impression that he's being pushed along by events rather than taking direct control of them. If he doesn't step up with a clearer vision of Facebook's direction, in the end it won't be Cambridge Analytica but the government itself that drinks Facebook's milkshake. That will be the detriment to everyone.",

                "body": "Under a new law, Idaho will require abortion providers to report personal details about their patients, including how many times they've had the procedure in the past.\n\nGov. Butch Otter (R) signed a bill into law on Thursday that will require abortion providers to collect data on women's personal and health details, the Associated Press reported Friday.\n\nThe report will include the woman's age, race, number of children, if any their children have died and the number of their past abortions.\n\nThe legislation also requires medical practitioners to report a list of any possible abortion complications, including: infection, blood clot, hemorrhaging, depression, anxiety and sleeping disorders.\n\nThe new law comes just two days after Otter approved a so-called \"abortion reversal\" law, which requires women to be informed that a drug-inducted procedure can be halted halfway.\n\nMedical experts -- including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists -- have pushed back, saying there is little scientific evidence to support that theory.\n\nThe laws follow a nationwide trend from Republican-led states trying to restrict a women's right to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nThis week, Mississippi's governor signed the country's most restrictive abortion law, banning the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nHowever, a federal judge temporarily blocked the law from going into effect on Tuesday.\n\nLast month, an Idaho state senator made headline after yelling \"abortion is murder\" at a group of college students lobbying for birth control and sexual education.",

McMaster as his national security adviser.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" Conway said that members of President Trump's administration need to \"get with the program or get out.\"\n\n\"It's his agenda if people support it, they should be here, if they're not with the program, you should get with the program or get out,\" she said.\n\nConway added that her comment \"doesn't mean blind loyalty.\"\n\n\"This is a man who takes into consideration everybody's different inputs and ideas, and that makes him a wonderful leader and a terrific boss,\" she said.\n\nMcMaster is the most recent in a series of high-level White House departures. Trump announced via tweet on Thursday that he would replace McMaster with former United States Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.\n\nTrump also fired Secretary of State\n\nSenior economic adviser Gary CohnGary Davivd CohnWhite House aides planned to announce McMaster with other departures: report Trump considered ousting Kelly and serving as his own chief of staff: report Bannon: If Kelly leaves White House, Trump won't replace him MORE also left the White House this month over disagreements with the president over tariffs. Trump announced that he would hire economist Larry Kudlow as Cohn's replacement.\n\nKudlow and Bolton are both frequent commentators on conservative media. Conway said she thinks it's \"kind of weird\" for people to comment on Trump's hiring of conservative media personalities. It is well-known that the president often watches Fox News, and particularly \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\n\"They are men of intellectual heft and substantial accomplishments in their respective fields,\" she said. \"This country should be pleased when people who don't need another chapter in their illustrious careers want to come in and serve the nation.\"",

                "body": "\"The notion that he [Mueller] was hired to only go look for criminality, I think, does a disservice to [the president],\" Gowdy said in an interview with CBS News' \"The Takeout\" podcast.\n\nGowdy, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, said that Mueller's special counsel investigation extends beyond whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to how Russia sought to influence the 2016 election.\n\nGowdy told CBS host Major Garrett that Trump's team should understand that the controversial dossier authored by Christopher Steele that makes salacious ties about Trump's ties to Russia was not the driving force behind the federal probe.\n\n\"I think his lawyers have done a disservice to him, frankly,\" Gowdy said. \"I think allowing it to be framed as an investigation into collusion and collusion only, conflating the Andy McCabe firing, conflating, frankly, the dossier. This investigation would exist without a dossier. And I've said that for the last 12 months. With or without a dossier, this investigation goes on.\"\n\nGowdy went on to urge Trump to continue cooperating with the probe, despite what the White House has admitted is the president's \"frustration\" at the length of the investigation.\n\n\"There's a certain level of frustration that comes from anyone who is, quote, under investigation,\" Gowdy said. \"If you believe you've done nothing wrong, you want the investigation concluded as quickly as possible. It is beyond argument that this has cast a pall over the first part of his presidency.\"\n\nSpeculation has grown over the last few weeks over whether Trump will fire Mueller in an attempt to end the investigation. The White House has repeatedly denied that Trump is considering firing the special counsel.",

                "body": "Restaurants and hot spots around Washington are rolling out the red carpet for protesters joining the March for Our Lives in D.C. on Saturday, offering freebies to demonstrators.\n\nMany of the giveaways tied to the anti-gun violence march, organized by survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, are geared toward students participating in the daylong event.\n\nThe March for Our Lives is set to feature a 12 p.m. rally on Pennsylvania Ave., blocks from the Capitol and White House. Sister protests are also being held nationwide.\n\nThe D.C. event will include Broadway stars Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ben Platt\n\nAmong the celebrities participating in the march are Ariana Grande, Julianne Moore, George Clooney, Jimmy Fallon and Demi Lovato.\n\nDave Delaplaine, the general manager of the Adams Morgan restaurant Roofers Union DC, says his eatery is partnering with a local high school to provide 300 lunches to student activists planning to attend.\n\n\"We are excited to do it,\" Delaplaine said. Included with the brown bagged lunch is a note praising the marchers as an \"inspiration.\"\n\n\"And please remember,\" the message says, \"just because the White House and a stale Congress are in this city, Washington, D.C., is a wonderful city and we will support you every way we can!\"\n\nRoofers Union is not the only one offering to fuel student protesters in the form of free food. Celebrity chef José Andrés tweeted earlier this month that one of his D.C.-based spots would also dole out dishes at the March 24 protest.\n\nOne of my restaurants Think Food Tank on Navy Memorial will be dedicated to provide free sandwiches, drinks etc for those students in need of a meal! Friday/Saturday. More info coming soon...@AMarch4OurLives https://t.co/yyoi9HQajW -- José Andrés (@chefjoseandres)\n\nMarch 10, 2018\n\nHere is a list of some of the places participating in March For Our Lives specials on Saturday:",

We talked about it in conference calls, in meetings.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Cambridge used the data to figure out how best to promote Bolton's hawkish foreign policy message to voters. Bolton became so close to the firm that it even helped him craft talking points, the Times reported.\n\nCambridge has denied any wrongdoing in obtaining the data. Facebook has promised to audit the firm to ensure that the information was destroyed.",

MORE (D-Ill.) seeks to prevent federal officials from misusing taxpayer dollars. The bill specifically nods to the heads of the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Treasury Department, all of whom have been criticized for extravagant travel on chartered planes or in first class.\n\n\"Every public servant has a responsibility to be a good steward of public dollars but it's clear that Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE and his cabinet secretaries do not always see it that way,\" Duckworth said in a statement.\n\n\"When Trump Administration officials spend thousands of taxpayer dollars to charter a private or military plane or purchase a first-class ticket, they should -- at the very least -- be required to tell the American people who are bankrolling their luxurious travel why it is necessary.\"\n\nSpecifically, the bill would require the government to disclose on a public website the official air travel activities of agency leaders every few months. The disclosures would include trip duration, destinations and the number of employees on the trip as well as justification for the travel and the associated costs.\n\nDuckworth argued that the new process established under the bill would cut back on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests made for travel summaries and in turn save government resources and time.\n\nA number of government agencies including the EPA and the Interior Department have blamed a backlog in FOIA requests for slow response times, often coming months later than legally required.\n\nA government watchdog is probing Interior Secretary Ryan ZinkeRyan Keith ZinkeOvernight Regulation: Groups sue over decision to end pay-data rule | EU proposes tax on tech companies | Sessions issues memo on death penalty for drug cases | Pruitt spent 5K on first class flights Overnight Energy: EPA says Pruitt's security detail flies first class | Lackluster offshore drilling sales | Oil companies snag leases near Bears Ears monument Zinke and his wife took security detail on vacation to Turkey, Greece: report MORE for using taxpayer-funded charter and military planes to travel between work events and personal and political appearances, including a jaunt he took to Las Vegas last summer to talk to a professional hockey team.

A government watchdog also previously filed an ethics complaint against him for authorizing EPA to spend what is now estimated to be $43,000 to build a soundproof booth in his office.\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, led by Rep.

Ed MarkeyEdward (Ed) John MarkeyDemocrats lay into Trump's pick of Bolton for national security adviser Dem senator on Bolton hire: Trump is 'lining up his war cabinet' Trump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser MORE (D-Mass.) is calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin research into gun violence immediately, following a new clarification from Congress.\n\nMarkey is calling for the CDC gun violence research, long a priority for Democrats, after the new government funding legislation passed by Congress included language clarifying that existing restrictions do not prevent the agency from researching the causes of gun violence, only from actively advocating for gun control.\n\nPointing to a $1 billion increase in funding that the CDC just received, Markey writes to Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar that \"it appears that the CDC is in an ideal position to begin research on this public health crisis.\"\n\nFinding a source of funding could be a problem, though. Markey asks Azar whether the CDC can use money from its existing budget for the gun violence research, or whether it needs to request additional funding from Congress.\n\nThe push for CDC research on gun violence has received new momentum in the wake of the mass shooting at a Florida high school in February.\n\nNotably, Azar said at a congressional hearing the next day that he supported the research.\n\n\"We believe we've got a very important mission with our work with serious mental illness as well as our ability to do research on the causes of violence and the causes behind tragedies like this so that is a priority for us especially at the Centers for Disease Control,\" Azar said.\n\nMarkey, though, now wants the research to actually commence.",

                "body": "Texas wants back federal family planning dollars the Obama administration pulled from the state government five years ago for defunding Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers.\n\nIn a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked HHS to \"reverse the Obama administration's exclusion of Texas\" from the Title X family planning grant program, which helps fund reproductive health care services for low-income women.\n\n\"As the second largest sovereign in the country, with nearly 13 million female residents, your predecessor's exclusion of Texas from the Title X program is not a badge of honor,\" Paxton wrote.\n\n\"A precursor to participation in federal programs should not be an uncompromising commitment to abortion providers.\"\n\nWhile an HHS spokesperson said all public and private nonprofits are encouraged to apply for the funds, Paxton wrote in his letter that he questions whether the state's application will be \"received with respectful consideration\" or with \"the same derision of the prior administration.\"\n\nAfter Texas banned Planned Parenthood and abortion providers from receiving Title X funding in 2011, the Obama administration, in 2013, opted to award the funding to the Women's Health and Family Planning Association of Texas, a coalition of women's health providers.\n\nThe organization then subgranted Title X funds out to clinics throughout the state, including Planned Parenthood.\n\nNow, Texas is asking for those funds back. Title X grant recipients must reapply for the funding every year, under new rules set by the Trump administration. Applications for next year's funding are due May 24.\n\nIf the Trump administration decides that Texas is eligible for the funding, and approves its application, it would once again give the state the power to strip Planned Parenthood of Title X funding.\n\nPaxton wrote in the letter that recent comments and actions from the administration on abortion funding makes him hopeful.\n\n\"In light of the recent statements by both President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE and the Acting [HHS] Secretary Hargan, and communications that Texas officials had with members of your agency last Fall, Texans are encouraged that cooperative participation to accomplish the objectives of the Title X program, is yet again possible,\" Paxton wrote.\n\nLast year, Trump signed a bill rolling back an Obama-era rule that blocked states from cutting off Title X funding to healthcare providers for political reasons.\n\nThe state is also asking for the administration to give back millions of dollars in Medicaid family planning the Obama administration stripped from the state in 2013 for defunding Planned Parenthood. In the state's request, it said it would continue to exclude Planned Parenthood from receiving funding.\n\nIf approved by the Trump administration, it could set off a wave of similar actions in other states, and more than likely prompt lawsuits from abortion rights groups.\n\nWhile the administration hasn't ruled on the request yet, in January it rescinded Obama-era guidance that warned states against ending Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nAn HHS official at the time called the move an effort to \"roll back regulations the Obama administration put out to radically favor abortion.\"",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nThe latest omnibus spending legislation is full of bad policy and wasteful spending. So was the omnibus that was enacted in May 2017. So was the omnibus enacted in December 2015. Same for December 2014, January 2014, May 2013 and December 2011.\n\nThe most disappointing part of this year's version of the utterly broken congressional appropriations process is that it was no different than years past. Omnibus spending loaded down with sweeteners demanded in back-door negotiations are the essence of the swamp.\n\nEvery year, the process plays out the same way. The regular order appropriations bills pass in the House, then die in the Senate. As the various deadlines come and go, Congress passes numerous continuing resolutions to buy more time (though the extra time never yields a productive regular order proceeding).\n\nFinally, when months of a given fiscal year have already passes, Republican and Democratic leaders retreat to some back room in the Capitol to do the real negotiating. The negotiations lead to countless concessions the duly elected majority party must make to the Democrats that break every campaign promise on the books.\n\nThe result is a thousand-page bill that increases spending, exacerbates the debt crisis, and enacts misguided policy riders. Worse, the vote on these bills is often rushed, passing only 24 or 36 hours after the text is released, and inevitably, Members are faced with a government shutdown if the omnibus doesn't pass.\n\nThis is a terrible way to govern. After all is said and done, congressional leaders pledge that next year will be different. They promise regular order, and vow they'll get the spending under control next year.\n\nBut this year was the no different than the last year, or the one before that.

                "title": "Intellectual property protections should be at forefront of NAFTA discussions",
                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nA recent Morning Consult poll, conducted on behalf of ACTION for Trade showed that 73 percent of respondents believe that the renegotiation of NAFTA must include increased IP protections for our nation's creators, inventors and entrepreneurs. It is time for the administration to catch up with the American electorate and put IP protection first when it comes to NAFTA negotiations.\n\nI believe in the principles of free trade and open markets. I know that fewer barriers to trade benefits American workers and consumers, not to mention, creates a better quality of life for workers around the globe. I also fully support increased IP protections for American innovators and creators - furthermore, I believe international trade agreements are the best way and most practical to expand those protections that offer continued support to American products in global markets.\n\nEighty-six percent of American voters believe that continued innovation is necessary for the United States to remain competitive as a leader in the global economy. They are absolutely correct. Ninety-one percent of respondents believe that American innovation and inventiveness are important aspects of domestic economic growth. They are right, again. And finally,\n\nMoving forward with NAFTA negotiations, we should set IP protection at the center of these talks so that we are able to create a fair environment for our country and our trading partners. America continues to be a leader in the biopharmaceutical industry. It is a crucial industry for our economy that was valued at $450 billion in 2016 alone. The pharmaceutical industry relies heavily on patent protection to develop new drugs and treatments, and developing a new drug has the potential of costing $2.5 billion - according to a study by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. Through patent protections, American-created pharmaceuticals, medical treatments, and medical devices are improving the quality of life across the world.\n\nBut IP protection also goes beyond one single industry - It moves creatives, innovators, and artists to work and develop new ideas. American software code has created new internet platforms that keep businesses, families and friends connected and the world a smaller place. American-inspired film, music, and literature are changing hearts and minds in every corner of the globe - contributing to culture and entertaining billions. Robust IP law protects all of this. Furthermore, creates high-paying jobs for skilled workers across America. For example, the underlying technology at Apple alone is responsible for a supply chain that supports over two million jobs in the United States. It is crystal clear that American innovation continues to be a pioneer, not only in our country but across the world.\n\nBuilding positive trade relationships with our allies must be a priority for America's economy to thrive and succeed in the 21st century and beyond. IP protections must be a priority in all trade relationships. Free trade only gives Americans and the industries across the country more opportunity to grow and develop new technologies. If we continue to build more barriers for trade we will only shut down further opportunities for our local industries and for American workers who benefit from trade. Not to mention, all the jobs that could be affected along with all the small businesses in the country. Let's keep advocating to support small business owners, American workers and all the industries who believe in free trade and in fair IP protection - and, let's continue to build better and more equal relationships with our trade partners, without placing further obstacles for these most important and key relationships.",

I am going to get my shotgun and do something about this. I will just handle this myself,\" Goodwin allegedly said Thursday to a staff member, telling others \"You two are next.\"\n\nThe aggression wasn't a first for Goodwin, the U.S. attorney's office said in a Friday statement. Last year, he allegedly yelled at staffers in Taylor's Virginia Beach office and also confronted Taylor personally outside the congressman's home.\n\nGoodwin, who was charged with threatening murder and assault on a U.S. official, could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.",

                "body": "A nonprofit government ethics watchdog filed a complaint Friday with the Justice Department against the Trump Organization for displaying the presidential seal on tee markers at the Trump International Golf Course in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) announced in a press release that President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE's business, which is controlled by his two adult sons, \"likely violated the law\" by ordering golf tee markers bearing the official White House seal.\n\n\"According to reports, the Trump International Golf Club, located 'five minutes' from Mar-a-Lago, used the presidential seal on tee markers placed on the ground to show golfers where to tee off,\" the complaint reads.\n\n\"The Trump Organization's use of the Presidential Seal in support of its commercial endeavors falsely conveys the impression of government sponsorship or approval of its commercial interests and should be investigated to determine if it violates the law,\" it continues.\n\nCREW executive director Noah Bookbinder added in a statement that a case of the president's personal business being faulted for using the presidential seal to profit from a presidency was unprecedented.\n\n\"Past presidential administrations have vigorously policed unauthorized use of the seal,\" Bookbinder says.\n\n\"But, as with so many other cases of unprecedented mixing of private business with the presidency in this administration, there has never been a case in which the president's own business was using the seal to benefit from the presidency.\"\n\nPast presidents, including former President Obama, have used golf balls featuring the presidential seal while golfing in office.\n\nThe Trump Organization issued a statement earlier this month saying it had discontinued use of the presidential seal, just a day after a ProPublica report revealed the company had ordered the tee markers. It's unclear if the markers bearing the official presidential seal were ever used on the courses.\n\n\"The plaques were presented to the club by a small group of members, who are incredible fans of the President, in honor of Presidents Day weekend,\" a spokesperson for the Trump Organization said. \"They were temporary and have since been removed.\"",

                "body": "An Oregon state lawmaker this week posted the personal information, including phone numbers and home addresses, of three area clergy pushing for a ban on assault weapons.\n\nRep. Bill Post (R) posted the information to a Facebook group on Wednesday, according to the Oregonian, encouraging supporters of gun rights to contact Rabbi Michael Cahana, Rev. Alcena Boozer and Pastor W. J. Mark Knutson.\n\nCahana, Boozer and Knutson recently filed an initiative to ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and large capacity magazines in the state. If the initiative collects the required 88,000 signatures by a July deadline, it will be on the ballot in November.\n\nPost told the Oregonian that he personally left voicemails for the three leaders of the initiative, but declined to say what his message was, or why he posted their personal information on Facebook.\n\n\"Knowledge is power,\" he told the paper. He added that he thinks having the initiative on the ballot would prompt \"the greatest red wave in Oregon's history.\"\n\nCahana told the Oregonian that he received \"quite a number\" of phone calls about the proposal, in addition to Facebook and email messages, which he said were \"not so polite.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Oregon became the first state to add a new gun safety law since the Florida high school shooting. Gov. Kate Brown (D) signed the bill, which bars convicted domestic abusers from owning guns.",

                "body": "Political inexperience is actually a strength in her New York gubernatorial bid, according to Cynthia Nixon, who says \"sometimes a little naïveté is exactly what is needed.\"\n\n\"With a jaded system everybody says, 'Yeah, well, that's the way it is.' You need somebody to come and say, 'Why? Why is that the way it is? Don't try to tell me that I don't have a right to stand here and say, 'I want to be governor, because I think you're doing a lousy job. Nobody is talking about the things that you're not doing, so I am going to do it,'\" the former \"Sex and the City\" star says in an interview with Glamour magazine published Friday.\n\nNixon's remarks come after former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn called the actress an \"unqualified lesbian\" in an interview earlier this week. Quinn\n\nNixon, 51, says \"a lot of things\" propelled her to make a Democratic primary challenge against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\"I think it's the election of Donald Trump. I think it's the defeat of Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonWhite House would like to see Biden 'in the boxing ring' in 2020 House Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents The suit to make Electoral College more 'fair' could make it worse MORE. I think it's what Bernie SandersBernard (Bernie) SandersCongress to require FEC report on foreign money in elections DCCC adds first black candidates to list of top candidates Hillary Clinton's sorry apology is why she's no champion for women MORE showed us is wrong with our party, and what we can do,\" Nixon told the mag.\n\n\"What women did with the Women's March knocked me out. It wasn't just a day to scream and cry and to go home and forget about. It was a shot over the bow, like, 'We're here, and there's a lot of us, and we're not going away. You're going to have to contend with us.'\"\n\nNixon also responded to critics who argued that following former reality TV star President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE's election win, voters don't need another \"celebrity politician.\"\n\n\"Andrew Cuomo is a celebrity politician because he was Mario Cuomo's son. He is in a political celebrity family, and I am in a theatrical celebrity family,\" Nixon said. \"He was also a celebrity when he ran. But I don't know. To me, celebrity seems like a distraction.\"",

Trump had threatened to veto the measure early Friday, but eventually backed down and signed the spending measure.\n\npic.twitter.com/y6NSarFOuF -- MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nAt the bill signing, Trump complained that \"nobody read\" the 2,232-page piece of legislation, which Congress passed this week to avert a government shutdown slated to begin Saturday.\n\n\"It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what's in it,\" Trump said.",

I would hope that we would see quick results on that front in particular,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, Petraeus said he will be watching how Pompeo deals with the mass exodus of seasoned foreign service officials under Rex TillersonRex Wayne TillersonWhite House aides planned to announce McMaster with other departures: report Trump considered ousting Kelly and serving as his own chief of staff: report Trump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser MORE, who was ousted from the top spot at the State Department by Trump earlier this month.\n\n\"It's hard to understand what is the dynamic here, what was that all about,\" Petraeus said of the walkouts at the department. Democrats have expressed concern over the increased vacancies at the agency.\n\n\"My hope would certainly be that Mike Pompeo, recognizing the issues that exist, will be able to work effectively with the White House and with a president with whom he's developed, obviously, a very strong relationship and mutual respect.\"\n\nPompeo, who previously ran the CIA, was described by the retired Army general as a strong director of the agency.\n\nPetraeus would not comment on Tillerson's firing, noting that \"I'm not on the inside, I don't know what the dynamics were,\" but did allow that there was tension between the former ExxonMobil chief executive officer and the commander in chief.\n\n\"Obviously there was some friction between the secretary of State and the president; some days that would be putting it mildly,\" Petraeus said.\n\n\"I thought substantively that he developed quite quickly and impressively,\" he added.",

Under the agreement, Facebook vowed to improve its privacy practices.\n\n\"Facebook has a legal responsibility to ensure user data is secure and that its policies are transparent -- which includes upholding the privacy rights of its users and keeping its promises when it comes to notifying them if there has been a violation,\" the senators wrote.\n\nMultiple media outlets reported this week that the FTC was probing the Cambridge Analytica incident and whether it ran afoul of the settlement.\n\nKlobuchar and Harris asked Ohlhausen if the investigation would also explore whether any other entities improperly obtained Facebook profile data.\n\nCambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing, and Facebook has promised to conduct its own investigation.\n\nFacebook in 2011 agreed to a settlement with the FTC over claims that it deceived users about their privacy settings. Under the terms of the agreement, Facebook promised to refrain from \"making misrepresentations about the privacy or security of consumers' personal information.\"\n\n\"We urge the FTC to conduct a thorough investigation -- which should include examining any and all potential violations of users' privacy -- to assess whether Facebook violated the decree or any other applicable laws,\" the senators wrote.\n\nThe FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Minority Whip Dick DurbinRichard (Dick) Joseph Durbin'Dreamers' fix blocked in Senate GOP leaders to Trump: Leave Mueller alone Water has experienced a decade of bipartisan success MORE (D-Ill.) also signed the letter.\n\nThe call for a comprehensive analysis -- which comes after the U.S. and France joined the U.K. in blaming Russia for the attack -- signals that Democrats want to slap Russia with consequences for the attack.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied responsibility for the attack\n\nIn an address to Parliament earlier this month, British Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.K. government had determined the Russian government was likely behind the attack, pointing to the assessment of Moscow's chemical weapons capabilities and its record of signing off on former intelligence officers' death warrants.\n\nU.K. officials announced that a highly lethal chemical agent was used in the attack, known as Novichok, which they say is known to be a military grade nerve agent that the Kremlin develops.\n\n\"Given the use of such a dangerous nerve agent, as well as the origins of the substance, we believe a comprehensive analysis of this chemical attack is vital to uncovering the perpetrators and, if necessary, you should impose sanctions on the individuals and entities involved,\" the lawmakers' letter continues.\n\nConcern about Russia's aggressiveness in other countries continues to run high on Capitol Hill.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle largely agree that the Kremlin sought to sow discord and meddle in the 2016 presidential election and will likely strike again in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert MuellerRobert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE, who is investigating Russian interference, indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian groups earlier this year for their efforts to conduct \"information warfare\" in the U.S. during the election, through social media and other sophisticated measures.\n\nWhile Trump administration has issued some punishment on Moscow for meddling, Trump has largely avoided criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin in public.",

                "body": "Actor George Clooney penned a letter to students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, saying that he and his wife Amal Clooney are grateful for their actions and support their march against gun violence.\n\n\"You make me proud of my country again,\" he wrote.\n\nClooney's note was published in the Guardian on Friday, the day before thousands of students are expected to march in Washington, D.C., in support of gun control and school safety in the wake of the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas. The staff of the high school's paper, The Eagle Eye, took over the Guardian's website to cover the march, organized by students from their school.\n\nClooney turned down an interview with the staff of the paper, saying in the letter that he thinks it is important for them to share the stories of other young people instead.\n\n\"We both feel very strongly that this is your march. Your moment,\" Clooney wrote.\n\n\"Young people are taking it to the adults and that has been your most effective tool. The fact that no adults will speak on the stage in DC is a powerful message to the world that if we can't do something about gun violence then you will.\"\n\nHe added that anyone the students ask to interview \"would feel proud to be interviewed by you,\" but that he thinks it is \"so much more effective if it's young people.\"\n\nThe Guardian's editors in chief said they also requested interviews with Sens. Bernie SandersBernard (Bernie) SandersCongress to require FEC report on foreign money in elections DCCC adds first black candidates to list of top candidates Hillary Clinton's sorry apology is why she's no champion for women MORE (I-Vt.) and Marco RubioMarco Antonio RubioTrump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser Orlando March for Our Lives protesters to march to Rubio's downtown office, Pulse nightclub Lawmakers eye crackdown on China's Confucius Institutes MORE (R-Fla.), who both accepted.\n\n\"It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to point to this moment and say it belongs to you,\" Clooney wrote ot the students. \"You certainly should do what you want but that would be my hope for you.\"\n\nThe Clooneys donated $500,000 to the March for Our Lives effort in February and plan to march on Saturday. Several other celebrities, including Jimmy Fallon and Lin-Manuel Miranda, have also said that they will be present.",

                "body": "A Houston high school student organizing the city's gun control march is calling on adults to play a role in supporting the gun control movement that students have led nationwide in the wake of the Florida high school shooting in February.\n\nPaige Cromley, a sophomore at the John Cooper School, published an op-ed Friday in the Houston Chronicle, in which she writes that adults \"cannot understand this movement the same way we can.\"\n\n\"We are the generation raised on mass shootings,\" Cromley writes. \"We were the ones enrolled in elementary school when a man walked into Sandy Hook and shot 20 children dead. We're the ones crouched monthly under desks in a darkened room, hoping that it's a drill.\"\n\nCromley writes that young people \"need to remain at the forefront\" of the national movement demanding gun control and school safety, but said that they need adults to support, protect and listen to students.\n\n\"Look at it this way: We are completely unrepresented in the government,\" she writes. \"The youngest standing member of Congress is more than twice my age. Not one member of the Senate was in high school when the Columbine shooting occurred.\"\n\n\"Our government officials don't have the perspective on this issue that we have, because they haven't grown up with it,\" Cromley adds. \"And yet, when we voice our thoughts, all kinds of people want to speak over us.\"\n\nIn the op-ed, Cromley compares the \"outrage and passion\" surrounding the issue to the activism during the Vietnam War and civil rights movement, and offers suggestions to parents for how to best support their children during the march.\n\n\"Encourage your sons and daughters to get involved, even if you don't agree with the cause,\" she writes. \"Give them and their friends a ride to the march this Saturday. Help them make signs for the rally, or submit art through our website. It's scary for us kids to speak out; don't punish yours for taking a stand.\"\n\nThe Houston March for Our Lives is one of hundreds planned nationwide. Survivors of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February are organizing the movement. Thousands of young people are expected to call for gun control and school safety in Washington, D.C. and other cities in Saturday.",

Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what's in it.\"\n\nIn a Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was frustrated that the bill did not include enough funding for his long-promised border wall or protections for young immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nTrump's veto threat came despite an assurance the president made over the past few days to Speaker Paul RyanPaul Davis RyanHouse Republicans grumble about the 'worst process ever' Winners and losers from the .3T omnibus Collins: McConnell has 'kept his commitment' on ObamaCare fix MORE (R-Wis.) and his own Cabinet members that he intended to sign the bill.\n\nThe president said Friday he was \"forced\" to sign it because he didn't want to harm the military.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about this bill,\" Trump said. \"There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill, but were in a sense forced to if we want to build our military.\"\n\nThe president's remarks about the process echo those of conservatives in Congress and on Fox News, who have fumed in recent days that the massive omnibus was forced on them shortly before the government spending deadline.\n\nMany on the right believe that Republicans would have opposed the bill if Democrats were in power.\n\n\"We are very disappointed that in order to fund the military, we had to give up things were we considering many cases them to be bad for them to be a waste of money,\" Trump said. \"But that's the way unfortunately right now the system works.\"",

Progressive group launches anti-Trump 'We the Constitution' campaign MORE a line-item veto for tax and spending provisions was unconstitutional.\n\nTrump signed the spending bill after saying earlier Friday that he was considering vetoing the measure since it didn't address recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and provide full funding for a wall along the southern border.\n\nLater, Trump said the spending bill is too large because Republicans had to agree to spending sought by Democrats in exchange for increased military spending. He called the Democrats' demands \"a wasted sum of money.\" He also blamed them for the bill's lack of provisions to protect DACA recipients.\n\nIn addition to pushing for a line-item veto, Trump also reiterated his calls for the Senate to end its filibuster rule that requires most legislation to be supported by 60 Senators, rather than a simple majority.\n\n\"We have to get rid of the filibuster rule,\" he said. \"We have to get rid of the filibuster rule and go to 51 votes in the Senate if we're going to have really sustained, continued success.\"",

They want to get your situation taken care of,\" Trump said. \"The Democrats fought us. They fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill.\"\n\nHe addressed DACA recipients and the \"Hispanic community\" directly in his remarks, accusing Democrats of \"using\" them for political gain.\n\n\"I do want the Hispanic community to know and DACA recipients to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats, who are using you for their own purposes,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president's comments - and his decision to sign the spending bill - came hours after he said he was considering a veto of the legislation, venting frustration with the fact that it did not resolve the fates of DACA recipients and decrying its lack of funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump has repeatedly argued that Democratic lawmakers have opposed his proposed solutions for DACA, an Obama-era program that temporarily shielded certain undocumented immigrants from deportation. Trump announced in September he would rescind the program.\n\nBut Democrats have bristled at Trump's proposals, which they argue contain so-called \"poison pills\" - like curbing legal immigration - that they cannot support.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nMy six-year-old daughter is just sort of beginning to understand her parents work in politics. \"How does someone run for office?\" she asked, so I explained all kinds of people can run for office, even kids who have an idea about how to make their school better. Her ideal platform, she decided, would be to get rid of all the teachers so \"the kids could be in charge and just eat candy.\" Even at six, she's fantasizing about patronage, perks and getting rid of her political enemies.\n\nYet, the movement for stronger gun laws spurred by the Parkland school shooting shows us how teachers and students can lock arms and model real leadership for a dysfunctional Washington. Despite President TrumpDonald John TrumpScarborough mocks 'Deflection Don' over transgender troop ban Pelosi condemns Trump's 'cowardly, disgusting' ban on transgender troops Trump moves to ban most transgender people from serving in military MORE floating the idea of arming teachers, with many Republicans predictably following suit, the views of teachers are quite clear.\n\nA new Gallup poll shows three-fourths of teachers oppose teachers and staff carrying guns, with a majority saying the policy would make them less safe. A poll of National Education Association members conducted by GBA Strategies shows very similar findings. (Even Barron Trump's own school joined a regional call to not arm teachers.) It's sometimes hard to push aside the White House chaos and drama to remember Trump's policies are also wildly unpopular.\n\nWhile much has been written about a recent shift on guns, with many saying \"this time it's different,\" young people were already moving toward support for stronger laws. The Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll last winter showed a majority, at 61 percent, of younger adults supported \"stricter gun laws,\" a 12-point jump in just a few years. For young people guns are not just a political position but a personal fear. A new USA Today poll of those ages 13 to 24 shows gun violence to be a top worry, more so than even college affordability, racism or climate change.\n\nFor gun law skeptics who assume teachers and younger people are simply destined to be progressive anyway, the polling suggests otherwise. In the National Education Association member survey, opposition to arming teachers is so pervasive, even a majority of gun-owning educators oppose it. Moreover, a recent Pew Research study comparing generations shows younger people have turned sharply Democratic under Trump, continuing a trend that cannot be explained by just hoping they'll grow out of it.\n\nRepublican leaders looking at these patterns might be tempted to lean on the conventional wisdom that gun owners are more enthusiastic about their position than those who want stronger laws. But this is more myth than wisdom. A Quinnipiac poll recently measured single-issue gun voting: those who would vote against a candidate with whom they disagreed on guns, even if they agreed on other issues. Not only did it find gun law opponents just as likely as supporters to be single-issue voters, supporters outnumbered opponents by more than two-to-one. That means in this poll, the bloc of voters who say they just won't stand for new stronger gun laws comprises only about 10 percent of the electorate.\n\nOf course, the battle for stronger gun laws is not just about school shootings, student walkouts or arming teachers. Stronger gun laws can reduce deaths from accidental shootings, intimate partner violence and suicide. Voters, unlike Washington, seemingly know this, too. A poll I conducted in 2017 for the group Guns Down (not in the wake of a well-publicized mass shooting) showed a majority of Americans supported 15 of 16 different stronger gun law proposals, including strong support from gun owners.\n\nSo it is Washington politicians who see gun laws as all or nothing, and choose to do nothing. Most Americans -- whether young people, teachers, activists or even gun owners -- want to see something. Running for office isn't about the politics or the perks, but about listening to voters. Thanks to the national movement of students and educators, many are finally recognizing the support that's been there all along. The only thing that can truly be different is if this time Washington listens. Should politicians ignore the passion behind this Saturday's March For Our Lives, they might just have to wait until November to get the message.",

                "body": "\"I was talking about high school,\" Biden told NBC reporter Mariana Atencio on Friday.\n\nAtencio asked Biden whether he would \"really fight the president\" following an exchange between the president and Biden that began when Biden criticized Trump's past remarks about women at a Florida rally on Wednesday.\n\nBiden declared then that he would have taken Trump \"behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\" in high school.\n\nTrump responded in a tweet early Thursday, calling Biden weak \"both mentally and physically\" while declaring his potential 2020 opponent \"would go down fast and hard\" if such a confrontation occurred.\n\nBiden demurred when asked to respond to the president's tweet, but stopped to insist he was only talking about a hypothetical situation in high school, not the present day.\n\n\"Go back and read what I said. I said 'high school,'\" Biden stopped to tell Atencio, who caught him live on MSNBC while walking down a hall in the Capitol.\n\nDuring his Thursday remarks at a Florida rally, Biden was referencing comments made by Trump on a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape that included lewd remarks around grabbing women without their consent.\n\n\"A guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, 'I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it.' They asked me would I like to debate this gentleman, and I said no. I said, 'If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him,'\" Biden said to cheers.\n\nTrump responded on Twitter the following morning.\n\n\"Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault,\" Trump wrote. \"He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe!\"\n\nTrump is 71 and Biden is 76.\n\nTrump and Biden similarly clashed ahead of the 2016 election.",

It is kind of hard to express empathy when you don't understand.\"\n\n\"It's just that when you go through a very traumatic experience such as this one ... you have to be very delicate in the way you phrase your words to people,\" she continued.\n\n\"I don't think he took any caution or any regard for what I was going through,\" Fuentes added. \"That kind of hurt my feelings.\"",

Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what's in it.\"\n\nThe president called on Congress for a line item veto for all government spending rules and called on the Senate to end its filibuster rule to make it easier to implement the Republican agenda.",

Trey GowdyHarold (Trey) Watson GowdyHouse Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents House Judiciary chair to subpoena for FBI documents Trump lawyer John Dowd resigns MORE (R-S.C.) is requesting answers from the Interior Department on the hefty $139,000 price tag to replace the secretary's office doors.\n\nGowdy on Thursday sent a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan ZinkeRyan Keith ZinkeOvernight Regulation: Groups sue over decision to end pay-data rule | EU proposes tax on tech companies | Sessions issues memo on death penalty for drug cases | Pruitt spent 5K on first class flights Overnight Energy: EPA says Pruitt's security detail flies first class | Lackluster offshore drilling sales | Oil companies snag leases near Bears Ears monument Zinke and his wife took security detail on vacation to Turkey, Greece: report MORE requesting a briefing on his plans to replace the doors and documentation for the costs associated with the replacement.\n\n\"The committee is aware of numerous reports about the need for replacement doors at the Department and allegations of excess cost,\" Gowdy wrote in the letter.\n\nAs part of his request, Gowdy asked the Interior Department to provide documentation on the acquisition process, estimates, invoices and related contracts related to the door.\n\nThe Interior Department signed a contract in September to pay $138,670 for the \"Secretary's door.\" The door in question, according to the department, was a replacement balcony door that leaked when it rained.\n\nInterior press secretary Heather Swift previously said that Zinke was not aware of the door upgrades and that the replacements were part of an order requested under the previous administration.\n\n\"The secretary was not aware of this contract but agrees that this is a lot of money for demo, install, materials, and labor,\" Swift said in a statement.\n\n\"Between regulations that require historic preservation and outdated government procurement rules, the costs for everything from pencils to printing to doors is astronomical. This is a perfect example of why the secretary believes we need to reform procurement processes.\"\n\nInterior later said it was looking for alternative bids for the door.\n\nZinke said during a House budget hearing last week that he had successfully negotiated the price down to $75,000.\n\nLast month Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben CarsonBenjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonWhite House aides planned to announce McMaster with other departures: report Warren battles Carson: Housing discrimination 'the scandal that should get you fired' Overnight Regulation: Omnibus includes deal on tip-pooling rule | Groups sue over rules for organic livestock | AT&T, DOJ make opening arguments in merger trial MORE withdrew an order for dining room furniture that included a $31,000 table.\n\nThis is not the first time that the House oversight committee has gotten involved in alleged government waste.\n\nIn February the committee sent a letter to Environment Protection Agency head Scott PruittEdward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Regulation: Groups sue over decision to end pay-data rule | EU proposes tax on tech companies | Sessions issues memo on death penalty for drug cases | Pruitt spent 5K on first class flights Overnight Energy: EPA says Pruitt's security detail flies first class | Lackluster offshore drilling sales | Oil companies snag leases near Bears Ears monument EPA: Pruitt's security detail flies first class MORE asking him to provide documents regarding his consistent use of first- and business-class travel on government-funded trips.\n\nPruitt was given two weeks to respond but missed the deadline.\n\nA spokesperson for the EPA said the agency has been in touch with Gowdy's office in an attempt to get the information to him.\n\n\"We have been in contact with Chairman Gowdy and are accommodating his request as quickly as possible,\" EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a statement.\n\nGowdy has given Zinke until April 6 to respond to his request.",

He will be the first member of his family to go to college.\n\nIn January, Obama picked Chicago as the site of his future presidential library and announced plans for a 235-foot tall museum, community athletic center and outdoor plaza.",

                "body": "Hundreds of students gathered on Capitol Hill Friday to argue for gun control ahead ofa Saturday march expected to bring hundreds of thousands to Washington, D.C.\n\nFlanked by a handful of Democratic lawmakers, including former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), the young advocates accused Congress of bowing to the wishes of the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) at the expense of school safety.\n\n\"Students are stepping up to the NRA because our elected officials are afraid to,\" Antiqua Flint, an 15-year-old high school student from North Minneapolis, Minn., said during a press briefing in front of the Capitol.\n\n\"The solution to violence is not more guns. We need to pass sensible laws to keep guns out of dangerous hands.\"\n\nThe briefing marked an introduction of sorts to Saturday's \"March for Our Lives\" demonstration. The student-driven event was sparked by last month's shooting rampage at a high school in Parkland, Fla., where a lone gunman killed 17 people with a military-style rifle.\n\nRep. Ted DeutchTheodore (Ted) Eliot DeutchJudiciary Dems warn Trump: Don't fire Mueller, Sessions during House recess Gun protests sweep nation as House passes school safety bill House passes school safety bill amid gun protests MORE, a Democrat who represents Parkland, said the student victims at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School \"have energized the nation,\" launching a new movement that could mark a \"sea change\" in the decades-old debate over gun reform.\n\n\"We knew that it would be different,\" he said. \"Students decided that they weren't going to simply allow this tragedy to become another statistic in a long line of horrific tragedies, or horrific acts of gun violence.\"\n\nSen. Amy KlobucharAmy Jean KlobucharOvernight Cybersecurity: House Intel votes to release Russia report | House lawmakers demand Zuckerberg testify | Senators unveil updated election cyber bill Five takeaways from Mark Zuckerberg's media blitz Senators introduced revised version of election cyber bill MORE (D-Minn.) offered another explanation for why the student protests could represent a tipping point in the debate.\n\n\"When kids ask,\" she said, \"it's harder to say no.\"\n\nCongress this week passed a massive government spending bill that includes several provisions designed to tackle the nation's gun-violence epidemic, particularly school shootings. One aims to strengthen -- but not expand -- the federal background check system before gun purchases. Another provides grants to school districts to help identify and counsel students with behavioral problems that might accelerate into violence. A third empowers federal researchers to study gun violence as a public health issue.\n\nAll told, the reforms mark the most drastic changes to the nation's gun laws since 2007, when Congress stepped in to bolster background checks after the shooting massacre at Virginia Tech the same year.\n\nThe provisions do nothing, however, to restrict gun sales or ownership.\n\n\"There's a long way to go,\" said Sen. Bill NelsonClarence (Bill) William NelsonSteyer brings his push to impeach Trump to town halls across the nation Overnight Defense: Senate sides with Trump on military role in Yemen | Dem vets push for new war authorization on Iraq anniversary | General says time isn't 'right' for space corps Senate sides with Trump on providing Saudi military support MORE (D-Fla.). \"That's what these students are here for.\"\n\nAmong a host of additional measures, the Democrats are pushing hard for votes on bills to expand background checks to all gun sales; ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; raise the gun-buying age to 21; and prohibit the sale of bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to fire with automatic rapidity.\n\n\"Congress did more yesterday than they've done in recent memory, and they did it because of these students,\" said Deutch, referring to the omnibus bill. \"But if the Speaker and the majority leader really want to honor the memories and the lives tragically lost at Stoneman Douglas ... they will do what is necessary to stand up to the gun lobby and stand up for the families and for these kids.\"\n\nGOP leaders have shown no appetite to consider legislation that would put new limits on guns. Following the Parkland shooting, they warned against eroding Second Amendment rights, focusing instead on strengthening the mental health system.\n\n\"We shouldn't be banning guns from law-abiding citizens,\" Speaker Paul RyanPaul Davis RyanHouse Republicans grumble about the 'worst process ever' Winners and losers from the .3T omnibus Collins: McConnell has 'kept his commitment' on ObamaCare fix MORE (R-Wis.) said after the tragedy.\n\nSaturday's march is designed to challenge that sentiment head on. And the students are vowing that their grassroots movement -- fueled by social media and the unique prowess of a younger generation to tap its organizing powers -- is just getting started.\n\n\"To you, the politicians in Washington for not hearing our cries for justice, enough is enough,\" said Demitri Hoth, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, said Friday at the Capitol. \"We are your future. Why won't you protect us?\"\n\nGiffords, who launched her own gun control group after she was nearly killed in a mass shooting at a constituent event in Tucson in 2011, did not speak at Friday's briefing. But her husband Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, predicted that the groundswell of support for tougher gun laws, fueled by the student activists, is poised to alter the electoral landscape in ways that will make reforms inevitable.\n\n\"They're not going to be students very long, they're going to be voters. ... And that is what is going to really make the difference,\" he said.\n\n\"This election in November could turn out to be a referendum on what Congress, collectively, has not done on this issue for so many years,\" Kelly added. \"And when that happens, you're going to see some real change.\"",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nAs John Bolton takes over for outgoing National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, he is likely to ponder: What does the Russian presidential election tell us?\n\nOn March 18, 67 percent of the Russian electorate voted, choosing Vladimir Putin to serve his fourth presidential term with 77 percent of the vote. This was a tightly controlled election, with Alexei Navalny, a leading opposition figure, banned from running. Some election tampering was reported.\n\nFirst, the Kremlin controls the media. The independent Rain TV has a tiny audience and is limited to the internet outside of Moscow. But significantly, the Russians are living better -- and longer -- than ever in recent history.\n\nThe quality of food has deteriorated since the Kremlin imposed a ban on certain imports from the EU and the U.S. in response to sanctions placed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, but there are none of the shortages or queues for basic foodstuffs that were staples of the Soviet era.\n\nMedical care is subpar by Western standards, but life expectancy and fertility have increased recently despite state health budget cuts. While many in law enforcement and intelligence cannot travel abroad, the majority of Russians can. They love their Turkish beach vacations, and Putin allows them.\n\nPutin's imprint on Russia is unmistakable: the quest for world power, meddling in the affairs of countries near and far, but little economic growth.\n\nWhile in his first two terms (2000-2008) the Russian GDP grew around 7 percent per year and there was a talk of \"catching up and overtaking\" Portugal, today, Russia's economy is growing at an anemic 1.5 percent, after negative growth in 2014-2016.\n\nRussia remains an oil and gas exporter and continues selling weapons and nuclear reactors, as it has for the last 50 years. Its performance is not impressive in the new, 21st-century industries: AI, robotics, biotech, sophisticated IT; and there are few signs that this is about to change.\n\nPolitics remain stilted. Under Putin's rule, prominent political opponents are not allowed to challenge him, or they wind up shot like Boris Nemtsov or chased out of the country, like chess champion Garry Kasparov.\n\nCorruption is rampant, as the Transparency International index, which ranks Russia between Gambia and Bangladesh, indicates.\n\nNevertheless, the majority of Russians -- 77 percent -- voted for Putin. In addition, 12 percent of voters supported Stalinist/communist agricultural businessman Pavel Grudinin, and 6 percent voted for imperialist, ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Thus, 95 percent of Russians reject the pro-Western, liberal approach, which makes any kind of rapprochement difficult.\n\nSimply put, Russians do not buy the notion of Russian integration with the West and reject transformation into a tolerant, democratic society with a law-based market economy. As much as Russians suffered under the czars and the commissars, this is still a people who is proud to have built a massive empire.\n\nPutin's assertion that the collapse of the USSR was a \"geopolitical catastrophe\" resonates with both the elites and the masses. The \"It\" girl, Ksenia Sobchak, and a veteran economist Grigory Yavlinsky -- the two most liberal of the candidates running against Putin -- collectively won less votes than the margin of error.\n\nLike it or not, we in the West need to stare the stark reality in the face: The Russian people support their leader in his war in Ukraine, tough talk against America, and de-facto alliance with China, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Venezuela.\n\nThis means friction with NATO and the U.S. will continue for the foreseeable future in Europe -- from the Arctic to the Black Sea -- and in the Syrian powder keg. Moscow will also support Teheran in a possible future confrontation with the U.S.\n\nIt also means that Russia is likely to continue bolstering extreme-right and far-left parties in Europe, intent on undermining the EU and weakening NATO.\n\nWhile pressure on the Baltic states has subsided somewhat recently, and a few months ago, there were noises about seeking a solution in eastern Ukraine, Putin's rhetoric, especially in his recent speech to the Parliament, remains bellicose and threatening.\n\nPutin wants \"respect\" for Russia, and a new accommodation with the West, possibly in the form of a \"Yalta II\" deal, in which new spheres of influence are delineated. However, it is unlikely that the collective West will be ready and willing to grant him that.\n\nThus, the best advice to new National Security Advisor Bolton, the American leadership and Congress is:\n\nRussia today may be adventurous and occasionally nasty -- to wit, the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the U.K. -- but it has a weak economic base and lacks the science and technology potential, as well as the demographic resources of the USSR.\n\nWhile it is unlikely to win a protracted geopolitical competition with the U.S. on its own, in the short run, Moscow may wreak havoc in the international arena.\n\nTwo of America's authoritarian rivals -- Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping -- just got essentially open-ended mandates to rule. This is a challenge unprecedented since the end of the Cold War. The Trump administration should do all it can to keep Moscow and Beijing apart, and prepare for a long slog.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nOn Sunday, CBS aired a 30-minute interview with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, covering the South Korean Government's position on the recent developments with North Korea in the lead-up to the inter-Korean and U.S.-DPRK summits in April and May, respectively. There's much to be dissected from host Margaret Brennan's dialogue with the foreign minister, but the most telling point was the way in which Kang -- and by extension, Seoul -- placed confidence in Pyongyang's verbal commitment to denuclearization.\n\nThis should be unnerving, as both Washington and Seoul are about to enter into talks with North Korea, which until most recently has threatened the stability and peace of its neighbors with its nuclear provocations, illicit activities and a dismal human rights record.\n\nWhen asked by Brennan what conditions North Korea would have to meet before a conversation on a vision for a lasting, permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula could happen, Kang replied that the Kim regime has, in effect, already responded to Seoul's request that the North stop provocations and indicate a clear commitment to denuclearize. Per Kang, Kim has conveyed that commitment by \"giving his word,\" which is \"quite weighty\" since the words came directly from the regime's leader, which has never happened before.\n\nKang's response makes us think for a split-second that this is the first time the South Koreans have dealt with the North Korean regime, and that the DPRK has built a long history of credibility such that a mere verbal acquiescence is sufficient for Washington, Seoul and other stakeholders to rest somewhat assured and move forward in the preparatory steps for two high-level dialogues. But even among allies, a leader's verbal commitment by itself is never adequate to assuage the security concerns of partner nations; his words are backed up by policies, actions and measures to follow through on the pledge.\n\nSo when the leader of a hostile country -- who until recently threatened the United States with an \"all-out war\" and a nuclear preemptive strike -- conveys his verbal commitment to temporarily halt provocations and denuclearize, skepticism should remain.\n\nThe North may have held in abeyance its nuclear provocations, but just this past weekend, we saw reports on the Kim regime's pirating and illicit transaction techniques to get around international sanctions that are wearing away at the DPRK's economy. Further, Pyongyang's egregious human rights violations in the form of prison camps and forced labor continue to this day despite the international community's efforts to clamp down and hold the regime accountable for its abuses. So it is quite evident that we cannot just yet take \"the word\" of Kim as having met a condition for talks -- or worse yet, concessions or aid down the road -- and proceed. It remains to be seen just how the DPRK will conduct itself in the lead-up to and during its talks with South Korea and the United States.\n\nLet's not hold our breath.\n\nAssuredly, however, Foreign Minister Kang has expressed the South Korean government's willingness to coordinate preparations for the April inter-Korean summit to go hand-in-hand with the planning for the Trump-Kim summit in May. At the least, the Blue House recognizes that the inter-Korean dialogue will serve as the stepping stone for U.S.-DPRK talks -- the outcome of Seoul's engagement with Pyongyang will inevitably shape and tint the atmospherics and substance of President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE's meeting with Kim Jong Un.\n\nWe should thus capitalize upon Seoul's willingness to cooperate and consult with Washington in planning for the summits as an opportunity to align our North Korea policies and deal with Pyongyang as a united front. South Korea President Moon Jae-in's pro-engagement stance clearly runs counter to the Trump administration's tougher posture toward the DPRK; yet, if lasting, permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula is a shared goal, assuredly Seoul and Washington can set aside short-term national interests and find some common ground for cooperation and policy coordination.\n\nWith about a month remaining until the Seoul-Pyongyang summit and two months until the Trump-Kim meeting, we clearly have our work cut out for us. The time pressure leaves Seoul and Washington vulnerable to hasty decision-making and susceptible to Kim Jong Un's string-pulling and calculated moves. A lot could happen in the next couple months -- let's make sure that Kim follows through on his word and we make progress toward lasting peace on the Peninsula.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nThe opioid crisis is a public health emergency that shows no signs of abating. In 2016, the most recent year with data, 63,600 people died from drug-related causes, a 21 percent increase from 2015. More recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveal that emergency department visits for suspected opioid overdoses -- including fatal and non-fatal apparent overdoses -- increased by 30 percent from 2016 to 2017, an ominous sign that rates of drug overdose deaths are continuing to escalate.\n\nThe federal response to the opioid epidemic has been sluggish and anemically funded going back several administrations since data on the dangers of opioid addiction have only started to become generally understood.\n\nPresident TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE this week unveiled a plan to address the opioid epidemic, coming nearly five months after the administration first declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Last month, Congress approved $6 billion over the next two years for the response, the first new federal money to combat the opioid epidemic since the Obama administration. The omnibus appropriations bill, released Wednesday, would supplement this amount with an additional $3.3 billion in opioid spending for 2018.\n\nCongress is now tasked with developing a plan for how to spend this funding, which will likely go toward serving the17.2 million people needing but not receiving treatment for substance use disorders. Policymakers from both parties have proposed a wealth of policy instruments to achieve this, including deregulating the prescribing of medications to treat addiction, removing barriers to funding inpatient treatment facilities, and delivering treatment to vulnerable populations like prisons. Yet one of the simplest and most impactful tools for facilitating treatment and recovery for substance use has come under continuous political attack -- access to Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid provides coverage for four in 10 non-elderly Americans living with opioid use disorder. However, since last summer, some members of Congress have repeatedly asserted that Medicaid has fueled the opioid epidemic. Citing the low cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid patients, these members have accused patients of selling prescribed opioids for profit. After a Senate hearing these lawmakers released a report reiterating claims that \"growing evidence\" of fraud in the Medicaid program has worsened the epidemic and asserted that Medicaid caused the opioid epidemic. Some lawmakers have made spurious comparisons of opioid death rates in states that expanded and did not expand Medicaid eligibility.\n\nOur findings, published in American Journal of Public Health, show these claims have no basis in fact. By comparing states that did and did not expand Medicaid eligibility, we find that while opioid prescribing in the Medicaid population has increased in recent years, there is no statistical difference between states that did expand Medicaid and states that did not. The findings are in line with other assessments, including a recent Health Affairs blog describing that the trend toward higher drug-related deaths in expansion states came before the Affordable Care Act was even signed.\n\nIn fact, the most profound effect of Medicaid expansion on the opioid epidemic is increased access to addiction treatment. Our analysis finds that per-enrollee rates of buprenorphine and naltrexone, two medications used to treat opioid use disorders, increased by more than 200 percent after states expanded Medicaid eligibility. By contrast, prescribing rates increased by less than 50 percent in the states that did not expand eligibility.\n\nCoupled with the finding that opioid prescribing increased no more in expansion states than non-expansion states, this reveals that the expansion successfully opened up access to treatment for people with opioid use disorder. Trump himself acknowledged the importance of Medicaid in addressing the opioid epidemic by taking aim at the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, which prohibits federal Medicaid funding from reimbursing large residential treatment facilities, in his recent opioid plan.\n\nAmericans do not experience substance use disorders in a vacuum. Nearly 40 percent of people with opioid addictions are also experiencing mental health disorders. Injecting drugs increases the chances that people will acquire infective endocarditis, HIV, or viral hepatitis. For those who developed an addiction through the misuse of drugs prescribed for chronic pain, injury, cancer, or other illnesses, those same underlying health conditions may require ongoing health care.\n\nThe rhetoric that substance use disorders can be addressed through siloed funding earmarked only for treatment, or worse, suggesting that expanding health care coverage is actually driving the opioid epidemic, fundamentally undervalues the holistic health needs of people experiencing addiction. For many, the complex health needs associated with addiction are best served by an integrated health system that is accessible and affordable.\n\nAs we map the way forward towards ending the opioid epidemic, we must not forget that Medicaid is one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal. Attempts to undermine or discredit the role of Medicaid in improving the lives of Americans living with substance use disorders are counterproductive and not supported by the best available evidence.",

                "body": "Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were flown to Washington on Thursday on the New England Patriots' official plane ahead of Saturday's March for Our Lives.\n\nThe Boston Globe reported Friday that the team's owner, Robert Kraft, sent the plane to fly the families of victims of the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Fla. and some of the students to the nation's capital.\n\nKraft's decision came at the behest of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, the Globe reported.\n\nGiffords and Kelly are among the country's most prominent advocates for stricter gun control laws. They founded Giffords, a gun violence prevention group, after the former congresswoman was nearly killed in a shooting in 2011.\n\nThe March for Our Lives, set to take place in cities across the country on Saturday, was organized in the wake of a mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead and 14 others injured.\n\nSince then, the students and parents of the high school have emerged as vocal advocates for strengthening gun control laws, and have pressed lawmakers to take swift action on the matter.\n\nKelly told The Washington Post that he wanted to help the students get to the march on Saturday.\n\n\"Not only did their friends and teachers get shot and killed, other friends shot and injured ... most of them they had bullets flying over their heads,\" he said. \"This is not fair that they have to deal with something like this at their age. They wanted to go to Washington and be heard, and so I felt it was our obligation to help them.\"\n\nAccording to the Globe, the plane departed from Fort Lauderdale on Thursday, and will bring the students back to Florida after the march.",

                "body": "Nationwide support for increased gun control is at a new five-year high according to an Associated Press poll released Friday.\n\nThe poll was taken in the aftermath of a mass shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 dead and reignited the national debate on gun violence.\n\nNearly seven out of 10 adults surveyed in the Associated Press-NORC poll are now in favor of stronger gun control laws, the highest measure of support in the five years the AP has asked the question.\n\nOverall, 69 percent of those polled favored stricter gun control measures, a large jump from the 55 percent who indicated support in an October 2013 poll.\n\nThe survey does show that support for gun control measures varies greatly along party lines, though at least half of those polled in both parties supported some sort of tighter gun laws.\n\nA large majority of Democrats, 90 percent, now favor tighter gun laws while only 50 percent of Republicans would favor stricter measures.\n\nNotably, 54 percent of gun owners surveyed also said they favor new restrictions.\n\nNearly six out of 10 voters favor outright banning AR-15-style rifles like as the weapon used in the Florida shooting.\n\nThe poll also showed an increase of those who believe restrictions would help prevent mass shootings with 60 percent saying measures could help, compared to 49 percent who said the same in 2016.\n\nHowever, just 51 percent of respondents believe lawmakers will actually enact legislation on the matter.\n\nA number of state legislatures have seized on the momentum for gun control to enact new laws, including Florida.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott (R) recently signed a law to increase the minimum legal age necessary to purchase rifles from 18 to 21.\n\nThe AP/NORCE Center for Public Affairs poll was conducted from March 14-19 and surveyed 1,122 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nThough you wouldn't know it from the media coverage, Democrat Conor Lamb -- the upset victor in the most recent congressional special election -- strongly supports expanding, not cutting, Social Security and Medicare. He is also a strong proponent of using the power of the federal government to lower drug prices.\n\nWith that economic message, Lamb just won in a congressional district that Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE won by nearly 20 points. For the last few election cycles, Democrats didn't even run a candidate in the district. In a futile effort to make lemonade out of lemons, Trump and Speaker Paul RyanPaul Davis RyanHouse Republicans grumble about the 'worst process ever' Winners and losers from the .3T omnibus Collins: McConnell has 'kept his commitment' on ObamaCare fix MORE (R-Wis.) claimed that Lamb ran as a Republican. But, he did not. He ran as a New Deal Democrat, proudly advocating for Social Security and Medicare and against high drug prices.\n\nLamb\n\nBauman played \"Bowzer\" in the hit television series Sha Na Na featuring a 1950s-style greaser band. Campaigning for Lamb, Bauman pointedly explained that, while he loved the music of the 1950s, he did not want to go back to the 1950s, a time when Medicare had not even been enacted and a third of seniors lived in poverty.\n\nLamb's victory speech was delivered in the middle of the night. Consequently, few people know that he astutely proclaimed, \"We found that there is public support for programs like Social Security and Medicare that is nearly universal, because these programs are universal. They are America's way of saying 'we are all in this together.'\"\n\nAs Lamb understood, as polarized as Americans are over many issues, they are nearly unanimous in their support for expanding Social Security and Medicare, and for lowering prescription drug prices. These are wedge issues for Democrats, issues where the Republican base agrees with Democrats more than with their own party's politicians.\n\nIn case anyone doubts this, new data from Public Policy Polling shows that a whopping 66 percent of the electorate are more likely to vote for candidates who support expanding Social Security. That percentage includes 56 percent of people who voted for Donald Trump, 78 percent of people who voted for Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonWhite House would like to see Biden 'in the boxing ring' in 2020 House Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents The suit to make Electoral College more 'fair' could make it worse MORE, and 58 percent of people who voted for a third-party candidate or didn't vote.\n\nThe percentage of the electorate who are more likely to vote for candidates who support expanding Medicare is a similarly whopping 64 percent. And the percentage of those more likely to support candidates who want to use the power of the federal government to lower drug prices is an eye-popping 84 percent.\n\nVirtually no one except for Republican politicians and their billionaire donors supports benefit cuts. During the 2016 presidential primary, opposition to cutting Social Security was the only issue that united supporters of Sen. Ted CruzRafael (Ted) Edward CruzConservatives balk over funding bill ahead of shutdown Confirmation fight over Trump pick exposes blurred lines in GOP-LGBT activism GOP pushes to change Senate rules for Trump MORE (R-Texas), Sen. Bernie SandersBernard (Bernie) SandersCongress to require FEC report on foreign money in elections DCCC adds first black candidates to list of top candidates Hillary Clinton's sorry apology is why she's no champion for women MORE (I-Vt.), and every candidate in between.\n\nDemocrats are poised for a blue wave at the polls this November, but it's not guaranteed. In a midterm election, where the electorate tends to trend older and more conservative, negative campaigning, even against someone as deeply immoral and unpopular as Donald Trump, only gets Democratic candidates so far. To ensure victory, Democrats should set forth a vision -- one that is broadly popular among the entire population.\n\nExpanding Social Security and Medicare, while also keeping money in people's pockets by taking on the pharmaceutical industry's greed, is not only winning politics. It is also profoundly wise policy.\n\nExpanding Social Security is a solution to a looming retirement income crisis and an eroding middle class. It is an antidote to corporate tax cuts and other policies that redistribute wealth upward.\n\nExpanding Medicare is the solution to a broken health care system which costs more, covers fewer people, and has worse outcomes than other industrialized countries.\n\nAnd exorbitant drug prices are both immoral and economically devastating, particularly to America's \"always voters\" - those approaching old age or already there.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare demonstrate the value of government. Both programs are more universal, sound, and efficient than any private sector counterparts. Federal action to lower drug prices similarly would demonstrate the value of government. Democrats advocating for these policies will not only win elections. By encouraging Republicans to vote Democratic, they can be the leading wedge in a progressive revolution.\n\nFor too many election cycles, Democrats, as well as Republicans, lamely argued for a \"bipartisan solution\" to Social Security. That meant voters, unable to differentiate between the candidates, voted on other issues.\n\nIn 2016, Democrats ran on expanding, not cutting, Social Security, but the position was neutralized by Trump's false promise to not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the media focus on emails, name-calling, and other diversions meant that the Democratic message was largely unheard.\n\nIt is a cliché to say that the upcoming election is the most important in history. But for supporters of Social Security and Medicare, this is true. Even in this election year, Republicans are announcing their plans to go after Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Indeed, Trump's budget included $1.8 trillion in cuts -- approximately the same amount as the increase in the deficit caused by their tax giveaway to wealthy donors and corporations.\n\nIf Republicans retain control of Congress, cuts to these vital programs will be hard to stop in 2019. The job of Democratic candidates must be to make sure that every single voter knows about the stark contrast between the parties on the issues of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nTrump's never-ending circus of corruption will continue to suck up most of the news coverage and a lot of public attention. But, particularly in a year when Trump himself is not on the ballot, a unified Democratic message to expand Social Security, expand Medicare and lower drug prices can break through the chaos. It is the roadmap to victory.",

A user then asked him if he'd join the boycott by deleting SpaceX's Facebook page.\n\n\"I didn't realize there was one. Will do,\" Musk wrote back.\n\nI didn't realize there was one. Will do. -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nFacebook is facing a backlash after reports last week revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a firm that worked on President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE's 2016 campaign, had obtained data on 50 million users without their knowledge.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times this week, CEO founder Mark ZuckerbergMark Elliot ZuckerbergOvernight Tech: What we learned from Zuckerberg's media blitz | Opening arguments in AT&T-Time Warner trial | Trump plans new tariffs on China Bannon swipes at Zuckerberg after Cambridge Analytica reports Overnight Finance: Stocks bleed as Trump seeks new tariffs on China | House passes .3T omnibus | Senate delay could risk shutdown | All eyes on Rand Paul | Omnibus winners and losers MORE acknowledged that the boycott shows that the company needs to rebuild trust with its users.\n\n\"I don't think we've seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it's not good,\" he told the Times. \"I think it's a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that.

John McCainJohn Sidney McCainAfghanistan is our longest war ever and Congress has abandoned all responsibility Kremlin: 'We have a long way to go' before any breakthrough with US The GOP is Trump's party now MORE (R-Ariz.), who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, is asking President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE's pick to lead the CIA about her role in an enhanced interrogation program.\n\nCIA deputy director Gina Haspel has come under fire because of her role in former President George W. Bush administration's \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" -- critics call it torture -- in the post-9/11 era, including her role in interrogations at a so-called \"black site\" prison and the destruction of videotapes documenting the waterboarding sessions of an al Qaeda suspect there.\n\nMcCain sent a letter to Haspel asking for \"clarification in writing on several matters that are essential\" to the Senate's consideration of her nomination to succeed CIA Director Mike PompeoMichael (Mike) Richard PompeoDemocrats lay into Trump's pick of Bolton for national security adviser Dem senator on Bolton hire: Trump is 'lining up his war cabinet' Trump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser MORE as the country's top spy.\n\n\"Over the course of your career with the intelligence community, you have served in positions of responsibility that have intersected with the CIA's program of so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques,'\" McCain wrote in the letter.\n\n\"We now know that these techniques not only failed to deliver actionable intelligence, but actually produced false and misleading information. Most importantly, the use of torture compromised our values, stained our national honor, and threatened our historical reputation,\" he said.\n\nMcCain detailed a slate of questions he wants Haspel to respond to by April 2, including providing a \"detailed account\" of her role in the CIA's interrogation program and her involvement at so-called black sites, or overseas prisons.\n\n\"Did you ever impose, direct, or oversee the use of 'enhanced interrogation techniques,' including the use of waterboarding?\" McCain asked.\n\nHe also wants to know if she was in a position to stop or prevent the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques,\" and what her personal views were at the time on the measures as well as what her views are currently.\n\nIn 2005, Haspel reportedly played a role in a decision to destroy videotapes documenting interrogations. The destruction of the tapes was ordered by Jose Rodriguez, then head of the agency's clandestine service -- but Haspel, at the time his chief of staff, was reportedly a strong advocate for the choice.\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the destruction of the tapes, but no charges were filed.\n\nMcCain is asking Haspel to provide details of the incident. He wants to know if she advocated the destruction of tapes, if she asked to destroy \"other material containing potential evidence of the torture,\" and if she directed anyone else to destroy tapes or other evidence.\n\nMcCain, in his letter, noted that Congress has outlawed torture. The Senate voted in 2015 to ban the U.S. from subjecting prisoners to waterboarding and other brutal interrogation practices.\n\nThe amendment, included in a mammoth defense bill, limited the entire U.S. government to the interrogation and detention techniques outlined in the Army Field Manual.\n\nMcCain's letter comes as Haspel faces a potentially tough path to confirmation for her CIA appointment.\n\nRepublicans hold a 51-seat majority in the Senate. Sen. Rand PaulRandal (Rand) Howard PaulSenate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump GOP senator threatened to hold up bill over provision to honor late political rival: report Conservatives balk over funding bill ahead of shutdown MORE (R-Ky.) has said he will oppose her, potentially leaving GOP leadership with the 50 votes to let Vice President Pence break a tie so long as the rest of the caucus supports her.\n\nMcCain has been absent from the Senate for months battling brain cancer, and his support for her nomination is not guaranteed.\n\n\"Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA's interrogation program during the confirmation process,\" he said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nNo Democrat has yet said they would support Haspel's nomination, and several progressives have come out in opposition.",

The vote: 65-32, well over the simple majority needed. Was this expected: Well, senators yesterday were bracing for a potentially long weekend because of objections from a few lawmakers. http://bit.ly/2HYS7VS\n\nAs of 8:55 a.m. -- Wait, no. DONALD! I swear to--! If you even--\"\n\nPresident Trump suggested he may veto the omnibus spending bill, which passed both chambers in Congress. This would mean: Lawmakers likely have the votes to override the veto, but there would be a government shutdown before they had time to vote. Was this expected?: No, Capitol Hill was blindsided by the announcement, with many lawmakers making plans to leave town and some attending the funeral for Rep. Louise SlaughterDorothy (Louise) Louise SlaughterHouse Republicans grumble about the 'worst process ever' House easily passes .3 trillion spending bill House poised to vote on .3T spending bill MORE (D-N.Y.). Why the veto threat: Trump cited a lack of funding for his border wall and no fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. http://bit.ly/2ue8qwb\n\nHe tweeted: \"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\" http://bit.ly/2pzfChJ\n\nREACTION -- A LITTLE REINFORCEMENT FROM SEN.

I am just down the street and will bring you a pen. The spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children under the bus. Totally irresponsible.\" http://bit.ly/2pzntf7\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE GETS INVOLVED -- DON'T MIND HIM: White House officials are confident President Trump will sign the $1.3 trillion omnibus approved by Congress despite his surprise threat via Twitter to veto the bill. How we know: \"I think we'll be OK,\" White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short told CNN. And from an administration source: \"I think he just wanted to add a little drama,\" the source told The Hill. \"Everyone here is confident he'll sign it when it arrives at the White House.\" http://bit.ly/2G4dGnq\n\nTidbit from yesterday afternoon -- Ohhhh, Sen. Paul. Don't expect too many holiday cards next year:\n\nSo this just happened.\n\nWe were asking Sen.

Paul decides we can\" -- Daniella Diaz (@DaniellaMicaela)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nWhy: McMaster, a three-star Army lieutenant general, will retire from the military. The general has been discussing his departure with Trump for some time, and both men decided to make his exit official now because the constant speculation about his job status was interfering with his duties, according to the White House.\n\nWhat to know about John Bolton: The former U.N. ambassador is a foreign policy hawk. Some think \"Bolton's bellicose approach will only encourage Trump's more aggressive foreign policy instincts.\" Five facts about Bolton: https://usat.ly/2ILG7bF\n\nWhen the change will happen: April 9.\n\nNope, wasn't curious.

Daniels's lawyer tweeted, \"If 'a picture is worth a thousand words,' how many words is this worth?????\" Yikes. http://bit.ly/2G4e6u0\n\nSpotted -- ain't no party like a bipartisan book party:\n\nThat's 'March for Our Lives' -- not to be confused with 'March for Life':\n\nThis weekend, demonstrations will be taking place all over the country to protest gun violence. What the protesters want: Increased gun control and school safety measures. The name is similar: Don't get this confused with the anti-abortion rights annual protest called \"March for Life.\" http://ti.me/2pyHanb\n\nDETAILS FOR THE MARCH:\n\nWhich cities: \"So far, according to Facebook events, there are marches being planned for Los Angeles; Chicago; Miami; Las Vegas; Springfield, Missouri; San Francisco; Dallas; New York City; Birmingham, Alabama; West Palm Beach, Florida; Boise, Idaho; Liverpool, England; and more.\" http://ti.me/2pyHanb\n\nWhen/where in Washington, D.C.: D.C.'s march will begin at noon Saturday at Pennsylvania Avenue NW and 3rd Street NW.\n\nStreet closures & where to avoid: Here's what you need to know about the Washington, D.C., rally, including what streets to avoid: http://wapo.st/2I10hx7\n\nImagine if these high school kids knew what was coming:\n\nCongress is out -- welp, for now.

To them, his decision to replace Rex TillersonRex Wayne TillersonWhite House aides planned to announce McMaster with other departures: report Trump considered ousting Kelly and serving as his own chief of staff: report Trump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser MORE with Mike PompeoMichael (Mike) Richard PompeoDemocrats lay into Trump's pick of Bolton for national security adviser Dem senator on Bolton hire: Trump is 'lining up his war cabinet' Trump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser MORE as secretary of State was a disaster, more evidence that Trump is \"unhinged,\" and \"reckless,\" and \"[insert the insult of your choice here].\" They are wrong. Worse, they are missing the more important point: Pompeo's elevation gives Trump an opportunity properly, and finally, to execute the America first foreign policy on which he campaigned.\n\nFor example, consider U.S. policy toward the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, in which the Iranian regime agreed to suspend its drive to acquire nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of Western sanctions. Though a terrible deal for the United States, it was one of the Obama administration's most sought after foreign policy goals, and it was one of the Obama policy decisions Trump most regularly and most vehemently denounced during his 2016 campaign for the presidency.\n\nThe problems with the deal are obvious. For instance, it cannot be verified because the Iranians refuse to allow international inspectors to visit some of the sites where such nuclear weapons research is suspected of being done. Further, the deal says nothing at all about stopping or even slowing down Iran's development of ballistic missile technology, without which nuclear warheads are virtually useless.\n\nTrump, on the campaign trail and since, has made clear his belief that the deal was negotiated improperly from the start, and that he would, as president, either renegotiate it with better terms or abandon it entirely. Tillerson, apparently captured by the Obama holdovers and permanent bureaucracy at the State Department, never took to President Trump's opposition to the deal. At regular intervals throughout the past year, Tillerson counseled the president not to abandon the deal.\n\nIn fact, the disagreement between the two men on this issue was so strong that last week, when discussing his decision to replace Tillerson, the only policy disagreement the president cited was their disagreement over Iran policy: \"When you look at the Iran deal, I thought it was terrible, he thought it was okay. I wanted to either break it or do something. He felt a little differently. So we were not really thinking the same.\"\n\nBy contrast, Pompeo had experience with the Iran nuclear deal going back to his service as a member of Congress, where he sat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. In that role, he flew to Vienna, Austria, in July 2015, as the Iran deal was being debated, to question firsthand officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which would be tasked with verifying some parts of the deal. He was one of the leaders of the opposition to the deal in the House, and he fought it to the bitter end.\n\nWith Pompeo moving from the CIA to the State Department, if confirmed as secretary, the president finally will have a man representing him and his views of the deal in the current international discussions over the deal's fate. It's about time. President Trump has made a good move swapping out Tillerson for Pompeo.",

                "body": "Zell Miller, a Democratic former Georgia governor and senator who often bucked his own party, died on Friday at the age of 86.\n\nBryan Miller, a grandson and the CEO of the Miller Institute Foundation, said in a statement that his grandfather died peacefully, \"surrounded by his family.\" Miller had been receiving treatment for Parkinson's disease.\n\n\"The people of Georgia have lost one of our state's finest public servants,\" Bryan Miller said.\n\n\"As his grandson, I learned more from Zell Miller both professionally and personally than from anyone else I have encountered,\" he added. \"He was more than my grandfather. He was my dear friend and mentor. I cherish all the time we spent together. I will never forget the lessons he taught me, his witty sense of humor, or his contagious smile. Our family will miss him terribly.\"\n\nMiller served as the governor of Georgia from 1991 until his retirement in 1999. Among the most notable accomplishments of his tenure was the founding of the state's lottery-funded HOPE Scholarship program.\n\nThat retirement, however, was short lived. He was appointed in 2000 to serve out the last four years of the Senate term of the late Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), who passed away that year.\n\nAs a senator, Miller often broke with his party, endorsing former President George W. Bush's re-election bid in 2004 over former Sen. John KerryJohn Forbes Kerry2020 Dems compete for top campaign operatives Kentucky candidate takes heat for tweeting he'd like to use congressman for target practice Breitbart editor: Biden's son inked deal with Chinese government days after vice president's trip MORE (D-Mass.).\n\nSpeaking at the Republican National Convention that same year, Miller offered a scathing assessment of the Democratic Party, which he decried as unsupportive of U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\"Motivated more by partisan politics than by national security, today's Democratic leaders see America as an occupier, not a liberator,\" he said.\n\nIn that speech, he also took aim at Kerry and former Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), saying that \"no pair has been more wrong, more loudly, more often than the two senators from Massachusetts.\"",

Those payments have so far totally $222,000.\n\nThe latest figure was first reported Friday by CNN.\n\nAn RNC official told the news network that Trump properties are often cheaper to rent out than other venues, and also cited security and convenience among the reasons for choosing the president's properties.\n\nThe $271,000 spent in February amounted to 86 percent of the RNC's total spending on venues and catering for the month, according to CNN. And since the beginning of 2017, 14 percent of the party's spending on such costs has gone to Trump properties.\n\nWhen he took office last year, Trump declined to liquidate his assets or place them in a blind trust. Instead, he moved to hand over day-to-day operations of his company, the Trump Organization, to his two elder sons, Donald Jr. and Eric.\n\nBut the arrangement has drawn scrutiny from ethics experts, who have raised questions about conflicts of interest and whether the president could profit from his decisions in the Oval Office.",

                "body": "Nine Iranian nationals and one Iranian entity on Friday were sanctioned by the Treasury Department and charged by the Department of Jusitice for allegedly hacking into hundreds of universities and other organizations, stealing information on behalf of Iran's government.\n\nThe individuals worked in some capacity for an Iran-based company called the Mabna Institute, which investigators say was founded in 2013 to help Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations gain access to non-Iranian scientific materials.\n\nInvestigators say the hackers targeted American and international universities, as well as the United Nations and U.S. businesses and government entities including the Department of Labor and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which holds sensitive information on U.S. electricity and natural gas systems.\n\nThe hackers allegedly breached and stole information from American universities that cost them approximately $3.4 billion to procure and maintain, Deputy Attorney General Rod RosensteinRod Jay RosensteinOutgoing lawyer says Trump approved statement calling for end to Mueller probe House Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents House Judiciary chair to subpoena for FBI documents MORE said at a press conference Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department is charging the Iranians with seven crimes, including conspiracy, computer fraud, wire fraud and identity theft.\n\nThe hackers are based in Iran, making it highly unlikely they will be extradited to the U.S. to face charges.\n\nHowever, Rosenstein said Friday that publicly identifying them will help deter nation-state hacking going forward.\n\n\"This type of public identification helps deter state-sponsored computer intrusions by stripping them of anonymity and imposing consequences,\" Rosenstein said. \"By bringing these criminal charges, we reinforce a norm that most of the civilized world accepts: Nation-states should not steal intellectual property for the purpose of giving domestic industries a competitive advantage.\"\n\nThe Mabna Institute has allegedly stolen personal information and economic resources for private financial gain, as well as contracting with the Iranian government to hack into organizations on its behalf.\n\n\"The IRGC outsourced cyber intrusions to The Mabna Institute, a hacker network that infiltrated hundreds of universities to steal sensitive data,\" Treasury under secretary Sigal Mandelker said in a statement, referring to Iranian's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, part of Tehran's military.\n\n\"We will not tolerate the theft of U.S. intellectual property, or intrusions into our research institutions and universities,\" Mandelker said. \"Treasury will continue to systematically use our sanctions authorities to shine a light on the Iranian regime's malicious cyber practices, and hold it accountable for criminal cyber-attacks.\"\n\nThe Mabna Institute hacked into computer systems belonging to 144 U.S. universities as well as 176 universities in 21 other countries, according to Treasury and the Department of Justice, which jointly announced the new sanctions on Friday.\n\nInvestigators say the hackers stole data and login credentials from the schools and gave them to the IRGC, in addition to selling the stolen information in Iran through at least two websites.\n\nThe hackers allegedly stole login credentials from university professors that was used to access online university library systems.\n\nThe other nations impacted include Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\n\nTreasury is also sanctioning another Iranian, Behzad Mesri, who was indicted last November for breaching HBO servers to steal information about unaired episodes and other sensitive company data.",

Trump complained that the legislation did not fully fund his wall on the Mexican border, and that it did nothing to help young immigrants described as dreamers who were brought to the United States illegally as children and could face deportation.\n\n\"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,\" he tweeted Friday morning.\n\nIf the president opts not to sign the bill, the government will shut down at midnight on Friday.",

It's an obligation that I have to participate,\" Pruitt told conservative talk show host Mark Reardon on KMOX Thursday.\n\nWhile in Italy, Pruitt attended a multi-day Group of 7 environmental ministers' meeting and also met with Vatican City officials. The meeting came days after President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE announced he would exit the Paris climate change agreement.\n\n\"I don't know if folks really realize this before or not, but the Vatican is like a country. It has a secretary of state. It has a head of environment,\" Pruitt said of the Vatican, which is a sovereign nation.\n\n\"This was a four-day exercise on focused efforts on the decisions that the United States had made on an international agreement that had significant impacts on this country,\" he said.\n\nPruitt has also been under fire for almost exclusively flying first class. Federal workers are usually restricted to coach class, but Pruitt said EPA security officials have preferred that he fly first for security reasons.\n\nIn the Thursday interview, Pruitt claimed that his predecessors under Obama, Gina McCarthyRegina (Gina) McCarthyOvernight Energy: EPA plans to restrict use of science data for regs | Pruitt's Italy trip cost more than K | Perry insists he's staying at Energy Cost of Pruitt's Italy trip rises above ,000 Senators question whether EPA security contract is conflict of interest MORE and Lisa Jackson, spent more, and that he only spent $100,000 on foreign trips in his first year.\n\n\"$100,000 on the trips that we're talking about, and the previous administration spent 10 times that much and there'll be any discussion about it,\" he told Reardon after the host accused the media of a \"double standard.\"\n\n\"I think your reference to a double-standard is pretty well-said,\" the EPA head said.\n\n\"The Obama EPA heads, before I arrived, spent nearly $1 million on foreign trips. I think our cost last year was a little over $100,000,\" Pruitt said later in the day to syndicated conservative talk host Lars Larson.\n\nThe EPA said Pruitt's December trip to Morocco cost around $40,000. That amounts to about $124,000 for Pruitt's first year, excluding the $36,000 military flight for the June trip to Italy.\n\nThe main focus of the Morocco trip was to promote United States liquefied natural gas exports, a responsibility that Democratic lawmakers say is not within the EPA's purview.\n\nPruitt's staff released data earlier in the week alleging that McCarthy and Jackson took multiple, five-figure trips to foreign countries.\n\nMcCarthy took 10 foreign trips at an average cost of about $63,000 each, while Jackon's four trips from 2011 to 2013 averaged about $83,000, both less than the $120,000 Italy trip. Jackson was in office from 2009 to 2013, but the EPA only has records stretching back to 2011.\n\nJackson's costliest trip was a $155,764 jaunt to China, which included visits to three major cities there.\n\nLiz Purchia, who was an EPA spokeswoman during McCarthy's tenure, questioned the accounting by Pruitt's staff of McCarthy's and Jackson's trips, saying it is impossible to validate and security detail costs were only included sometimes.\n\n\"And it's important to point out why he's traveling versus the purpose of the trips that Jackson and McCarthy took. He and his detail have been flying first class to promote an agenda that isn't part of EPA's mission, like his Morocco trip,\" she said.",

And the New York Times' Maggie Haberman reported Thursday that Trump spent a significant amount of time deriding Bolton for the mustache.\n\nTrump spent more time deriding Bolton's mustache in the transition than focusing on why he didn't want him as nsa. Kelly was said by multiple sources to have played role in souring Trump on Kelly - Kelly had a bigger problem with him than Trump did. -- Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nBolton joked after the initial reports that he \"appreciated the grooming advice\" but said he would not be shaving his mustache.\n\nBut before appointing Bolton to take the place of outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster on Thursday, the signature facial hair gave Trump pause, according to The New York Times.\n\nA White House aide told CNN on Thursday that Trump was able to look past the facial hair in order to name him as McMaster's replacement.\n\nBolton will be Trump's third national security adviser, replacing the three-star Army general who never clicked with the president behind the scenes.",

                "body": "The acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dropped the agency's probe of a payday loan collector and is mulling ending cases against three high-interest lenders, Reuters reported Friday.\n\nActing CFPB Director Mick MulvaneyJohn (Mick) Michael MulvaneyOvernight Regulation: Omnibus includes deal on tip-pooling rule | Groups sue over rules for organic livestock | AT&T, DOJ make opening arguments in merger trial Warren presses Mulvaney, Azar on tip pooling House easily passes .3 trillion spending bill MORE decided against suing Kansas-based National Credit Adjusters (NCA), a company that collects debt from high-interest loans issued on tribal land, according to Reuters.\n\nFormer CFPB director Richard CordrayRichard Adams CordrayBipartisan House bill would replace consumer director with panel Mulvaney unsure of when he will leave consumer bureau Giving the middle class credit: New bill a step in right direction MORE was reportedly set to sue NCA, but Mulvaney dropped the case, Reuters reported.\n\nReuters also reported that Mulvaney was considering ending the CFPB's probes into Security Finance, Cash Express LLC and Triton Management Group, three lenders of high-interest, short-term \"payday\" loans.\n\nThe CFPB under Cordray found that the three lenders and their debt collectors pressured, mislead and harrassed consumers into dangerous cycles of debt, Reuters reported. Cordray reportedly planned to seek millions of dollars in damages and fines.\n\nMulvaney's decision to drop the NCA case and potential end three others is the latest way that the staunchly conservative acting director is pulling back on the CFPB's policing of financial markets.\n\nThe bureau's acting chief, who is also the White House budget director, has pledged to end the CFPB's track record of aggressively fining and regulating lenders they've deemed to have abused consumers. Mulvaney said the CFPB under his watch would use far more restraint and show more deference to the needs of businesses.\n\nCracking down on payday lenders was one of Cordray's top priorities at the CFPB. The bureau released a rule shortly before Cordray resigned last November meant to protect consumers from cyclical debt from repeatedly taking out payday loans. Lawmakers have introduced a resolution to repeal the CFPB rule, though it has not received action on the House floor.\n\nThe CFPB announced in January that it would delay compliance with new regulatory rules for payday loans. The agency said it is considering how to roll back those rules. Mulvaney will allow lenders subject to the payday measure to ask for a delay in complying with the first deadline.\n\nLenders covered by the rule must register with the CFPB by April 16, while the rest of the rule kicks in on August 19, 2019. The bureau delayed the April deadline in order to prevent covered lenders from spending time and money to comply with the rule that could be drastically different by 2019.\n\nDemocrats and liberal allies of the former CFPB regime have fumed over Mulvaney's stance on payday loans, which they say threatens consumers and lets bad actors run free.\n\n\"Let's see the case be made, with full debate, on whether the zealots and toadies can justify repealing a rule to protect consumers against extortionate payday loans,\" Cordray said in January.\n\nRepublicans and the financial services industry have praised the acting CFPB chief for easing off of lenders they say were strangled by the bureau's former leadership.",

The fight America needs,\" a narrator says in a parody boxing match promotion clip aired on ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" \"Two Washington heavyweights: Crazy Joe Biden, Donald 'The Grabber' Trump. White House. Fight House. POTUS vs. Joetus.\"\n\n\"They really should do that,\" Kimmel said after the clip. \"I mean, all proceeds to charity. Whoever wins gets to be president.\"\n\nThe segment came after Trump and Biden this week floated the notion of physically fighting one another.\n\nThe first challenge came from Biden, who said at a Tuesday rally in Miami that he would have beat Trump up over his comments about women if the two men had been in high school together.\n\n\"If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him,\" Biden said, after referencing Trump's infamous \"Access Hollywood\" comments, in which the real estate mogul said his celebrity status allowed him to grope women without their permission.\n\nTrump responded in kind on Thursday, saying that Biden was \"mentally and physically\" weak, and that he would \"go down fast and hard.\"",

                "body": "The teenage girl shot in a Maryland school attack earlier this week has died, police said Friday.\n\nSixteen-year-old Jaelynn Willey was taken off life support at 11:34 p.m. on Thursday at the University of Maryland Prince George's Hospital Center, according to The Associated Press. Jaelynn's mother previously told reporters that there was \"no life left in her.\"\n\nWilley suffered a bullet wound in the head on Tuesday when 17-year-old Austin Rollins began firing on students at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County. Rollins and Willey had reportedly just ended a relationship.\n\nRollins died at the scene on Tuesday when a school resource officer took action and fired a shot, though it remains unclear whether the assailant died at the officer's hand or by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nDesmond Barnes, a 14-year old student at the high school, also suffered a gunshot in the thigh but was treated at a hospital and released on Wednesday.\n\nThe deadly shooting took place just one month after a mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida high school that has reinvigorated the debate about gun control.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nAmericans expect that their elected officials are committed to protecting their tax dollars. Wait, no they don't. Americans used to believe that. But the sad reality is, there are very few Americans who think politicians uphold their fiscal responsibilities. And that's a shame because Congress recently took a very important step toward restoring sanity to the budget process.\n\nThe creation of a Joint Committee to make recommendations on how to fix Washington's busted budget process, on its face, means little to the American public. But the fact that Congress is ready to do something about its budget should be big news. Government shut-downs and legislative duct tape have become de rigueur for lawmakers, but the disruption and anxiety to federal workers - including congressional staffers - as well as seniors, the military and others is getting old. Americans are fed up with Congress not performing its basic job functions.\n\nSince 2016, the Congressional Institute has been commissioning research to look at the growing dissatisfaction that middle-class voters have with Congress. What we've found is that, year after year, voters feel more and more strongly that their elected representatives are tuning them out. Research that we've posted on our website shows that almost 60 percent of voters don't think that Washington hears them and just 29 percent believe that lawmakers are paying attention. Among the top concerns of survey participants were how Congress spends tax dollars and Congress not fulfilling its constitutional duties.\n\nBoth of those concerns can be alleviated through the Joint Committee. To understand why, it's important to understand how this committee differs from the 2011 Supercommittee, which was charged with cutting $1.5 trillion in spending over a decade. That's a very specific and very big goal. The Supercommittee failed because lawmakers couldn't agree on how to cut spending or reform the nation's fiscal policy. While's there no guarantee of success for the Joint Committee, it is charged with fixing the budget process, which is an internal congressional function that shouldn't be partisan or politically motivated. In fact, the motivation for the eight members of the Joint Committee should be to restore good governance and legislative sanity.\n\nThat sounds like a lofty ideal, but the Joint Committee doesn't have to entirely rewrite the Budget Act of 1974 to be successful. The committee has until Nov. 30, 2018, to draft recommendations and present them to Congress so they're working on a short timeline. There's also little appetite - as always - during an election year for sweeping legislation. That's why it's important that we have reasonable expectations.\n\nTwo significant changes Joint Committee members could look at are moving to a two-year budget process and changing the start of the fiscal year to Jan. 1. A two-year budget would give authorizing committees and Executive Branch agencies and departments greater certainty about funding levels. It also will let Congress exercise more effective oversight.\n\nOver the last four decades, continuing resolutions and omnibuses have dominated the budget process leading White Houses to negotiate with congressional leadership. So if the White House can wait and hash things out with leaders, it has no incentive to work with authorizing committees, which have the ability to hold the Executive Branch accountable.\n\nMoving the start of the fiscal year from Oct. 1 to Jan. 1 makes good common sense, but it also make good fiscal sense. Passing spending bills on time is the one action required in the Constitution as Congress' responsibility. It's one thing to say that Congress needs to reclaim the power of the purse; it's a whole other matter to do it. Moving the beginning of the fiscal year to Jan. 1 gives Congress more time to do its work. It also puts some distance between needing to wrap up spending bills and November elections, which can derail even the most well-intentioned bills.\n\nBudget reform is complicated. It has significant repercussions for nearly every aspect of governing. A bipartisan, bicameral Joint Committee is the mechanism through which almost all major congressional reforms have been accomplished for the last 80 years. Given Americans' attitude toward Washington, November's election could tip the balance of power in Congress. That should be more of an incentive for both parties to work together on some common-sense budget reforms that will get us away from the stop-gap measures required to compensate for missed deadlines. After all, today the majority, tomorrow the minority; a functioning and efficient budget process will benefit both parties no matter who holds the Speaker's gavel.",

                "body": "The woman behind a series of videos pushing a conspiracy theory about Broward County, Fla. Sheriff Scott Israel has admitted that the content of the videos is false, and that she was paid to make the claims.\n\nIsrael was thrust into the national spotlight after the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Since then, a number of conspiracy theories have emerged around the shooting, and Israel has found himself swept up in many of them.\n\nIn three old YouTube videos, the woman, whose identity remains anonymous, claimed that Israel impregnated her when she was 17 years old and made her get an abortion.\n\nBut the woman and her attorney acknowledged to Politico that the claims were false.\n\n\"I was paid to say these things. I didn't even know what I was saying,\" the woman told Politico. \"I'm sorry ... It's fake.\"\n\nThe woman, who now lives in New York, said she was paid $25 per video in 2012, when Israel beat out the Republican incumbent for the sheriff's office. She said she was 17 at the time, and did the videos through Fiverr, a freelancing website where she was paid to record testimonials for various products, according to Politico.\n\nThe woman was reportedly taken aback when told that the videos about Israel have been used to push conspiracy theories about the sheriff in the wake of the Parkland shooting.\n\nBoth the woman and Israel have sought to have YouTube take the videos down, but those requests have been refused, Politico reported.\n\n\"Now that these bogus, fake videos have been debunked we would ask that YouTube comply with our previous request (going back to 2012) and take them down!\" Amy Rose, Israel's campaign manager, said in a statement to Politico.\n\n\"It's too bad that the young woman who was paid to repeat these lies can't identify the person who paid her to do so.\"",

                "body": "Roseanne Barr says Americans shouldn't rely on the president, because it's \"up to the people\" to make the government work.\n\n\"Here's my two cents, dammit, it's up to us to make this government work, no matter who's president,\" the \"Roseanne\" star told host Jimmy Kimmel on a Thursday appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\n\n\"It's up to us to do our jobs as citizens,\" continued the 65-year-old comedian -- who made a 2012 White House bid as the Peace and Freedom Party's nominee. \"If we don't like something, you know, let them know you don't like it and then you've got another election in two years, get out there and vote.\"\n\n\"Change it if you don't like it,\" Barr added.\n\nOn her rebooted ABC sitcom, Barr plays a grandmother who voted for President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE, which causes some political clashes with her family. In real life, Barr has voiced support for Trump as well, saying ahead of the 2016 election, \"I think we would be so lucky if Trump won.\"\n\n\"I'm shocked because you were a very liberal, socially liberal person in general,\" Kimmel told Barr during her late-night sitdown.\n\n\"I'm still the same, you all moved. You all went so f---ing far out you lost everybody,\" Barr exclaimed.\n\n\"A lot of us, you know, no matter who we voted for, we don't want to see our president fail,\" Barr said.\n\n\"Because we don't want [Vice President] Pence,\" she added.\n\n\"Are you f---ing me? You want Pence? You want Pence for the fricking president?\" Barr asked Kimmel, in mock disbelief.",

                "body": "More hate crimes with racial or ethnic bias were reported on Nov. 9 than any other day in 2016 and remained elevated for the next 10 days.\n\nOne such hate crime was an alleged plot by three white men to bomb a Kansas mosque for Somali Muslim refugees the day after the election.\n\nTheir trial began on Thursday, the Post reported.\n\nDefense attorney Jim Pratt said his client Patrick Stein was influenced by the charged language during the campaign and referred to Muslims as \"cockroaches.\"\n\nStein was recorded by an FBI informant saying, \"The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim,\" and \"If you're a Muslim, I'm going to enjoy shooting you in the head.\"\n\nHate crimes have typically spiked during election years since the early 1990s, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.\n\nWhen former President Barack ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaJudge orders Walker to hold special elections Mueller investigates, Peters quits Fox, White House leaks abound 2020 Dems compete for top campaign operatives MORE was first elected in 2008, there was a 21 percent spike in reported hate crimes the next day.\n\nIt's unclear why election years bring the sudden increase, the Post reported. It could be from people feeling frustrated or energized by election results or victims feeling emboldened to come forward with the underreported crimes.\n\nThe FBI has been collecting data on hate crimes since Congress passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act in 1990 to collect information about crimes based on race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.",

Marco RubioMarco Antonio RubioTrump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser Orlando March for Our Lives protesters to march to Rubio's downtown office, Pulse nightclub Lawmakers eye crackdown on China's Confucius Institutes MORE (R-Fla.) credited the survivors of the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. with doing more to tackle gun violence in five weeks \"than has been done in 15 years.\"\n\n\"They've done more in five weeks on gun violence than has been done in 15 years,\" Rubio told the Guardian. \"The parents have come together, all 17, even though they don't always agree. They aren't out there saying, 'Don't vote for anything unless we have everything'.\"\n\nBut Rubio also cautioned against setting \"unrealistic expectations\" for bipartisan compromise on new gun control legislation, and warned that partisan politics could ultimately stall efforts to tackle gun violence.\n\n\"The attitude of total victory - the idea that somehow some of us are going to come up here and get everything we want and just run over the other side - our system is just not set up for that,\" he said.\n\n\"We're creating unrealistic expectations and, in the process, nothing happens,\" he added.\n\nRubio also rejected the idea of a ban on assault weapons, telling the Guardian that such a prohibition would not be effective.\n\nThe shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14 left 17 people dead and 14 others injured. But it reignited an intense national debate over gun laws, with students at the school emerging as some of the most vocal proponents for tightening firearms restrictions.\n\nRubio has faced scrutiny from many of those students, who have taken particular aim at the National Rifle Association's contributions to his political campaigns.\n\nHis comments to the Guardian came a day before the March for Our Lives, a series of student protests calling for action on gun violence. Those demonstrations are set to take place Saturday, with the epicenter being in Washington.",

McMaster, has praised the U.S. involvement in Iraq and suggested a preemptive strike against North Korea. He will take over the job on April 9.\n\nBolton's appointment is a \"fitting coda for a movement whose adherents spent decades throwing themselves on an endless array of ideological barricades,\" Scarborough wrote, adding that the move \"will not disappoint these same GOP militants whom Kirk battled until his death in 1994.\"\n\nThe administration's latest hires are \"the predictable outcome of my Republican party aligning its interests with the most cynical political operators of our time,\" the \"Morning Joe\" host said, citing the GOP's embrace of a wealthy donor class and partisan attacks in a contentious media environment.\n\nTrump's latest appointment comes after months of turmoil in the administration, as Trump has ousted multiple top officials, including Secretary of State Rex TillersonRex Wayne TillersonWhite House aides planned to announce McMaster with other departures: report Trump considered ousting Kelly and serving as his own chief of staff: report Trump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser MORE.\n\nBolton -- Trump's third national security adviser -- may take a markedly different approach to key issues, such as the Iran nuclear deal supported by both Tillerson and McMaster.",

                "body": "Former CIA director David Petraeus on Thursday praised the woman up for his previous role as \"a very capable\" leader but acknowledged that she was involved in now illegal interrogation methods.\n\n\"She's very capable, very bright, very personable, very good leader, all kinds of superlatives there,\" Petraeus said of Gina Haspel at a Veterans in Global Leadership event in Washington.\n\n\"She was a station chief in an undisclosed location when I was the director. Very highly regarded, but as you know, obviously, she's associated with some activities that now, to put a point on it, are illegal.\"\n\nPresident Trump last week fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, announcing that he'd seek to replace him with current CIA director Mike Pompeo and would replace Pompeo at the CIA with current deputy director Haspel.\n\nHaspel has already received pushback from Congress over her role surrounding waterboarding and other interrogation techniques used on detainees at a secret CIA prison in Thailand in 2002.\n\nPetraeus said he expects Haspel will address at the beginning of her nomination hearing questions surrounding her involvement in interrogation techniques and her carrying out of an order to cover up torture crimes by destroying videotape evidence.\n\n\"My sense is an understanding that she is going to explain in her opening statement she gets it that this is now illegal and she would therefore never countenance it, and explain perhaps the context at the time,\" he said.\n\nPetraeus maintains that he does not support enhanced interrogation techniques and did not before they became illegal, but notes that \"in the post 9/11 period, there was a sense of a ticking time bomb that people do need to remember,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked if Haspel's involvement in now illegal activities should bar her from top positions including CIA director, Petraeus deferred.\n\n\"She's going to have to explain what the context was. She's going to have to explain what her actions were. She'll have to explain why it was that she took certain actions, including the tapes that were destroyed later on,\" he said.\n\nThe effectiveness of Haspel's explanation, he said, will decide whether she sees an easy path to confirmation.\n\n\"But clearly there are already some who have come out against that so it's going to be an interesting endeavor,\" he added.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), an outspoken critic of enhanced interrogation techniques, last week condemned Trump's decision to nominate Haspel, arguing she was involved in \"one of darkest chapters in American history.\"",

                "title": "John Bolton will put America first after years of failed Obama policy",
                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nThe president likes former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. They may not agree on every issue of strategic importance, especially the question of America's role in \"regime change\" internationally, but they are kindred spirits in their love of our republic and their commitment to sacrificing the sacred cows of the establishment's conventional \"wisdoms.\"\n\nAs a result, Thursday's decision by President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE to replace his national security adviser, Gen. H.R. McMaster, with Ambassador Bolton -- coming so soon after the decision to move another outspoken fighter, CIA Director Mike PompeoMichael (Mike) Richard PompeoDemocrats lay into Trump's pick of Bolton for national security adviser Dem senator on Bolton hire: Trump is 'lining up his war cabinet' Trump replaces McMaster with Bolton as national security adviser MORE, to head up the Department of State -- will solidify the international and national-security gains of the last 14 months. It will provide an incredibly strong platform for the next seven years of \"America first\" foreign policy.\n\nAs I write this, I am fully aware that designers in \"mainstream\" newsrooms are already updating their screen graphics of White House employees who have left the administration to now include a headshot of Gen. McMaster. Reporters and editors are working on yet another batch of \"revolving-door,\" \"chaos in the White House\" pieces that have, at this point, become so run-of-the-mill. Yet, for all their feverish activity, they will miss the point. Again.\n\nDonald Trump and his White House are not about process. They are about results. And this is something the good general failed to understand. Especially when it came to our policy in Afghanistan, a topic on which the current national security adviser held no less than six principals meetings, each time trying to convince the commander in chief that a large-footprint presence was required in that benighted nation -- until, that is, President Trump pointed out to Gen. McMaster that he was not elected to continue the broken nation-building policies of the post-9/11 years. This commander in chief can stand -- actually encourages -- disagreement among the ranks, but only if it is based on common sense and the realities of his mandate.\n\nAlready one can hear the voices of those who think Bolton's public statements on Iraq and, more recently, North Korea will bring him into instant conflict with his new boss. Not so. For as the ambassador made clear in a rather lengthy Fox News interview given just minutes after the president posted his tweet announcing the personnel change, the ambassador has fully internalized that which McMaster never did.\n\nQuoting legendary Secretary of State Dean Acheson's response to the question of why he and President Truman had such a good relationship, Acheson replied that the answer was easy: \"Neither the president or I ever forgot who is president.\"\n\nThe fact that this was the quote the NSA-designee highlighted, in his very first interview after the announcement, speaks greatly to just how much Bolton \"gets\" what his new job is. That is not to say that Bolton will be a \"yes man.\" Anyone who knows the ambassador knows how unlikely a scenario that would be. Just one Bolton speech of yesteryear makes that abundantly clear. He is not, and never was, a shrinking violet.\n\nIn sum, John Bolton will be an outspoken adviser to the president, one who sees America's interests as paramount, but one who understands that it was Donald Trump who was chosen to be president and, to quote his Fox interview: \"He's a different kind of president but that's what the people voted for.\"\n\nIndeed they did. The \"Make America Great Again\" platform was more of an effective rallying cry after the Obama-era institutionalization of an \"America last\" stance. In the past year, however, thanks to the results-oriented drive of President Trump, MAGA has been filled with tangible content in a range of achievement, spanning the stupendous economic turnaround already achieved to the crushing of the \"caliphate\" of ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nWith new team members such as Secretary of State-designee Pompeo and National Security Adviser Bolton, MAGA has a real chance to graduate from a results-based mission to an \"America first\" doctrine for the Trump era and beyond. Until that shape of the new \"Trump doctrine\" is fleshed out, all we can say with certitude today is that the \"Never Trumpers\" of the \"swamp,\" former KGB colonels in Moscow, politburo members in Pyongyang and Beijing, and the mullahs of Iran are a tad more uneasy today than they were yesterday.\n\nAnd for many Americans like myself, that is a decidedly good thing.",

Candy then pushed the secretary to redecorate the office's dining room, citing concerns over unstable chairs and exposed nails on the furniture.\n\n\"The next thing that I quite frankly heard about it was this $31,000 table had been bought. I said 'what the heck is this all about?' \" Carson said. \"I investigated and I immediately had it canceled,\" the secretary explained to the House panel.\n\nThe purchase also exceeded the $5,000 legal limit above which congressional approval is required for purchases.",

Doug Jones won his special election Senate race against Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct with underage girls.\n\nAn overwhelming majority - 98 percent - of black women took to the polls to ensure Jones' victory.\n\nOther have said the Me Too movement has empowered them to enter politics, making sure women are a part of the policy-making process to fight against sexual harassment and assault, said Rep.

The group focuses on helping African American candidates in local and state races.\n\n\"You have a president who attacks black women,\" James told NBC News. \"They're fed up, we're fed up, and ... it's crucial we have more voices on the public stage to fight back.\"\n\nTrump often feuds with Democratic congresswomen Maxine WatersMaxine Moore WatersTrump keeps up 'low IQ' attack on Maxine Waters Flynn endorses Maxine Waters challenger Flynn to make first public appearance since pleading guilty MORE (Calif.) and Frederica WilsonFrederica Patricia WilsonFlorida Democrat: '80 percent' of the US agrees with students on gun control Maxine Waters calls for Kelly to resign over handling of Rob Porter allegations House Dems call for first Education Committee hearing on school shootings since Sandy Hook MORE (Fla.).\n\nTrump has recently gone after Waters, and accused her of having \"a low IQ.\"\n\n\"This place that was so resistant to change, where, now, a group of women who were looked down upon and dealt first-hand with the vestiges of slavery and segregation are the ones who can lead us forward -- it's monumental,\" James said.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nIf you have ever watched Russia Today (or RT as it's better known), it probably didn't take long to realize the TV network has a decidedly pro-Russia stance. And, if you've never seen RT just trust the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's assessment that it \"conducts strategic messaging for the Russian government,\" and played an important role in Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. But, what should be done about RT?\n\nTo many, the answer was simple: RT should be forced to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). And they did. Yet, this has done little to solve the problem of RT. In fact, it has arguably made the problem worse by setting a precedent for the U.S. stifling press freedom, leading to retaliatory actions against Western media abroad, and providing American viewers with little awareness of the Russian governments' control of RT.\n\nTo understand why FCC reforms are a vital solution to counter foreign propaganda on TV, it's important to understand just how inadequate the current U.S. response has been to RT's role in Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nWhile RTTV and their operating company, T&R Productions, registered as foreign agents, this provided much more paperwork than transparency. Sure, we learned that Mikhail Solodovnikov is the general manager of T&R and is paid a hearty $670,000 salary and we got to see hundreds of pages of contracts from RTTV and T&R Productions. But these FARA filings did little to solve the real problem with RT -- letting viewers know RT is Russian government propaganda.\n\nThe registration did lead to Russian government retaliation via a law requiring any media outlet in Russia receiving foreign funding to register as a foreign agent. Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, said the Russians' intentions were clear as \"this legislation is tailor-made to be selectively and politically enforced, and to silence voices they do not want Russian people to hear.\"\n\nTo be sure, the Russian retaliation against RT's FARA registration appears to go far beyond what is required of FARA registrants and RT shouldn't have felt singled-out for registering under FARA as they were simply joining the ranks of Chinese, Japanese, and South Korean media outlets that have been registered under FARA for decades. But, then every Russian accusation that this was an infringement on press freedom was confirmed when RT was stripped of its congressional press credentials. These credentials grant media outlets significantly more access to Congress, including access to the press galleries of the House and Senate floors. In other words, revoking RT's congressional press credentials explicitly impeded freedom of the press.\n\nThis will serve as a pretext for autocratic regimes looking to crackdown on press freedom abroad. According to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) FARA has already been used to justify measures that restrict civil society in a number of foreign countries, including Hungary, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Ukraine. The language of these laws does differ from FARA, but if these, or any other, countries so choose they can adopt the exact language used to deny RT's congressional news credentials to deny press freedoms in their country.\n\nFortunately, Moulton and Stefanik's Countering Foreign Propaganda Act provides the best solution to the problem of RT and other foreign propaganda TV in the U.S. Their proposal ensures that American viewers of foreign government controlled TV are made abundantly aware of who is funding what they're watching, while not denying the networks' press freedom, thus reducing the possibility of retaliation on Western media abroad.\n\nTheir bill doesn't require journalists working for foreign media to register as \"foreign agents,\" but it does require that foreign media networks let viewers know, at least once an hour, if they are funded and under the editorial control of a foreign government.\n\nThe bill fights foreign interference in American democracy while not losing sight of what makes that democracy great. It is essential legislation for defending the 2018 election, and future elections, from undue foreign influence.",

                "body": "\"I've been very reluctant to talk about impeachment until we have all the information coming in from the investigation. But that would be a major, major, major obstruction of justice. That would be an impeachable offense in my view,\" Sanders said in an interview for The Intercept's newly launched podcast \"Deconstructed\" released Friday.\n\nSanders joins several other senators from both parties who have warned Trump against dismissing the special counsel. Sen. Lindsey GrahamLindsey Olin GrahamSenators introduced revised version of election cyber bill GOP senators push tougher sentencing for synthetic opioid Dems aim to turn ObamaCare hikes into election weapon MORE (R-S.C.) said on Tuesday that firing Mueller would \"probably\" be an impeachable offense, while Sen. Jeff FlakeJeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeOvernight Health Care: House passes .3T omnibus | Bill boosts funds for NIH, opioid treatment | Senators spar over ObamaCare fix | 'Right to Try' bill heads to the Senate The Hill's 12:30 Report Booker admits defeat in Capitol snowball fight with Flake MORE (R-Ariz.) has also indicated he would support impeaching Trump if Mueller was fired \"without cause.\"\n\nTrump has long voiced frustration with the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential race, a probe that has also looked at whether Trump tried to obstruct the investigation.\n\nBut speculation that the president could move to oust Mueller has grown in recent days. He voiced his ire at the special counsel's investigation on Twitter earlier this week, questioning the fairness of the probe and mentioning Mueller by name, something he had previously resisted.\n\nHe also indirectly criticized Mueller in another tweet on Wednesday, in which he quoted lawyer Alan Dershowitz, suggesting that a special counsel should never have been appointed in the first place.",

Bush administration.\n\nThe president on Thursday announced the appointment in a tweet, noting that current National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster would be replaced on April 9.\n\nMeacham said that the move \"raises the stakes for military action\" worldwide due to Bolton's \"long record of talking about using American power.\"\n\n\"I think it raises the stakes for military action around the world. I don't think there's any doubt about that,\" Meacham said. \"You have to take people seriously, you take them at their word, and as you say, Bolton has a long record of talking about using American power.\"\n\n\"One of the things that's really interesting if you go back only ten years or so is you had a series of hawks in the -- particularly in the second Bush term, George W. Bush term, who wanted to exert power even farther beyond Afghanistan and Iraq,\" he continued. \"And it was George W. Bush, Condi Rice, who didn't want to do it. It was people like Bolton who did.

                "body": "The classified advertising website Craigslist has shut down its personals sections, after Congress passed a measure intended to crack down on online sex trafficking.\n\nIn a statement posted on its website on Friday, Craigslist said that it could not risk being held liable for postings made by users that may advertise sex or potentially illegal interactions.\n\n\"US Congress just passed HR 1865, 'FOSTA', seeking to subject websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties (users) misuse online personals unlawfully,\" the statement reads, using an acronym for the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act.\n\n\"Any tool or service can be misused,\" it continues. \"We can't take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day.\"\n\nThe measure, passed by both chambers of Congress, amends a longstanding provision absolving online platforms of liability for content posted by their users, making it easier to target websites with legal action for enabling prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nThe Senate passed the measure on Wednesday, while the House approved it last month. President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE is expected to sign it.\n\nAdvocates for the legislation argue that it will help to curb the growing online sex trafficking industry. Opponents, especially in the tech industry, have argued that it amounts to a form of censorship and could make online companies vulnerable to lawsuits.",

                "body": "A report by the National Labor Relations Board's inspector general found that a Republican board member violated an ethics pledge by weighing in on a case involving his former law firm.\n\nThe report, obtained by Bloomberg Law, found that the board member William Emanuel previously told lawmakers that he may need to remove himself from the case, Browning-Ferris Industries.\n\nBut Emanuel reportedly told the NLRB's inspector general that he didn't realize that his former law firm, Littler Mendelson, was representing one of the businesses in the case, according to Bloomberg Law.\n\nThe case hinged on whether BFI, a recycling plant owner, was the joint employer of workers provided by a staffing agency, called Leadpoint Business Services. Littler Mendelson was representing Leadpoint in the case.\n\nAn ethics pledge signed by Emanuel stated that he would sit out from any cases, in which his former employer or clients played a substantial role.\n\nEmanuel said in an interview with Berry, however, that the company represented in the case by his Littler Mendelson had stopped filing legal documents and was no longer a central player in the case.\n\nStill, the inspector general, David Berry, said in the report that there was not sufficient evidence to show that Emanuel \"intentionally lied\" by making the conflicting statements, and that the board member's reaction to being told of Littler Mendelson's role in the case suggested a \"genuine lack of recall.\"\n\nBerry's report also said that Emanuel's statements in his interview \"lack a level of credibility,\" according to Bloomberg Law.",

                "body": "A Florida GOP gubernatorial candidate has dropped in the polls after siding with the National Rifle Association (NRA) on a new state law raising the age of purchasing a gun to 21.\n\nAdam Putnam has said he opposes new gun laws and has made appearances on NRA TV to urge members of the organization to fight back against those fighting for gun control in the wake of a deadly shooting last month at a Parkland, Fla., high school.\n\n\"It's more important now than ever for second amendment advocates and gun owners to step forward and roll up their sleeves and be involved in the process,\" Putnam said.\n\nRepublican consultants told ABC7 that his stance on the issue may hurt his chances of winning the Republican Primary.\n\nPolls showed Putnam with an early lead in the race for the GOP nomination but that lead has disappeared and he is slightly behind his Republican challenger, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantisRonald Dion DeSantisDCCC adds first black candidates to list of top candidates Lawmakers demand explanation from United over pet deaths Dems: Uranium One informant provided 'no evidence' of Clinton 'quid pro quo' MORE.\n\nDeSantis now has a slim two-point lead over Putnam, who is the state's agriculture commissioner.\n\nSome consultant say the shift in the polls may be in part to Putnam's collaboration with the NRA, who is suing after current Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed a bill into law raising the minimum age limit to buy a gun to 21.\n\nYoung, liberal students told ABC7 they thought Putnam's comments supporting the NRA could be \"political suicide.\"",

We never made any agreement, and the project never went anywhere. I never contacted any U.S. officials on behalf of Chadbourne or its clients and never had any contact with Chadbourne's clients.\"\n\nBroidy sent the proposal after Baev requested his help, according to Bloomberg. The episode illustrates how Russians seeking to evade U.S. sanctions sought the help of Trump's political allies.",

McMaster on Thursday, saying he served the country well under exceedingly difficult circumstances.\n\nPetraeus praised the Army lieutenant general shortly after news broke Thursday that President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE had ousted McMaster in favor of former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton.\n\n\"I think he served the country very, very well in a very challenging and difficult job at the best of times, and arguably particularly challenging over the course of the last year or so,\" Petraeus told attendees at a Veterans in Global Leadership event in Washington.\n\nPetraeus described McMaster as \"someone who is not one to leave something left unsaid,\" adding that \"I think very, very highly of him.\"\n\n\"I want people to be willing to cross swords. I wanted people who would not hold something back if they felt deeply. Not everyone is in that camp, obviously,\" Petraeus said.\n\nMcMaster worked under Petraeus multiple times while both were in the Army, and Petraeus in 2008 sat on the board for his mentee's promotion to a one-star major general.\n\nTrump wrote on Twitter that Bolton, a former Bush administration official, will take over for McMaster on April 9.\n\nA White House official said McMaster had been discussing his departure with Trump for some time.\n\n\"After thirty-four years of service to our nation, I am requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer after which I will leave public service,\" McMaster said in a statement from the White House.\n\n\"Throughout my career it has been my greatest privilege to serve alongside extraordinary servicemembers and dedicated civilians.\"",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion went into effect, Esperanza Lopez was able to access affordable health care for the first time in her life. At the time, Lopez was 51 years old and legally blind, having lost her eyesight to diabetes in her 40s after being unable to afford a doctor. She also had a foot infection which was spreading to her bone-- and if the Medicaid expansion had come any later, she would have required amputation.\n\nOn Lopez's first visit to our clinic in 2012, we enrolled her in Medicaid in order to give her free diabetes medication to bring her blood sugar levels under control. We also set her up with a podiatrist who provided wound care and treated her with antibiotics, and referred her to a surgeon to try to restore her sight.\n\nToday, Lopez can see again, her foot has been saved, and she is back to working full time at a garment factory. Her story is incredible, and the hero is obvious-- none of this would have been possible without the expansion of Medicaid.\n\nRight now, around 40 percent of undocumented people remain uninsured in California-- despite the fact that undocumented immigrants contribute around $11.74 billion annually in taxes, helping fund vital health programs such as Medicaid. In order to continue protecting and empowering our most vulnerable neighbors, it's now more critical than ever for California to send a strong message about our values and priorities by enacting universal health coverage.\n\nIt's clear that health care is a major concern for people across the country. Democrat Conor Lamb unexpectedly won Pennsylvania's recent special election, in large part due to his pro-ACA stance in a race where health care was a top issue for 52 percent of voters. Health care has consistently made it into the top four issues facing our country right now, with the majority of Americans continuing to believe that the federal government should ensure health care coverage for all.\n\nThe numbers in support of universal coverage are even higher in California, with two-thirds of Californians expressing support for the idea. Universal health coverage would mean expanding Medi-Cal to undocumented adults, as well as increasing subsidies for low to middle income families and individuals purchasing insurance through the Covered California exchange. Through a basic expansion of Medi-Cal, every single Californian would have the opportunity to become covered. California now has the unique opportunity to act as a model for the nation, showing other states what is possible when we truly come together to protect the wellbeing of our people.\n\nWhile universal health care legislation has recently been introduced into California's state legislature, it must pass through committee and both houses of the legislature before being signed into law by the governor. In some of my recent meetings with legislative leadership, I was assured that both houses of the legislature could work together to produce a universal coverage package. But what the past year has shown is that when citizens stand together, we have the power to make elected officials treat certain issues, such as health care, more urgently than they would without our voices. That's why we, the people, must be ever-vigilant in holding the feet of our elected officials to the fire in order to turn their promises into reality. We must continue mobilizing thousands of Californians from every walk of life to stand up and demand health care for all.\n\nSt. John's Well Child and Family Center has spent years bolstering the ACA's impact on the ground by enrolling tens of thousands of patients in health care plans, expanding and opening new health center sites, offering more services, continuing to increase the number of patients served, and, finally, fighting relentlessly to preserve our gains as Republicans and Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE attempted to take them away. Through all of this work, the most important lesson we've learned is that victory cannot be achieved if we don't fight together.\n\nWe've seen firsthand that access to health care is a catalyst for social, racial and economic justice through the many people like Esperanza Lopez who came to us with exacerbated health conditions and chronic illnesses, and were able to build thriving lives for themselves after finally getting the care they so desperately needed. It's not just about being able to treat our bodies-- affordable health care allows people to hold full-time jobs, provide for their families, and become more invested in their communities. Lopez was lucky to finally get the health care she deserved before it was too late. It's now time to extend that opportunity to the thousands of undocumented and low-income Californians who still live on the margins of our health care system.\n\nTo fully honor the anniversary of the ACA being signed into law, I encourage everyone, especially my fellow Californians, to call their representatives and ask them to introduce or support universal health care legislation. After all, this is our country, and it's time we take it into our own hands by saying, loudly and clearly, that every single person living here has a fundamental human right to health care-- regardless of citizenship status or ability to pay.",

                "body": "Pennsylvania moved forward on Thursday with a plan to permit medical marijuana research, outlining the process by which medical schools can seek approval for such studies.\n\nThe state will allow as many as eight medical schools to conduct research on medical marijuana. So far, at least one, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, has said it intends to seek permission to do so, PennLive.com reported.\n\nMedical schools in the state will work with separate marijuana growers to supply the substance for research. Those growers and distributors will have to seek a separate approval from the state, according to the news outlet.\n\nPennsylvania is expected to begin accepting applications from more growers, processors and dispensaries next month.\n\nPennsylvania moved in 2016 to legalize medical marijuana, and became the first state to codify research on the substance into the law.\n\nMarijuana is still considered by the federal government to be a Schedule 1 controlled substance, though federal officials have generally declined to enforce that ban, and have left the decision to individual states.\n\nAttorney General Jeff SessionsJefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsFeinstein, Harris call for probe of ICE after employee resigns House Judiciary chair subpoenas DOJ for FBI documents Sen. Gardner won't let Jeff Sessions tread on Colorado's cannabis boom MORE has long opposed the legalization of marijuana, and in January announced the rollback of an Obama-era policy that gave states the leeway to allow recreational use of the drug.\n\nSo far, there are 13 dispensaries approved to sell medical marijuana to patients in Pennsylvania, though only nine are actively doing so. PennLive.com reported that the state's dispensaries have faced supply issues, with only two growers currently shipping products.",

                "body": "The chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court scolded Republican state lawmakers on Thursday, after they filed impeachment resolutions against four Democratic justices over the court's decision on the state's congressional map.\n\nChief Justice Thomas Saylor, a Republican, said in a statement that he was concerned by the impeachment resolutions, which he called \"an attack upon an independent judiciary.\"\n\n\"Threats of impeachment directed against Justices because of their decision in a particular case are an attack upon an independent judiciary, which is an essential component of our constitutional plan of government,\" he said.\n\nA dozen Republicans in the Pennsylvania state House moved on Tuesday to impeach four of the court's five Democratic justices, filing articles of impeachment alleging that they exceeded their authority in striking down Pennsylvania's congressional map.\n\nThe court had previously ruled that the map had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered. Saylor and Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's only other Republican, both opposed that ruling.\n\nAfter the court ruled in January that the congressional map was unconstitutional, it gave state lawmakers three weeks to come up with a new map. Those efforts eventually failed, however, prompting the court to issue its own map.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has twice declined requests from Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania to block the new map from taking effect.\n\nThe new map is intended to create more parity between Republicans and Democrats in Pennsylvania's congressional races, and could give Democrats a chance to pick up some seats in the upcoming midterm elections.",

Others said they weren't upset and wanted to support the protest.\n\n\"I am appalled by what happened to the young man,\" Barbara Mitchell told The Bee. \"It was a travesty. So as much as I love basketball, it's OK. I'm not angry. I admire them for taking the time to protest an injustice.\"\n\nMore than 17,000 people had tickets to the game but only about 2,000 people made it inside the arena, the Bee reported.\n\nVivek Ranadive, the Kings' principal owner, made a statement over the microphone from the court, apologizing for the turmoil caused by Clark's killing.\n\n\"What happened was absolutely horrific and we are so very sorry, so very sorry for your loss,\" Ranadive said, adding they he respected the protesters right to assemble outside and would use the Kings' public platform for good.\n\nPolice approached in riot gear but did not engage the crowd and left several minutes later.\n\nThe Bee reported that while \"noisy and passionate,\" the protest did not turn violent and no arrests were made.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the officers involved in Clark's death are on paid leave until the investigation is complete.",

                "body": "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill\n\nStudents attending March for Our Lives this weekend have a message for lawmakers: Stand up to the gun lobby and pass meaningful legislation or we'll throw you out of office.\n\nFor the countless students and families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence, and for those who live in fear that their school or their community could be next, Saturday's march is just the beginning.\n\nThis generation has been told that active shooter situations in their schools are like natural disasters -- unpreventable and unavoidable. But students aren't fooled. They know that mass shootings and daily gun violence are man-made problems, rooted in the inaction of lawmakers who have chosen to protect the profits of gun manufacturers instead of people's lives.\n\nAs many of these students prepare to vote for the first time in upcoming elections, an A rating from the NRA won't be a badge of honor. It will be a scarlet letter.\n\nA new survey shows that gun violence prevention is a top issue for young people -- including teens who will be voting for the first time -- deciding how they'll cast their ballot in 2018. Seventy-two percent say that politicians who refuse to take action on gun violence should not be reelected. Almost half say that they will actively work to throw politicians who oppose commonsense gun safety reforms out of office.\n\nMore than one-quarter have already participated in or plan to participate in the walk-outs that have swept the nation since Parkland. Perhaps millions will march this weekend.\n\nAn entire generation is mobilized, and determined to vote in the wake of Parkland. They're fed up with living in fear -- and they're coming for lawmakers who aren't willing to act.\n\nBlack and brown students have been fighting this battle for a long time. And while Congress has stalled progress at the federal level, communities across the country have already made significant strides at the state level. Together, we've defeated legislation that would put more kids at risk and advanced changes to keep our schools and homes safe.\n\nAmericans from every generation are getting off the sidelines. At the march, we'll call on Congress to act on real solutions, including mandated background checks on all gun sales -- even if they happen online or at gun shows.\n\nAs a mom of five, gun violence is the most important issue to me when I vote. As parents, our kids are the center of our world and the future of this country. Their lives are on the line every day in our schools and communities -- and their voices deserve our full attention.\n\nMoms Demand Action is honored to support this student-led movement to hold lawmakers in Congress and in statehouses nationwide accountable. For thousands of children and families, it's too late. For members of Congress and state legislators, inaction is no longer an option.",

Can you imagine if Obama had done any of this stuff?\"\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Reid described his growing fatigue with Washington, and offered biting criticism of Trump and Republican lawmakers who he said have failed to stand up to the president.\n\n\"I can't fathom the Republicans doing what they do - nothing, nothing, it doesn't matter what he does,\" Reid said.\n\n\"Why would they be afraid of him? It should be just the opposite. I don't expect them to be nit-picking him on every little thing he does wrong. But shouldn't somebody be saying something about something?\"\n\nReid, who retired in 2017 after more than three decades in Congress, often traded barbs with Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. At one point that year, Trump appeared to mock an injury Reid had sustained in 2015 that cost him his sight in his right eye.\n\n\"I may not be able to see out of my right eye, but with my good eye, I can see that Trump is a man who inherited his money and spent his entire life pretending like he earned it,\" Reid said at the time.\n\nSince his retirement more than a year ago, Reid has remained relatively silent. But he told the Times that he's preparing to leave the nation's capital, and that he does not intend to visit often.\n\n\"I don't want to be here,\" Reid said. \"My life's not the Senate anymore.\"",

Avenatti has previously declined comment on whether such evidence exists.\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is currently suing to void a non-disclosure agreement that she says blocks her from speaking publicly about the alleged affair with Trump more than a decade ago.\n\nShe was paid $130,000 by Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen in 2016, just weeks before the presidential election. That payment, she has said, was intended to buy her silence on the alleged affair.\n\nCohen has acknowledged making the payment, but has insisted that it came from his own personal funds. The White House has denied that Trump ever had an affair with Daniels.\n\nIn court papers filed last week, Trump's attorneys accused Daniels of repeatedly violating the non-disclosure agreement, arguing that doing so exposed to her to paying $20 million in damages.\n\nKaren McDougal, a former Playboy model, has also come forward with allegations that she had an affair with Trump years ago. The White House has also denied that affair.",

                "body": "The Sacramento Police Department released footage on Wednesday of the fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man who was in his own backyard.\n\nStephon Clark, 22, was killed on Sunday by police who were investigating calls of a suspect smashing in car windows. Police claimed they thought the cellphone in his hands was a gun.\n\nLaw enforcement released three videos and two audio recordings late Wednesday, according to the New York Times.\n\nBody camera footage shows officers checking yards and speaking with neighbors before a sheriffs helicopter spots Clark in the backyard.\n\nOfficers encounter Clark in the yard around 9:30 p.m. and order him to show his hands. One yells \"gun\" before \"five to seven\" shots are fired, video shows.\n\nPolice continue to fire after Clark falls to the ground.\n\nTwo minutes and 50 seconds later, officers try to communicate with Clark, asking if he is alright, according to the New York Times. Clark does not respond and officers continue speaking to a still body.\n\nFive minutes after the last bullet is fired, officers make their way over to Clark to check on him. He is later pronounced dead at the scene, the Times reported.\n\nClark was found with a cell phone and no weapons.\n\nMassive protests broke out at City Hall after news of the shooting, delaying a NBA game for the Sacramento Kings.\n\nOfficers involved have been put on paid leave as the city investigates the shooting.",

                "body": "Republicans are calling themselves hypocritical when it comes to the $1.3 trillion omnibus approved by Congress this week.\n\nThe legislation adds to a disturbing trend if you are a conservative Republican worried about the deficit: It's another bill backed by GOP congressional leaders and a Republican president that will add greatly to the nation's debt.\n\n\"It just boggles my mind that we continue to spend at a level that's no different than the last three or four years of the Obama administration,\" said Rep. Mark WalkerBradley (Mark) Mark WalkerConservatives fear being steamrolled by Dems on funding bill Congress may pass background check legislation in funding bill Congress races to finish .2 trillion funding bill MORE (R-N.C.), who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee caucus.\n\nHe said the GOP looked \"hypocritical\" and \"disingenuous.\"\n\nEstimates predict that deficits could exceed $1 trillion as soon as next year given the new spending hikes and the GOP tax-cut bill approved last year.\n\nAnnual debt interest payments alone could rise to $1 trillion within the decade.\n\nAnd the latest damage to the nation's fiscal health has been done with Republicans in charge at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\"We're codifying levels never seen before, an upward trend in government spending, that should give all of us pause,\" said House Freedom Caucus member Mark SanfordMarshall (Mark) Clement SanfordHouse Republicans grumble about the 'worst process ever' 25 House Republicans defy leadership in key spending bill vote Congress may pass background check legislation in funding bill MORE (R-S.C.).\n\nNinety Republicans voted against the omnibus spending bill, many with concerns about the debt and the rushed pace at which the measure is moving through Congress.\n\nThe bill was released late Wednesday with a noon vote Thursday, giving lawmakers little time to read a 2,232-page bill.\n\nDemocrats ridiculed the process, arguing not a single Republican would have voted for a Democratic measure rushed with similar speed. A few GOP lawmakers agreed, including Rep. Louie GohmertLouis (Louie) Buller Gohmert25 House Republicans defy leadership in key spending bill vote GOP lawmaker: 'Mueller should be fired' Hispanic Caucus lashes out at Gohmert over Cesar Chavez comments MORE (R-Texas).\n\n\"It is a disaster,\" Gohmert said Thursday morning before the vote in an interview on CSPAN's \"Washington Journal.\" He later voted against the spending bill.\n\n\"It's the very thing that we belittled Nancy PelosiNancy Patricia D'Alesandro PelosiSenate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump House Republicans grumble about the 'worst process ever' Senate bracing for possible long weekend MORE over, when she said 'we have to pas the bill to see what's in it,'\" he said. \"You have a 2,200-page bill . . . and you got 24 hours, maybe 36 -- it's just, it's insane. It's no way to govern.\"\n\nStill, 145 GOP lawmakers voted for the bill, which includes an increase in funding for the military and other priorities sought by Republicans.\n\n\"The economy is going, we're at the defense spending we need, we have the Homeland Security funding and certainly we needed Gateway [project funds],\" said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.).\n\nA number of GOP lawmakers who supported the measure said that they think the main cause of the growing debt is mandatory spending such as Medicare and Social Security -- as opposed to discretionary spending, which is dealt with in the omnibus.\n\n\"Until people around here want to get serious about Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, there's no way to balance it,\" said Rep.

David SchweikertDavid SchweikertRepublicans open to targeted China tariffs despite steel flap GOP open to 3-year DACA fix in spending bill Ryan, Pelosi name members to new budget and pension committees MORE (R-Ariz.), a fiscal hawk who voted against the spending bill, agreed that discretionary spending is not as big a problem as mandatory spending.\n\n\"It's a fraction of a fraction of what mandatory entitlements are spending,\" he said, noting that projected increases in medical inflation and an aging population would cost mandatory spending programs twice as much over a decade as a given year of defense spending.\n\n\"My terror is that by the time we start to come up with rational solutions, so much of the baby boomer generation will be in retirement benefits that none of the solutions will have the economic effect that's needed to flatten out the curve,\" he added.\n\nConceding that mandatory spending is a greater problem, deficit hawks argued that increases in discretionary spending are nonetheless troubling.\n\nRomina Boccia, deputy director for economic policy at the Heritage Foundation, said that while mandatory spending is the primary driver of debt in the long run, \"this bill undoubtedly supercharges our growth in the deficit and the debt.\"\n\n\"We're ultimately mortgaging the future for a massive spending increase,\" she said, adding that much of the funds allocated to federal agencies may end up being wasted.\n\nMany in the GOP lay the blame for deficits at the feet of Democrats, whose support they need to pass spending bills in the Senate.\n\n\"If we had a simple majority in the Senate like we do in the House, on appropriations bills only, the spending would not be this high,\" said Rep. Mike ConawayKenneth (Mike) Michael ConawayOvernight Cybersecurity: House Intel votes to release Russia report | House lawmakers demand Zuckerberg testify | Senators unveil updated election cyber bill House Intel votes to release report in Russia probe Dem group: House Intelligence Committee ignored most Trump-Russia links MORE (R-Ill.).\n\nWalker said that the fiscal situation would not improve so long as Senate rules required more than a simple majority.\n\n\"As long as there's a 60-vote threshold on appropriations, I don't see how we ever resolve the spending issues or the budget as a whole,\" he said before voting against the spending bill.\n\nRep. Jim RenacciJames (Jim) B. Renacci10 Senate Democrats are up for reelection in Trump country Ohio to vote on redistricting reform Trump accuses Dems of 'treasonous' behavior MORE (R-Ohio), a member of the House Budget Committee, said the entire budget process needed to be revamped.\n\n\"We do have to change the process,\" he said. \"I'd like to see a budget committee that can pass a budget that we follow, that if we don't follow we need to make sure we tell the American people why we're not following it.\"\n\nThe budget caps deal struck in February created a bipartisan commission to examine the budgeting process and recommend changes. Those recommendations will be non-binding.\n\nPassage of the spending bill follows Republicans' approval of a tax-cut package in December that the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates would add more than $1 trillion to the deficit even after accounting for economic growth.\n\nConservatives said they hoped the tax cuts would be paired with spending cuts, and are dismayed to see that isn't happening.\n\n\"Ideally you would have sound tax policy pared with better fiscal policy on the spending side,\" said National Taxpayers Union Executive Vice President Brandon Arnold.\n\nDeficit hawks suggested that there currently is a lack of political will or leadership on cutting spending and the debt.\n\n\"Making real budget choices is always difficult,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

Claire McCaskillClaire Conner McCaskillKoch-backed group launches six-figure ad buy against Heitkamp GOP Senate candidate slams McCaskill over Clinton ties Dems meddle against Illinois governor ahead of GOP primary MORE, another Democrat facing reelection in a pro-Trump state.\n\nDemocratic strategists say the omnibus is good news for vulnerable incumbents who pledged after the 2016 election to work with Trump on areas of common ground.\n\nThe problem they've had over the last 14 months is that those opportunities for bipartisanship have been few and far between.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Charles SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerAmtrak to rename Rochester station after Louise Slaughter Conscience protections for health-care providers should be standard Pension committee must deliver on retirement promise MORE (N.Y.) hailed the budget deal in February as a \"breakthrough\" after what he called \"months of legislative logjams.\"\n\nRodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist, said vulnerable Democrats can use the omnibus to campaign for reelection as pragmatists willing to reach across the aisle.\n\n\"The biggest knock on Congress is that they don't do anything and all they do is fight and argue,\" he said. \"There's real dollars in this bill that will go to priorities in these states.\n\n\"It gives Democrats seeking re-election in the Senate to go back home and brag about what they've been able to do for the state,\" he added.\n\n\"The second part is it shows we work in a bipartisan manner, will be able to get something done and can work with Trump,\" he said.\n\nRed state Democrats can say they are wiling to stand up to Trump when he's wrong but also cut deals to help West Virginia, Montana and Indiana, Mollineau noted.\n\nDemocrats who are considered less vulnerable than Manchin, Tester, Donnelly or Heitkamp are also touting the omnibus.\n\nSen.

                "body": "The resignation of the lead attorney on President TrumpDonald John TrumpPoll: Both parties need to do more on drug prices Senate approves .3 trillion spending bill, sending to Trump White House: Trump will delay steel tariffs for EU, six countries MORE's personal legal team is the strongest sign yet that Trump wants to pursue a harder line in confronting special counsel Robert MuellerRobert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE.\n\nJohn Dowd resigned on Thursday. Although he emphasized his \"love\" for Trump in comments to news outlets, his departure came after the president lost faith in him, according to several sources.\n\n\"The president wants to be more aggressive,\" one source within Trump's orbit told The Hill.\n\nDowd \"wasn't tough enough for the president,\" this person added.\n\nSome Trump loyalists were even more critical.\n\n\"Good riddance,\" was the verdict of Sam Nunberg, the former Trump aide who recently made headlines with a flurry of television interviews in which he suggested he might defy a subpoena from the Mueller team to appear before a grand jury. (He later relented.)\n\nReferring to Ty Cobb, the in-house White House counsel for the Russia probe, Nunberg added, \"Cobb should be fired next. Their strategy has hurt the president.\"\n\nDowd and Cobb favor a broadly cooperative stance toward Mueller. Their argument, in essence, is that the president has done nothing wrong and therefore would benefit from the Mueller probe being concluded expeditiously.\n\nOne problem, however, is that Cobb predicted last year that the special counsel's investigation would be over by Thanksgiving 2017, or by the end of that year.\n\nOutside legal experts argued, even at the time, that the prediction was unrealistic.\n\nAs the probe has gone on, and new avenues have reportedly been opened by Mueller's team, Trump's patience has grown thin.\n\nHe name-checked Mueller for the first time in a tweet on Sunday, blasting the special counsel's team as having \"13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary Supporters and zero Republicans.\"\n\nMueller himself was appointed as FBI director by a Republican president, George W. Bush. He has been reported to be a registered Republican.\n\nOn Monday, Trump branded the probe, \"A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\"\n\nThe White House has insisted that Trump has no intention of firing Mueller. Republican lawmakers have predicted catastrophe were he to do so. Sen. Lindsey GrahamLindsey Olin GrahamSenators introduced revised version of election cyber bill GOP senators push tougher sentencing for synthetic opioid Dems aim to turn ObamaCare hikes into election weapon MORE (R-S.C.) told CNN on Sunday that such a move would be \"the beginning of the end of his presidency.\"\n\nThe most fervent among Trump's supporters are enthused about this week's hiring of Joe diGenova onto the president's legal team.\n\nDiGenova is a much more aggressive figure than either Dowd or Cobb. Prior to joining Trump's team, he had argued that the FBI was conspiring to frame the president.\n\nOne GOP operative, referring to diGenova taking the lead, said: \"I think you'll see every inch of ground fought for: every document, every email, every witness. It's siege warfare now.\"\n\nThe source inside Trump's orbit exulted that \"there's a new boss in town.\"\n\nTwo questions loom over the legal picture: Whether Cobb's job is safe inside the White House and whether any more senior figure will be hired on the outside to take the lead above diGenova?\n\nSpeculation is swirling around Cobb but the president has not made any definitive move against him.\n\nAt least two well-known lawyers -- Ted Olsen and Emmett Flood -- are reported to have been approached about taking a role. But a top executive at Olsen's firm later tweeted that neither Olsen nor the firm would be representing Trump.\n\nJay Sekulow remains in position as one of Trump's personal attorneys and told The Hill on Thursday that he and his colleagues \"will continue our ongoing representation\" of the president.\n\nThe Hill understands that Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, retains a voice in the legal deliberations as well.\n\nOne source familiar with the current legal team's thinking offered a nuanced view on the meaning of Dowd's resignation and the hiring of diGenova.\n\nThis source argued that the change was more about Trump's communications strategy than his legal strategy.\n\nTrump's lawyers, this person insisted, \"all agree [on] cooperating with the special counsel to move things along. The question was how aggressively we should message out in the public square.\"\n\n\"John believed it was better not to engage in that, so as to wrap things up with the special counsel. But I don't think the president can do that for too long,\" the source added.\n\nOutside experts cautioned that Trump seems a deeply challenging client.\n\n\"I think Trump wants to be more aggressive in the court of public opinion, as well as in the court of law, if it goes there. But any legal strategy is only as effective as the client's willingness to listen to their lawyer,\" said Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent.\n\nRangappa, like other sources, also highlighted Dowd's reported role, with Cobb, in trying to keep Trump calm by promising that the Mueller probe could soon come to a conclusion.\n\n\"His departure could reflect a dawning realization that this is not ending,\" she said.",

                "body": "A majority of voters thinks that both parties need to do more to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, according to a poll released early Friday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 80 percent, said prescription drug costs are unreasonable, and about half said passing legislation to bring down prescription costs should be a \"top priority\" for President TrumpDonald John TrumpHouse expected to vote on omnibus Thursday afternoon House passes 'right to try' drug bill Spending bill rejects Trump's proposed EPA cut MORE and Congress.\n\nThe survey also found that 72 percent of respondents think pharmaceutical companies have too much influence in Washington -- more than say the same about the National Rifle Association.\n\nOverall, more than three in four respondents said that congressional Republicans, congressional Democrats and Trump and his administration all aren't doing enough to bring drug costs down.\n\nTrump has railed about the high price of prescription drugs throughout his first year in office. His tough talk on drug manufacturers dates back to the 2016 presidential campaign, when he blasted the pharmaceutical industry as \"getting away with murder.\"\n\nTrump also backed allowing Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies and endorsed expanding importation of cheaper medicine.\n\nEarlier this week, he said the administration will soon be unveiling a slate of drug-pricing policies.\n\n\"You'll be seeing drug prices falling very substantially in the not-so-distant future, and it's going to be beautiful,\" Trump said during a press conference on opioids in New Hampshire.\n\nBut the poll's respondents were skeptical of what the administration will do. According to the Kaiser, only 39 percent said they have confidence that Trump will deliver on the promise to lower drug costs.\n\nThe vast majority of Democrats, at 91 percent, and independents, 80 percent, said Trump and his White House \"are not doing enough\" on the issue.\n\nBut Republicans were more supportive: 56 percent said he is \"not doing enough\" and about one-third said his administration is \"doing enough.\"\n\nAn increasing number of people say they don't trust either party to bring down prescription drug prices. The share of the public who explicitly said \"neither,\" when asked which party they trust on the issue rose from 12 percent in 2016 to 21 percent this year.\n\nVast majorities of both Republicans and Democrats said they trust their own political party to do a better job handling the drug pricing issue, at 78 percent and 84 percent, respectively. Very few said they trust the opposing party -- 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively.\n\nThe survey was conducted March 8-13 among 1,212 adults ages 18 and older. Its margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.",

It now goes to the White House where Trump is expected to sign it.\n\n\"Let's cut right to the chase. Is the president going to sign the bill? The answer is yes,\" White House budget chief Mick MulvaneyJohn (Mick) Michael MulvaneySpending bill prevents employers from pocketing tips under tip-pooling rule Report: Trump officials overrule regulatory czar in releasing tip pooling rule Bipartisan House bill would replace consumer director with panel MORE told reporters Thursday, following the president's past threat to veto the measure.\n\nThe vote early Friday morning came after conservatives, including libertarian-minded GOP Sen. Rand PaulRandal (Rand) Howard PaulHouse poised to vote on .3T spending bill Overnight Finance: Lawmakers race to finalize omnibus | What we know about funding bill | White House on board | Fed raises rates for first time under Powell Senate passes controversial online sex trafficking bill MORE (Ky.), backed down from a showdown that could have forced a brief, hours-long partial closure of the federal government.\n\nPaul kept his colleagues in the dark throughout Thursday, before hinting in a tweet and Fox News appearance after 8 p.m. that he would allow the vote to take place.\n\n\"If they insist on voting, I will vote no because it spends to much and there's just too little time to read the bill and let everyone know what's actually in it,\" he tweeted.\n\nIn the end, his colleagues insisted.\n\nLawmakers noted that the bill ultimately had the votes to pass, allowing the chamber to leave for a two-week recess on Saturday as scheduled.\n\n\"I think people realize the handwriting is on the wall,\" Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said amid speculation that Paul might force another hours-long shutdown.\n\n\"I just figured I would let him speak up if he wants to speak, and if he doesn't we'll vote.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to try to delay it out of respect to my colleagues. Everybody, you know, needs to vote their conscious,\" Kennedy said.\n\nThe colossal funding package, which funds the government through Sept. 30, includes $695 billion in defense funding and $591 billion in nondefense funding.\n\nThe funding boost comes after Congress passed a budget deal last month that raised the spending caps by $80 billion for defense and $63 billion for nondefense and set similar increases for 2019.\n\nConservative lawmakers seethed over the higher spending levels, as well as litany of unrelated issues stuck into the funding bill that is expected to one of the last major pieces of legislation Congress passes before the midterm election.\n\nThe budget deal, along with the GOP's signature tax-cuts legislation, will add around $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to a study by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget released earlier this month.\n\n\"I could not be more discouraged about where we are today with our adult leadership here in Congress and at the White House. This is one of the most grotesque pieces of legislation I can remember,\" said GOP Sen. Bob CorkerRobert (Bob) Phillips CorkerNearly 70 percent say Trump is a bad role model for children: poll PPP poll: Dem leads by 5 points in Tennessee Senate race Dem Iraq War vets renew AUMF push on 15th anniversary of war MORE (Tenn.).\n\nSen. Ted CruzRafael (Ted) Edward CruzTrump can save Republicans and restore sanity to California in 2018 Cruz says Cambridge Analytica assured him its practices were legal Dem battling Cruz in Texas: 'I can understand how people think this is crazy' MORE (R-Texas) said the omnibus spending bill was \"drafted by the Swamp in the dark of night\" and \"the disastrous elements of this bill are almost too numerous to list.\"\n\nOther lawmakers grumbled about the breakneck pace of the 2,000-plus page bill, which cleared Congress roughly 24 hours after it was publicly released, giving members little time to read and digest the legislation in its entirety.\n\n\"This is a great dane-sized whiz down the leg of every taxpayer,\" Kennedy said.\n\nSen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who is part of a committee aimed at reforming the appropriations process, added: \"You all I know how I feel about the process. ...[This] is just not the way to govern at all.\"\n\nBut with a Christmas tree of legislative priorities included in the bill, leadership on both sides claimed the funding legislation as a win.\n\nMcConnell pointed to the increase in defense funding, calling it a \"top priority\" for Republicans.\n\n\"First and foremost, in my view, this bill will mark the end of disproportionate and harmful cuts to Department of Defense funding. It delivers the largest year-on-year increase in defense spending in fifteen years,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerAmtrak to rename Rochester station after Louise Slaughter Conscience protections for health-care providers should be standard Pension committee must deliver on retirement promise MORE (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy PelosiNancy Patricia D'Alesandro PelosiCollins: 'Extremely disappointing' ObamaCare fix left out of spending deal Moderates see vindication in Lipinski's primary win Clinton, Pelosi, John Lewis to eulogize Slaughter MORE (D-Calif.) held a joint press conference on Thursday to tout provisions their party secured in the legislation.\n\n\"It was weeks of pain-staking negotiations,\" Schumer said. \"We Democrats are really happy with what we were able to accomplish on a number of priorities.\"\n\nHe added that \"this spending agreement brings the era of austerity to an unceremonious end.\"\n\nThe legislation includes $1.6 billion for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall that includes 33 miles of new border fencing -- not a concrete wall -- that was already authorized through the 2006 Secure Fence Act.\n\nTrump claimed victory over the funding, saying in a tweet that he \"got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming.\"\n\nBut Schumer hit back, noting that the few fencing had to be see-through, unlike a physical wall, which he argued was \"consist with the border security\" Democrats support.\n\nNegotiators also worked out a deal on funding for the Gateway project, a rail and tunnel initiative connecting New York and New Jersey.\n\nTrump had caused temporary heartburn among GOP leadership earlier this week over concerns that he could veto the massive bill. Trump issued the threat on the initial $900 million request from regional lawmakers including Schumer. The compromise knocks the figure down to $541 million.\n\nThe bill also included a narrow bill aimed at bolstering the National Instant Background Check System (NICS). The legislation, known as Fix NICS, would reinforce existing laws by ensuring that authorities report criminal records to the system and penalizing agencies that don't.\n\nIt also included school safety measures and cleared the path for federal researchers to examine gun violence as a public health threat.\n\nDemocrats believe the Fix NICS bill doesn't go far enough in the wake of last month's high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Schumer said he asked for a vote on background checks but Republicans said no.\n\nSen. Dick DurbinRichard (Dick) Joseph DurbinGOP leaders to Trump: Leave Mueller alone Water has experienced a decade of bipartisan success Trump vows tougher borders to fight opioid epidemic MORE (D-Ill.) said the exclusion of broader measures wouldn't prevent the caucus from supporting it.\n\nThe bill does not address two controversial issues: A fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program or key ObamaCare payments.\n\nDurbin tried to pass the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, or DREAM Act, earlier Thursday.\n\n\"We have this 2000 page bill which addresses every subject imaginable, but doesn't address the looming deadline that we face in America where [we're] one court decision away from hundreds of thousands of young people being deported,\" he said.\n\nBut Sen. Thom TillisThomas (Thom) Roland TillisGOP leaders to Trump: Leave Mueller alone North Carolina GOP previously hired Cambridge Analytica: report Senate GOP: Legislation to protect Mueller not needed MORE (R-N.C.) objected.\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as the debate over DACA has largely stalemated. A source familiar with the talks told The Hill earlier this week that the White House offered to include a deal in the omnibus that would give $25 billion in border money in exchange for a two-and-a-half year extension of DACA.\n\nDemocrats rejected the offer and countered with $25 billion in border security and a pathway to citizenship for the broader 1.8 million population. The White House rejected, according to the source.\n\nTrump blasted Democrats for the immigration deal not being in the bill.\n\n\"Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy, but they just didn't care,\" he said in a tweet, \"I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.\"",

                "body": "Welcome to Overnight Regulations, your daily rundown of news from the federal agencies, Capitol Hill and the courts. It's Thursday evening here in Washington where a $1.3 trillion spending bill advanced in the House. Though when the Senate will vote on the bill to avoid a shutdown is up in the air.\n\nLawmakers added language to the $1.3 spending bill to prevent employers from being able to steal workers' tips under the Labor Department's controversial tip-pooling rule.\n\nSen. Patty MurrayPatricia (Patty) Lynn MurraySpending bill would double child care funding for low-income families Funding bill gives billion boost for NIH medical research Spending bill prevents employers from pocketing tips under tip-pooling rule MORE (D-Wash.) reached the deal with Labor Secretary Alexander AcostaRene (Alex) Alexander AcostaSpending bill prevents employers from pocketing tips under tip-pooling rule These health plans create level playing field for small business Five Cabinet members to testify at infrastructure hearing next week MORE to add a rider in the bill that amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to prevent employers, managers or supervisors from pocketing workers' tips regardless of whether they earn gratuities on top of a full minimum wage.\n\nThe lack of a safeguard was a sticking point of controversy on the rule that allows employers to pool the tips of workers who make the full minimum wage and split them with non-tipped workers.\n\nBut Acosta has also been under fire for his actions in the rule making process.\n\nSen. Elizabeth WarrenElizabeth Ann WarrenDems offering bill aimed at curbing stock buybacks Lessons from Dan Lipinski's victory Michael Moore: Russia, Stormy Daniels stories are 'shiny keys to distract us' MORE (D-Mass.) sent letters to Acosta and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick MulvaneyJohn (Mick) Michael MulvaneySpending bill prevents employers from pocketing tips under tip-pooling rule Report: Trump officials overrule regulatory czar in releasing tip pooling rule Bipartisan House bill would replace consumer director with panel MORE on Thursday demanding answers over reports the two hid an unfavorable impact analysis from the proposed rule that showed workers could lose billions in gratuities.\n\nBloomberg Law reported Wednesday that Acosta and Mulvaney also overruled Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Administrator Neomi Ra, who objected to its release without the report.\n\nWarren is now calling on Sen. Lamar AlexanderAndrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderOvernight Health Care: What to expect in omnibus | HIV expert to head CDC | Sessions issues memo on death penalty for drug cases HIV expert named CDC director GOP lawmakers blast Dems for opposing ObamaCare fix MORE (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, to hold an oversight hearing on the controversy.\n\nAgriculture: Consumer groups are suing the Trump administration over its decision to withdraw an Obama-era rule that set new standards for how animals must be treated if their meat is going to be sold as \"certified organic.\"\n\nThe Center for Food Safety (CFS) and three other groups filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia on Thursday.\n\nThey argue that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) wrongly claimed it lacked the authority to regulate practices such as animal space and preventative health care for livestock under the organic label and gave an arbitrary rationale for withdrawing the rule.\n\nThe CFS said the USDA claimed the regulation would be costly, despite its own economic analysis finding only minor costs.\n\nTech: The government and AT&T delivered their opening arguments Thursday in the trial over the telecom giant's proposed $85 billion merger with Time Warner.\n\nJustice Department attorney Craig Conrath focused on the \"ability and incentive\" AT&T would have to use popular Time Warner programming -- which includes HBO shows, March Madness, NBA games and more -- to hurt competition. And he warned that consumers could end up paying more for television subscriptions.\n\n\"Effectively, consumers will be forced to pay for an extra month of Time Warner content every year even though they're only getting 12 months,\" Conrath argued.\n\nBut Daniel Petrocelli, the lead attorney for the merging companies, dismissed that argument as \"preposterous,\" saying that AT&T's business relies on finding innovative ways to distribute content to consumers.\n\nThe two sides made their opening cases Thursday before a packed courtroom that included AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes.\n\nThe case is widely seen as the antitrust \"trial of the century\" and has been mired in controversy.\n\nTech: Facebook chief executive Mark ZuckerbergMark Elliot ZuckerbergZuckerberg: Maybe tech should face some regulations Zuckerberg 'open' to speaking with Congress Overnight Tech: Zuckerberg breaks silence on Cambridge Analytica controversy | Senate passes sex trafficking bill | EU pushes new tax on tech | YouTube toughens rules on gun videos MORE said on Wednesday that he's open to having his company be regulated.\n\n\"Actually, I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with CNN that represented some of his first public remarks since the Cambridge Analytica controversy plunged his company into crisis and led to calls for his testimony before Congress.\n\n\"I actually think the question is more 'What is the right regulation?' rather than 'Yes or no, should it be regulated?'\" Zuckerberg told CNN.\n\nFacebook has faced intense scrutiny from critics, including lawmakers on Capitol Hill, since it revealed that the British research firm Cambridge Analytica improperly took data from 50 million Facebook users without those users' consent.\n\nAli Breland has the story here.\n\nAnd on Thursday, lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee called on Zuckerberg to testify on the Cambridge Analytica controversy.\n\nHealth care: The House passed \"right to try\" legislation on experimental drugs largely along party lines Wednesday, sending a bill backed by President TrumpDonald John TrumpHouse expected to vote on omnibus Thursday afternoon House passes 'right to try' drug bill Spending bill rejects Trump's proposed EPA cut MORE to the Senate.\n\nLast week, House Republican leaders put the bill on the floor under suspension of the rules. Democrats objected, expressing safety concerns over how the measure would bypass the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and it fell short of the necessary two-thirds support it needed.\n\nBut leaders made clear the House would take up the bill again. On the second try, the House only needed a simple majority to pass the bill, and easily did so in the 267-149 vote.\n\nThirty-five Democrats voted for the bill, and two Republicans opposed it.\n\nNow, the measure goes to the Senate, where a version of the bill passed in August by unanimous consent.\n\nThe bill lets terminally ill patients request access to drugs the FDA hasn't yet approved without going through the agency. Patients can request the drugs from manufacturers if the medicine has gone through a small-scale clinical trial and is still under FDA consideration.\n\nEnvironment: The $1.3 trillion government-wide spending bill released late Wednesday rejects President Trump's proposal to slash the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) budget by 31 percent.\n\nSenior lawmakers negotiating the omnibus appropriations bill instead chose to give the agency $8.1 billion for fiscal 2018, keeping it at the same funding level as 2017.\n\n\"The American people support investments in clean air and water, public lands, parks, and the arts and humanities, which are vital to the health and well-being of our communities and our economy,\" Sen. Tom UdallThomas (Tom) Stewart UdallSpending bill rejects Trump's proposed EPA cut Overnight Energy: Dem says EPA isn't cooperating on 'privacy booth' probe | Tribe, Zinke split over border wall | Greens tout support for renewables in swing states Overnight Regulation: Facebook faces new crisis over Cambridge Analytica data | Whistleblower gets record SEC payout | Self-driving Uber car kills pedestrian | Trump bans trading in Venezuelan cryptocurrency MORE (N.M.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee subcommittee responsible for the EPA, said in a statement.\n\nThe funding level represents a victory for Democrats, who had argued that Trump's cuts would be disastrous. But much of the GOP also opposed the 31 percent proposed cut.\n\nHealth care: A group of Republicans wants to bolster mandatory minimum sentencing for trafficking fentanyl, a move that comes as President Trump advocates for harsher punishments for drug traffickers.\n\nFentanyl is \"as much a weapon of mass destruction as it is a drug,\" Sen. Tom CottonThomas (Tom) Bryant CottonProtecting American innovation Russian spy poisoning brings world powers closer to day of reckoning GOP senators see Tillerson ouster as the new normal MORE (R-Ark.) said at a Thursday press conference, holding up a nearly empty salt shaker and explaining how that amount -- less than 40 grams -- of fentanyl could kill thousands of people.\n\nFederal mandatory minimums for fentanyl kick in after trafficking 40 grams or more.\n\n\"That's why mandatory minimum sentences are so important and our sentences for fentanyl are so inadequate,\" he said later.\n\nThe bill, which will be introduced Thursday, would reduce the amount of fentanyl required for mandatory minimum sentences to apply. The effort, senators said, is aimed at taking into account the synthetic drug's potency -- which is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin.\n\nFinance: Citibank announced Thursday that it will start requiring clients to place some restrictions on gun sales, including banning the sale of firearms to anyone under the age of 21.\n\nThe bank will also require retail clients to only sell guns to individuals who have passed a background check and to not sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines.\n\nThe company announced the changes in a statement condemning gun violence and slamming lawmakers for failing to pass gun control measures. It said the policy would apply to new clients.\n\nEnvironment: Lawmakers grilled federal officials Thursday over why power is still not restored to all of Puerto Rico six months after Hurricane Maria devastated the island.\n\n\"I just want you to imagine your own hometown here in the mainland without electricity for two months -- three, four, six months without power, with also failing communications with the only assurance that 'we are working on it,'\" said Del. Jenniffer González-Colón (R-Puerto Rico), at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Subcommittee on National Security, expressing frustration over the slow recovery.\n\n\"The people of Puerto Rico have been admirably patient and justifiably tired. If we were a state, we would have five congressional districts and two senators -- no one would leave a state without power for six months.\"\n\nMulvaney, Acosta override regulatory office to hide tips rule data - Bloomberg Law\n\nUndocumented and old enough for DACA, but too late to apply - The Washington Post\n\nTop regulator worries that crypto markets could be full of manipulation - Bloomberg",

                "body": "John Dowd, who resigned Thursday, issued a statement last weekend calling on Deputy Attorney General Rod RosensteinRod Jay RosensteinMcCabe oversaw criminal probe into Sessions over testimony on Russian contacts: report Hannity: Mueller can't 'honestly investigate scandals' that Comey, Rosenstein are 'directly involved in' House Judiciary Chair expected to issue DOJ subpoena over Clinton emails as soon as this week MORE to \"bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation.\"\n\n\"(Trump) thought it was a good statement. And I still do,\" Dowd told the Journal on Thursday.\n\nDowd had initially told The Daily Beast, which first reported his statement, that he was making the comments in his capacity as Trump's counsel. In a later statement provided to The Hill and other outlets, Dowd clarified that he was speaking in a personal capacity.\n\nHours after Dowd's statement, Trump took to Twitter to echo his lawyer's sentiment blasting the special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.\n\n\"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\nDowd's resignation on Thursday comes as the president seeks to shake up his legal team amid frustrations within the White House over Mueller's probe.\n\nThis week, Trump added Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney who has been highly critical of the FBI and Department of Justice, to his outside legal team.\n\nWith Dowd gone, Trump's outside legal team handling the Russia matter will be led, at least in the interim, by diGenova and Jay Sekulow.\n\nTrump indicated Thursday he would be willing to testify in the Mueller probe, something that Dowd reportedly advised the president against.",

                "body": "A teenage girl who was shot in the hallway of her Maryland high school earlier in the week will be taken off life support Thursday night, NBC Washington reported.\n\nJaelynn Willey, 16, one of two students shot on Tuesday morning at Great Mills High School. Police said the gunman, Austin Rollins, shot her in the head. Rollins and Wiley had a previous relationship, police said.\n\nWiley had been on life support at UM Prince George's Hospital Center, the NBC affiliate reported.\n\n\"She will not make it,\" Melissa Willey, Jaelynn's mother, said. \"She's brain-dead and has nothing, no life left in her.\"\n\nRollins was killed after exchanging gunfire with the school resource officer. The other injured student is in good condition, NBC Washington reported.\n\nThe shooting at the Maryland high school came more than a month after a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, killing 17 people.\n\nStoneman Douglas students have been at the forefront of the discussion about gun violence following last month's shooting.\n\nThe students organized the March For Our Lives rally, which will take place on Saturday in Washington, D.C., and cities across the country.",

The leak reportedly infuriated Trump and his chief of staff John KellyJohn Francis KellyMORE.\n\n\"When I read about the leak of the note and the subject, I was outraged by it,\" Bolton said Thursday evening on Fox News.\n\n\"You cannot conduct diplomacy, you cannot expect other foreign leaders to be candid and open in their conversations with the president if some munchkin in the executive branch decides they're going to leak the talking points or the transcript or any other aspect of it,\" Bolton continued.\n\n\"And I think this is really a terrible reflection on the individual or individuals who did this.
