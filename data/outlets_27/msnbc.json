It's an attribution that resulted from a fleeting but critical slip-up in GRU tradecraft.\"\n\n* He wasn't a rogue coffee boy: \"When a Russian news agency reached out to George Papadopoulos to request an interview shortly before the 2016 election, the young adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump made sure to seek approval from campaign headquarters.\"\n\n* A stunning look at how far-right operatives work behind the scenes: \"Days after a woman accused U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual impropriety, two Moore supporters approached her attorney with an unusual request.\"\n\n* Stephon Clark: \"Demonstrators enraged over the police shooting of an unarmed man shut down traffic on a Sacramento freeway Thursday and later blocked fans from attending a Kings game.\"\n\n* Will he ask good questions and then vote for her anyway? \"Sen. John McCain, whose experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam has established him as Congress's moral conscience on torture, asked CIA director nominee Gina Haspel to detail her role in the agency's enhanced interrogation program.\"\n\n* This dovetails with the NRA story we've been watching: Incoming White House national security adviser John Bolton recorded a video used by the Russian gun rights group The Right to Bear Arms in 2013 to encourage the Russian government to loosen gun laws.\"\n\n* Imagine if Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte took an interest in ongoing Trump administration scandals instead of nonsense: \"The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed the Justice Department Thursday for records connected to the FBI's 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton - as well as the internal report that led to the ouster of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe.\"\n\n* And Karen McDougal is now talking publicly for the first time about her alleged affair with Donald Trump, and she seems to have an interesting story to tell.\n\nAnything to add?

                "title": "Trump's DACA lie is rooted in transparent cynicism",
                "body": "At a hastily thrown together White House event this afternoon, Donald Trump announced that he's signed that omnibus spending package his administration supports, but which he threatened to veto. Towards the end of the event, the president strayed from his prepared text to tell a rather important lie:\n\n\"I do want the Hispanic community to know and DACA recipients to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats who are using you for their own purposes.\"\n\nApparently, Trump is under the impression that Dreamers and \"the Hispanic community\" pay no attention to current events - because otherwise, he wouldn't make such a cynical and ridiculous argument.\n\nLet's revisit the facts, which are unambiguous. After assuring Dreamers that he wouldn't punish them, Trump ended the DACA program, putting these young immigrants' future in jeopardy and creating a crisis where none exists.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have scrambled to protect Dreamers, offering the president six different bipartisan agreements, each of which Trump either rejected or walked away from.\n\nIndeed, it's stunning just how far Democrats have been willing to go as this debate has unfolded. I, for example, have never seen much value in trading DACA protections for a border wall, largely because that's a \"compromise\" in which Trump gets something he says he wants in exchange for something Trump says he wants. That's not how bipartisan deals are generally supposed to go.\n\nBut as of last month, Democrats were willing to accept that deal anyway. In effect, Dems caved, feeling as if they had no choice and no leverage. Trump and his team could've taken \"yes\" for an answer, but they didn't. The White House said they'd protect Dreamers only if Democrats agreed to fund a border wall and accepted dramatic cuts to legal immigration. Dems said that was a bridge too far.\n\nAnd in Trump's mind, this means he and Republicans are the true friends of Dreamers and \"the Hispanic community.\"\n\nLet's circle back to an analogy we discussed several weeks ago. Imagine someone took a group of people hostage and then sent a ridiculous ransom note to the group's friends. The friends, feeling desperate, grudgingly agreed to meet most of the hostage taker's demands, only to receive word that the hostage taker considers his ransom note non-negotiable. He'll only accept 100% of what he wants.\n\nThen imagine that same hostage taker went to the media to boast that he's the hostages' true ally, unlike the friends who haven't yet met his demands.\n\nIf that sounds absurd, that's because it is - though we're watching this play out in public view.\n\nThis isn't complicated: if Trump wanted to help Dreamers, he would. He could restore DACA. He could also accept one of the many bipartisan offers he's been presented with. He could take deportations off the table. He could accept the wall-for-DACA compromise he said he wanted.\n\nBut the president hasn't done any of these things, and that's almost certainly because he doesn't want to.\n\nBut instead of defending his position, Trump, whose rise to power was fueled in part by anti-immigration animus, is lying about it.\n\nAnd why is the president lying so brazenly? Because as regular readers know, Trump realizes that the politics of this debate aren't going his way: if he starts deporting hundreds of thousands of Dreamers, the threat of a political backlash is real. After all, the American mainstream supports DACA protections for these young immigrants and opposes the White House's approach.\n\nAnd so, in order to protect himself politically, Trump has to lie - brazenly and repeatedly - as he did again this afternoon.",

                "title": "Trump keeps bluffing badly and for no reason",
                "body": "In poker, bluffing is an important strategic move. If you're playing a bad hand, for example, you can keep upping the ante in the hopes of convincing the other players that you actually have a good hand, persuading them to fold. The risk, of course, is that your rivals will see through your bluff, at which point you'll lose even more of your money.\n\nI'm starting to think Donald Trump doesn't understand the point of bluffing - because like his routine lying, the president seems to do it for no good reason.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump endorsed a massive government spending bill, and on Thursday, the White House and its allies spent much of the day telling everyone how much the president is looking forward to signing the omnibus package into law. This morning, however, Trump, for reasons that are not yet clear, threatened to veto the proposal he ostensibly supports because it lacks immigration provisions he claims to support.\n\nIn response, lawmakers didn't bother to offer Trump anything - at which point he signed it anyway.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump called the spending bill a \"ridiculous situation,\" while standing in the White House Diplomatic Room, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, and several Cabinet members.\n\n\"There are a lot of things I'm unhappy about in this bill,\" the president said, pointing to the inclusion of unspecified items in the bill that he said were added in order to get necessary funding for the U.S. military.\n\nTrump added that he \"will never sign another bill like this again\" - in part because \"nobody read it\" before it passed - and that threat might actually mean something if anyone had reason to believe the president's warnings.\n\nSo what did Trump gain from raising the prospect of vetoing this bill, only to back down a few hours later? Nothing of value. For all his trouble, despite the manufactured drama, the only thing the president gained from this experience is fresh evidence that he bluffs badly.\n\nWhat's more, Trump didn't do his stature any favors, either: he condemned the spending package as wasteful, and then signed into law anyway, as if he were powerless to defend his stated principles. Presidents don't generally go out of their way to make themselves appear weak like this.\n\nThe broader question is why this mini-fiasco happened in the first place. My hunch is that Trump's impulses once again got the better of him: the White House endorsed the legislation; the president didn't know that; and when he saw something on Fox News this morning, he had a knee-jerk reaction without consulting any of his aides or allies.\n\nWhatever the explanation, even by 2018 standards, this little stunt didn't do Trump any favors.\n\nPostscript: The president this afternoon also asked Congress to give him a line-item veto. Trump probably doesn't know this, but the Supreme Court rejected a line-item veto as unconstitutional 20 years ago.",

                "body": "It wasn't easy, but federal policymakers worked out a deal on Wednesday on a giant spending package that would fund the government for a while and prevent a government shutdown. Donald Trump wasn't directly involved in the negotiations, but he expressed his approval for the result. Indeed, on Wednesday night, he tweeted about his support for the omnibus bill.\n\nAnd with the president's blessing, Congress followed suit. As the House and Senate passed the package with relative ease - and with bipartisan majorities - the White House issued this formal Statement of Administration Policy, making a fairly detailed case in support of the proposal. Trump's communications office sent out talking points touting the bill around the same time.\n\nWhat about reports from last week that the president wasn't pleased with the bill because it doesn't include funding for his border wall? Never mind, people close to Trump said. \"The president supports this bill,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters yesterday. \"There's no two ways about it.\"\n\nSoon after, White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, standing at the White House podium, told reporters that Trump \"looks forward to signing\" the omnibus into law.\n\nOops.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday morning threatened to veto a freshly passed government spending deal -- prompting renewed concerns of yet another government shutdown -- because the measure doesn't adequately fund his desired border wall or protect recipients of the DACA program his administration ended.\n\n\"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,\" Trump tweeted Friday morning.\n\nI guess he forgot his own position again?\n\nThere are occasional questions about which presidential tweets were written by Trump and which were written by aides, but in this case, in light of the seemingly random capitalization and casual dishonesty, I think it's a safe bet the president himself was the author.\n\nSo, will Trump follow through on the threat? Given how often he bluffs badly, I'm not inclined to even guess. He'll apparently let us know soon.\n\nBut what I like about this story is how it ties to together so many recent threads. Trump likes to blindside his own aides? Check. The president and his own White House aren't on the same page? Check. Trump seems to ignore his own position because of something he saw on Fox News? Check.\n\nIn other words, today is Classis Trump.\n\nPostscript: In the president's veto threat/tweet, he again points to funding for his border wall. Whether Trump realizes this or not, Democrats already offered to trade wall funding for DACA protections for Dreamers. He rejected the compromise.",

Scott Walker (R) has refused to call special elections to fill state legislative vacancies, a state judge ruled yesterday the governor no longer has a choice. The case was brought by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and an affiliate of the group he leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.\n\n* In Arizona's closely watched U.S. Senate race, the latest Public Policy Polling survey found Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D) ahead by five points over Rep. Martha McSally (R), 46% to 41%.\n\n* On a related note, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D) has been targeted with an aggressive round of attack ads by conservative groups, but PPP found her with leads of about 12 points in hypothetical general election match-ups over her likely Republican challengers.\n\n* In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker (R) appears to be a pretty safe bet for a second term: a new WBUR poll shows him with big leads over each of his would-be Democratic opponents. Newton Mayor Setti Warren (D) comes closest, and he trails Baker in this poll by 34 points.\n\n* As if Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) doesn't already have enough problems, the Federal Election Commission contacted his campaign committee this week about potentially illegal contributions he received in 2017. The FEC sent the letter to Nunes' campaign treasurer, who also happens to be his mother.\n\n* Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) is heavily favored in Utah's U.S. Senate race this year, but he's not running unopposed. State Rep. Mike Kennedy kicked off his Republican primary bid this week.\n\n* And the Pew Research Center published an interesting new polling report this week, which found that Democrats now enjoy a 27-point lead against over Republicans among Millennial voters. As recently as 2014, the Dems' advantage with these same voters was 16 points.",

                "body": "Donald Trump's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, led by Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, announced in January that it would effectively ignore Obama-era safeguards protecting consumers from predatory payday lenders.\n\nSlate reported soon after, \"Last week, the CFPB dropped a lawsuit in Kansas against four payday lenders without any explanation, other than a weak assurance that it would continue investigating the case. Meanwhile, International Business Times reports today that Mulvaney stealthily closed an investigation into a South Carolina-based payday lender, World Acceptance Corporation, which had previously donated to his campaigns.\"\n\nIn February, after the CFPB spent years building a case against one controversial payday lender, Mulvaney dropped the case. Reuters reports today that the pattern continues.\n\nThe top cop for U.S. consumer finance has decided not to sue a payday loan collector and is weighing whether to drop cases against three payday lenders, said five people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe move shows how Mick Mulvaney, named interim head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) by U.S. President Donald Trump, is putting his mark on an agency conceived to stamp out abusive lending.\n\nI'm starting to think Mulvaney doesn't much care about alleged abuses among payday lenders.\n\nIndeed, I don't think I'm alone. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that Janet Matricciani, the former CEO of a payday lender, reached out to Mulvaney personally, asking him to consider her to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nTo help bolster her credentials, Matricciani explained that the CFPB actually investigated her former employer's lending practices. \"I have indepth (sic) experience of what a CFPB investigation is like, and so I am in an unparalleled position to understand the effect of various CFPB actions on a company, its workforce, its customers and the industry,\" she wrote.\n\nIn the Obama era, this would've been pointless. Now that the CFPB has become more payday-lender friendly, Matricciani probably assumed it was worth a shot?\n\nPostscript: Leading members of the payday lending industry will host their annual retreat in South Florida next month.

                "body": "Donald Trump delivered a speech in New Hampshire last week on the U.S. response the opioid crisis, and while there was no shortage of problems with the president's vision, it was his call for increased executions that stood out.\n\nAbout midway through the remarks, Trump insisted that policymakers need to approve new laws to empower the government to kill drug dealers. \"Unless you have really, really powerful penalties, led by the death penalty for the really bad pushers and abusers, we are going to get nowhere,\" he declared.\n\nIt was an unfortunate argument for all sorts of reasons, though MSNBC's Danny Cevallos highlighted one of the most important: capital punishment is already available for drug traffickers in the federal criminal justice system. It's just not used.\n\nAnd as Slate's Mark Joseph Stern explained, that's where Jeff Sessions comes in.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions played along, issuing a memo in which he \"strongly encourage[d] federal prosecutors\" to seek capital sentences \"for certain drug-related crimes,\" including those that do not involve murder.\n\nSessions' memo might be disturbing if it weren't so pathetic. He must know that his entreaty will not lead to a single execution, but instead - at most - to millions of taxpayer dollars spent litigating appeals.\n\nSo why did the attorney general issue the memo? Probably because Sessions is still looking for ways to make Trump happy.\n\nRemember, the president hasn't exactly hid his frustrations with the attorney general following Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Trump reportedly threw an Oval Office tantrum in the spring, during which he called Sessions an \"idiot,\" in part because he wanted the attorney general to protect him from the Russia scandal, which became impossible when Sessions recused himself.\n\nIn the months that followed, Trump's frustrations with the Alabama Republican didn't fade. In September, the president hosted a dinner with conservative leaders, and when the conversation turned to Sessions, the president's comments were \"dripping with venom.\" It was just one of many incidents in which Trump blasted his attorney general.\n\nLast month, the president tweeted that Sessions' approach to the White House's political enemies is \"DISGRACEFUL.\"\n\nIt's against this backdrop that Sessions keeps looking for new ways to prove his obedience. Trump wants his perceived opponents in the FBI to be ousted? There's Jeff Sessions, leaning on the FBI director to make personnel decisions that would make the president happy. The White House wants to convince the public that immigrants are a national security threat? There's Jeff Sessions, releasing a wildly misleading report about terrorism.\n\nTrump wants increased federal scrutiny of Democrats? There's Jeff Sessions, assuring Republicans that the Justice Department is taking their anti-Clinton theories seriously. Trump is whining about governmental leaks? There's Jeff Sessions, announcing a crackdown on leakers. Trump has a partisan vision about attacking so-called \"sanctuary cities\"? There's Jeff Sessions, threatening some of the nation's largest municipalities with subpoenas.\n\nThe Washington Post's Aaron Blake made the compelling case in January that it's \"looking more and more like Jeff Sessions is doing Trump's political dirty work.\"\n\nAnd that was before Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, one of Trump's favorite targets.",

                "title": "What Team Trump describes as 'fake news' is often true",
                "body": "Nearly two weeks ago, the New York Times reported that Donald Trump was poised to make significant changes to his legal defense team. A day later, the president accused the newspaper of having \"purposely\" publishing \"a false story.\"\n\nWe now know that the president has reached out to two high-profile D.C. attorneys, neither of whom joined Trump's team, while hiring two Fox News personalities to help with his legal defense. The latest head of his team of attorneys resigned yesterday.\n\nIn other words, the president's denial wasn't true.\n\nAlso this month, NBC News, citing five sources, reported that the White House \"is preparing to replace H.R. McMaster as national security adviser.\" Politico published this item later that day.\n\nThe Trump administration batted down a new report on Thursday that national security adviser H.R. McMaster could be on his way out, with President Donald Trump telling a spokesman for the National Security Council that the article was \"fake news.\"\n\n\"I was just with President Trump and H.R. McMaster in the Oval Office,\" the spokesman, Michael Anton, said in a statement provided to pool reporters. \"President Trump said that the NBC News story is 'fake news,' and told McMaster that he is doing a great job.\"\n\nRaj Shah, the White House principal deputy press secretary, also cast doubt on reports of McMaster's looming departure, telling pool reporters that the administration often dealt with \"rumor and innuendo about senior administration officials.\"\n\nJust last week, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders added that she'd just spoken to Trump and McMaster, explaining, \"[C]ontrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC.\"\n\nYesterday, meanwhile, Budget Director Mick Mulvaney stood at the White House podium and assured the nation that the president \"looks forward to signing\" the omnibus spending bill that passed Congress last night. This morning, Trump said the opposite - and threatened to veto the measure.\n\nMy point is not that one should necessarily ignore literally everything the White House says. When Trump and/or one of his spokespersons praise Vladimir Putin, for example, it matters. When they threaten war with a foreign rival, we have to pay attention. When they defend white supremacists, no one should just look the other way.\n\nBut Team Trump frequently reminds us of one unmistakable truth: the White House is not a reliable source of accurate information, even about its own positions and plans.",

                "body": "Fox News' Juan Williams joked on the air last week that he sees Donald Trump's White House as a reality-television program - and if you want to make it onto the show, you have to be in a Fox News green room \"because apparently that's the staging area.\"\n\nPerhaps Williams wasn't kidding.\n\nLess than an hour after President Trump named John R. Bolton as his new national security adviser on Thursday, Mr. Bolton made an appearance in the venue where many Americans, including Mr. Trump, have come to know him over the past decade: Fox News.\n\n\"I think I still am a Fox News contributor,\" Mr. Bolton, laughing, told the host Martha MacCallum at the start of a previously scheduled interview.\n\n\"No,\" Ms. MacCallum clarified. \"You're not.\"\n\nYou can't blame him for being a bit confused.\n\nTrump's new White House national security advisor was, up until yesterday afternoon, a Fox News personality. Indeed, Bolton appears to have been offered his new job at least in part because the president thinks he's \"good on television.\"\n\nJoe diGenova, the new member of the president's legal defense team, is also a Fox News personality, and he was joined on the team yesterday by his wife, Victoria Toensing, who is - let's all say it together - a Fox News personality. (Trump has also reportedly turned to Jeanine Pirro, a Fox News host, for legal guidance.)\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told Rachel on the show last night, \"I'm concerned the president's world is confined now to watching Fox News... Aside from his insular existence in the Oval Office, Fox is his whole world.\"\n\nWell, not his whole world: Trump hired television host Larry Kudlow to be the head of the White House National Economic Council - and Kudlow worked for CNBC.\n\nThe larger point, of course, is that the president's TV remote remains the most important tool in the United States.\n\nFollowing up on our coverage from a couple of weeks ago, one of the staples of this presidency is that Trump is moved by what he sees on his TV screen. This is especially true on personnel decisions.\n\nFox News' Heather Nauert is now a key official at the State Department (who was recently promoted). Fox News' K.T. McFarland was Trump's deputy national security advisor. Fox News' Monica Crowley was chosen to work at the National Security Council before a controversy forced her departure. Fox News' Jonathan Wachtel was named the spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations. Fox News contributors such as Ben Carson and Elaine Chao are already in the president's cabinet, and now CNBC's Larry Kudlow will be the top economic voice in the White House.\n\nEven Jay Sekulow, a top member of Trump's legal defense team, has no relevant experience working on the issues he's tackling now, but he has maintained a very high profile in recent years on conservative media, which very likely helped get him his current gig.\n\nThe Washington Post joked last year, \"The Trump revolution won't just be televised. It will be led by television talking heads.\" It's even truer now than it was then.\n\nWhat's more, it's not just personnel. The president met with Veterans Affairs Sec. David Shulkin recently, and when their conversation turned to pending V.A. health care legislation, Trump reportedly called a Fox News personality, Pete Hegseth, \"to get his opinion\" of the bill. (Hegseth may soon replace Shulkin.)\n\nWhen proponents of steel tariffs launched a lobbying campaign, they ran TV ads where they thought Trump might see them. When Kristian Saucier wanted a presidential pardon, he went on Fox News to ask for one - and received one soon after. When White House aides wanted to convey to Trump that the indictments of 13 Russian operatives was not good news, they went to cable news in order to shape the president's understanding of the developments.\n\nForeign diplomats have urged their governments' leaders to appear on American television \"as a means of making their case to Trump.\"\n\nFollowing up on an item from last year, I should emphasize that as a rule, I'm not at all inclined to criticize those who watch a lot of cable news. It just so happens that I work for a cable-news television show and get paid by a cable-news network.\n\nThat said, it's also fair to say that while we've had media-conscious presidents in American history, we're never seen someone with the kind of obsession Trump has. To get a job on Team Trump, go on TV. To get a message to the president, go on TV. To influence the direction of the White House, go on TV.\n\nThis isn't how the executive branch of a global superpower is supposed to work.",

                "body": "Part of the problem with the revolving door in Donald Trump's White House is the turmoil itself. An administration cannot expect to function effectively when a president is constantly hiring and firing new officials for powerful executive-branch posts.\n\nBut the other part of the problem is that each of Trump's recent changes have been changes for the worse. Rex Tillerson is being replaced by Mike Pompeo; Gary Cohn is being replaced with Larry Kudlow; and as we learned late yesterday, H.R. McMaster is being replaced with John Bolton.\n\nI'm reluctant to refer to Tillerson, Cohn, and McMaster as the administration's \"grown-ups,\" since they were often wrong, ineffectual, and marginalized. I prefer to think of them as the president's training wheels.\n\nTrump has never been graceful, and he still struggles to steer straight. Observers, even those who want to see him reach his destination, routinely feel the need to cover their eyes when they're not burying their heads in their hands. But officials like Tillerson, Cohn, and McMaster generally made an effort to help prevent total wipeouts. They recognized their president's many limitations, and often made credible efforts to keep him from falling.\n\nThis is especially true of McMaster, who tried to help the president be more responsible on everything from NATO to Russia to North Korea. When Trump threatened our South Korean allies, it was McMaster who reached out to tell them to ignore his erratic boss.\n\nThe president, however, didn't appreciate McMaster's maturity. I'm reminded of this Politico piece published a month ago:\n\nTheir strained relationship was on rare public display over the weekend when the president chastised his national security adviser for telling a crowd at the Munich Security Conference that evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 election was \"incontrovertible.\"\n\n\"General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems,\" Trump tweeted.... The president's chiding of McMaster marked the first public break between the two, whose clashes and disagreements have heretofore taken place behind closed doors.\n\nIn hindsight, this was probably the beginning of the end. McMaster told the truth about Russia, Trump didn't like it, and the rumors about McMaster's ouster began almost immediately thereafter.\n\nAs a consequence, the job will now go to John Bolton - a ridiculous choice - who will be the president's fourth pick for the White House national security advisor in 14 months. Mike Flynn, of course, was Trump's first pick, and he was ousted for lying to the FBI about his communications with Russia. Retired Navy Vice Adm. Robert Harward was offered the job soon after Flynn's departure, but he turned Trump down.\n\nThe position then fell to McMaster, who did his best for about a year, and now Bolton. If you thought Trump's team couldn't be a more embarrassing mess in 2017, you may be surprised at how much worse things will get in 2018.",

                "body": "Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/22/18, 9:26 PM ET McFaul on Trump pick Bolton: What he believes in is very scary Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, talks with Rachel Maddow about his concerns about Donald Trump's choice of John Bolton as H.R. McMaster's replacement as national security adviser. Donald Trump was a nontraditional presidential candidate, and not just because major American political parties don't usually nominate inexperienced gameshow hosts to the nation's highest office. What also helped Trump set apart was his willingness to ignore several key elements of his party's orthodoxy - either because he didn't know what Republicans thought about key issues, or because he didn't care.\n\nThe result was an idiosyncratic platform in which the nominee of a far-right GOP spoke openly about his opposition to entitlement cuts, despite his party's support for them. Trump also voiced support for higher taxes on the wealthy, despite his party's opposition to them. The same Republican candidate vowed to get tough on Wall Street, combat corruption, bring health care coverage to all Americans, and keep Goldman Sachs insiders at arm's length - all positions that put him at odds with the contemporary GOP.\n\nThe sincerity and depth of Trump's positions were open questions. It was nevertheless obvious that in some key areas, he at least claimed he wouldn't be doctrinaire.\n\nBut perhaps Trump's most striking break with Republican orthodoxy came on foreign policy. Donald Trump seemed to genuinely believe in a non-interventionist vision for the U.S. role in the world. He repeatedly mocked the war in Iraq, made clear he had no use for a Bush/Cheney-style approach to international affairs, and dismissed those who disagreed as useless fools.\n\nAfter Inauguration Day, it didn't take long for Trump to betray the broader vision he sold to the electorate, abandoning practically every position that set him apart from traditional GOP leaders, but on foreign policy, the perfidy took longer.\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon, however, the duplicitous campaign reached its endpoint. I'm reminded of something The Atlantic's Conor Friedersdorf wrote a few weeks ago in response to rumors that John Bolton would soon replace H.R. McMaster as the White House national security advisor:\n\nThe problem isn't just that Bolton is singularly ill-suited for the role - he also represents a set of views diametrically opposed to the policies that helped the president secure his job. Trump won the GOP primaries and the White House in part by taking the position that the Iraq War was a dumb waste of American lives and resources.\n\nBolton, meanwhile, not only celebrated the disastrous war during the Bush era, he also continues to insist it was a wise decision, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWhich only helps underscore why Bolton, an outlandish conspiracy theorist with an abusive temperament, is a truly ridiculous choice for this powerful White House post: his bizarre, ultra-hawk worldview is largely the opposite of what Candidate Trump promised to pursue before the election.\n\nIndeed, if you're a voter who helped elect Trump because of his non-interventionist platform, I have some spectacularly bad news for you. Slate's Jim Newell once described Bolton as \"a madman whose only wish is to bomb Iran into oblivion\" - which isn't altogether fair because Bolton also wants to bomb North Korea into oblivion.\n\nThis isn't complicated: non-interventionist presidents do not hire warmongers to guide the White House on matters of national security.\n\nThe Donald Trump voters saw in 2016 has been slowly disappearing for a year and a half. The John Bolton announcement means that iteration of Trump is truly gone.",

The Senate has until tomorrow at midnight to prevent a shutdown.\n\n* The banking angle to this story matters: \"Stormy Daniels' lawyer is demanding that the Trump Organization preserve all records related to the adult film actress and he plans to subpoena them - citing 'unmistakable links' between President Donald Trump's company and a secrecy agreement she signed.\"\n\n* I sure hope you saw Rachel's segment on this: \"A cooperating witness in the special counsel investigation worked for more than a year to turn a top Trump fund-raiser into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to interviews and previously undisclosed documents.\"\n\n* Border Patrol: \"President Trump has called for a wall along the border with Mexico to stop undocumented immigrants and drugs from entering the United States.

                "title": "After more than two decades, Congress clarifies limits on gun research",
                "body": "The day after the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), a longtime opponent of new gun measures, said Congress needs to \"take a breath and collect the facts.\" The Republican leader added, \"We don't just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.\"\n\nThe trouble, of course, has been that access to facts and data has been severely limited by something called the Dickey Amendment, approved in the 1990s, which effectively made it impossible for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to study gun violence.\n\nMore than two decades later, we're starting to see an overdue change. This gets a little complicated, but the new omnibus spending measure addresses this is an important way. The Washington Post reported:\n\nAccompanying the $1.3 trillion spending bill that the House passed Thursday afternoon is language that may open the door slightly to restoring federal funding for gun research.\n\nThe language, which is still pending passage in the Senate, clarifies that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can indeed conduct research into gun violence.\n\nThis probably sounds a little confusing. After all, if the Dickey Amendment blocked researchers from studying gun violence, and the amendment is still in place, what changed?\n\nThe answer, evidently, is new language lawmakers have agreed to that clarifies how the Dickey Amendment should be interpreted.\n\nLet's back up for a minute. When Arkansas Republican Jay Dickey first crafted his amendment in 1997, he didn't explicitly ban research on gun violence. Rather, what his measure said that no CDC funds could be \"used to advocate or promote gun control.\"\n\nFor CDC researchers, however, that language was far too vague to be useful. After all, if they did a study on gun violence that Congress perceived as \"advocacy\" for new gun policies, their work could end up being inadvertently illegal. As a result, Dickey's policy - which he later regretted - had a chilling effect on research, to the public's detriment.\n\nFast forward 21 years and we find lawmakers looking for official data that doesn't exist - because they've effectively handcuffed those who'd provide the information policymakers want and need. The result is a compromise of sorts: the CDC still can't advocate in support of new gun policies, but the new policy stipulates that officials can do gun research, and the collection of data won't run afoul of the legal limits.\n\nIt's not a big shift, but it's a shift.\n\nMark Rosenberg, who directed research on firearm violence at CDC in 1997 when the Dickey Amendment was passed, and saw his staff and research projects slashed almost immediately, told the Post, \"It's recognition by Congress after all these years that, 'Yes, we want to know what the science has to tell us.' It recognizes that science has a tremendous amount to contribute, and that science can be a common ground where both sides come together.\"\n\nAnd speaking of modest measures, the omnibus spending bill also includes the Fix NICS measure we discussed last month. It's admittedly not much, but when it comes to federal gun policies, it's a start.",

                "body": "Just 12 days ago, the New York Times reported that Donald Trump was \"in discussions\" with Emmet Flood, a veteran D.C. lawyer who has the kind of background and expertise the president desperately needs. He neglected to tell his current attorneys about his outreach to a new one.\n\nA day later, Trump insisted that that everything was fine with his private legal team, which is overseeing Trump's defense in the Russia scandal. He added, \"I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job.\"\n\nAnd yet, here we are, watching the lead attorney on the president's team resign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's personal lawyer, who has been providing counsel to the president on the Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, said Thursday that he has resigned.\n\nIn a brief statement to NBC News, attorney John Dowd confirmed his move and said, \"I love the president and wish him very well.\"\n\nDowd's resignation comes less than a week after he issued a bizarre call for the end of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, and three months after Dowd made the curious assertion that the president is literally incapable of obstructing justice.\n\nThis is the second time Trump has lost the lead attorney on his defense team, following Marc Kasowitz's demotion last year.\n\nWhat we're left with is a striking set of circumstances: as the Russia scandal intensifies, and the special counsel's team flips key witnesses, the president's team of attorneys is becoming an embarrassing mess.\n\nTrump recently hired Joe diGenova for his legal defense - again without telling anyone - because the president liked what the far-right conspiracy theorist said on television. Trump has already reportedly turned to Fox News' Jeanine Pirro for legal guidance.\n\nThe president still has Ty Cobb - despite his reported classes with the White House counsel's office - who's perhaps best known for his false predictions about the end of the investigation and his candid remarks about the probe at an outdoor table at a restaurant outside the New York Times' D.C. bureau. (Cobb, who may soon be fired, also has some unfortunate email habits.)\n\nOf course, there's also Jay Sekulow, who has no business even trying to do this kind of work - he led TV preacher Pat Robertson's legal group, where he worked on issues like school prayer - and who's embarrassed himself on national television while talking about the controversy.\n\nIt's against this backdrop that competent attorneys have turned the president down.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but Trump is facing a serious scandal of historic significance, which may very well bring his presidency to a premature end. He needs the best legal defense possible.\n\nInstead, Trump's efforts to assemble a capable legal defense team have become one of the biggest debacles of his presidency - and given the scope of his failures, that's no small feat.",

Phil Bryant (R) announced yesterday that he's appointing Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) to replace Sen. Thad Cochran (R), who's stepping down from the Senate for health reasons.\n\n* In the Democratic primary in Illinois' 3rd district, did the state's open-primary system help Rep. Dan Lipinski fend off a progressive challenge from Marie Newman? Maybe.\n\n* In Missouri, the Democratic-affiliated Senate Majority PAC is making a six-figure ad buy in support of Sen. Claire McCaskill (D), launching a new ad tying state Attorney General Josh Hawley (R) to the state's scandal-plagued governor, Eric Greitens (R).\n\n* On a related note, Hawley's campaign is welcoming support from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), but Hawley still won't commit to backing McConnell for the GOP leadership post.\n\n* In California, a new statewide poll from the Public Policy Institute of California shows Gavin Newsom (D) with a solid lead in the Golden State's gubernatorial race. The same survey shows Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) with a 26-point lead over her Democratic rival, Kevin de Leon, in this year's Senate race.\n\n* And while Donald Trump hasn't commented on the Cambridge Analytica controversy, he seemed to point in that direction this morning, tweeting, \"Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore!\"",

                "body": "Joe Biden has made clear on many occasions that he isn't fond of Donald Trump. In fact, the former vice president has mentioned more than once than he'd like to beat up the current president over Trump's treatment of women.\n\nIt came up again this week when Biden, who may be eyeing the 2020 race, appeared in Miami and referenced Trump's \"Access Hollywood\" tape. \"A guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, 'I can grab a woman anywhere, and she likes it,' \" Biden said. \"They asked me if I'd like to debate this gentleman, and I said 'no.' I said, 'If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.' \"\n\nThe former vice president added, \"I've been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life. I'm a pretty [darn] good athlete. Any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest S.O.B. in the room.\"\n\nBecause Trump is Trump, he returned fire this morning through his favorite medium.\n\nPresident Donald Trump took a jab at Joe Biden on Thursday, blasting the former vice president on Twitter as \"weak, both mentally and physically\" and vowing that if they actually fought he \"would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.\"\n\nIn a scathing early-morning tweet, Trump responded to earlier insults from Biden and wrote that \"Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy.\"\n\n\"Don't threaten people Joe!\" the president added.\n\nIf we put aside chatter about who might win such a fight - or how much money might be generated in a pay-per-view event - what we see are two septuagenarians arguing at great distances about who would beat up whom. One is a 71-year-old president, the other is a 75-year-old former vice president.\n\nI'll go out on a limb here at say no one benefits from these hollow, chest-thumping displays of machismo. Biden needs to understand that addressing the societal scourge of mistreatment of women requires more than fistfights with abusive men, and Trump should understand that he's supposed to be the president of the United States.\n\nWatching the back and forth, Vox's Ezra Klein raised a good point this morning: \"Imagine a black man as president, tweeting about who they'd like to beat the hell out of, and what would result.... When Obama was president, the pressure on him for emotional restraint created an ongoing comedy series about his 'anger translator' Luther.\"\n\n(If you haven't seen Key & Peele's series of \"anger translator\" sketches, this was the first-ever installment. Please note, the language in the clip isn't even close to being safe for work.)\n\nIt's a case study in privilege. Trump apparently doesn't think twice about his antics, boasting not only about being able to beat up rivals, but also about his ability to beat up mad gunmen. It was just last month when the president said, in reference to the mass shooting in Parkland, \"I really believe I'd run in there - even if I didn't have a weapon.\"\n\nBarack Obama never had the luxury of saying nonsense like this.",

                "title": "Former CIA chief questions whether Russians 'have something on' Trump",
                "body": "As Donald Trump's presidency has progressed, several prominent former officials, who've held some of the nation's top security and intelligence posts, have been unguarded in criticizing the Republican.\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, for example, is on record questioning Trump's \"fitness\" for office and his \"access to nuclear codes.\" Clapper added that the president exhibits a \"complete intellectual, moral, and ethical void.\"\n\nMore recently, retired four-star Army General Barry McCaffrey, an NBC News analyst, wrote on Twitter, \"Reluctantly I have concluded that President Trump is a serious threat to US national security.... It is apparent that he is for some unknown reason under the sway of Mr Putin.\"\n\nAnd yesterday, former CIA Director John Brennan appeared on MSNBC and raised eyebrows with a similar assertion, suggesting, in reference to Trump, that Vladimir Putin's government \"may have something on him personally.\" Brennan added, \"The Russians, I think, have had long experience with Mr. Trump, and may have things that they could expose.\"\n\nWhat made Brennan's comments stand out as important, however, wasn't just the intensity of the criticisms. Given his previous role atop the Central Intelligence Agency - and the timing of his tenure - the New York Times reported that Brennan's interview set off \"furious speculation about whether the former spy chief was basing that assertion on inside information.\"\n\nMr. Brennan was running the C.I.A. when a salacious dossier surfaced in 2016 that claimed the Russians had compromising information on Mr. Trump. If there were any current or former American officials who might know if there was truth behind the allegations in the dossier, Mr. Brennan would most likely be one of them. And his comments came the day after a phone call Mr. Trump made to Mr. Putin congratulating him for winning an election raised new questions about the president's relationship with Russia. [...]\n\n[L]ast weekend, Mr. Brennan - in response to Mr. Trump's praise for the firing of the former deputy director of the F.B.I., Andrew G. McCabe - issued a remarkable condemnation of the president. \"When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,\" Mr. Brennan wrote on Twitter.\n\nThis, naturally, raises a couple of possibilities.\n\nIt's possible, of course, that Brennan is watching Trump's presidency unfold, and like much of the country, he's appalled by the recent abuses, scandals, and corruption. Maybe the former CIA chief, as a private citizen, is simply engaging in the same kind of speculation - based on public, open-source reporting - many of us consider all the time in the hopes of making sense of the president's behavior.\n\nIt's also possible that Brennan, in his capacity as the former head of the CIA, knows quite a bit more than the rest of us, and when he casually mentioned that Russia \"may have something on\" Trump personally, it wasn't a throwaway line.\n\nIn a written statement, Brennan later told the New York Times, \"I do not know if the Russians have something on Donald Trump that they could use as blackmail.\"\n\nGot it. But do you have reason to suspect they might?",

Claudia Tenney (R-NY) appeared to blame the nefarious \"Deep State\" for ordering a costly dining set for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Talk! Of the Town, an upstate New York local radio show, the New York Republican was asked about the decision to buy a $31,000 dining room set for Carson's office last year. Tenney told the hosts that the \"Ben Carson story is so misunderstood\" before pointing to a no-named staffer of cryptic origin as the culprit.\n\nAfter referencing a conversation with a HUD staffer, the GOP lawmaker specifically said, \"Somebody in the Deep State - it was not one of his people, apparently - ordered a table, like a conference room table or whatever it was for a room.\"\n\nThere are basically three angles to this to keep in mind. First, Tenney, after just a year on Capitol Hill, is quickly developing a reputation as one of Congress' most outlandish members. A month ago, she was the lawmaker who thought it'd be a good idea to argue many mass murders \"end up being Democrats.\" Two weeks earlier, Tenney argued that Democratic reactions to Donald Trump's State of the Union address were \"un-American,\" adding, \"And they don't love our country.\"\n\nThis is not the path an elected official follows if he or she wants to earn respect and credibility.\n\nSecond, in this case, Tenney is factually wrong. Nefarious forces didn't buy Carson's furniture; there's email evidence that the secretary and his wife did.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, far-right Republicans really need to get over this \"Deep State\" stuff. If you haven't heard the phrase, a variety of conservative conspiracy theorists - including the president - apparently believe there are secretive and corrupt federal officials lurking throughout the federal government, quietly working to undermine and delegitimize Trump's presidency.\n\nThe more the phrase has caught on in unhinged circles, the more those who believe in a \"Deep State\" instinctively turn to their conspiracy theory to explain developments they don't like.\n\nTenney may be trying to defend the administration, but she's actually helping prove how silly the conspiracy theory is.",

                "title": "Trump replaces one controversial CDC chief with another",
                "body": "Things didn't go well for Donald Trump's first choice to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald was ousted in January following a handful of embarrassing controversies, including reports that she bought shares in a tobacco company - after she became CDC director.\n\nYesterday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced her successor: Dr. Robert Redfield, a prominent AIDS researcher, is the new head of the CDC. At first blush, Redfield at least has the kind of background one might expect for this position - he's a longtime virologist and physician - and unlike so many other Trump appointees, Redfield wants the agency he'll lead to exist.\n\nBut this choice is not without critics. NBC News reported that Redfield has been accused of overseeing \"shoddy HIV research.\" Former Air Force Lt. Col. Craig Hendrix, a doctor who is now director of the division of clinical pharmacology at Johns Hopkins, worked with Redfield at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and told NBC, \"Either he was egregiously sloppy with data or it was fabricated. It was somewhere on that spectrum, both of which were serious and raised questions about his trustworthiness.\"\n\nBuzzFeed's report went a little further.\n\nRedfield has also been criticized for his discriminatory views on HIV testing. During the 1980s, while serving as chief Army AIDS researcher, Redfield was instrumental in implementing controversial HIV testing policies - including a mandatory HIV screening program at the Department of Defense that barred recruits who tested positive for HIV from military service. He later supported segregating HIV-positive members of the military, a practice that the Department of Defense Inspector General later found violated Army regulations.\n\n\"This pattern of ethically and morally questionable behavior leads me to seriously question whether Dr. Redfield is qualified to be the federal government's chief advocate and spokesperson for public health,\" [Democratic Sen. Patty Murray] said.\n\nIn fairness, the concerns are not universal. The Washington Post reported that Maryland Democrats praised Redfield's selection. Rep. Elijah Cummings called him a \"deeply experienced and compassionate public health physician.\" And former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who sits on the virology institute's advisory board, said, \"It's terrific to have someone who has been such a caring doctor, who has really treated patients and knows what they're going through.\"\n\nHis qualifications and background will not, however, be explored in detail during confirmation hearings - because the head of the CDC is a presidential appointment. Lawmakers have no say in the process.",

                "title": "Why would the Trump administration go after workers' tips?",
                "body": "The idea is called \"tip pooling,\" which may sound harmless, but the Trump administration's approach to the policy would be dangerous for millions of working-class Americans.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration unveiled a proposal to undo Obama-era safeguards, which required employers who pooled tips and gratuities to distribute them back to waitstaff. Under the new plan, employers could \"use workers' tips for essentially any purpose, as long as the workers were directly paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\"\n\nAmong the possible outcomes: employers could legally put some of the pooled tips in their own pocket. The Economic Policy Institute estimated that workers would stand to lose roughly $5.8 billion a year.\n\nAnd as it turns out, the Republican administration came to a similar conclusion. Trump's Department of Labor prepared a study on the possible consequences of the plan, and researchers found significant losses for workers. According to a Bloomberg Law report last month, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and his team were \"uncomfortable\" with the findings, so they \"removed\" the data they didn't like.\n\nYesterday, the story got a little worse.\n\nLabor Department leadership convinced OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to overrule the White House regulatory affairs chief and release a controversial tip-sharing rule without data showing it could allow businesses to skim $640 million in gratuities.\n\nMulvaney sided with Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta over the government's rulemaking clearinghouse - a little-known but critical wing of the White House called the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs - three current and former executive branch officials told Bloomberg Law. That allowed the department to delete from the proposal internal estimates showing businesses could take hundreds of millions in gratuities from their workers.\n\nSo to review, Team Trump unveiled a plan to screw over waitstaff workers. The administration then did a study, didn't like the results, and edited the report to take out the embarrassing parts. Those officials then went to the White House's far-right budget director, who endorsed hiding the data on the administration's plan.\n\nNo, seriously, that's what happened.\n\nYesterday, as the Washington Post reported, Congress intervened.\n\nIn December, the Labor Department proposed a rule that would allow employers such as restaurant owners to \"pool\" their employees' tips and redistribute them as they saw fit -- including, potentially, to themselves. That generated a bipartisan outcry, and the [new omnibus spending bill] spells out explicitly in law that tip pooling is not permitted:\n\n\"An employer may not keep tips received by its employees for any purposes, including allowing managers or supervisors to keep any portion of employees' tips, regardless of whether or not the employer takes a tip credit.\"\n\nUnless something happens in the 11th hour to derail the new government spending bill, the Trump administration's wage-theft, I mean, tip-pooling plan will not be implemented, at least not anytime soon.\n\nThe larger question, though, is why the Republican administration thought this would be a good idea in first place. I also wonder how many tipped workers across the country voted for Donald Trump, not realizing that he and his team would soon go after their gratuities.",

                "title": "FBI authorized perjury investigation into AG Jeff Sessions",
                "body": "As a rule, we tend to think of U.S. attorneys general investigating those accused of possible felonies, not being investigated for committing possible felonies. But as we were reminded yesterday, Jeff Sessions is a special kind of attorney general.\n\nAndrew McCabe, as the FBI's deputy director, authorized an investigation into whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions lied to Congress, three sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nThe investigation ended without criminal charges, according to Sessions's lawyer, and was not known to Sessions last week when he made the decision to fire McCabe, according to a Justice Department official.\n\nABC News was first to report that McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told lawmakers about the probe in a closed-door meeting last year. The inquiry eventually went to special counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed to investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nIn case anyone needs a refresher, we learned a year ago this month that during the 2016 campaign, Sessions, then an Alabama Republican senator, had meetings with Russian officials - for reasons that have never been altogether clear - which he failed to disclose during his Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nAs we discussed the other day, Sessions was specifically asked during sworn testimony about possible evidence tying members of Trump's campaign team to the Russian government during Russia's election attack. \"I'm not aware of any of those activities,\" Sessions said, adding \"I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\"\n\nSessions did, however, have communications with the Russians. Some Democratic senators urged the FBI to take a closer look, and we now know federal law enforcement did exactly that.\n\nIt's worth emphasizing that the investigation, by all accounts, has run its course and Sessions is not facing any legal jeopardy over his controversial testimony. But that doesn't make the story unimportant.\n\nFor one thing, the FBI examination was authorized by former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe - whom Sessions fired last week, less than two days before McCabe's scheduled retirement. Those suggesting the ouster of the bureau's deputy director was part of a political-retribution scheme now have a new data point to bolster their argument.\n\nIndeed, Sessions fired McCabe in part for his reported lack of \"candor,\" which seems ironic given the attorney general's suspect testimony.\n\nWhat's more, there's just something amazing about the circumstances themselves. After all, an attorney general is the nation's top law enforcement official, and it's not at all normal for them to be investigated by the FBI for possible criminal wrongdoing.\n\nBut in Donald Trump's administration, this has become alarmingly common, with several members of the president's cabinet facing investigations of varying degrees of seriousness.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's actions have become the subject of more than one official investigation. There was also HHS Secretary Tom Price, who was also under investigation, right up until the scandal forced his resignation.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke is under investigation. So is HUD Secretary Ben Carson. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley was investigated for violating the Hatch Act. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has been caught up in so many controversies, it's been difficult to keep up with all of them. VA Secretary David Shulkin's ethics mess may yet cost him his job. Now we know Jeff Sessions faced FBI scrutiny.\n\nAnd, of course, the president himself appears to be the subject of an obstruction-of-justice probe.\n\nThis would be a stunning total for an administration in its eighth year. Team Trump has only been in office for 14 months.",

                "body": "It's only been a few months since Republicans approved a massive package of regressive tax breaks, but so far, Democratic predictions about the GOP policy are holding up pretty well.\n\nDemocrats said, for example, that the corporate beneficiaries of the tax breaks would use their windfalls on priorities such as stock buybacks, which is what's happening. Dems said the Republican plan included all kinds of sloppy and consequential errors that would need fixes, which is also happening.\n\nAnd Democrats said that once the tax cuts blow a massive hole in the budget, Republicans will use the mess they created to justify cuts to social-insurance programs that millions of families rely on. And wouldn't you know it, a Bloomberg Politics reporter highlighted this quote yesterday from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.):\n\nPaul Ryan reiterates his call for cutting \"entitlements,\" saying that's the \"name of the game on debt and deficits.\"\n\n\"We're just going to have to keep at it,\" he says.\n\nNow, we're not.\n\nThe idea that the Wisconsin congressman actually cares about \"debt and deficits\" is obviously hard to take seriously. In the Bush/Cheney era, Ryan voted with his party in support of both of George W. Bush's tax cuts, both of George W. Bush's wars in the Middle East, Medicare Part D, and the Wall Street bailout - none of which Republicans even tried to pay for.\n\nMore recently - which is to say, a few months ago - Ryan helped champion a GOP tax plan that adds $1 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.\n\nWith this in mind, no one should be fooled into thinking the House Speaker is genuinely committed to tackling \"debt and deficits.\" Ryan's record obviously points in the opposite direction.\n\nBut what I'm especially interested in is the degree to which the Republican leader's rhetoric bolsters Democratic predictions.\n\nThough the debate over the GOP tax plan was brief, it featured plenty of congressional Dems arguing that Republicans would pass tax cuts for the wealthy, blow up the deficit, and then target Social Security and Medicare, crying about the importance for \"fiscal responsibility.\"\n\nRyan wasted no time confirming Democrats' fears. The Speaker started talking up Medicare cuts in December, and Social Security cuts soon after.\n\nFor proponents of these popular social-insurance programs, Ryan's ambitions are probably alarming, but let's not lose sight of election-year messaging: Democrats want to tell voters that the Republicans' unpopular tax plan represents a threat to celebrated pillars of modern American society such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nAnd whether he intended to or not, the Speaker of the House is effectively endorsing the Dems' line.",

                "body": "Last week, Donald Trump called Larry Kudlow to offer him the job of leading the White House National Economic Council. But during the call, the president apparently took pleasure in the fact that his own team had no idea he was extending the offer.\n\nKudlow told the Wall Street Journal that the president said on the call, \"No one else knows that you and I are having this conversation.\"\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the same thing happened when Trump brought on Joe diGenova, a television pundit and far-right conspiracy theorist, to serve on his legal defense team.\n\nThe hiring caught many of his advisers by surprise, prompting fears that Trump is preparing for bigger changes to his legal team - including possible departures - as he goes on the offensive in the primary legal challenges facing him.\n\nTrump is not consulting with top advisers, including Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and chief White House lawyer Donald McGahn, on his Russia legal choices or his comments about the probe, according to one person with knowledge of his actions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive conversations. He is instead watching television and calling friends, this person said.\n\n\"He is instead watching television\" might as well be the name of the PBS documentary series on Trump's presidency.\n\nBut even putting that aside, I remain fascinated by the number of instances in which Trump blindsides his White House team. Before the president took office, the conventional wisdom was that Trump, a confused amateur with no relevant experience, knowledge, curiosity, or familiarity with the most basic details of government, would rely heavily on his staff, since left to his own devices, the president would obviously have no idea what he's doing.\n\nThose assumptions have fallen short. Trump now seems to enjoy winging it, making major decisions without consulting anyone in the White House, reveling in the chaos.\n\nWhen he declared in his Republican convention speech that he \"alone\" can fix what ails the nation, Trump apparently wasn't kidding.\n\nOr as the Washington Post put it last week, \"The mood inside the White House in recent days has verged on mania, as Trump increasingly keeps his own counsel and senior aides struggle to determine the gradations between rumor and truth.\"\n\nThink about the recent evidence. Trump didn't tell his staff about his latest hires. He didn't tell aides he'd ignore their guidance on what to say to Vladimir Putin. He didn't tell them in advance about his tariffs policy. He didn't involve them in his decision to meet with Kim Jong-un.\n\nAnd those are just some of the most recent examples. As we discussed a few weeks ago, this has become a staple of Trump's presidency. His aides didn't know that he'd denounce a House Republican surveillance bill that the White House supported. The White House staff was also surprised to learn that he'd announced via Twitter that Christopher Wray was his choice to lead the FBI. They were equally startled to read Trump's tweets banning transgender Americans from military service.\n\nWhite House aides also didn't know in advance that Trump would falsely accuse Barack Obama via Twitter of tapping his phone. They also had no idea that the president would tweet news about John Kelly serving as chief of staff. Politico highlighted an instance from early last year in which Trump lashed out at China via Twitter \"while U.S. officials were meeting with a Chinese delegation at the State Department.\"\n\nMy personal favorite was this Associated Press report:\n\nAides to President Donald Trump were in deep talks about how to defuse tensions between Qatar and other Arab nations when the door to the secure room at the White House burst open.\n\nThe urgent message: Trump had just tweeted about Qatar.\n\nOne adviser read the tweet aloud and with that, the policymakers in midconference call had no other choice but to rework their plans to reflect the president's tweeted assertion that Qatar, host to some 11,000 U.S. troops, was funding terrorism.\n\nIt was an accusation against a close U.S. ally that had never been voiced so publicly and with such indelicacy.\n\nA White House official recently complained, \"This is the most toxic working environment on the planet.\" Team Trump is facing a staffing crisis, though under the circumstances, I'm a little surprised it's not worse.",

                "title": "Does Trump understand what an 'arms race' is?",
                "body": "Donald Trump spoke briefly with the press yesterday from the Oval Office, sitting alongside Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, but managed to cover some interesting ground. The American president made headlines, for example, by announcing he'd called to congratulate Russia's Vladimir Putin on his recent election.\n\nBut there was something else about Trump's unscripted comments that stood out for me as, well, a little confusing. From the official White House transcript:\n\n\"I had a call with President Putin and congratulated him on the victory - his electoral victory. The call had to do, also, with the fact that we will probably get together in the not-too-distant future so that we can discuss arms, we can discuss the arms race. As you know, he made a statement that being in an arms race is not a great thing. That was right after the election - one of the first statements he made.\n\n\"And we are spending $700 billion this year on our military, and a lot of it is that we are going to remain stronger than any other nation in the world by far.\n\n\"We had a very good call, and I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future to discuss the arms race, which is getting out of control, but we will never allow anybody to have anything even close to what we have.\"\n\nTo know anything about Trump's rhetorical style is to understand that the president often likes to use phrases he doesn't fully understand. I'm convinced, for example, that he has no idea what a \"witch hunt\" is. The president also talks about \"clean coal,\" without knowing what that means. I don't think he knows what a \"blind trust\" is, either.\n\nAnd now it's probably worth taking a closer look at what an \"arms race\" is - or at least what Trump thinks it is.\n\nTrump began by saying he intends to have a conversation with Vladimir Putin about the arms race. That's not generally the way in which an American president would phrase the issue, but fine.\n\nMoments later, however, Trump seemed to switch gears, bragging about increased U.S. military spending and how pleased he is with the new investments.\n\nAnd then he switched back, saying the arms race \"is getting out of control,\" only to switch once more seconds later, saying, \"[W]e will never allow anybody to have anything even close to what we have\" - which tends to be the kind of rhetoric that encourages an arms race.\n\nSo I suppose my questions for the White House are as follows:\n\n1. What does the president think an \"arms race\" is?\n\n2. Does he think an arms race is good or bad?\n\n3. Does he want to see an arms race escalate or deescalate?\n\nLet's also note that Trump attended a Pentagon briefing last summer and was shown a slide that showed the size of the U.S. nuclear stockpile over the past seven decades. Trump saw the highest point on the chart - a half-century ago, the American stockpile was at 32,000 - and told his team \"he wanted the U.S. to have that many now.\"\n\nThat, of course, was absurd, and officials in the room had to explain there are \"legal and practical impediments\" to such a move. NBC News reported at the time, \"Any increase in America's nuclear arsenal would not only break with decades of U.S. nuclear doctrine but also violate international disarmament treaties signed by every president since Ronald Reagan.\"\n\nIt was soon after that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Trump a \"moron\" - or more specifically, a \"f***ing moron.\"\n\nDo you get the sense the president's understanding of the arms race hasn't become any more sophisticated in the months since?",

                "body": "The confluence of developments yesterday involving women who claim to have had affairs with or been sexually harassed by Donald Trump was rather extraordinary.\n\nFirst, of course, there's Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who received $130,000 in hush money from Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, shortly before the 2016 presidential election. Soon after the president's lawyer insisted that the pre-election payoff had nothing to do with the election, NBC News reported that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, passed a lie-detector test.\n\nSecond, there's Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's reality show, who alleges he made unwanted sexual advances toward her back in 2007. She's now suing the president, and despite Trump's lawyers' efforts, a New York judge ruled yesterday that the case can go forward. Though the decision will be appealed, the possible discovery process in this case offers untold possibilities.\n\nAnd then there's Karen McDougal. A few days before the 2016 election, the Wall Street Journal reported the company that owns the National Enquirer paid the former Playboy centerfold $150,000 for the exclusive rights to her story about her alleged affair with Trump. The tabloid then chose not to publish it.\n\nAnd as the New York Times reported yesterday, she, too, is suing in the hopes of being able to tell the public about her experiences. Her lawsuit is targeting the National Enquirer's parent company,\n\nMs. McDougal, in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims that [Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney] was secretly involved in her talks with the tabloid company, American Media Inc., and that A.M.I. and her lawyer at the time misled her about the deal. She also asserts that after she spoke last month with The New Yorker, which obtained notes she kept on Mr. Trump, A.M.I. warned that \"any further disclosures would breach Karen's contract\" and \"cause considerable monetary damages.\"\n\nNote, that New Yorker piece, written by Ronan Farrow, explained last month, \"[McDougal's] account provides a detailed look at how Trump and his allies used clandestine hotel-room meetings, payoffs, and complex legal agreements to keep affairs - sometimes multiple affairs he carried out simultaneously - out of the press.\"\n\nTaken together, over the course of one afternoon, we saw significant developments in three different controversies about women the president would prefer to keep silent.\n\nThe fine folks behind NBC News' First Read said this morning, \"Your authors have seen A LOT of different stories in the two decades we've covered politics - the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Chandra Levy murder, Mark Foley, the recent Dem/GOP retirements in the wake of the #MeToo Movement. But we've NEVER seen these back-to-back-to-back stories in the span of just hours involving the president of the United States.\"",

We don't get to dictate how other countries operate.\n\nIt wasn't a trick question. Donald Trump's chief spokesperson could've very easily acknowledged international concerns that the Russian elections - in which Vladimir Putin's rivals were not allowed to run - were little more than a sham intended to give the appearance of legitimacy to an autocratic ruler's ongoing reign.\n\nBut that's not what Sanders said. Instead, she dodged, suggesting how other countries conduct their elections are their own business. MSNBC's Kasie Hunt, noting a video clip of the exchange, was exactly right when she wrote, \"This is just a truly astonishing moment coming from the White House podium.\"\n\nI'm especially interested the in selectivity of Team Trump's principles.\n\nWhen Venezuela held its controversial elections in January, Vice President Mike Pence condemned the elections for not being \"free and fair.\" Pence added that the Venezuelan election were \"undemocratic, unconstitutional, and globally opposed,\" and U.S. pressure would continue.\n\nIndeed, last summer, the White House issued a written statement from Trump in which he called for \"free and fair elections\" in Venezuela.\n\nJust last month, meanwhile, the White House criticized elections in Cambodia, which U.S. officials considered so illegitimate, they cut off aid to the Asia-Pacific nation.\n\nCan Sanders explain why it is that when it comes to promoting democracy and fair elections around the world, Team Trump seems to have one standard for Russia, and a different standard for other countries?\n\nPostscript: Mike Pence is scheduled to deliver remarks today to the Organization of American States, and he'll reportedly speak out in support of \"free and fair elections.\" Perhaps the White House hasn't yet told him that the administration is unconcerned with \"how other countries operate.\"",

                "body": "Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/20/18, 9:00 PM ET Against advice, Trump congratulates Putin on sham election win... Carol Leonnig, National Reporter for The Washington Post, talks with Rachel Maddow about new reporting that Donald Trump's advisers explicitly told him not to congratulate Vladimir Putin and to condemn the poisoning of two people in the UK. Trump did the Donald Trump acknowledged yesterday that he'd called Russian President Vladimir Putin in the morning, and it was \"a very good call\" between the two leaders. The obvious follow-up question has become, \"A very good call for whom?\"\n\nThe Washington Post's report on the conversation was amazing.\n\nPresident Trump did not follow specific warnings from his national security advisers Tuesday when he congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his reelection - including a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE,\" according to officials familiar with the call.\n\nTrump also chose not to heed talking points from aides instructing him to condemn the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain with a powerful nerve agent, a case that both the British and U.S. governments have blamed on Moscow.\n\nWhether the American president realizes this or not, this is a delicate moment in U.S./Russia relations. The Kremlin stands accused - by the Trump administration, among others - of recently launching a poison-gas assassination attempt on British soil. The White House also just last week announced sanctions against Russia in response to its attack on our elections.\n\nAnd Russia just held a national election - described by many observers as a \"sham\" - in which Putin's rivals weren't allowed to run.\n\nIt's against this backdrop that White House officials urged Donald Trump to do two things: (1) don't congratulate the Russian autocrat; (2) condemn Russia's actions in the U.K. This is a time for the American president - ostensibly the \"Leader of the Free World\" - to be firm and resolute.\n\nAnd yet, Trump ignored the all-caps guidance, congratulated Putin, and said nothing about the nerve-agent attack or the U.S. election attack.\n\nThe Washington Post's Carol Leonnig told Rachel on the show last night that the American president's call became an \"OMG moment\" inside the White House, as officials tried to digest what had just happened.\n\nIt's possible, of course, that Trump simply didn't read the briefing materials prepared by his own team, which wouldn't come as too big of a surprise, since we already know this president \"rarely if ever\" reads his own intelligence briefings.\n\nIt's also possible that the \"newly emboldened\" Trump saw the all-caps guidance, but the president decided he doesn't care what his own administration's diplomatic and security teams believe is in the nation's best interest.\n\nOr maybe Trump has been compromised in some way and treats Russia, whose illegal intelligence operation helped put the Republican in power, differently than every other country.\n\nWhatever the explanation, there are apparently some folks in the administration who want the world to know what happened.\n\nAs for the larger context, as we recently discussed, the White House was recently eager to insist that when it comes to Russia, Trump has been incredibly \"tough.\" We should all be impressed with his \"toughness.\" Trump's tough toughness, the argument went, has certainly been tougher than that rascally Barack Obama, who was never as tough as Donald \"Tough\" Trump.\n\nThe evidence to the contrary, of course, has long been overwhelming. After yesterday, the claims appear even more ridiculous.",

                "body": "We talked briefly yesterday about the fourth explosion in less than three weeks in Austin, a situation that led Austin Police Chief Brian Manley to tell reporters, \"We are clearly dealing with a serial bomber.\"\n\nToday, the story grew even more serious.\n\nA package that exploded at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio early Tuesday is linked to four blasts in Austin this month, a source briefed on the investigation told NBC News.\n\nTuesday's explosion occurred around 12:25 a.m. local time (1:25 a.m. ET) in the sorting area of a facility in Schertz, Texas, officials said.... [A] source briefed on the investigation later told NBC News that the blasts are linked.\n\nThis afternoon, three weeks after the first incident, Donald Trump \"broke his silence\" on the bombings, telling reporters in the Oval Office, \"This is obviously a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals. These are sick people, and we will get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nWhat struck me as especially notable, however, was a statement from White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who published a tweet on this earlier today. Much of the missive was what you'd expect it to say - the president's spokesperson said Trump \"mourns for victims\" and officials are \"monitoring the situation\" - though Sanders added, \"There is no apparent nexus to terrorism at this time.\"\n\nReally?\n\nI realize there's still an investigation underway, and those responsible have not yet been apprehended, but given what we know, how in the world could a series of bombings in Texas - which have killed two Americans and left others injured - not be considered \"terrorism\"?\n\nIn all likelihood, Sanders probably meant there's no reason to believe the violence in Texas is connected to international terrorist networks. But therein lies a larger point: domestic terrorist threats don't have to come from faraway sources to be terrorism.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said this morning, \"We need to do everything humanly possible to catch this terrorist.\" Right, because this is terrorism.\n\nRepublicans spent the better part of the Obama era insisting that dealing with security issues properly means using specific words and phrases. If that's true, perhaps the Trump White House can agree that this counts as terrorism?",

                "body": "As much of the world no doubt recalls, Donald Trump was recorded in 2005 bragging about committing sexual assaults. The Republican said, among other things, that he kisses women he considers attractive - \"I don't even wait,\" Trump claimed at the time - which he said he can get away with because of his public profile.\n\n\"When you're a star, they let you do it,\" Trump said on the recording. \"You can do anything. Grab 'em by the p -- y.\"\n\nAfter Trump denied having done what he bragged about doing, 11 women came forward to accuse the Republican of sexual misconduct - one of whom, Summer Zervos, is currently suing the president for defamation, after Trump insisted each of his accusers were liars.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried a variety of arguments to make the case go away - the president has denied any wrongdoing - but as of this afternoon, those efforts have failed. The Daily Beast reported:\n\nA Manhattan Supreme Court judge ruled Tuesday that President Trump has to face a defamation lawsuit brought by former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos. Justice Jennifer Schecter wrote that a \"sitting president is not immune from being sued in federal court for unofficial acts,\" citing court precedent that led to President Clinton's impeachment in 1998. Justice Schecter subsequently denied Trump's \"motion to dismiss this case or hold it in abeyance.\"\n\nThis comes as Zervos, who accused Trump last year of sexually harassing her in 2007, sued the president for defamation after he suggested she made up the allegations for \"ten minutes of fame.\"\n\nRemember, the president's legal team argued, among other things, that a case like this one could \"distract a president from his public duties to the detriment of not only the president and his office but also the nation.\"\n\nThough the cases have some important differences, Bill Clinton's lawyers tried a similar tack in the Paula Jones case in the 1990s, and it didn't work out for the sitting president. Indeed, the New York judge cited this case in concluding today, \"No one is above the law.\"\n\nToday's decision will almost certainly be appealed, but in the meantime, the litigation can proceed. Of particular interest is what new information may be revealed by the discovery process.\n\nWatch this space.",

                "title": "Lindsey Graham: If Trump fires Mueller, it might be impeachable",
                "body": "Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has some experience when it comes to presidential impeachment. Twenty years ago, when Republicans impeached Bill Clinton, Graham was a member of the House Judiciary Committee and was one of the impeachment \"managers\" who made the case for removing the president from office.\n\nThis came to mind hearing the South Carolina senator broach the same subject this morning.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Tuesday said that it would \"probably\" be an impeachable offense if President Donald Trump fired special counsel Robert Mueller \"without cause.\"\n\n\"If the President fired Robert Mueller, do you think that would be an impeachable offense?\" conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked the senator in an interview.\n\n\"Probably so, if he did it without cause, yeah,\" Graham replied.\n\nAsked to explain why, the Republican added, \"Well, I think what the President will have done is stopped an investigation into whether or not his campaign colluded with the Russians, what effect the Russians had on the 2016 campaign. I can't see it being anything other than a corrupt purpose.\"\n\nAccording to the online transcript, Graham went on to say, \"I can't think of a more upsetting moment in the rule of law to have an investigator looking at a president's campaign as to whether or not they colluded with a foreign government, what kind of crimes may have been committed. I've seen no evidence of collusion, but to stop investigation without cause, I think, would be a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nWhen Hewitt asked whether he's communicated that message to the president, Graham replied, \"I think I just did.\"\n\nThe GOP lawmaker said over the weekend that if Trump were to fire the special counsel, \"that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we're a rule-of-law nation.\" This morning's comments seemed quite a bit more serious.\n\nAnd while it's certainly notable when a senator starts using the \"i\" word in reference to a president of his or her own party, I wouldn't get too excited just yet.\n\nFor one thing, Trump may not fire the special counsel. The president and his team certainly sent some alarming signals over the weekend, launching a new rhetorical offensive against Mueller, but we don't yet know what will come of this.\n\nSecond, there's little to suggest Lindsey Graham speaks for his party on this. On the contrary, most Republican leaders responded to Trump's weekend escalation with shrugged shoulders, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters this morning that he still doesn't see any need for new legislation to shield Mueller's probe from White House interference.\n\nI suspect Trump will hear about Graham's comments, but is there any reason to believe the president will fear such a dramatic consequence? I rather doubt it.\n\nAnd finally, if Graham believes Trump shouldn't try to stop an investigation by firing a leading law-enforcement official for \"corrupt\" reasons, perhaps someone can refer the senator to Trump's interview last year with NBC News' Lester Holt? Because if memory serves, the president admitted that he fired then-FBI Director James Comey in order to interfere with the investigation into the Russia scandal - something Trump soon after bragged about to Russian officials.",

                "body": "Hillary Clinton spoke at an event in October, and in reference to some of her conservative critics, the former Secretary of State joked, \"It appears they don't know I'm not president.\"\n\nThe line came to mind last night when Fox News' Sean Hannity asked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) whether he has \"any doubt\" that Clinton committed \"crimes\" with her email server protocols. The Republican congressman replied, in apparent reference to the former Democratic official:\n\n\"Well, as you know, our committee continues to look at conspiracy. We are looking at obstruction, we are looking at misleading Congress and also there's the statute in the civil rights code that involves I think abuse of power and using your position to go after someone personally.\"\n\nAfter explaining his committee's ongoing interest in Hillary Clinton, Nunes added, \"The American people expect the intelligence agencies not to be political.\"\n\nHeaven forbid.\n\nAs the interview aired, Politico reported that Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is moving forward with plans \"to subpoena the Justice Department for records gathered by its inspector general in his review of how the FBI handled its 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nThere was a point, shortly before the last presidential election, in which GOP leaders said they expected to spend Clinton's presidency launching one investigation after another. When she lost, some in the party said they didn't care.\n\nIndeed, n Nov. 9, 2016, literally the day after the election, then-House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said his pre-election plans had not changed: he would continue to vigorously pursue Clinton. \"We can't just simply let this go,\" Chaffetz told Fox News in December.\n\nChaffetz may have resigned from Congress, but his sentiment is still shared by many in his party.\n\nIn case anyone's forgotten, Donald Trump - you know, the guy who's actually in the White House, not the 2016 candidate who left public office nearly six years ago - is at the center of multiple scandals of enormous significance. And yet, the House Judiciary Committee has chosen to largely ignore all of the controversies, while the House Intelligence Committee, under Nunes' tutelage, has gone to almost comical lengths to help cover up the Republican president's alleged misdeeds.\n\nClinton remains the star of the GOP's show, and not just on Capitol Hill. Donald Trump tweets about her regularly, including three times this past weekend. During a recent speech, the president said he wants to send Americans to Mars - unlike Clinton. During a recent press conference alongside Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, Trump made multiple references to his former rival.\n\nIn January, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway insisted, \"Nobody here talks about her. Nobody here talks about Hillary Clinton, I promise you.\"\n\nOf course not. Why would anyone think otherwise? What could possibly lead anyone to think the president and his party have some kind of unhealthy fixation on the former Democratic candidate?",

                "body": "In any major piece of legislation, flaws are practically inevitable, and even careful policymakers often don't notice the errors until a new law takes effect. With this in mind, perhaps it's unsurprising that the Republicans' regressive new tax plan is riddled with dozens of mistakes.\n\nIn this case, however, the details matter. While some errors are probably unavoidable, GOP lawmakers were unusually careless in throwing together their reckless tax breaks for the wealthy, effectively scribbling the legislative text on the back of envelopes filled with campaign contributions.\n\nAsked to describe the scope of the mistakes in the Republican tax law, Marty Sullivan, chief economist at the non-partisan Tax Analysts, told Politico, \"This is not normal. There's always this kind of stuff, but the order of magnitude is entirely different.\"\n\nFixing these mistakes will require congressional action, and wouldn't you know it, the Democrats who locked out of the process last fall don't seem especially eager to cooperate now. The Washington Post reported over the weekend:\n\nRepublicans aiming to use an upcoming spending bill to fix a glaring problem with their recently passed tax overhaul are running into a wall with Democrats, who were shut out of the tax law process and now don't want to cooperate unless they get something in return. [...]\n\nDemocrats aren't willing to go along so easily. They say they warned Republicans that pushing through the law in a matter of weeks - without public hearings - would result in problems and unintended consequences. And now that such issues are emerging, some Democrats resent being asked to lend their votes to a solution.\n\nThat's not the funny part. Rather, what's truly amazing is the Republicans' incredulity.\n\nAxios had a great report on this yesterday, noting that after the Affordable Care Act became law, and officials found technical glitches, Republicans refused to consider even the modest fixes. Now, many of those same GOP lawmakers seem astonished that Democrats are returning the favor.\n\n\"Surely Democrats have to understand that when you make a mistake like that, it ought to be fixed without bargaining with them on something else,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said.\n\nAs best as I can tell, he wasn't kidding.\n\nLook, the comparison even isn't altogether fair to Democrats. When the health care law was considered, it went through a lengthy process featuring hearings, meeting, forums, and debates. Republicans weren't just invited to participate in the policymaking process, Democrats actually incorporated several dozen GOP amendments into the law itself.\n\nWhen Republicans then refused to consider technical fixes, the GOP was simply being spiteful, trying to undermine the federal law, on purpose, in the hopes that the system would be less effective for the public.\n\nRepublicans who blocked Democrats from having any role whatsoever in shaping the new tax law, meanwhile, are suddenly appalled by Dems' reluctance to simply go along with GOP-proposed fixes.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said, \"Most of the ACA stuff, we kind of wanted to undo the whole thing. This is a technical, unintended consequence that has broad ramifications for both Democrats and Republicans.\"\n\nYes, and there were technical, unintended consequences in the health care law that had broad ramifications for both Democrats and Republicans - and John Thune nevertheless rejected any effort to correct those errors.\n\nIt's as if GOP lawmakers believe there should be two entirely different governing standards for the parties: a harder one for Democrats, an easier one for Republicans.\n\nFor Dems to go along with this would be folly.",

                "body": "After the 2010 Census, Pennsylvania Republicans crafted a gerrymandered congressional map that was tough to defend. As regular readers may recall, the GOP-led state legislature took an evenly divided state, drew up 18 congressional districts, and put 13 of them safely in Republican hands.\n\nIt created a dynamic in which Democratic candidates won 51% of the vote in Pennsylvania, but received only 28% of the power.\n\nThe state Supreme Court rejected that map - calling it \"clearly, plainly, and palpably\" unconstitutional - and ended up unveiling a better map of its own. Republicans still have an advantage under the new district lines, but it's not nearly as outrageous as the GOP's previous version.\n\nTo put it mildly, Republican officials weren't satisfied, and when they weren't threatening to impeach state Supreme Court justices, they filed lawsuits. Yesterday, those efforts failed.\n\nPennsylvania Republicans were handed a pair of defeats Monday in their quest to keep old congressional maps in place for the 2018 midterms, potentially giving Democrats a boost when it comes to winning back the House in November.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined a request from Republican leaders to put the new congressional district map, imposed last month by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, on hold. Earlier Monday, in a separate case, a panel of federal judges dismissed a legal challenge by Republican congressmen to the new map.\n\nThere are no additional appeals. The court-drawn map will be the one in place for this year's midterm elections.\n\nWhy should voters outside of the Keystone State care? Because this one development is likely to have a significant impact on which party has political power in the coming years.\n\nVox sketched out the net impact of Pennsylvania's new, un-gerrymandered map:\n\n* It creates two new districts where Democrats are favored that didn't exist in the previous map (and in one of those, they're overwhelmingly favored).\n\n* It keeps the same number of very closely divided swing districts that existed before (three).\n\n* It changes one district that had been overwhelmingly Republican to be one where the GOP is favored but not entirely certain to win (Trump won the new district by about 9 points).\n\n* Overall, it reduces by one the number of safe Republican districts (where Trump won by more than 15 points), and by one the number of lean Republican districts (where Trump won by 5 to 15 points).\n\nSo open seats held by retiring GOP Reps. Pat Meehan and Charlie Dent are more likely to flip, Republican incumbents like Rep. Ryan Costello and Keith Rothfus are now more embattled, and even GOP Rep. Scott Perry is no longer assured of skating to reelection.\n\nTo put this in practical terms, if Conor Lamb's victory is certified, House Democrats will need a net gain of 23 seats to retake the House majority. That's already seen as an attainable goal - there are, coincidentally, 23 seats currently represented by Republicans in districts won by Hillary Clinton - which is made easier by new pick-up opportunities in Pennsylvania.",

                "body": "When it comes to Donald Trump's Stormy Daniels scandal, some of the most interesting revelations come from one of the president's personal attorneys, Michael Cohen. He's the one who quietly created an LLC in 2016 to pay $130,000 in hush money to the porn star, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\n\nIt was Cohen, for example, who publicly confirmed the $130,000 figure. It was Cohen who said he borrowed against his home equity in order to facilitate the payment. And now it's Cohen who's now denying any connection between the pre-election payoff and the election itself.\n\nAttorney Michael Cohen, who has said he paid porn actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about any relationship she might have had with his client Donald Trump, told Vanity Fair that the payment had nothing to do with the 2016 campaign. Cohen also denied he has threatened Daniels.\n\n\"People are mistaking this for a thing about the campaign,\" Cohen told VF. \"What I did defensively for my personal client, and my friend, is what attorneys do for their high-profile clients. I would have done it in 2006. I would have done it in 2011. I truly care about him and the family - more than just as an employee and an attorney.\"\n\nGiven the circumstances, this isn't a surprising argument. As Cohen no doubt realizes, if the hush money was delivered as part of an effort to improve Trump's chances of winning, then it may have been necessary to report the $130,000 as a campaign-related expenditure - and failure to do so may have violated federal election laws.\n\nAnd so, naturally, the president's lawyer is now eager to make the case that this had nothing do with the 2016 campaign. Cohen would've paid hush money to the adult-film actress at any time, the story goes, and it's just a remarkable coincidence that the developments unfolded in late October 2016.\n\nIf it seems difficult to believe Cohen's claims, it's probably because of what we know about the larger context.\n\nLet's not forget what we already know. In the weeks leading up to Election Day 2016, Donald Trump's campaign was already struggling to deal with reports of the Republican's mistreatment of women - he was recorded bragging about sexual assault - when Stormy Daniels was getting ready to talk to the media about her alleged affair with the candidate years earlier.\n\nWith less than a month to remaining, Daniels believed Trump World was late in making its payment to her, and on Oct. 17 - roughly three weeks before Election Day - her attorney was prepared to walk away from the deal altogether.\n\nOn Oct. 27, Daniels received the $130,000, and her planned media blitz was called off. By that point, Election Day was less than two weeks away.\n\n\"People are mistaking this for a thing about the campaign\"? Yeah, imagine that.\n\nAs for the purported threats Daniels has received, Cohen told Vanity Fair he's never spoken to Daniels. Asked whether others in Trump's orbit may have threatened his alleged mistress, Cohen replied, \"I can only speak for myself.... I have never threatened her in any way and I am unaware of anyone else doing so.\"",

                "title": "Trump lawyers get creative, try to 'minimize his exposure' to Mueller",
                "body": "In January, Donald Trump surprised White House reporters with some impromptu comments how much he's looking forward to speaking to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it, actually,\" Trump said, adding that he'd \"love to\" talk to the special counsel investigators. The president went on to say he's \"absolutely\" prepared to answer questions under oath, and he suggested the discussion would happen in roughly \"two or three weeks.\"\n\nThat was two months ago. In the weeks that followed, Trump's lawyers have gone to almost comical lengths to give the appearance of cooperation, without actually agreeing to a presidential Q&A, At one point, the president's defense team considered offering the special counsel's team a written affidavit, signed by the president, \"affirming he was innocent.\" Another possibility would be an on-paper interview - in effect, a take-home exam - in which Trump's lawyers answered Mueller's questions in writing instead of having the president sit down with investigators.\n\nMore recently, Trump's lawyers reportedly offered the special counsel a deal in which Mueller and his team could interview the president, so long as no asked the president any detailed questions, and in exchange, Mueller would agree to end his investigation in 60 days.\n\nAs Rachel noted on the show last night, the Washington Post reported on the latest, unintentionally hilarious offer.\n\nPresident Trump's attorneys have provided the special counsel's office with written descriptions that chronicle key moments under investigation in hopes of curtailing the scope of a presidential interview, according to two people familiar with the situation.\n\nTrump's legal team recently shared the documents in an effort to limit any session between the president and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to a few select topics, the people said.\n\nThe idea is to provide the special counsel with \"a narrative of the White House view\" of key events that are currently under investigation, in order to \"eliminate the need to ask the president\" about the incidents.\n\nYou've got to be kidding me.\n\nInstead of simply cooperating with the probe, Trump's legal team is effectively offering pre-written narrative vignettes about episodes that are the subject of ongoing federal scrutiny. Mueller and his investigators, the theory goes, would read the written narratives, feel satisfied, and find no reason to explore these issues in any detail during an in-person interview.\n\nThe decision, the Post added, is part of \"an effort by Trump's lawyers to minimize his exposure to the special counsel.\" And why, pray tell, would it be necessary to minimize the president's exposure to Mueller? Because Trump's attorneys \"are worried that Trump, who has a penchant for making erroneous claims, would be vulnerable in an hours-long interview.\"\n\nThis dovetails nicely with a New York Times report from early February, which noted the president's defense team is \"concerned\" that Trump, \"who has a history of making false statements and contradicting himself, could be charged with lying to investigators.\"\n\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but the moral of the story isn't subtle. The president's attorneys are aware of the problem the public already recognizes: Donald Trump, just as a matter of course, says things that aren't true. The president lies, habitually, about matters large and small, sometimes to get himself out of a jam, and sometimes for no apparent reason at all.\n\nHaving him sit down with Robert Mueller is therefore profoundly dangerous, leaving Trump's lawyers in an impossible position. If they refuse to cooperate, the president will look guilty. If they agree to an interview, the president is likely to lie to federal investigators, which is a crime.\n\nAnd so Trump's defense team appears to searching for a solution that might accommodate the president's strained relationship with the truth. At this point, given what we know of their offers, the search continues.",

(My personal hunch is that Flood turned the president down.)\n\nAs it turns out, Trump has hired added a member to his legal defense team - but it's not someone of Emmet Flood's caliber.\n\nPresident Trump has decided to hire the longtime Washington lawyer Joseph E. diGenova, who has pushed the theory on television that Mr. Trump was framed by F.B.I. and Justice Department officials, to bolster his legal team, according to three people told of the decision.\n\nMr. diGenova is not expected to take a lead role but will instead serve as a more aggressive player on the president's legal team.\n\nThough Trump hasn't directly confirmed the news, Jay Sekulow, another member of the president's defense team, told NBC News, \"I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the president.\"\n\nAt this point, I imagine some of you are asking, \"Who's Joe diGenova?\" And I'm very glad you asked.\n\nRecently, diGenova has been appearing on television quite a bit - remember, Trump's TV remote dictates a little too much of his presidency - pushing a conspiracy theory about a cabal of FBI agents who manufactured the Russia scandal as part of an anti-Trump plot. This cabal, diGenova has said on Fox News, set out to \"frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.\"\n\nThat's obviously quite nutty given the total lack of evidence to support the claim, but it shouldn't come as a surprise to those who've followed diGenova's career over the last couple of decades. Rachel noted on the show last year that diGenova became a prominent political figure during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, where he peddled all sorts of strange claims during hundreds of television appearances.\n\nYears later, when the right was excited about Benghazi conspiracy theories, diGenova was once again on the airwaves, pushing unsubstantiated claims about the Obama administration intimidating witnesses. He soon after cited secret sources who told him Hillary Clinton would be indicted over her emails and was bound for prison.\n\nMore recently, diGenova was worked up about claims that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice ordered intelligence agencies to cooperate in some kind of illegal scheme involving Donald Trump's communications with his staffers.\n\nAnd against the backdrop of him getting one thing wrong after another, diGenova then started talking up an FBI conspiracy theory - which apparently helped him land a gig on the president's legal team.\n\nObviously, diGenova's track record of pushing strange, right-wing conspiracy theories on television makes it difficult to take him seriously, but because Donald Trump is Donald Trump, the opposite is true in the White House: this president loves those who push strange, right-wing conspiracy theories on television. The same qualities that make Joseph diGenova appear foolish in the eyes of the American mainstream are the very qualities that make him appealing to Trump.\n\nFor those who support the president and want him to succeed, none of this is good news. Trump is facing a serious scandal of historic significance, which may very well bring his presidency to a premature end. He needs the best legal defense possible.\n\nI'm not sure he's getting it. Trump - who already had to replace the former head of his legal team, who seemed completely out of his depth - has assembled a group of attorneys who haven't necessarily served him especially well, and he's now adding a conspiracy theorist whom the president probably saw on Fox News, peddling a strange tale with no basis in fact.\n\nThose who want the best for Trump - those who want to see him benefit from a sound, responsible legal defense - have no reason to be pleased by these developments.",

                "body": "Even before he was elected, Donald Trump made no secret of his support for non-disclosure agreements. It was nearly two years ago that the then-candidate stated his belief that White House officials should sign NDAs.\n\nEvidently, he meant it. Trump required confidentiality agreements of his campaign staff, his transition staff, and according to the Washington Post's Ruth Marcus, his White House staff.\n\nThis is extraordinary. Every president inveighs against leakers and bemoans the kiss-and-tell books; no president, to my knowledge, has attempted to impose such a pledge. And while White House staffers have various confidentiality obligations - maintaining the secrecy of classified information or attorney-client privilege, for instance - the notion of imposing a side agreement, supposedly enforceable even after the president leaves office, is not only oppressive but constitutionally repugnant.\n\nUnlike employees of private enterprises such as the Trump Organization or Trump campaign, White House aides have First Amendment rights when it comes to their employer, the federal government. If you have a leaker on your staff, the cure is firing, not suing.\n\nMarcus spoke to attorney Debra Katz, who has represented numerous government whistleblowers and negotiated nondisclosure agreements, who described Trump's NDAs as \"crazy,\" adding, \"The idea of having some kind of economic penalty is an outrageous effort to limit and chill speech. Once again, this president believes employees owe him a personal duty of loyalty, when their duty of loyalty is to the institution.\"\n\nThe Post columnist obtained a draft of the agreement, which restricts not only what aides can say during their tenures at the White House, but also \"at all times thereafter.\" The NDA goes so far as to include \"works of fiction.\"\n\nThere's a lot to this, but three questions come to mind.\n\nFirst, are these NDAs enforceable? The ACLU believes the answer is no. Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a statement, \"Public employees can't be gagged by private agreements. These so-called NDAs are unconstitutional and unenforceable.\" Whether anyone at the White House will test this assessment is unclear.\n\nSecond, what's with Team Trump and its contempt for transparency? We're not just talking about tax returns and visitor logs anymore. The scope of the secrecy surrounding this presidency is stunning.\n\nAnd third, Marcus concluded with a key question about how Trump oversees his operation: \"Why is he so consistently frantic to ensure that no one knows what goes on behind closed doors?\" Under the circumstances, it's hard not to wonder what it is, exactly, that the president is worried about being exposed.",

That 10-point margin is up from a six-point lead Dems had in the same poll in January.\n\n* At Donald Trump's urging, Danny Tarkanian ended his Republican primary race against Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada. Tarkanian will instead run in the state's 3rd congressional district, which is an open-seat contest. Heller, meanwhile, generally seen as the nation's most vulnerable Senate incumbent, will no longer have a primary rival.\n\n* Speaking of Nevada, Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.) recently wavered on his 2018 plans, but after facing sexual-harassment allegations, the freshman Democrat has ruled out a re-election bid.\n\n* Ahead of tomorrow's primaries in Illinois, the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, generally seen as a far-right group that supports Republicans, is supporting Rep. Dan Lipinski in his Democratic primary with a \"six-figure investment.\"\n\n* And speaking of Illinois, NBC News' First Read reported the other day that candidates in the state's gubernatorial race have already spent more than $65 million - and the general-election phase hasn't even begun in earnest yet. It may become the most expensive non-presidential race in American history.\n\n* In Hawaii, former Rep. Charles Djou announced today that he's no longer a member of the Republican Party. His announcement comes almost exactly a year after Rep. Beth Fukumoto, once considered a rising star in the Hawaii GOP, became a Democrat.\n\n* Remember the Maine Republican state House candidate who lashed out at student activists from Parkland, Fla.? Leslie Gibson, who was running unopposed, has decided to quit his race.\n\n* And according to Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), the chair of the NRSC, Donald Trump will be \"actively campaigning for a Senate majority. Absolutely.\" Time will tell, however, just how many Republican incumbents or challengers will want to be seen with the unpopular, scandal-plagued president.",

                "body": "The fact that the National Rifle Association took a keen interest in the 2016 elections is, at least on the surface, uninteresting. What's far more important is how much the far-right group invested and where the NRA received the money.\n\nAs we discussed a couple of months ago, the NRA took a keen interest in the 2012 election cycle, spending $10 million to boost Mitt Romney's candidacy. Four years later, however, the organization spent triple that to support Donald Trump. What's more, most of money the group spent on the election was spent by part of the NRA's operation that isn't required to disclose its donors.\n\nMcClatchy News reported in January that the FBI is exploring whether \"a top Russian banker with ties to the Kremlin illegally funneled money\" to NRA to help Trump win the presidency. Of particular interest are the activities of Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of Russia's central bank, a close Putin ally, and someone who's faced allegations of money laundering and connections to organized crime.\n\nMcClatchy also reported last week that Cleta Mitchell, a former NRA board member, had \"concerns\" about the group's ties to Russia \"and its possible involvement in channeling Russian funds into the 2016 elections.\" Mitchell later described the reporting as a \"complete fabrication.\"\n\nAnd then there was this Politico report late Friday:\n\nThe Federal Election Commission has launched a preliminary investigation into whether Russian entities gave illegal contributions to the National Rifle Association that were intended to benefit the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, according to people who were notified of the probe.\n\nThe inquiry stems in part from a complaint from a liberal advocacy group, the American Democracy Legal Fund, which asked the FEC to look into media reports about links between the rifle association and Russian entities, including a banker with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt's far too early to say what the inquiry may uncover, though a Slate piece on this added that if FEC investigators \"find compelling evidence to suggest wrongdoing the FEC could possibly refer any findings to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\"\n\nPostscript: The existence of the FEC's investigation seems quite clear. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore), the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and the senator who's arguably taken the most interest into this aspect of the Russia controversy, sent a letter to the gun group last month requesting information.\n\nAn NRA attorney responded that the organization was already \"answering questions about possible Russian donations as part of an FEC inquiry.\"",

                "title": "Trump no longer keeping his distance from Daniels scandal",
                "body": "In general, Donald Trump lashes out, almost instinctively, against all perceived foes. It doesn't much matter who wrongs him - politicians, athletes, entertainers, foreign officials, et al - because the president will respond to practically any slight with an attack of his own.\n\nExcept, oddly enough, Stormy Daniels. To date, the president has said literally nothing - not even a brief tweet - about the adult-film actress who received $130,000 in hush money from his personal attorney. On this one issue, if no other, Trump has somehow managed to become the model of message discipline, maintaining total silence.\n\nThe president's lawyers, however, appear to have plenty to say.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his personal attorney are trying to get a lawsuit by adult film star Stormy Daniels transferred to federal court - and they claim she's on the hook for at least $20 million for violating a secrecy agreement signed just before the election.\n\nAn attorney for the actress accused the Trump team of \"bullying tactics\" for the legal maneuver, which is aimed at pushing the dispute into private arbitration.\n\nAs Rachel noted on Friday's show, Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has already sued Trump in state court, hoping to get out of the non-disclosure agreement that prevents her from talking about her alleged \"intimate\" relationship. It's president's lawyer in this case, Charles Harder, who wants to move the case to federal court, likely as a way of getting the matter into private arbitration.\n\nAnd who's Charles Harder? He's the lawyer who oversaw the case that put Gawker out of business.\n\nAs for the $20 million figure, the existing agreement between the porn star and the president's legal team calls for $1 million in damages for every instance in which Daniels breaches the NDA - and according to Trump's lawyers' latest filing, Daniels has broken the deal at least 20 times.\n\nAll of this, by the way, represents Trump's first direct involvement in the Daniels scandal. We've all suspected from the outset that the president and his alleged relationship was at the center of the story, but it's now his name listed plainly in court filings. As the New York Times reported:\n\nUntil now, Mr. Trump had kept his distance from the legal wrangling, leaving it to his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to take the lead in refuting Ms. Clifford's claims.... When Mr. Cohen brought a temporary restraining order seeking to silence Ms. Clifford in late February, he did so on behalf of a shell company he used to pay her through, not on behalf of Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump's name surfaced in one of two motions his legal team filed Friday in Los Angeles. One, in the name of the shell company, Essential Consultants, sought to move the suit to federal court from Los Angeles Superior Court, where Ms. Clifford filed the suit.\n\nThe second motion, filed on Mr. Trump's behalf, states that he joins Essential Consultants in seeking the change of venue and ends with the statement, \"Mr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent permitted by the law.\"\n\nThe question of whether or not Trump is a party to this case has apparently now been answered.\n\nMeanwhile, Daniels' \"60 Minutes\" interview is still scheduled to air this upcoming weekend. There was some talk last week about the president's lawyers suing CBS, but as of now, that hasn't occurred - and even if there was such a case, it'd be a long shot.",

Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.\n\nSo the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump's campaign in 2016.\n\nWait, it gets a little worse.\n\nIn a separate report, the Times added that while Cambridge Analytica's Alexander Nix has denied any work with Russian companies, the firm partnered with a Russian oil giant - which, for some reason, was \"interested in how data was used to target American voters.\"\n\nThe article went on to note, \"Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what - or which client - prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin's popularity to Russian expansionism.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has asked the firm to turn over \"the emails of any Cambridge Analytica employees who worked on the Trump campaign.\"\n\nMueller's investigators aren't the only ones with questions. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) suggested yesterday that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg may need to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain what the company knew about the misuse of its data \"to target political advertising and manipulate voters.\" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) announced plans for a state-based investigation.\n\nBritish officials, meanwhile, are also demanding an explanation following reports that Facebook accounts were exploited in advance of the UK's \"Brexit\" vote.\n\nFor its part, Facebook continues to insist it did nothing wrong, there was no actual \"breach,\" and Cambridge Analytica's account has been suspended.\n\nFinally, while the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into the Russia scandal seemed to end abruptly last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cambridge Analytica's Nix conducted an interview with the panel via videoconference last week.\n\nAsked about this yesterday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Rep Michael Conaway's (R=Texas) answers were less than clear.",

                "body": "It wasn't long after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was sworn in when he faced a scandal over possible perjury. In fact, we learned a year ago this month that during the 2016 campaign, the Alabama Republican had meetings with Russian officials - for reasons that have never been altogether clear - which he failed to disclose during his Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nIndeed, he was asked specifically about possible evidence tying members of Trump's campaign team to the Russian government during Russia's election attack. \"I'm not aware of any of those activities,\" Sessions said, adding \"I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\"\n\nSessions did, however, have communications with the Russians.\n\nThat was the first time the attorney general faced questions about false testimony. Reuters reported yesterday on the second.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' testimony that he opposed a proposal for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team to meet with Russians has been contradicted by three people who told Reuters they have spoken about the matter to investigators with Special Counsel Robert Mueller or congressional committees.\n\nSessions testified before Congress in November 2017 that he \"pushed back\" against the proposal made by former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos at a March 31, 2016 campaign meeting. Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign's foreign policy team.\n\nSessions, who has already been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team, clearly said in his sworn congressional testimony that he pushed back against suggested meetings between campaign officials and Russians.\n\nThere now appears to be reason to question Sessions' version of events. According to Reuters' report, three people who were on hand for the March 2016 campaign meeting disputed his claims.\n\nAnd while the article didn't identify each of the three sources, it's worth noting for context that George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last fall to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russia, and he's now a cooperating witness in the special counsel's investigation.\n\nIt's impossible to say with any confidence whether Mueller and his team intend to pursue this as an area of legal concern, but it certainly appears to be a problem when an attorney general is accused of giving false sworn testimony - more than once.\n\nWhat's more, let's not forget that Sessions just fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe on Friday night for his lack of \"candor.\"",

                "title": "Seeing Andrew McCabe as a potential 'significant witness'",
                "body": "Andrew McCabe, fired by the Justice Department on Friday night before he could retire 28 hours later, was many things to the White House. McCabe, for example, was the deputy director the FBI - the first to ever be fired. He was also one of the first officials to scrutinize the connections between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and its Russian benefactors.\n\nBut I was especially interested in something McCabe told Politico.\n\n\"[A]t some point, this has to be seen in the larger context,\" said McCabe, 49, who says he has voted for every Republican presidential nominee until he sat out the 2016 contest entirely. \"And I firmly believe that this is an ongoing effort to undermine my credibility because of the work that I did on the Russia case, because of the investigations that I oversaw and impacted that target this administration.\"\n\n\"They have every reason to believe that I could end up being a significant witness in whatever the special counsel comes up with, and so they are trying to create this counter-narrative that I am not someone who can be believed or trusted,\" McCabe added. \"And as someone who has been believed and trusted by really good people for 21 years, it's just infuriating to me.\" [emphasis added]\n\nSeeing McCabe as a witness is a detail that may be familiar to regular readers and TRMS viewers. Early on in Trump's presidency, the president allegedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to go easy on Michael Flynn, the former White House national security advisor. Comey, recognizing the importance of a president possibly obstructing justice during an ongoing investigation, informed a small group of officials.\n\nComey, obviously, was part of the small circle, and he was fired as part of the president's effort to derail the Russia investigation. Then there's Jim Baker, the former FBI general counsel who's still with the FBI, but who's also been ousted from his senior position at the bureau. There's also Jim Rybicki, a two-time chief of staff to the FBI director, who was pushed out earlier this year.\n\nAnd there's Andrew McCabe, who was fired as part of an apparent political vendetta.\n\nOf the six people that we know of who were in the loop with information about Trump's possible obstruction, four have either been sidelined at the FBI or are out of their jobs altogether.\n\nOr put another way, many of those who can corroborate Comey's version of events have themselves been targeted.\n\nAnd as we saw over the weekend, they're still being targeted. Yesterday morning, the president lashed out again at Jim Comey, accusing him of perjury, and soon after, Trump published a follow-up tweet on McCabe: \"Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?\"\n\nThis was in reference to reports that McCabe took notes on his interactions with the president - just as Comey did. What's more, McCabe's notes have also reportedly been turned over the special counsel investigators - just as Comey's notes were.\n\nTrump has no idea what's in those documents, but he's already trying to discredit them. (The fact that the president finds it significant that McCabe didn't write the notes in Trump's presence is kind of hilarious, and emblematic of the president's apparent desperation.)\n\nTrump's anxiety is understandable. For a while, he thought the obstruction question, at least with regards to asking the FBI director to go easy on Flynn, would ultimately be a he-said/he-said: either the president is telling the truth or Comey is. But if McCabe has contemporaneous materials that could help tip the scales, Trump has to expand his universe of law-enforcement personnel whose credibility he needs to attack.\n\nIndeed, I wouldn't surprised if the president remains on the offensive, attacking McCabe, Comey, and other potential witnesses to alleged crimes, if for no other reason than to frame them as political enemies of the White House who have an incentive to embarrass Trump.\n\n\"Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,\" McCabe said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nIt is those events he witnessed that appear to be causing so much anxiety in the Oval Office.",

                "title": "Will Republicans agree to protect Mueller from Trump?",
                "body": "Last August, there was at least some bipartisan support for Senate legislation intended to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller from Donald Trump. At the time, there was considerable chatter about the president possibly trying to fire the head of the Russia investigation - possibly touching off a political crisis - and several members saw value in proactive steps to shield the probe from White House interference.\n\nSoon after, however, Republicans lost interest. In October, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a co-sponsor of one of the bills, said, \"I don't feel an urgent need to pass that law until you show me that Mr. Mueller is in jeopardy.\" A few months later, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), the co-sponsor of a related measure, also said his proposal could wait.\n\nNow that Trump is going after Mueller by name, and one of the president's attorneys is calling for an end to the investigation, those who prefer passivity have a difficult case to make. House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) made a compelling case yesterday on ABC's \"This Week\":\n\nWhen asked what Congress should do if President Trump opts to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Schiff responded saying, \"I would hope that it would prompt all Democrats and Republicans in the House to pass an independent counsel law and reinstate Bob Mueller. This would undoubtedly result in a constitutional crisis and I think Democrats and Republicans need to speak out about this right now,\" continuing, \"Members need to speak out now, don't wait for the crisis.\"\n\nAnd while there was no shortage of other Democrats saying the same thing over the weekend, the question, of course, is whether the Republican majority is inclined to agree.\n\nAlso on ABC's \"This Week,\" Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) seemed confident that there's no need to leap into action. \"I don't see the president firing him,\" the senator said in reference to Trump and Mueller. Asked about possible legislation to protect the special counsel, Lankford, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, added, \"I don't even think that's going to be necessary, because the president's not going to fire him.\"\n\nI continue to find this a difficult perspective to understand. Trump has already explored firing Mueller - and by some accounts, he's lied about it - and that was before this weekend's apparent escalation.\n\nOn the flip side, there were a handful of GOP lawmakers who were willing to go further - including Lindsey Graham, who pledged \"to make sure that Mr. Mueller can continue to do his job without any interference.\" That said, most Republican leaders remained silent, and even those who publicly raised concerns weren't explicit about what they would do if the president tried to fire the special counsel.\n\nComplicating matters, another member of the president's legal team, Ty Cobb, issued a written statement last night. \"In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the Administration, the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller,\" Cobb said.\n\nWhether his client agrees remains an open question.",

                "title": "Why the FBI's Andrew McCabe was fired",
                "body": "Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe listens on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, May 11, 2017, while testifying before a Senate Intelligence Committee...\n\nNever before has the deputy director of the FBI been fired. Late Friday night, the Trump administration broke new ground.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions late Friday night accepted the recommendation that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who took the reins of the agency during the turbulent days after the abrupt firing of James Comey, be terminated - two days before he was to retire and become eligible for full pension benefits.\n\nThough McCabe - who has been attacked by President Donald Trump - stepped down as deputy director in late January, he remained on the federal payroll, planning to retire on Sunday. The firing places his federal pension in jeopardy.\n\nThe official rationale is that the Justice Department's inspector general identified wrongdoing on McCabe's part as part of the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nAnd while it's entirely possible McCabe took steps he shouldn't have - the full report has not yet been made available to the public - it's difficult to take the official line seriously after seeing Donald Trump's taunting end-zone dance over the weekend. The president's critics responded to McCabe's firing by arguing that the move appeared to be part of a politically motivated vendetta orchestrated by the Oval Office - and Trump took steps to prove his critics right.\n\nThe president celebrated McCabe's firing as \"a great day for democracy,\" adding, \"Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\" Trump also published a tweet with some demonstrably false Clinton-related conspiracy theories, insisting that McCabe was \"caught, called out and fired.\"\n\nThe FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility may have proposed the termination, but the president himself seemed to have no use for the fig leaf. Indeed, he never has: Trump has targeted McCabe personally for months. Friday night was simply the culmination of a petty and corrupt vendetta.\n\nThere's no shortage of angles to this story, but as the dust starts to settle, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Attorney General Jeff Sessions keeps looking for ways to make the White House happy. Firing McCabe two days before his retirement seems to be part of a larger pattern in which the Alabama Republican prioritizes the president's wishes.\n\n2. In case anyone's forgotten, the Justice Department's decisions are supposed to be kept separate and independent from the White House's political agenda. Trump World has taken a bulldozer to that firewall, and the president's politicization of federal law enforcement remains one of his most serious official transgressions.\n\n3. There is some irony in Sessions firing McCabe for a lack of \"candor\" given the attorney general's own record. Indeed, didn't the attorney general vow to recuse himself from decisions such as these?\n\n4. McCabe, who was among the first to investigate the connections between the Trump campaign and its Russian benefactors, has already secured legal counsel of his own, and through his attorney, he said his firing was part of Trump's \"ongoing war on the F.B.I.\" Given the president's unprecedented offensive against the bureau, McCabe's allegation seems very easy to believe.\n\n5. It's hardly a stretch to think Friday night's move was intended to have a chilling effect throughout the executive branch: if Trump sees you as an adversary, your career and your benefits are at stake, so everyone better stay in line - or else.\n\nJust as importantly, McCabe is a witness to possible presidential obstruction of justice, which necessarily makes him a target for Trump. We'll have more on that angle a little later this morning.",

                "body": "For months, Donald Trump and his legal team have been extremely cautious in its confrontations with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. When pressed, the president's defense attorneys have generally pressed Mueller and his investigation, all while vowing to cooperate with the probe.\n\nThat was the old posture. The new posture emerged over the weekend.\n\nPresident Trump's personal lawyer John Dowd called Saturday for an end to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference, citing \"recent revelations\" and the late-night firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as a basis to end the probe.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Dowd said he hopes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will choose to end the investigation \"on the merits\" of the FBI Inspector General's recommendation to fire McCabe.\n\nThough Dowd clarified he wasn't calling for Mueller's ouster, the president's attorney did say he prays that Rod Rosenstein brings \"an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.\"\n\nTo the extent that reality is in any way relevant, Dowd's argument was bizarre - the dossier hasn't been discredited and we already know it wasn't responsible for launching the investigation - but this shift was less about making credible arguments and more about going on the offensive again the special counsel's ongoing investigation.\n\nIt's a campaign Donald Trump himself seemed eager to join.\n\nLooking back over the last several months, there have been all kinds of developments in the Mueller probe - indictments, subpoenas, guilty pleas, etc. - but the president never once published a tweet that referenced the special counsel by name. That changed over the weekend, with Trump declaring on Saturday, \"The Mueller probe should never have been started.\" A day later, the president whined about the special counsel's team featuring some Democrats and \"zero Republicans.\"\n\nAgain, Trump wasn't telling the truth - Mueller himself is a Republican - but the larger point is that the president and his team are escalating their fight against the special counsel's investigation in ways we haven't seen before. The New York Times described this as \"an extraordinary shift.\"\n\nWhat's next? At this point, we don't know, but it's hard not to wonder about whether Trump - who's already explored steps to fire Mueller before, and by some accounts, lied about it - may be preparing another radical move, possibly touching off a political crisis.\n\nThe new posture also suggests Trump World is getting nervous in ways it wasn't before. Officials' confidence about an inevitable exoneration has been replaced with frantic complaints and dishonest claims.\n\nOn Fox News yesterday, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), a conservative member of the House Intelligence Committee, said, \"If you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.\"\n\nAnd therein lies the point: innocent people don't generally act the way Trump and his team are acting.\n\nPostscript: This weekend's developments also obviously increase the pressure on Congress to consider steps to shield Mueller from White House interference. We'll have more on that later on this morning.",

                "body": "Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/15/18, 9:00 PM ET Carson, Mnuchin give Trump reasons to keep firing cabinet members Rachel Maddow looks at how Donald Trump secretaries Ben Carson and Steven Mnuchin are garnering the kind of embarrassing scandal headlines that seem likely to draw the ax-wielding attention of Donald Trump. It wasn't great when we learned Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife flew on a government plane to Kentucky on the day of the solar eclipse. The story looked a little worse when we learned Mnuchin \"inquired about the use of a military plane\" for his European honeymoon.\n\nThe scope of the story, however, is still coming into focus.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin racked up almost $1 million in military flights last year at taxpayers' expense, according to a new report.\n\nIn a report issued Thursday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which investigated Mnuchin's travels through Freedom of Information Act requests, found Mnuchin took eight separate trips on military aircraft between spring and fall 2017.\n\nThose dates are of particular significance: it seems likely that the cabinet secretary has taken other military flights since the fall of 2017, which means the overall price tag is probably even higher now.\n\nIt's also worth emphasizing that Mnuchin had other travel choices. His recent predecessors, for example, took plenty of commercial flights. He also could've made use of smaller military planes.\n\nBut he didn't. Mnuchin isn't part of the military; he's never been in the military; and there's nothing about his office that requires him to make use of military planes, which are extremely expensive. But the Treasury secretary has apparently been taking full advantage of this opportunity, even if taxpayers get stuck with the tab.\n\nThe fact that this story comes against the backdrop of so many other Trump cabinet officials using public funds in controversial ways really doesn't help.\n\nThat said, the Washington Post reported overnight on vulnerable members of the president's team, and somehow, Mnuchin wasn't included among those whose jobs are in jeopardy.",

                "body": "It seemed like a perfectly reasonable question. At a House Natural Resources Committee hearing yesterday, Rep. Colleen Hanabusa (D-Hawaii), a fourth-generation Japanese-American, asked Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke about his agency's grant programs to preserve World War II-era internment camps.\n\n\"Oh, konnichiwa,\" Zinke replied.\n\nThere was apparently a momentary silence in the committee room; the Democratic congresswoman corrected his Japanese; and the hearing proceeded. That said, several other lawmakers, including Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), were eager to admonish the cabinet secretary today for his \"flippant\" and \"juvenile\" comment.\n\nBut before we could catch our breath on this Zinke story, the Associated Press published another.\n\nTrophy hunters are packed on a new U.S. advisory board created to help rewrite federal rules for importing the heads and hides of African elephants, lions and rhinos. That includes some members with direct ties to President Donald Trump and his family.\n\nA review by The Associated Press of the backgrounds and social media posts of the 16 board members appointed by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke indicates they will agree with his position that the best way to protect critically threatened or endangered species is by encouraging American hunters to shoot some of them.\n\nShortly before Thanksgiving, the Trump administration announced the end of an Obama-era ban on hunters bringing the trophy heads of elephants they'd killed in Africa back to the U.S. The move immediately drew fire, even from some prominent Republicans, and Donald Trump soon after suspended his own administration's policy. Via Twitter, the president said it'd be difficult to change his mind about \"this horror show.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, the Trump administration reversed course again, and now Zinke's advisory board wildlife-protection board is stacked with trophy hunters.\n\nAll of which serves as a striking reminder: when the Interior secretary make headlines, it's probably not for flattering reasons.\n\nI started taking stock of Zinke-related controversies, and was a little surprised by the size of the list.\n\nThere's the cabinet secretary's controversial travel habits. And his alleged intimidation tactics against Republican senators during the health care fight. And the investigation into whether he reassigned an Interior scientist who disclosed how climate change affects Alaska Native communities.\n\nThere are the resignations at the National Park System Advisory Board. And his sweetheart deal for Florida on coastal oil drilling. And the story about Zinke's mistakenly using wildfire preparedness funds to pay for one of the secretary's unrelated helicopter tours.\n\nThere have also been questions about Zinke's wife saddling department staffers with extra work. The Federal Election Commission, meanwhile, has raised questions about a leadership PAC affiliated with Zinke during his time in Congress. Just last month, two scientists resigned from Interior after Zinke demanded confidential energy data. Around the same time, a pair of casino-owning American Indian tribes accused Zinke \"of illegally blocking their plans to expand operations in Connecticut - a delay that stands to benefit politically connected gambling giant MGM Resorts International.\"\n\nThere's also that weird flag story. And the story about his unusually expensive door. And for all I know, there are other stories related to Zinke that haven't crossed my radar.\n\nI realize this administration has its share of controversial cabinet secretaries, but it'd be tough to top the sheer volume of questions surrounding the Interior secretary.",

                "title": "The banking deregulation bill isn't a done deal just yet",
                "body": "In early 2009, when the Great Recession was still very much an ongoing crisis, congressional Democrats began work on reforming the financial industry's rules, including bankruptcy reform proposals. When some of these ideas failed, then-Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) became frustrated, and was willing to say so in candid ways.\n\n\"[T]he banks - hard to believe in a time when we're facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created - are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill,\" Durbin said nine years ago. \"And they frankly own the place.\"\n\nBy some measures, that hasn't changed.\n\nThe Senate passed on Wednesday legislation sponsored by Senate Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-ID) that would rewrite parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, the landmark financial regulation overhaul enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The bill cleared the Senate with ease, 67 to 31, earning support from 16 Democrats and Sen. Angus King (I-ME) in addition to 50 Republicans.\n\nThe Senate bill would adjust the size at which banks are subject to certain regulatory scrutiny and exempt small banks from some requirements for loans, mortgages, and trading, among other measures.\n\nRight now, banks with more than $50 billion in assets are subject to Dodd-Frank regulations. The Senate bill would, among other things, raise that threshold to $250 billion.\n\nThe bill faced fierce criticism from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and much of the left - the very idea that Congress would roll back financial-industry safeguards right now seems dangerous from a progressive perspective, especially with the industry already flush with cash - but it cleared the Senate anyway. All 31 \"no\" votes came from the Senate Democratic caucus, but they were easily outnumbered.\n\nWhat's especially interesting right now, however, is what House Republicans intend to do with the Senate bill.\n\nIndeed, as the Wall Street Journal reports, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) considers the Senate bill as \"an important first step.\"\n\nMr. Hensarling, who is retiring from Congress this year, said he discussed the bill with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and was told the bill wouldn't leave Mr. Ryan's desk \"unless and until the Senate negotiates with the House,\" indicating House lawmakers want to debate adding provisions they favor to the legislation.\n\nAnd that leaves progressives in an unexpected place: the left is suddenly hoping Hensarling and the House GOP make this bill even worse, which in turn might derail the entire effort.\n\nThat's not at all unrealistic. Democratic centrists in the upper chamber were willing to go along with the Senate version of the deregulation bill, but they say they're not open to House efforts to move the bill even further to the right.\n\nHensarling, a longtime proponent of Wall Street's regulatory requests, however, seems to think the moderate Senate Dems are bluffing - and that they'll feel compelled to vote for package, even if House Republicans add new, conservative elements.\n\nOr maybe it's Hensarling, who's retiring this year, who's bluffing, and he'll eventually pass the Senate version in its current form.\n\nWe'll see soon enough which side prevails, but if it's Jeb Hensarling, and not Elizabeth Warren, who kills this bill, I'm going to laugh quite a bit.",

Andrew Cuomo (D) will reportedly have some discretion \"over when to call a special election.\"\n\n* At an appearance in New Hampshire this morning, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) offered another not-so-subtle rhetorical shot at Donald Trump. \"We have ... succumbed to what can only be described as a propaganda-fueled dystopian view of conservatism,\" the retiring senator argued.\n\n* On a related note, Flake told the Associated Press, \"It's not in my plan to run for president, but I am not ruling it out. Somebody needs to stand up for traditional Republicanism.\"\n\n* How are Democrats preparing to defend vulnerable Democratic incumbents? The Senate Majority PAC unveiled this new ad today, defending Sen. Joe Donnely (D-Ind.), who's already facing an aggressive ad campaign from the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity.\n\n* According to an AP article, the chair of the West Virginia Republican Party apparently criticized Democratic congressional Richard Ojeda for receiving a military pension. If so, that was probably unwise.\n\n* In Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey (R) launched her first TV ad of the cycle, claiming she \"steadied the ship\" after her predecessor, former Gov. Robert Bentley (R), was forced to resign in the wake of a sex scandal.\n\n* Former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.) announced this week that he won't seek a rematch against Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) this year, citing Donald Trump's unpopularity and the results of Tuesday's special election in Pennsylvania.\n\n* And in Maine, a Republican state House candidate, Leslie Gibson, lashed out at some of the student activists in south Florida working on gun reforms, calling one student a \"skinhead lesbian\" and denouncing another as a \"bald faced liar.\" Gibson was running unopposed. Now, however, he has a Democratic rival: Eryn Gilchrist told the Portland Press Herald she didn't intend to run for elected office, but she felt \"horrified and embarrassed\" at the thought of Gibson representing her.",

                "body": "In political circles, the Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol is known for a few things. He was former Vice President Dan Quayle's chief of staff; he's one of the more influential Republicans in the D.C. media; he's a notable critic of Donald Trump; and he has an unfortunate habit of making predictions that don't come true.\n\nLarry Kudlow is similar, except instead of always being wrong about political developments, Kudlow is always wrong about the economy. And while that's an unfortunate track record for someone who pontificates about the economy on television - Kudlow is a longtime CNBC anchor - it's an even worse trait for someone who leads the White House's National Economic Council.\n\nAnd yet, that's the job Donald Trump tapped Kudlow for this week.\n\nThe New York Times highlighted some of Kudlow's \"not-so-on-the-money predictions\" yesterday, and it's an unflattering list. The Washington Post's Dana Milbank added:\n\nIt was the eve of the biggest economic collapse since the Great Depression. Many on Wall Street worried that a recession loomed and that the housing bubble was bursting.\n\nAnd then there was Larry Kudlow, the man President Trump just tapped to be his top economic adviser.\n\n\"Despite all the doom and gloom from the economic pessimistas, the resilient U.S. economy continues moving ahead,\" Kudlow wrote on Dec. 7, 2007, in National Review, predicting that gloomy forecasters would \"wind up with egg on their faces.\" Kudlow, who previously derided as \"bubbleheads\" those who warned about a housing bubble, now wrote that \"very positive\" news in housing should \"cushion\" falling home sales and prices.\n\nThat was in December 2007 - the exact month the Great Recession began - and the global economy entered a crushing free-fall not long after.\n\n\"Even a stopped clock is right twice a day, they say,\" Milbank added. \"But Kudlow's misfires just keep coming.\"\n\nThe point, however, isn't to point and laugh. Rather, what matters here is Kudlow's track record and its relationship to his new responsibilities.\n\nWhen Kudlow begins his formal role on Team Trump - he's already been an informal adviser to the Republican - he'll be the top voice on the economy in the White House. The president will turn to him regularly for guidance, advice, and expertise, not only on the health the economy, but also about the kind of policies the administration should pursue for the near future.\n\nFortunately, right now, the economy appears to be quite healthy, but if there's a downturn, would Kudlow recognize the signs? Would he give Trump honest assessments about the efficacy of Republican policies?\n\nOr would Kudlow maintain his uninterrupted record of getting key questions backwards?",

                "title": "Nunes: There's 'no one left' for Mueller to indict in Russia scandal",
                "body": "Politico reported late yesterday that House Republicans \"are privately venting that they've fumbled the release of their own Russia probe report.\"\n\nYa think? The GOP leadership of the House Intelligence Committee abruptly ended their own investigation of the Russia scandal, long before they had all the facts. They also released a ridiculous pre-cooked report, rejected the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies about Russia backing Donald Trump, and then spent the rest of the week conceding that this core conclusion of the GOP report was wrong.\n\n\"Fumbled the release\" seems like a charitable way of saying the House Intelligence Committee's Republicans screwed up spectacularly (again). Four days after the release of a GOP document intended to exonerate their party's president, the only people who even remember the report are those who recognize its insulting absurdities.\n\nBut the committee's embattled chairman and unyielding Donald Trump ally, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), is undeterred. Indeed, he spoke at a private dinner this week, hosted by a conservative magazine called the American Spectator, and toed the White House line in an interesting way. The Washington Examiner reported:\n\nNunes said that he doesn't see who [Special Counsel Robert Mueller] could indict for collusion if all the indictments to date have been on other charges.\n\n\"Now look at who Mueller has prosecuted at this point, and who is left to prosecute for collusion?\" he wondered. \"I mean, there's no one left. [Former Trump campaign manager Paul] Manafort would be the obvious guy to think of that was colluding, right? If you could have gotten him on collusion, he would have been the obvious choice. Flynn, I mean, I knew Flynn very very well, and he is not a secret communist supporting Putin. So, they can't get him on that. So who else do they have?\"\n\nWas that a rhetorical question? Because if Nunes really wants to know - if he genuinely believes there's literally no one else who might be prosecuted by the special counsel's team - the California Republican probably should've run a real investigation and kept it going.\n\nAs New York's Jon Chait added yesterday, \"Who is left to prosecute for collusion? Well, let's see. There is Donald Trump Jr., who attended a meeting with a Russian promising to help his campaign, and loved it. There's Jared Kushner, who also attended that meeting, and had a web of financial relationships and contacts with Russia that he suspiciously failed to disclose. There is Roger Stone, who reportedly knew about the Russian email hacking as early as spring 2016, before it was publicly known.\"\n\nThat's hardly a comprehensive list. Some of those Mueller has indicted weren't on the political world's radar, right up until there were reports of the criminal charges against them.\n\nThere's also, of course, the beneficiary of Russia's attack - I believe he's now the American president - who may yet face legal jeopardy, and who has an unfortunate habit of acting as if he's guilty.\n\nAs for Nunes, the New York Times published a joint op-ed this week from former Rep. Claudine Schneider (R-R.I.), who now serves on the board of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington; Johns Hopkins' Eliot Cohen, who served in the Bush-Cheney administration's State Department; and CREW Chairman Norm Eisen, who was the Obama administration's chief ethics lawyer. Among other things, the trio argue that the House Intelligence Committee chairman, now that he's done dismissing examining the scandal, is likely to target Mueller.\n\nWatch this space.",

                "title": "After admitting he makes stuff up, Trump clings to bogus claim",
                "body": "Even for Donald Trump, it was a bizarre moment. The president boasted at a fundraiser this week that he hosted a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and the two leaders discussed which country had a trade deficit with the other. According to his own version of events, Trump insisted the U.S. has a trade deficit with our neighbor to the north, though he had no idea whether or not that was true.\n\nIt was striking for several reasons. The president not only admitted that he makes stuff up, Trump also acted as if this is worth bragging about - even in the context of trying to mislead the prime minister of one of the United States' closest allies. It also served as a reminder that the president doesn't feel like doing his homework, even on one of his signature issues.\n\nBut nearly as important is what Trump did when this news caused a stir: the president repeated the falsehood he's so fond of:\n\n\"We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that's how I know!\"\n\nThe child-like logic is a sight to behold:\n\n1. Trump believes the United States has a trade deficit with almost every country.\n\n2. Canada is a country.\n\n3. Ergo, the United States must have a trade deficit with Canada. QED.\n\nMeanwhile, in reality, the United States does not have a trade deficit with Canada. We know this largely because of data provided by ... wait for it ... the Trump administration.\n\nFaced the evidence, Trump seems determined to dig in further, and the rest of his team feels compelled to play along with the fantasy.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters yesterday that Trump's claim was \"accurate,\" all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. She followed up with a tweet insisting that the U.S. trade deficit with Canada is real.\n\nIt's not. Sanders' conclusion ignores trade in services.\n\nNow, I know what some of you are thinking. Trump and his team lie a little too often, but their dishonesty is routine and usually inconsequential. What makes the lies about Canadian trade any more notable than the other falsehoods the White House has peddled this week, or last week, or the week before?\n\nThe answer, I believe, is the larger context. As Trump's insistence, U.S. officials are in the middle of negotiating a possible new NAFTA trade deal, and being honest with our neighbors - two of our closest trade partners on the planet - makes a difference.\n\nAnd yet, here we are, watching the White House, for no particular reason, start with a falsehood on Wednesday night, only to spend Thursday pretending fiction is fact.",

                "body": "As if Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson wasn't already struggling enough, things got worse for the brain-surgeon-turned-politician a few weeks ago. The New York Times reported Carson's agency spent more than $31,000 on furniture for the cabinet secretary, despite a law that requires congressional approval for furniture costing more than $5,000.\n\nA HUD spokesperson said at the time that Carson \"didn't know the table had been purchased,\" a point amplified by the secretary himself in a Facebook post. \"I was as surprised as anyone to find out that a $31,000 dining set had been ordered,\" he wrote.\n\nAs Politico reported this week, there's new reason for skepticism about the official Carson line.\n\nHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was involved in selecting a $31,000 dining table set for his office suite, emails show, despite Carson and HUD's statements that he had no knowledge of the costly request.\n\nA cache of emails obtained by the advocacy group American Oversight show a HUD employee referring to \"print outs of the furniture Secretary and Mrs. Carson picked out\" on Aug. 29, 2017.\n\nThe emails, for what it's worth, came by way of a Freedom of Information Act request (as opposed to a leak from agency staffers who don't like Carson).\n\nAt a briefing yesterday, a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders about whether Carson misused public funds. The president's spokesperson said, \"Look, this is something we're looking into.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported overnight that Carson is \"considered at risk for being fired,\" and the Weekly Standard, a prominent conservative magazine, had a related piece.\n\nOr put another way, this isn't just some quirky story about a cabinet secretary and office redecoration. This, on the heels of Carson's other controversies, including an ethics mess that's already under investigation, may prove to be a career-ender.\n\nPostscript: Just in case Carson's mess didn't already point to trouble at HUD, The Guardian reported yesterday that another official at the cabinet agency, Naved Jafry, resigned the magazine \"asked him to explain multiple allegations of fraud as well as exaggerations in his biography.\"",

                "title": "Donald Trump's latest head-scratcher: The 'bowling ball test'",
                "body": "Donald Trump had all kinds of curious things to say at a fundraiser in Missouri this week, but as the Washington Post reported, one of the more notable head-scratchers came when the president was describing gimmicks Japan uses to deny U.S. auto companies access to its consumers.\n\n\"It's called the bowling ball test; do you know what that is? That's where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car,\" Trump said of Japan. \"And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn't qualify. It's horrible, the way we're treated. It's horrible.\"\n\nNo one had any idea what he was talking about. Yesterday, the White House insisted the president was kidding.\n\nHours after President Donald Trump told a group of Missouri donors that Japanese regulators were dropping bowling balls on American automobiles to keep them off the market, the White House insisted the president's anecdote was just an allegory.\n\n\"Obviously, he's joking about this particular test,\" Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday afternoon, telling a reporter who said he'd covered the auto industry in Japan that Trump's anecdote was merely \"illustrative of creative practices\" countries use to keep American goods out of their markets.\n\nBut the president, delivering the story Wednesday evening, offered no indication that he was joking.\n\nIndeed, if you read the transcript, the only thing that's perfectly clear about this story is that Trump most certainly wasn't kidding. The president believes there are stringent Japanese regulations in place, including the \"bowling ball test,\" that American manufacturers struggle to overcome, creating an unfair advantage for Japanese auto companies.\n\nAnother White House reporter added that, according to a White House aide, Trump \"frequently\" mentions this bowling ball test in meetings, for reasons no one understands.\n\nSo, what's going on here?\n\nThe truth is, no one knows for sure. The president, by his own admission, makes stuff up. To know Trump at all is to know he routinely believes fiction is fact, and trying to dissuade him with evidence is folly. If he wants to believe in the bowling ball test, then he will, even if it exists only in his imagination.\n\nWhat many tried to figure out yesterday, however, is why in the world he's convinced of this particular fantasy. Philip Bump explored a variety of possible explanations, including referencing a Nissan television ad - the president does love watching TV - in which bowling balls hit a car.\n\nThe odd thing is, there's a kernel of truth lurking behind Trump's nonsensical story. For years, Japan really has put barriers in place for auto imports. As Mother Jones' Kevin Drum noted yesterday, the Obama administration persuaded Japan to make it easier for American manufacturers to reach the Japanese market as part of the negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nAlmost immediately after taking office, Trump killed the TPP. The Republican president has never really explained what it was about the TPP he didn't like, though I'm sure Trump has his reasons. Whether those reasons are real is a separate question entirely.",

                "body": "Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/14/18, 9:00 PM ET UK punishes Russia over spy poisoning, Trump oddly quiet Rachel Maddow looks at the history of the spy who was poisoned by Russia south of London and the strong response from the UK, and even strong statements from Nikki Haley and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, though Donald Trump himself has been wishy-washy. The role of Donald Trump's private business in the investigation into the Russia scandal appears to be increasingly unavoidable. Last night, for example, Rachel noted on the show that Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee reported that the Trump Organization was actively negotiating a business deal in Moscow with a sanctioned Russian bank during the 2016 election. That's no small revelation.\n\nAnd while it's not clear if today's news is related to the sanctioned Russian bank, the New York Times reports that the president's business has now been subpoenaed by Robert Mueller.\n\nThe special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known time that the special counsel demanded documents directly related to President Trump's businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.\n\nThe breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that oversees Mr. Trump's business ventures. In the subpoena, delivered in recent weeks, Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over all documents related to Russia and other topics he is investigating, the people said.\n\nWhen the president's attorneys assured him this investigation would end by the end of March, that was clearly wrong.\n\nThe next question - well, one of them - is whether and to what extent these developments cross the president's \"red line.\"\n\nAs regular readers may recall, Trump sat down last summer with the New York Times, which asked, \"If Mueller was looking at your finances and your family finances, unrelated to Russia - is that a red line?\" Trump replied, \"I would say yeah. I would say yes.\" He added, \"I think that's a violation.\"\n\nAsked specifically, \"Would you fire Mueller if he went outside of certain parameters of what his charge is?\" Trump dodged, saying, \"I can't answer that question because I don't think it's going to happen.\"\n\nSo, from the president's perspective, has this now happened?\n\nThere were points last year at which there was bipartisan support for legislation that would protect the special counsel in the event Trump tried to fire him. In time, Republicans lost interest, satisfied that Mueller would continue his investigation without presidential interference.\n\nThat confidence has always struck me as misplaced. Trump has already explored firing Mueller - and by some accounts, he's lied about it - and that was before the special counsel's team subpoenaed the president's private enterprise.\n\nPerhaps now would be a good time for Congress to reconsider some legal protections for Mueller and his investigation?",

                "body": "There have been quite a few reports over the last couple of days on Donald Trump's Stormy Daniels controversy, so let's take a look at what we've learned. NBC News, for example, reported last night:\n\nA top lawyer for the Trump Organization was involved in trying to enforce a secrecy agreement that adult film star Stormy Daniels signed in exchange for $130,000 before the 2016 election, new documents show.\n\nJill A. Martin, whose LinkedIn profile says she is assistant general counsel for the company, last month signed two legal papers linked to a temporary restraining order against the actress, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford.\n\nAt issue is the \"hush agreement\" intended to silence Daniels, and while we've known for a while about the NDA, the Wall Street Journal noted that these new documents \"for the first time tie President Donald Trump's flagship holding company to the continuing effort to silence a former adult-film actress who says she had an affair with Mr. Trump.\"\n\nThe president's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, created an LLC shortly before the 2016 presidential election in order to facilitate the $130,000 payment to the porn star, buying her silence. But we now know it was also a Trump Organization lawyer who was recently involved in an arbitration proceedings intended to ensure Daniels' silence.\n\nNBC News' report added that Clifford's attorney, Michael Avenatti, argued that Jill Martin's signature on the paperwork \"is another piece of evidence that Trump knew about the nondisclosure agreement, the payment and the more recent efforts to stop his client from talking.\"\n\nAnd while I don't think the revelations definitely show what, exactly, the president knew, the larger point is that the connections are growing, linking Trump's lawyer, Trump's business, Trump's alleged former mistress, and the effort to keep her quiet.\n\nWhat else have we learned of late? Quite a bit, actually. Politico reported late yesterday that BuzzFeed \"may have found a legal opening\" for Daniels and her lawyers to exploit.\n\nThe same Trump attorney who brokered the deal with Daniels, Michael Cohen, filed a libel suit in January against BuzzFeed and four of its staffers over publication of the so-called dossier compiling accurate, inaccurate and unproven allegations about Trump's relationship with Russia.\n\nNow, BuzzFeed is using Cohen's libel suit as a vehicle to demand that Daniels preserve all records relating to her relationship with Trump, as well as her dealings with Cohen and the payment he has acknowledged arranging in 2016.\n\nOn Tuesday, BuzzFeed's lawyer wrote to Daniels' attorney asking that the adult film actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, preserve various categories of documents. Such preservation letters are often a prelude to a subpoena. If Daniels' testimony is formally demanded in a deposition, the nondisclosure agreement would likely be no obstacle, legal experts said.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\n* Daniels' case trying to get out of her current agreement was transferred to a new judge this week, since the previous judge is seeking a federal judgeship from Donald Trump.\n\n* The adult-film actress has also begun an online fundraising campaign to cover her legal bills. She's also apparently prepared to pay back the $130,000 she received, though there's no reason to think that would make much of a difference to Trump World, which still doesn't want her to talk about the alleged relationship.\n\n* In addition to her interview several years ago with In Touch magazine, Daniels apparently referenced her alleged affair with Trump during a 2007 radio interview.\n\n* It's unclear when, or if, Daniels' \"60 Minutes\" interview will air, but as best as I can tell, Trump's lawyers have not filed suit against CBS News, at least not, and even if they did, such a case probably wouldn't go well.\n\n* And Vox published a piece this week that the D.C. political establishment should stop \"tittering in embarrassment and recognize that there is a serious scandal here.\" The piece added, \"[T]he fact remains that the American people have a right to know whether the president, his associates, and the businesses he controls violated campaign finance law. We also have a right to know whether he is habitually in the business of cutting large checks to buy ex-lovers' silence and, thus, how broadly susceptible to blackmail or other forms of exploitation he may be.\"",

                "title": "Will Trump's picks for CIA and State face confirmation trouble?",
                "body": "Donald Trump jolted the political world this week, announcing the ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, replacing him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, and replacing him with Gina Haspel, the intelligence agency's current deputy director.\n\nBut the process isn't one in which the president just snaps his fingers. Both Pompeo and Haspel will require Senate confirmation, and while the odds are in their favor in the Republican-led chamber, it's not necessarily going to be easy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's picks to run the Central intelligence Agency and the State Department likely will need votes from Democrats to get confirmed by the closely divided Senate, after a Republican lawmaker said he would oppose their nominations.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) announced Wednesday he would oppose the nomination of Gina Haspel to lead the CIA, citing her involvement with the harsh interrogation program used in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He also said he would oppose the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state, citing his perceived stance on foreign wars.\n\nTo be sure, the broader picture hasn't yet come into focus. Maybe Rand Paul intends to follow through on his decision (like he did when he briefly shut down the government last month), or maybe he'll cave when the pressure's on (like he did during the health care fight).\n\nFor that matter, we don't know whether Pompeo and Haspel will receive support from some conservative Democrats, or whether other Senate Republicans may have related concerns. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), for example, has also raised concerns in writing.\n\nI mention all of this, not because I take Rand Paul's rhetoric at face value, but because in a 51-49 Senate, interesting things can happen. Given Haspel's record on Bush-era torture, for example, it wouldn't shock me if Paul and McCain really did balk at her nomination, putting it in jeopardy.\n\nIt also wouldn't come as too big of a surprise if senators, well aware of the circumstances, started making certain demands in exchange for their votes on these controversial nominees. Horse-trading may very well make the difference between success and failure.\n\nPostscript: Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), true to form, said yesterday that the Republican senator from Kentucky is \"defending and sympathizing with terrorists.\" For some, the debate over war crimes and use of torture hasn't progressed much over the last decade or so.",

                "body": "Given the seriousness of the threat posed by North Korea, common sense suggests Donald Trump should be doing everything possible to strengthen the alliance between the United States and South Korea. And yet, the American president seems to be doing the exact opposite.\n\nAs regular readers know, this has been going on for a while. Just a few months into his presidency, Trump lied about dispatching an \"armada,\" led by an aircraft carrier, towards the peninsula, and South Koreans weren't pleased. When Trump falsely said Korean Peninsula \"used to be a part of China,\" that didn't go over especially well, either.\n\nLast May, Trump made matters vastly worse, condemning the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, known as Korus, and threatening to trash the deal. He then said he wants to deploy a missile-defense system - Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense (Thaad) - in South Korea to help protect against a North Korean attack, but only if South Korea pays for the technology. (White House National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster quietly let officials in Seoul know they should ignore the American presidents' bluster.)\n\nWhen Trump started publicly praising North Korea's Kim Jong-un, many in South Korea were left understandably \"bewildered.\"\n\nAnd yet, nearly a year later, Trump is still at it. The Washington Post reported on comments he made at a fundraiser in Missouri last night.\n\nHe also seemed to threaten to pull U.S. troops stationed in South Korea if he didn't get what he wanted on trade with Seoul, an ally. He said that the country had gotten rich but that U.S. politicians never negotiated better deals. \"We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,\" Trump said. \"We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let's see what happens.\"\n\n\"Our allies care about themselves,\" he said. \"They don't care about us.\"\n\nOh my.\n\nFirst, Trump is still convinced that a trade deficit with a country is proof of the United States \"losing money.\" That's not what a trade deficit means, and it's amazing the president, even now, hasn't yet familiarized himself with the basics of his own agenda.\n\nSecond, threatening and antagonizing American allies - especially in Asia-Pacific, especially ahead of purported talks between Trump and North Korea's dictator - does nothing to advance U.S. interests.\n\nThe Washington Post reported in the fall that South Koreans are still coming to terms with how \"different\" the current American president really is. David Straub, a former State Department official who dealt with both Koreas, said at the time, \"Opinion polls show South Koreans have one of the lowest rates of regard for Trump in the world and they don't consider him to be a reasonable person,\" Straub said. \"In fact, they worry he's kind of nuts.\"\n\nI'm trying to think of a sensible reason why Trump would go to such lengths to antagonize a key U.S. ally. Nothing comes to mind.",

                "title": "Trump looks ahead to 'Phase 2' of his tax-cut plans",
                "body": "Republicans didn't just approve massive tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations because they believed the policy would be good for the economy; they also saw the regressive tax cuts as a powerful electoral tool. A president's party traditionally does poorly in the first midterm cycle, but GOP leaders saw their tax plan as key to bucking the historical trend.\n\nThose assumptions have been shaken of late. In Pennsylvania's congressional special election, Republicans initially focused heavily on the GOP tax cuts, only to discover that voters in the district - an area Donald Trump won easily in 2016 - were wholly unimpressed.\n\nIt's against this backdrop that the president apparently wants ... wait for it ... more tax cuts. The New York Times reports:\n\nAmid all the turmoil and uncertainty, with his White House seemingly fraying, his legislative agenda stalled and his electoral base in danger, President Trump these days finds one area of comfort: talking about his tax cuts. He finds it so reassuring, in fact, that he is increasingly talking about doing it all over again. [...]\n\n\"We're now going for a Phase 2,\" he told a selected group of supporters at a Boeing factory in St. Louis. He did not describe what would be in such a Phase 2 but said he would team up with Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. \"It's going to be something very special. Kevin Brady's working on it with me.\"\n\nSome of this might even be true. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee told Fox Business that Republicans believe \"even more can be done\" on taxes.\n\nAfter the GOP plan passed, many of us assumed Republicans would turn their attention to other issues, such as infrastructure or immigration. What we didn't know was that some key GOP leaders would effectively decide, \"No, we'll just keep focusing on tax breaks, thank you very much.\"\n\nI'm reluctant to even guess what \"Phase 2\" might entail, but it may have something to do with the fact that the newly passed law is filled with glitches, errors, and flaws, and fixing the law's many problems will require congressional action of some kind.\n\nThat's not what Trump seemed to be suggesting yesterday, but the president's rhetoric often has no connection to reality.\n\nPostscript: Trump added yesterday that Republicans need to run on tax cuts in the 2018 midterms because they were very \"popular.\" He may want to believe that, but the latest Quinnipiac poll found just 36% of Americans support the new GOP tax law, and other recent national surveys point in a similar direction.",

                "body": "When it comes to the nation's debate over guns, it's hard to miss the direction of the prevailing winds. Gallup released a report yesterday that found two-thirds of American adults want new restrictions on the sale of firearms - the strongest support for gun restrictions in 25 years.\n\nThe same day as the poll's release, tens of thousands of students across the country participated in a walkout protesting gun violence. Exactly one month after the mass shooting in south Florida, the young activists protested for 17 minutes - one for each of the victims in Parkland - and organizers said the purpose was to highlight \"Congress' inaction against the gun violence plaguing our schools and neighborhoods.\"\n\nIt was against this background that the Republican-led House did, in fact, approve legislation related to guns. It is, however, a very modest measure. Roll Call reported:\n\nIt's not quite one and done, but the bill the House passed Wednesday to provide grants for schools to implement safety protocols and training is likely the last action GOP leaders will take this Congress in response to a recent spate of mass shootings.\n\nThe House passed, 407-10, a bipartisan measure by Florida Republican John Rutherford called the Student, Teacher's Officer's Prevention (STOP) School Violence Act.\n\nThe full roll call is online here.\n\nTo be sure, there's nothing especially wrong with the bill. As Roll Call's report explained, the proposal would \"authorize $50 million in grant funding for schools to conduct training to prevent student violence, set up anonymous reporting systems for threats and implement other safety protocols.\"\n\nThat said, as a Vox piece added, the bill \"doesn't address guns in any substantive way.\" It's likely why the proposal was able to get a vote in the far-right chamber and pass without much of a fuss.\n\nSo what happens now? House GOP leaders have signaled they have no intention of taking up additional legislation on guns, at least not without Senate action.\n\nIn the upper chamber, there's been some chatter about a modest background-check bill - the NICS measure we discussed last month - but ongoing Republican skepticism has delayed consideration of the proposal, despite the fact that it has 60 Senate supporters.\n\nEven if it were to pass, there's no reason to assume it could clear the House, where Republicans have tried to tie it to a measure that make it easier for gun owners with concealed carry permits to carry to firearms across state lines, regardless of state laws.\n\nOr put another way, those activists who protested yesterday have reason to keep the pressure on.",

After Lamb's apparent victory, GOP leaders decided they no longer agreed with their own talking points.\n\nThe Republican National Committee insisted that Lamb \"essentially\" ran as a Republican. A White House spokesperson said the Democrat \"really embraced the president's policies and his vision.\"\n\nAs The Atlantic reported, Trump went a little further while reflecting on the race yesterday at a private fundraiser in Missouri.\n\n\"The young man last night that ran, he said, 'Oh, I'm like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything.' He ran on that basis,\" Trump said. \"He ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me. I said, 'Is he a Republican? He sounds like a Republican to me.'\"\n\nLook, I realize that the president, by his own admission, occasionally makes stuff up, but the GOP spin on Pennsylvania's special election is getting a little silly.\n\nJon Favreau, Barack Obama's former chief speechwriter, noted yesterday that Lamb's campaign platform included several core tenets, including support for universal health care and opposition to Trump's regressive tax plan. Perhaps most importantly, Lamb repeatedly emphasized his rejection of House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) agenda, including GOP support for cuts to Social Security.\n\nOn guns, Lamb isn't exactly Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), but he endorsed expanded background checks - an issue that's faced repeated Republican resistance. On reproductive rights, Lamb said he's personally opposed to abortion, but as a matter of law, he backs a woman's right to choose.\n\nIf Republicans want to argue that Lamb isn't as progressive as the Democratic Party at the national level, fine. That's true. But before anyone believes that Lamb is \"like Trump,\" let's try to remember that the apparent congressman-elect supports the Affordable Care Act and labor unions, while he opposes the GOP tax plan and entitlement cuts.\n\nThis is a candidate who \"really embraced the president's policies and his vision\"?

                "title": "Celebrating ignorance, Trump boasts about making stuff up",
                "body": "About a year ago, Donald Trump sat down for an interview with the Associated Press, which touched on the president's criticisms of NATO. He referenced an exchange he had during the campaign with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, in which then-candidate Trump expressed deep concerns about the security alliance despite \"not knowing much about NATO.\"\n\nIn other words, according to Trump, he spoke with great conviction about a key area of U.S. foreign policy, despite the fact that - by his own admission - he had no idea what he was talking about.\n\nYesterday, something very similar happened. The president spoke at a fundraiser about a conversation he had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in which the two leaders discussed which country had a trade deficit with the other. As the Washington Post reported, Trump bragged last night that he made the private comments without having a clue as to whether or not he was correct.\n\n\"Trudeau came to see me. He's a good guy, Justin. He said, 'No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,' \" Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio obtained by The Washington Post. \"Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in - 'Donald, we have no trade deficit.' He's very proud because everybody else, you know, we're getting killed.\n\n\"... So, he's proud. I said, 'Wrong, Justin, you do.' I didn't even know.... I had no idea. I just said, 'You're wrong.' You know why? Because we're so stupid. ... And I thought they were smart. I said, 'You're wrong, Justin.' He said, 'Nope, we have no trade deficit.' I said, 'Well, in that case, I feel differently,' I said, 'but I don't believe it.' I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, 'Check, because I can't believe it.'\"\n\nSo, Trump started with the premise that the United States is \"stupid\" - a curious assumption for an American president - and then based his assumptions on that dubious foundation. It then led him to assume, without having any facts or having done any homework ahead of his meeting with the Canadian prime minister, that we have a trade deficit with our neighbors to the north.\n\nAccording to last night's story, Trump's aide then came back to him to assure the president that he was, in fact, correct about the trade imbalance - which is bizarre, since, according to the Trump administration's own data, the United States has a trade surplus with Canada.\n\nWhat's amazing about this story, however, isn't just the American president being wrong about a simple issue he's talked about for years.\n\nRather, what we have here is a president bragging about making stuff up, then assuring his audience that his evidence-free claims are accidentally true, without realizing that he's still wrong. It's like a lie wrapped in a gaffe wrapped in propaganda.\n\nFor most presidents, this would be a deeply embarrassing moment that he hoped the public would never find out about. For this president, it's an anecdote that Trump thinks makes him look better, not worse.\n\nWhat's more, given the circumstances, we have no reason to believe any of the conversations Trump described last night - the one with Trudeau or the one with the aide who looked up the trade details - actually happened in reality. It's entirely possible the president just made up this part of the story, too.\n\nAfter all, according to Trump, this is just what he does. Why anyone would ever take his word at face value is something of a mystery. When someone boasts about making stuff up, their credibility necessarily evaporates.\n\nDonald Trump is not the nation's first ignorant president. He is the first American president to brag about his ignorance, as if it's worthy of celebration.",

He was 76.\"\n\n* I'm not saying Republicans would go berserk if a Democratic president misspelled \"Marne Corps,\" as Donald Trump did last night, but ... wait, no, I am saying that.\n\n* A case to keep an eye on: \"The parents of slain DNC staffer Seth Rich sued Fox News on Tuesday, accusing the network of fabricating a conspiracy involving their son and Wikileaks in order to boost ratings.\"\n\nAnything to add?

                "title": "Trump taps CNBC anchor for White House's top economics job",
                "body": "During a brief Q&A with reporters yesterday, Donald Trump conceded he's looking \"very strongly\" at CNBC's Larry Kudlow to lead the White House's National Economic Council. As of today, he's apparently done looking.\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to name longtime supporter Larry Kudlow as his top economic adviser, sources told CNBC Wednesday.\n\nKudlow would replace National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, who resigned earlier this month after clashing with the president over controversial steel and aluminum tariffs. Kudlow also was not a fan of the policy, although Trump said Tuesday that \"he has now come around to believing in tariffs as a negotiating point.\"\n\nThere's every reason to believe the CNBC anchor will fit in just fine on Team Trump. As a Washington Post analysis noted yesterday, Kudlow is \"as standard a Wall Street Republican as you'll find. He believes in the Reaganite Holy Trinity of low taxes, low inflation and free trade. He believes in them so much that he's spent the better part of the last 20 years proclaiming them on TV and radio.\"\n\nThat, alas, hasn't always worked out for him. By some measures, Kudlow has been consistently mistaken about many of the major economic debates of the last several years.\n\nBut what I think is the most important takeaway of today's news is the importance of Donald Trump's television remote control.\n\nOne of the staples of this presidency is that he's moved by what he sees on his TV screen. This obviously shapes his tweets - Trump has live-tweeted various Fox News programs more than once - but it also shapes his personnel decisions.\n\nFox News' Heather Nauert is now a key official at the State Department (who was recently promoted). Fox News' K.T. McFarland was Trump's deputy national security advisor. Fox News' Monica Crowley was chosen to work at the National Security Council before a controversy forced her departure. Fox News' Jonathan Wachtel was named the spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations. Fox News contributors such as Ben Carson and Elaine Chao are already in the president's cabinet, and now CNBC's Larry Kudlow will be the top economic voice in the White House.\n\nEven Jay Sekulow, a top member of Trump's legal defense team, has no relevant experience working on the issues he's tackling now, but he has maintained a very high profile in recent years on conservative media, which very likely helped get him his current gig.\n\nThe list may yet grow: Fox News' John Bolton is rumored to be in contention to be the next White House national security advisor.\n\nThe Washington Post joked last year, \"The Trump revolution won't just be televised. It will be led by television talking heads.\" It's even truer now than it was then.\n\nWhat's more, it's not just personnel. The president met with Veterans Affairs Sec. David Shulkin recently, and when their conversation turned to pending V.A. health care legislation, Trump reportedly called a Fox News personality, Pete Hegseth, \"to get his opinion\" of the bill.\n\nWhen proponents of steel tariffs launched a lobbying campaign, they ran TV ads where they thought Trump might see them. When Kristian Saucier wanted a presidential pardon, he went on Fox News to ask for one - and received one soon after. When White House aides wanted to convey to Trump that the indictments of 13 Russian operatives was not good news, they went to cable news in order to shape the president's understanding of the developments.\n\nForeign diplomats have urged their governments' leaders to appear on American television \"as a means of making their case to Trump.\"\n\nFollowing up on an item from last year, I should emphasize that as a rule, I'm not at all inclined to criticize those who watch a lot of cable news. It just so happens that I work for a cable-news television show and get paid by a cable-news network.\n\nThat said, it's also fair to say that while we've had media-conscious presidents in American history, we're never seen someone with the kind of obsession Trump has. To get a job on Team Trump, go on TV. To get a message to the president, go on TV. To influence the direction of the White House, go on TV.\n\nThis isn't how the executive branch of a global superpower is supposed to work.",

                "body": "Over the weekend, Donald Trump assured the public that Republican candidates are undefeated - five wins and no losses - in recent congressional special elections. That's plainly wrong, though House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) declared the same day, \"There's already been five special elections and Republicans have won all five of those.\"\n\nUsing that same faulty arithmetic, some Republicans are content with recent results.\n\nWalking into the meeting, New York. Rep. Chris Collins, a close ally of President Donald Trump, called the race a \"one-off.\"\n\n\"We've won five [special elections]; they've won one. I'm feeling pretty good,\" he added.\n\nI'll confess to being mystified by this. There was a congressional special election in California's 34th district last summer, which a Democrat won easily. There was also a U.S. Senate special election in Alabama in December that the GOP may have noticed.\n\nPretending losses didn't happen doesn't make them go away.\n\nBut even if we put Chris Collins' curious blind spots aside, the larger issue is the Republican Party's reaction to Conor Lamb's (D) apparent victory over Rick Saccone (R) in Pennsylvania's special election. Politico's report added, many GOP officials \"seemed to be in denial.\"\n\nThe most common argument seems to be that Lamb ran \"as a conservative,\" and since the vast majority of Democratic candidates will run on progressive platforms, this race was a fluke. There are two key problems with the assertion. First, Lamb may be to the right of the Democratic Party at the national level, but on several core issues, he's very much within the Dems' mainstream.\n\nAnd second, Republicans just spent the past several weeks telling local voters that Lamb is actually a liberal partisan. Isn't it a little late for the GOP to say the opposite now?\n\nA White House official added this morning that inside Team Trump, folks are relieved Lamb didn't win in \"a blowout.\" The official told a CNN reporter, \"For now, we'll happily take it.\"\n\nBut we're talking about a district the president won by 20 points, where Trump just assured locals that Rick Saccone would win \"easily.\" Moving the goalposts, and arguing that a narrow loss is somehow a good sign, is hard to take seriously.\n\nPostscript: House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), true to form, spent some time this morning praising Donald Trump for making the race more competitive. Of course, what the Speaker didn't mention is that the president's unpopularity helped make the race competitive in the first place, and Trump's willingness to campaign for Saccone apparently wasn't enough to rescue his candidacy.",

A GOP candidate in Tennessee won a state Senate special election in a landslide, even outperforming Donald Trump, who carried this same district by 44 points in 2016.\n\n* It's been a while since we saw data out of New Jersey, so it was of great interest to see the latest Quinnipiac poll yesterday, which showed Sen. Bob Menendez (D) leading Bob Hugin (R) by 17 points, 49% to 32%.\n\n* Donald Trump's re-election campaign continues to add staffers, despite the fact that the race is still years away. This week, former national campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson signed onto the 2020 effort as a senior adviser.\n\n* The Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity is reportedly planning to \"step up its advertising\" in Indiana and Missouri, spending nearly $4 million in the hopes of defeating Sens. Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly.\n\n* While the president draws attention to his unpopularity for reasons that aren't altogether clear, the latest CBS News poll found Trump with a 38% approval rating. (He insisted over the weekend he's \"around 50%.\")\n\n* Former Attorney General Eric Holder, helping lead the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, wasn't kidding about focusing on down-ballot races: he'll be in Wisconsin this week, supporting Rebecca Dallet in a state Supreme Court race. The election is April 3.\n\n* And despite the shooting that nearly claimed his life last summer, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) is hitting the campaign trail in support of House Republican candidates in the South and Midwest.",

                "title": "On job numbers, White House spins in wildly unnecessary ways",
                "body": "If you stop by the White House's homepage right now, you'll see a headline at the top of the site that reads, \"The Strongest Average Monthly Job Growth in More Than Two Decades.\" It leads to a piece that makes the case that job growth in January and February - and only January and February - has the U.S. on track for the best year since the mid-1990s.\n\nThis is not a good argument. Sure, job growth in the first two months of the year was great - combined, we saw growth of 552,000 jobs - but no one seriously tries to extrapolate annual results from just two months.\n\nExcept Donald Trump and his team, that is.\n\nI'm not unsympathetic to the White House's eagerness to brag about encouraging economic news. What Team Trump shouldn't do, however, is try to spin good data in misleading ways.\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, for example, told reporters last week, \"Jobs are coming in at record numbers.\" No, actually, they're not. Job growth in Trump's first year, for example, was slower than any year of Barack Obama's second term. We topped 300,000 jobs in February, which is fantastic, but we crossed that same threshold nine times during Obama's presidency. No records are being broken.\n\nAs for the 552,000 jobs created in the first two months of 2018, that's excellent news, but it's easy to find even better back-to-back monthly totals in recent years. In June and July of 2016, for example, when Trump first launched his campaign. the U.S. economy created 610,000 jobs in just those two months - though it didn't stop Trump from telling Americans the economy was terrible.\n\nIndeed, while the truth should be good enough, the Republican president is himself describing the latest job numbers in ways that are plainly and demonstrably dishonest.\n\nAt his campaign rally in Pittsburgh over the weekend, for example, Trump boasted, 'We have created three million jobs since Election Day. Nobody thought that was possible.\" To arrive at this figure, he counted jobs created under Obama's presidency. The only thing nobody thought possible was Trump taking credit for thing that happened before he even took office.\n\nHe then said the most recent jobs report \"was among the best ... ever produced in the history of our country.\" That's not even close to reflecting reality.\n\nThis, however, was my personal favorite:\n\n\"[M]y guys came into my office and they gave me the number. Because if you add the previous month, which was adjusted upward by 52,000 jobs, they were low last month, it adjusted upwards. So we are like over 360,000 jobs. And I said, let me ask you. Is that a mistake? I don't think I have seen that. If you get 160 it's good. We were at 360.\"\n\nNo, we weren't at 360,000. Trump is referring to Bureau of Labor Statistics revisions, which are included in every monthly report, and which last week pointed to 54,000 previously unreported jobs from December 2017 and January 2018. The president then decided to claim the economy created 360,000 jobs in February because he borrowed job numbers from months preceding February.\n\nMy point isn't that there's something wrong with the job market. The opposite is true: the recent data looks excellent. Rather, what matters here is that the latest job numbers are good enough that Trump and his team shouldn't try to deceive the public about them.\n\nReality, in this case, doesn't need to be spun, massaged, or repackaged in misleading ways. The truth works fine. When it comes to jobs, the White House should go with it.",

                "body": "Two weeks ago, Donald Trump endorsed an ambitious vision for \"comprehensive\" reforms to the nation's gun laws, including everything from hiking age requirements on long-guns to \"powerful\" background checks to gun confiscation without prior due process. This week, the White House announced that the president's vision has been dramatically curtailed and moved in an NRA-friendly direction.\n\nAt a briefing this week, a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, \"Why he didn't go forward with what he has proposed earlier?\" She responded by pointing on the need for congressional support, before changing the subject - to Barack Obama.\n\n\"Let's not forget that the Obama administration had the White House and all of Congress for two years, and never did anything. This president is actually supporting specific pieces of legislation and still laying out other priorities that he would like to see talked about and implemented, whether we have to do that on a state level...\"\n\nI realize Team Trump tends to see almost everything through an Obama-centric lens, but this is getting a little silly. The Republican White House is bothered by Democratic inattention to new gun laws in 2010? As if any such measure wouldn't have died at the hands of a GOP filibuster?\n\nBut as it turns out, the Trump White House is also taking this argument a step further. The New York Times reported this week:\n\nAfter a gunman marauded through Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month, conservative commentators - looking for a culprit - seized on an unlikely target: an Obama-era guidance document that sought to rein in the suspensions and expulsions of minority students.\n\nBlack students have never been the perpetrators of the mass shootings that have shocked the nation's conscience nor have minority schools been the targets. But the argument went that any relaxation of disciplinary efforts could let a killer slip through the cracks.\n\nAnd this week, President Trump made the connection, announcing that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will lead a school safety commission charged in part with examining the \"repeal of the Obama administration's 'Rethink School Discipline' policies.\"\n\nTo civil rights groups, connecting an action to help minority students with mass killings in suburban schools smacked of burdening black children with a largely white scourge.\n\nThose civil rights groups are, of course, correct. But in the Trump administration, if an Obama-era measure can be repealed, little else seems to matter.",

                "body": "Late last year, Donald Trump tried to help then-Sen. Luther Strange (R) win his primary election in Alabama. Local Republicans ignored the president's suggestion. Soon after, Trump tried to get Strange's opponent, Roy Moore, elected to the Senate. That didn't work, either.\n\nNevertheless, the Washington Post reported a few days after a Democrat won Alabama's special election that the president and his team were planning \"a full-throttle campaign to plunge the president into the midterm elections.\" White House officials had already met with 116 candidates, and Trump reportedly told aides he \"wants to travel extensively\" and spend \"much of 2018 campaigning.\"\n\nIn January, Trump told Reuters that he intends to spend \"probably four or five days a week\" helping GOP candidates in 2018.\n\nAt face value, none of this was surprising. It's not exactly a secret that the president prefers campaigning to governing, and with Republicans feeling anxious about their electoral prospects, it stands to reason Trump would be eager to hit the campaign trail. After all, a president can realistically only invest so much time on golfing and watching conservative media.\n\nThe better question is the extent to which Trump will be welcome on the stump. Axios had an interesting item yesterday.\n\n[T]he reality is that out of the 23 most vulnerable House Republicans, only two candidates said they would accept Trump's help - and neither were especially eager about it.\n\nAxios reached out to the 23 House Republicans who represent districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016 and asked whether they'd welcome a presidential visit. In fairness, several of these districts are represented by GOP incumbents who are retiring this year.\n\nBut others are running for re-election - and they're not rolling out the welcome mat for their party's president.\n\nRep. Mike Coffman's (R-Colo.) campaign manager said, for example, \"I don't think it would make sense for him to even come here.\" Rep. Peter Roskam's (R-Ill.) communications director told Axios, \"We have not requested the president's assistance and we don't plan on requesting his assistance.\"\n\nRep. Carlos Curbelo's (R-Fla.) communications director didn't rule it out, though his office said the congressman would welcome \"anyone who wants to support Carlos' efforts and endorse his bipartisan approach to public service.\"\n\nOf the 23, the only one who'd welcome Trump? Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), best known as Vladimir Putin's favorite congressman.\n\nWhether members like these invite the president to their districts or not, it's a safe bet their Democratic opponents will be referencing Trump quite a bit this fall. That said, the president may be willing to spend up to five days a week campaigning, but the practical impediments may be greater than he realizes.\n\nPostscript: Trump was in Pittsburgh over the weekend, trying to boost Republican Rick Saccone's campaign. It's a safe bet GOP officials took note of the results, and the president's inability to help carry his party's candidate across the finish line.",

The Associated Press ran an interesting report late yesterday.\n\nA man who registered as a Green Party candidate for Montana's U.S. Senate race was on the state Republican Party's payroll and heads a newly formed anti-tax group, according to a review of election documents.\n\nTimothy Adams filed as a challenger Monday against Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who faces a tough re-election campaign, in a race where a Green Party candidate could siphon votes from the Democrat.\n\nNow, I suppose it's possible that this guy, who was paid by the Montana Republican State Central Committee as recently as 2015, underwent a dramatic reevaluation of his political beliefs, and somehow went from the far-right to the far-left quite quickly.\n\nBut it seems more likely that the GOP is engaged in some unfortunate electoral mischief.\n\nIn the hopes of preempting angry emails, let me acknowledge that the Green Party is an actual entity, with plenty of sincere activists who care about the party's platform and vision.\n\nThat said, we're occasionally reminded that while the Republican Party rejects everything the Green Party stands for, the GOP nevertheless sees the Green Party as incredibly useful in moving the country to the right. Indeed, we know just as a matter of arithmetic that if Green Party voters had backed the Democratic ticket in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016, Donald Trump would not be president today.\n\nWith this in mind, is it any wonder apparent schemes like this one in Montana pop up?\n\nThe Associated Press' report added that Montana's Green Party, which only qualified as a state party this week, will have more than one candidate prepared to run against Tester. As a result, Timothy Adams - the guy who was on the Republicans' payroll - will have Green Party primary rivals, if he remains on the ballot.",

                "body": "US President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a working dinner with European business leaders during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting...\n\nLast summer, Donald Trump hosted a White House event in recognition of an executive order on the National Space Council. It wouldn't have been especially notable, were it not for the president sharing some unscripted thoughts on the topic of the day.\n\n\"This is infinity here,\" Trump said. \"It could be infinity. We don't really don't know. But it could be. It has to be something - but it could be infinity, right?\"\n\nI still have no idea what the he was even trying to say.\n\nRegardless, between this and his comments yesterday, I'm starting to think the president should avoid this issue altogether. Politico reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump predicted on Tuesday that the U.S. would reach Mars \"very soon\" and backed the idea of creating a militaristic \"space force,\" seemingly expressing support for a measure that faced opposition from officials in his own administration.\n\nTouting recent technological advancements, Trump forecast that \"very soon we're going to Mars\" - a feat that he said wouldn't have been possible had Hillary Clinton prevailed in the 2016 election.\n\nLet's unpack this one, because it's kind of amazing.\n\nFirst, I suppose \"very soon\" is a relative term, but a manned mission to Mars is decades away.\n\nSecond, Trump still seems to be running the 2016 race in his mind. \"You wouldn't have been going to Mars if my opponent won, that I can tell you,\" he said yesterday. \"You wouldn't even be thinking about it.\" To the extent that reality matters, Hillary Clinton described herself as \"an enthusiastic supporter of human space flight,\" committed her administration to investing in the endeavor, including a Mars mission.\n\nAnd then there was the whole \"space force\" thing. \"My new national strategy for space recognizes that space is a warfighting domain, just like the land, air, and sea,\" the president said yesterday. \"We may even have a space force - develop another one, space force. We have the Air Force, we'll have the space force.\"\n\nDescribing a conversation with his team, Trump added, \"Then I said, 'What a great idea!' Maybe we'll have to do that.' That could happen.\" After taking a brief break to describe journalists on hand for the event as \"fake news\" - I guess he lost his train of thought - the president went on to say, \"So think of that: Space force, because we are spending a lot and we have a lot of private money coming in, tremendous.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, there's already an Air Force Space Command. But even putting that aside, Politico's piece noted that when some in Congress worked on creating a U.S. Space Corps, it drew opposition - from the Trump administration.\n\nAs for the president's apparent affection for space exploration, let's also not forget that Trump's budget plan makes significant cuts to investments in NASA.",

                "body": "Republican officials had reason to worry about the 2018 election cycle before yesterday, but it's safe to say their anxiety levels reached new heights overnight.\n\nDemocrat Conor Lamb is the apparent winner over Republican Rick Saccone in Tuesday's special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, according to an NBC News projection.\n\nWith 99 percent of the votes counted, Lamb was leading by 641 votes in a district long held by the GOP and one that President Donald Trump - who backed Saccone - carried by 20 points in 2016.\n\nLamb declared victory early Wednesday morning. Saccone has not conceded and his campaign is in touch with legal counsel.\n\nI can appreciate why the \"apparent\" caveat is unsatisfying, but that's where things stand. Given the best information available right now, it looks like Lamb has narrowly won this race.\n\nAnd that's not an outcome many would've predicted when the special-election campaign started. As we discussed yesterday, Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, south of Pittsburgh in the Keystone State's southwest corner, can safely be described as a Republican stronghold. John McCain won here by 11 points in his presidential campaign in 2008; Mitt Romney fared even better four years later, winning by 17 points; and Donald Trump carried the district by a 20-point margin.\n\nThe area's former congressman, Republican Tim Murphy, ran unopposed in the last two election cycles - because no local Democrats saw any point in going up against him.\n\nWhen a sex scandal led to Murphy's resignation, GOP officials assumed the party would have little trouble holding onto the seat. After all, a Democrat winning here would be like a Democrat winning a U.S. Senate campaign in Alabama.\n\nWait, that recently happened, too.\n\nAs the dust settles, it's worth keeping a few things in mind:\n\n1. Republicans went all out to help Saccone win. The Republican enjoyed a huge financial advantage in this race thanks to spending from outside GOP groups, and Saccone received extensive support from party leaders, including visits to the area from the president and vice president. As Republican candidates nationwide have probably noticed, it didn't much matter.\n\n2. Pennsylvania's 18th was a test run for the GOP's midterm strategy. Republicans saw this contest as a dress rehearsal of sorts, trying out the party's 2018 message. What the GOP quickly discovered instead was that voters didn't much care about the party's focus on its tax plan or its obsessive focus on Nancy Pelosi.\n\n3. A sign of things to come? In early 1974, with a scandal-plagued Republican president in the White House, there was a congressional special election in southwestern Pennsylvania. The district leaned toward the GOP, but Dems ran a young Marine veteran named Jack Murtha, who had fairly broad appeal. He eked out a narrow victory, and Democrats cruised in a wave election cycle later that year. It's entirely possible we'll see a very similar scenario play out in 2018.\n\n4. Lamb was unique, but not that unique. GOP officials will likely argue yesterday was a fluke, since Lamb is generally more conservative than his party. There's some truth to that, but the apparent congressman-elect is a veteran - and Dems have recruited more than a few vets to run this year. What's more, Lamb ran specifically against House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) agenda, and many Democrats are likely to do the same thing in the coming months.\n\n5. The Pennsylvania race fits into a broader pattern. Pennsylvania's 18th. Alabama's Senate special election. State legislative special elections. The evidence suggesting the prevailing winds are at Democrats' backs is hard to miss, at least at this point in the cycle. Republicans may point to U.S. House special election wins in Georgia, South Carolina, Kansas, and Montana, but even in those races, Democrats ran first-time candidates in ruby-red districts, and in every instance, those Dems exceeded expectations and forced Republicans to scramble to secure narrow victories.\n\nYes, there's still some question about the final results in Pennsylvania's 18th, but the point is, Republicans shouldn't have to fight tooth and nail for a district like this. They did, and as of this minute, they failed anyway.\n\nIf the number of GOP retirements suddenly goes up, we'll know why.",

                "body": "A little more than a year ago, the New York Times published a no-nonsense lede about a key personal decision that Donald Trump had just announced.\n\nAs a clandestine officer at the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002, Gina Haspel oversaw the torture of two terrorism suspects and later took part in an order to destroy videotapes documenting their brutal interrogations at a secret prison in Thailand.\n\nOn Thursday, Ms. Haspel was named the deputy director of the C.I.A.\n\nThe elevation of Ms. Haspel, a veteran widely respected among her colleagues, to the No. 2 job at the C.I.A. was a rare public signal of how, under the Trump administration, the agency is being led by officials who appear to take a far kinder view of one of its darker chapters than their immediate predecessors.\n\nA year later, Donald Trump has gone a step further, moving CIA Director Mike Pompeo to the State Department and elevating Haspel to the intelligence agency's top job.\n\nIn the Obama era, there was a reluctance on the part of the Democratic White House to dwell on Bush-era scandals. The then-president spoke frequently in 2009 about \"turning the page\" on the previous administration's alleged crimes, including its embrace of torture.\n\nBut as the Trump era got underway, a New Yorker piece noted, \"[T]he past, as Obama well knows, never goes away. With the prospect of American torture looming again, I wonder if Obama regrets his decision. After all, people like Haspel, quite plausibly, could have gone to prison.\"\n\nAnd now Haspel is the president's choice to be the director of the CIA.\n\nPolitico added last year that Haspel's experience \"includes having overseen a 'black site' prison in Thailand where terrorism suspects faced harsh interrogation tactics such as waterboarding, according to multiple media reports.\"\n\nThat kind of background should represent a screaming red siren in any responsible administration. Trump, evidently, has a very different perspective.\n\nOf course, this is a position that requires Senate confirmation. In a Republican-led chamber, it's probably fair to say Haspel is likely to succeed. That said, her nomination will be considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is led by an occasional Trump critic, retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). The same panel features Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who can sometimes be idiosyncratic on issues such as these, and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), another Trump critic who's retiring at the end of this Congress.\n\nWatch this space.",

John McCain won here by 11 points in his presidential campaign in 2008; Mitt Romney fared even better four years later, winning by 17 points; and Donald Trump carried the district by a 20-point margin.\n\nThe area's former congressman, Republican Tim Murphy, ran unopposed in the last two election cycles - because no local Democrats saw any point in going up against him.\n\nWith this recent history in mind, it was a bit jarring to see this Politico piece yesterday.\n\nThe chairman of Pennsylvania's Republican Party said Monday the special election in which Democrat Conor Lamb is running neck-and-neck with Republican Rick Saccone is in a \"Democrat district,\" even though it was represented by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won it handily in 2016.\n\n\"The other reason it's so tight is, you have to remember, this is a Democrat district, notwithstanding the fact that the president won this by 20 points,\" Pennsylvania GOP chairman Val DiGiorgio told Fox News on Monday.\n\nPutting aside grammatical concerns - I'll assume the state GOP chairman meant \"Democratic\" district - it's a tough sell.\n\nThat said, there's no great mystery as to why Republicans are saying things like this. When Tim Murphy resigned in the wake of a sex scandal, GOP officials assumed the seat would remain in Republican hands. But the more Conor Lamb (D) proved to be an excellent candidate, and the more Rick Saccone proved to be an inept candidate, the race became competitive in ways few expected.\n\nIn fact, a Monmouth University poll released yesterday showed Lamb with a modest lead.\n\nThe result has been an awkward dynamic: Republican officials are pulling out all the stops, investing an enormous amount of resources in this seemingly \"red\" district, while simultaneously trying to lower expectations, trashing Saccone's skills as a candidate, and preparing for the possibility of defeat.\n\nIndeed, the pressure seems to be getting to Saccone: at his final pre-election rally last night, the Republican told supporters that \"the other side\" hates the United States and God. Confident candidates don't usually fly off the handle like this.\n\nSo, why should voters outside of Southwest Pennsylvania care?\n\nFirst, this could reinforce suspicions of a burgeoning Democratic wave. The fact that this district is competitive at all should be quite alarming to GOP officials, but if the Republican candidate actually loses in a district Trump won by 20 points, Republican panic will become more palpable, and we might even start to see some additional retirements.\n\nSecond, the race has become a test run of sorts for the GOP's 2018 strategy. Republican attack ads keep talking about House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) - whom, not incidentally, Conor Lamb says he opposes. What's more, the GOP initially thought it could emphasize the party's regressive tax plan as a way of boosting Saccone's candidacy.\n\nThis hasn't gone especially well. Pelosi's relevance in the district is a mystery and Republicans ultimately gave up on tax-plan advertising when they found it wasn't resonating.\n\nThird, Trump has once again put himself on the line, endorsing and promoting Saccone, including headlining a campaign rally near the district this past weekend. If the president's preferred candidate loses - after two of his preferred candidates lost in Alabama late last year - it will further remind his party that Trump can't deliver votes for Republican candidates, even when he tries, and even after he embraced steel tariffs intended to be popular in districts like these.\n\nI'm sympathetic to the fact that local considerations always matter, and in this case, Dems have an excellent candidate - a likable young Marine, who ran a mistake-free race and raised quite a bit of money - and Republicans didn't. No one should count on this identical dynamic playing out the same way in districts nationwide in the fall.\n\nWhat's more, there's no reason to assume Lamb will prevail, the latest polling notwithstanding. Indeed, it wouldn't surprise me at all if media attention helped remind local voters that this race matters, which may very well help boost turnout among conservatives.\n\nThe bottom line, however, remains the same: win or lose, the fact that this race is a toss-up should make Republicans nervous.\n\nPolls close in Pennsylvania at 8:00 pm (E.T.).",

John McCain won here by 11 points in his presidential campaign in 2008; Mitt Romney fared even better four years later, winning by 17 points; and Donald Trump carried the district by a 20-point margin.\n\nThe area's former congressman, Republican Tim Murphy, ran unopposed in the last two election cycles - because no local Democrats saw any point in going up against him.\n\nWith this recent history in mind, it was a bit jarring to see this Politico piece yesterday.\n\nThe chairman of Pennsylvania's Republican Party said Monday the special election in which Democrat Conor Lamb is running neck-and-neck with Republican Rick Saccone is in a \"Democrat district,\" even though it was represented by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won it handily in 2016.\n\n\"The other reason it's so tight is, you have to remember, this is a Democrat district, notwithstanding the fact that the president won this by 20 points,\" Pennsylvania GOP chairman Val DiGiorgio told Fox News on Monday.\n\nPutting aside grammatical concerns - I'll assume the state GOP chairman meant \"Democratic\" district - it's a tough sell.\n\nThat said, there's no great mystery as to why Republicans are saying things like this. When Tim Murphy resigned in the wake of a sex scandal, GOP officials assumed the seat would remain in Republican hands. But the more Conor Lamb (D) proved to be an excellent candidate, and the more Rick Saccone proved to be an inept candidate, the race became competitive in ways few expected.\n\nIn fact, a Monmouth University poll released yesterday showed Lamb with a modest lead.\n\nThe result has been an awkward dynamic: Republican officials are pulling out all the stops, investing an enormous amount of resources in this seemingly \"red\" district, while simultaneously trying to lower expectations, trashing Saccone's skills as a candidate, and preparing for the possibility of defeat.\n\nIndeed, the pressure seems to be getting to Saccone: at his final pre-election rally last night, the Republican told supporters that \"the other side\" hates the United States and God. Confident candidates don't usually fly off the handle like this.\n\nSo, why should voters outside of Southwest Pennsylvania care?\n\nFirst, this could reinforce suspicions of a burgeoning Democratic wave. The fact that this district is competitive at all should be quite alarming to GOP officials, but if the Republican candidate actually loses in a district Trump won by 20 points, Republican panic will become more palpable, and we might even start to see some additional retirements.\n\nSecond, the race has become a test run of sorts for the GOP's 2018 strategy. Republican attack ads keep talking about House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) - whom, not incidentally, Conor Lamb says he opposes. What's more, the GOP initially thought it could emphasize the party's regressive tax plan as a way of boosting Saccone's candidacy.\n\nThis hasn't gone especially well. Pelosi's relevance in the district is a mystery and Republicans ultimately gave up on tax-plan advertising when they found it wasn't resonating.\n\nThird, Trump has once again put himself on the line, endorsing and promoting Saccone, including headlining a campaign rally near the district this past weekend. If the president's preferred candidate loses - after two of his preferred candidates lost in Alabama late last year - it will further remind his party that Trump can't deliver votes for Republican candidates, even when he tries, and even after he embraced steel tariffs intended to be popular in districts like these.\n\nI'm sympathetic to the fact that local considerations always matter, and in this case, Dems have an excellent candidate - a likable young Marine, who ran a mistake-free race and raised quite a bit of money - and Republicans didn't. No one should count on this identical dynamic playing out the same way in districts nationwide in the fall.\n\nWhat's more, there's no reason to assume Lamb will prevail, the latest polling notwithstanding. Indeed, it wouldn't surprise me at all if media attention helped remind local voters that this race matters, which may very well help boost turnout among conservatives.\n\nThe bottom line, however, remains the same: win or lose, the fact that this race is a toss-up should make Republicans nervous.\n\nPolls close in Pennsylvania at 8:00 pm (E.T.).",

                "title": "Roger Stone faces new questions about alleged WikiLeaks connections",
                "body": "During the 2016 presidential campaign, Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative and informal adviser to Donald Trump, seemed to have unique insights into developments that had not yet occurred. Stone, for example, on more than one occasion, teased anti-Clinton revelations from Wikleaks and its founder, Julian Assange, before the public saw them.\n\nAs the Russia scandal intensified, Stone backed off those claims, insisting that his insights were speculative and that he hadn't actually been in communications with Assange. The Washington Post reports today that there's reason to question the veracity of those denials.\n\n[Stone told someone over the phone in the spring of 2016 that] he had learned from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that his organization had obtained emails that would torment senior Democrats such as John Podesta, then campaign chairman for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe conversation occurred before it was publicly known that hackers had obtained the emails of Podesta and of the Democratic National Committee, documents that WikiLeaks released in late July and October. The U.S. intelligence community later concluded the hackers were working for Russia.\n\nThe Post has two sources. One is Sam Numberg, a former Trump aide, who told the newspaper on the record that he heard from Stone directly about the contacts with Assange. Just as importantly, Numberg said he conveyed all of this to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team.\n\nThe Post's second source is someone the paper has not identified by name.\n\nStone stands by his denial, though it's worth noting that when the GOP operative testified before the House Intelligence Committee in the fall, he reportedly did not directly answer questions under oath about his suspected Assange contacts.\n\nWhy should you care? I think New York's Jon Chait highlighted the relevant context:\n\nThe Post's story does not speculate about whether Stone shared his knowledge with other Trump campaign officials, including Donald Trump himself. It would be stunning and bizarre if he did not. Stone held an official role in the Trump campaign, but departed his official role in August 2015 on what he later called \"excellent terms.\" Later in August, Stone was characteristically cagey about his contacts with the candidate. \"Asked if he had spoken with Mr. Trump since they apparently went their separate ways, Mr. Stone said: 'I would rather not say. I still consider him a friend, and think he still considers me a friend; let's just leave it at that,'\" reported the New York Times.\n\nFor those willing to speculate about such things, connecting the dots is a fairly straightforward exercise. Russia stole Democratic materials and directed them to Wikileaks for dissemination in order to help Trump's campaign. Roger Stone, a Trump ally and adviser, is accused of communicating with Wikileaks, getting advance of warnings about the pending release of Democratic documents.\n\nIf that's true - and again, this hasn't been proven definitively - it's possible that Stone, who claims he had regular contacts with Trump during the presidential race, may have also given his buddy a heads-up about the materials from Russia, perhaps around the time top members of Trump's team met with Russians offering anti-Clinton dirt.\n\nWatch this space.",

                "body": "Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/6/18, 9:00 PM ET Trump, apparently winging it on tariff policy, loses Gary Cohn Rachel Maddow reports on the resignation of Gary Cohn, Donald Trump's top economic advisor, as Trump is in the midst of attempting to wing it through the implementation of complicated, consequential tariff policy. We know Donald Trump has ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson from the cabinet. There's still some question, however, about how and why.\n\nAccording to the White House, Tillerson was notified late last week about his fate. According to the State Department, that's not true. Indeed, NBC News' Andrea Mitchell reports that Tillerson didn't learn about his firing until he saw Donald Trump's tweet this morning.\n\nIt's enough to make one wonder if yesterday's disagreement between Tillerson and the White House over Russia had something to do with the developments.\n\nComplicating matters, this may not be the most unusual personnel news out of Trump World today. The Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's personal assistant, John McEntee, was escorted out of the White House on Monday, two senior administration officials said. The cause of the firing was an unspecified security issue, said a third White House official with knowledge of the situation. [...]\n\nMr. McEntee wasn't as well known as the others, but had been a constant presence at Mr. Trump's side for the past three years. He made sure Mr. Trump had markers to sign autographs, delivered messages to him in the White House residence and, over the weekend, ensured that the clocks in the White House residence were adjusted for daylight-saving time.\n\nIn other words, McEntee was Trump's \"body man.\" If you watched \"The West Wing\" television show, McEntee was Charlie. (Or, for \"Veep\" fans, he was Gary.)\n\nAccording to the WSJ's piece, McEntee was removed from the White House grounds yesterday \"without being allowed to collect his belongings.\" Indeed, he \"left without his jacket.\"\n\nWell, that certainly sounds serious. But CNN reported that almost immediately after McEntee was removed from the White House, he joined Trump's re-election campaign team \"as a senior adviser for campaign operations.\"\n\nSo let me get this straight. McEntee's \"security issue\" was serious enough that he had to be escorted from the White House complex without his belongings, but he could still get a good job on the president's campaign team?\n\nI feel like we're not getting the whole story here.\n\nAnd on that note, this seems like a good time to update the list of prominent Trump World departures:\n\nCabinet: HHS Secretary Tom Price, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nWest Wing: Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Director of Public Liaison George Sifakis, Office of Public Liaison Communications Director Omarosa Manigault, Staff Secretary Rob Porter, Deputy Assistant to the President Sean Cairncross, Chief Usher Angella Reid, Assistant to the President Reed Cordish, Personal Assistant to the President John McEntee Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Carroll (who's leaving his post to become the \"drug czar\")\n\nWhite House Communications: Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Assistant Press Secretary Michael Short, Communications Director #1 Mike Dubke, Communications Director #2 Anthony Scaramucci, Communications Director #3 Hope Hicks, Rapid Response Director Andy Hemming, Speechwriter David Sorensen, Senior Communications Official Josh Raffel\n\nNational Security team: National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Deputy National Security Advisor K.T.

                "body": "Throughout his tenure, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been on the periphery of the Trump administration's foreign policy apparatus, routinely contradicting the White House line. At times, it's seemed as if Donald Trump and his chief diplomat have had entirely different visions of the United States' role in the world.\n\nHow would the administration reconcile the conflict? Apparently, by replacing Tillerson.\n\nPresident Donald Trump asked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to step aside, the White House confirmed Tuesday, replacing him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump thanked Tillerson for his service and said Pompeo \"will do a fantastic job.\"\n\nGina Hapsel, the deputy director at the CIA, will reportedly succeed Pompeo at the intelligence agency.\n\nTillerson is the second cabinet secretary to leave the Trump administration, following former HHS Secretary Tom Price, who resigned last year in the wake of a controversy over his use of private jets.\n\nWhile we didn't know when this shake-up might happen, it doesn't come as a complete surprise. Axios reported way back in October that the White House had roughly this plan in mind: Tillerson would move from the CIA to the State Department, while Tillerson would exit the administration. The New York Times had a related report around Thanksgiving.\n\nBut that forewarning doesn't make the news any less dramatic.\n\nI see this as a development with three core tracks. The first is the ongoing personnel turmoil on Team Trump, which has been dealing with a staffing crisis for months, and which continues to intensify.\n\nThe second is the tenure of Rex Tillerson, the former ExxonMobil chief and Vladimir Putin ally, who was made the nation's chief diplomat despite having no diplomatic experience. He was an unwise choice: not only did Tillerson appear to disagree with his boss about several key international issues, but the secretary also spearheaded a months-long campaign that hollowed out his own cabinet agency, to the dismay of diplomats and other foreign service veterans.\n\nComplicating matters, Tillerson also reportedly called the president a \"moron\" in private, while in public, after Trump's praise for racist protesters in Charlottesville, he said the president \"speaks for himself,\" not the United States.\n\nAnd finally, there's Mike Pompeo, who was far too partisan to be a good fit at the Central Intelligence Agency, and who had an unfortunate habit of politicizing intelligence.\n\nSo, is it fair to see the developments as good news? Probably not. Tillerson was an ineffective and misguided secretary of state, but he at least tried to have a moderating influence over the president.\n\nPompeo, a former far-right congressman from Kansas, probably won't. Indeed, The New Republic had an item several months ago making the compelling case that Pompeo would be \"a disaster\" at the State Department.\n\nA longtime Koch ally, Pompeo has described the War on Terror as a clash between Christianity and Islam and defended the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretapping program. A foreign policy hawk, Pompeo has also advocated that Ed Snowden receive the death penalty. He weaves together two of the worst and most pervasive threads of the Trump administration: its coziness with corporate interests (he received more Koch money than any other Congressman in 2010) and its xenophobia.\n\nIt's true that Pompeo could bring more credibility to the State Department: unlike Tillerson, he has the president's ear, and he is unlikely to lose it. But any proximity would come at an enormous cost: even grading on a Trumpian curve, Pompeo would be an enormously destructive force - far more hawkish than Tillerson, the risk for global conflict is too high for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe confirmation hearings are bound to be interesting.",

                "body": "This was among the biggest stories in the world yesterday.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May says her government has concluded it is \"highly likely\" Russia is responsible for the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent.\n\nMay told British lawmakers on Monday that Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were exposed to a nerve agent known as Novichok, a weapon developed in the Soviet Union in the end of the Cold War.\n\nBy some estimates, hundreds of local people may have been exposed to the dangerous nerve agent.\n\nIn case this isn't obvious, the United Kingdom, a pillar of NATO and a nuclear-armed state, came awfully close to saying Russia launched an attack on their sovereign soil. Indeed, the British prime minister specifically declared yesterday, \"Either this was a direct act by the Russian state against our country, or the Russian government lost control of this potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others.\"\n\nAnd so, naturally, attention then turned to the United States. Would Donald Trump's White House stand arm-in-arm with one of America's closest allies after an apparent Russian attack?\n\nA reporter yesterday asked the president's press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, if there will be \"any repercussions for Russia from the United States, in coordination with its British allies.\" Sanders replied that the United States condemns the attack, adding, \"We stand by our closest ally and the special relationship that we have.\"\n\nPressed further, however, Sanders refused to say that Russia was behind the incident. The White House spokesperson also wouldn't endorse Theresa May's conclusions.\n\nHmm.\n\nThe Atlantic's David Frum wrote in response, \"It's too early to say that the Trump administration will do nothing. Perhaps it may yet step up. Perhaps it may even calculate that joining the U.K. in sanctions upon Russians implicated in such an outrageous crime may quiet complaints about the Trump administration's refusal to implement sanctions for Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Those questions remain open. For now, though, we are presented with the most astounding yet Trump default from traditional U.S. alliances and leadership.\"\n\nAbout a month ago, the White House was eager to insist that when it comes to Russia, Donald Trump has been incredibly \"tough.\" We should all be impressed with his \"toughness.\" Trump's tough toughness, the argument went, has certainly been tougher than that rascally Barack Obama, who was never as tough as Donald \"Tough\" Trump.\n\nThe evidence to the contrary, of course, has long been overwhelming. After yesterday, Sanders' rhetoric appears even more ridiculous.\n\nPostscript: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson went much further than the White House in blaming Russia for the incident, but since Tillerson often seems to be on the periphery of the administration, routinely contradicting the official Trump line, it's hard to gauge the significance of the cabinet official's comments.",

                "body": "Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/12/18, 9:42 PM ET Schiff blasts GOP over premature Russia probe shutdown Rep. Adam Schiff talks with Rachel Maddow about the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee shutting down their Trump Russia investigation with witnesses yet to interview and questions left unanswered. As recently as yesterday afternoon, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee thought their investigation into the Russia scandal was ongoing. What they didn't know was that their Republican colleagues had ended their probe, drawn their conclusions, and even prepared their report.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, Donald Trump's partisan allies managed to say exactly what the White House wanted them to say.\n\nHouse Republicans investigating foreign interference in the 2016 election say they have found no evidence that Russians colluded with any members of the Trump campaign and dispute a key finding from the intelligence community that Russia had developed a preference for the Republican nominee during the election.\n\nThose are the initial conclusions of a 150-page report from GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, who are formally bringing the panel's yearlong investigation to an end over the fierce objection of Democrats.\n\nWe know how this is supposed to work. The House Intelligence Committee, which used to go out of its way to operate in a nominally non-partisan fashion, is supposed to conduct a thorough investigation. After its completion, members from both parties are supposed to review their findings and methodically prepare a detailed report.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a close Trump ally, and his cohorts decided to pursue a very different course. NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell called the GOP lawmakers' actions \"pretty stunning,\" adding, \"The fix was in from the start.\"\n\nAnd now, according to House Republicans, the chamber's examination of Russia's attack on U.S. elections is over.\n\nIt's worth taking a moment to consider who and what GOP lawmakers chose to ignore as part of this ridiculous process:\n\n* House Republicans ignored the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies. U.S. intelligence professionals concluded that Russian operatives launched their 2016 intelligence operation in order to help put Donald Trump in power. GOP lawmakers on the intelligence committee decided to reject this politically inconvenient conclusion.\n\n* House Republicans ignored requests to interview key witnesses: Key players in this scandal, including Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, and George Papadopoulos, were never interviewed by the committee. Not to put too fine a point on this, but a thorough examination of what happened should probably include a private chat with former chairman of the campaign Russia wanted to help - who also happens to be under criminal indictment over his Russian ties.\n\n* House Republicans ignored evidence of witnesses who may have lied to the committee. It's hardly a stretch to believe some of the witnesses the Intelligence Committee spoke to gave false and/or incomplete testimony - which in some cases, may have been a crime. As of yesterday, GOP lawmakers don't appear to care.\n\n* House Republicans ignored potential leads. Last week, the New York Times published an important story about Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, who is now a witness cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe. The article noted that Mueller not only appears to be \"examining the influence of foreign money\" in the 2016 campaign, but Nader also helped arrange the controversial January 2017 meeting in the Seychelles. A day after the article ran, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who helped oversee the House Intelligence Committee's investigation, told a reporter, \"I don't have any clue who George Nader is.\"\n\n* House Republicans ignored their duties: In case anyone's forgotten, a foreign adversary launched an intelligence operation as part of a coordinated attack on the United States. Our attackers may have had allied compatriots who helped with the illegal scheme. GOP lawmakers on the Intelligence Committee had a responsibility to follow the facts wherever they led, not only to better understand what happened and why, but also to hold those responsible accountable.\n\nBut from the outset, the Republicans' principal goal had little to do with finding the facts and more to do with finding ways to protect the beneficiary of the Russian attack.\n\nMuch of the country has come to expect very little from this GOP-led Congress, but even cynics may have expected too much from Nunes and his accomplices. In this case, Republicans didn't even bother to pretend to take their responsibilities seriously.\n\nRep. Tom Rooney (R-Pa.), who's retiring from Congress this year, told CNN last night that the members of the House Intelligence Committee might as well drop their investigation since \"we've lost all credibility.\"\n\nRight. And whose fault is that?",

                "title": "Trump mistakenly brings renewed attention to his unpopularity",
                "body": "Donald Trump's poor poll numbers tend not to generate as much attention as they used to. The president is unpopular; we all know he's unpopular; and there's no reason to make a fuss about routine, predictable news.\n\nTrump, however, wants to talk about it anyway.\n\n\"Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50%, which is higher than Obama, and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are 'somewhat low.' They know they are lying when they say it. Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS!\"\n\nWell, someone's lying, but in this case, I don't think it's political pundits.\n\nLet's start with some basics: no recent national poll has the president's approval rating \"around 50%.\" Even Rasmussen, the Republican-friendly pollster that Trump singled out, puts the president's most recent support at 44%. Some major national pollsters, including Gallup, Monmouth, and Quinnipiac, each show Trump below 40%.\n\nAnd then there's the hilarious idea that Trump's support is \"higher than Obama.\" While I realize this president tends to see most political developments through an Obama-centric lens, the truth is, Trump's poll numbers, at least at this stage, are the lowest of any president in the modern era. Trump isn't especially close to where Obama was at this point in the Democrat's presidency.\n\nIn other words, by objective, verifiable metrics, everything Trump said on the subject is demonstrably untrue. What I think is more interesting, however, is why the president is calling attention to his unpopularity.\n\nOrdinarily, Politics 101 says that a president struggling with the public should dismiss the significance of polling. \"I'm doing what I think is best for the nation,\" a president is supposed to say, \"and I'll leave concerns about volatile polls to others.\" Barack Obama used to say that the ebb and flow of day-to-day politics was \"noise\" he didn't have time for.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, seems to think he's better off lying, embracing a make-believe landscape in which quantitative data doesn't say what it clearly says. Rather, the president evidently sees the figures he prefers to believe.\n\nThis generally isn't what \"very stable geniuses\" do in response to evidence, but more to the point, I think Trump does this because it's vastly easier than changing direction.\n\nAfter more than a year of effort, if you were the least popular president since the dawn of modern polling - despite a healthy economy and generally favorable conditions - you might consider some kind of course correction. That, however, would require a combination of effort and the reevaluation of key assumptions. This president has no interest in either.\n\nAnd so we're left with a fantasy in which plain, black-and-white numbers are seen through a fun-house mirror, offering a version of reality Trump prefers to this one.\n\nWhat should worry the White House, however, is the lack of a buffer. Trump's support is about 40% threshold despite low unemployment and decent economic growth. If the economy stalls, or there's an unforeseen crisis that rattles the public's confidence even more, there's no reservoir of good will for this president to draw upon.",

                "title": "Trump's 'intuition' is a poor substitute for evidence and reason",
                "body": "Peter Navarro has become a prominent adviser to Donald Trump on trade issues, and he told Bloomberg Politics the other day how he approaches his role in the White House.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg on March 7, Navarro heaped praise on his boss and described his own role as that of an enabler.\n\n\"This is the president's vision. My function, really, as an economist is to try to provide the underlying analytics that confirm his intuition. And his intuition is always right in these matters,\" Navarro said.\n\nPerhaps it's worth pausing to note what an \"adviser\" to the president is supposed to do: advisers advise. They offer guidance based on research, judgment, and subject-matter expertise. An economist, in particular, is not supposed to start with someone's intuition and then work backwards to bolster the preconceived idea. It's a classic example of post-policy thinking.\n\nBut in this White House, this dynamic has become the norm. When shaping life-changing policy, Trump and his team could rely principally on evidence, data, facts, and reason, or they can go with what strikes them as \"intuitively\" true. They keep going with the latter. It's the difference between technocratic governing and listening to the gut of a 71-year-old amateur with no background in government, public policy, or public service.\n\nAnd it comes up all the time. The Washington Post reported over the weekend that White House aides provided Trump with data on the effects of Bush-era steel tariffs in 2002, which did not have the intended effect. \"The president considered the advice,\" the article said, \"but said that he was skeptical of economists and their data.\"\n\nOf course. Why consider facts when the president has \"intuition\" and aides who tell him his hunches are always true?\n\nEven on North Korea and the prospect of a meeting with Kim Jong-un, the president didn't listen to his diplomats, intelligence agencies, or national security team. South Korean officials said the dictator would like a convention and the American president - impulsively and without any real strategy - accepted the invitation.\n\nA Washington Post analysis added, Trump \"has little worry about a dearth of qualified staff because he considers himself to be his own diplomat, negotiator and strategist.\"\n\nIn his acceptance speech at the Republican National Committee in 2016, Trump declared, \"Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.\" Maybe he meant that literally?\n\nThe Associated Press went on to report on Friday:\n\nThe president has long considered himself his own best consultant, saying during the presidential campaign: \"I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.\"\n\nTrump has told confidants recently that he wants to be less reliant on his staff, believing they often give bad advice, and that he plans to follow his own instincts, which he credits with his stunning election, according to two people who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about private conversations.\n\nBy this reasoning, for Trump, the White House's staffing crisis isn't really a crisis at all. All the president needs his intuition and some aides to execute his vision.",

                "body": "One of my favorite moments of Rick Perry's lengthy tenure as the Republican governor of Texas came in 2011, when he hosted an event in which he fielded questions from Texas Tribune chief Evan Smith. Relaying an inquiry from a voter, Smith asked, \"Why does Texas continue with abstinence education programs, when they don't seem to be working?\"\n\nPerry listened the question, thought for a second, and replied, \"Abstinence works.\"\n\nThe reporter pressed on, reminding the governor, \"But we have the third-highest teen teen-pregnancy rate among all states in the country. The questioner's point is, it doesn't seem to be working.\" The governor responded, \"It - it works.\"\n\nIn reality, Texas helped prove that pushing abstinence was spectacularly ineffective as a public policy - a fact Perry simply couldn't bring himself to understand, data be damned - which is why it's all the more discouraging to see the policy \"make a comeback\" now. The Hill reported last week:\n\nIn a marked departure from the previous administration, conservatives at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are putting an emphasis on abstinence to reduce teen pregnancy rates.\n\nSo far, the administration has encouraged organizations applying for Title X federal family planning funds to include in their programs a \"meaningful emphasis\" on \"the benefits of avoiding sex\" when communicating with adolescents and to use programs that don't \"normalize sexual risk behaviors.\"\n\nThe Trump administration also plans to release its first report early this summer as part of a $10 million research project looking at ways to improve sex education programs, with a focus on the impact of \"sexual delay.\"\n\nPolitico added last week that Valerie Huber, the acting deputy assistant secretary for population affairs at HHS, and a longtime abstinence advocate , \"will be the final arbiter of which groups receive federal family planning funds - a change from prior years, when a group of officials made the decision.\"\n\nAs a matter of public health, all of this is quite discouraging. But there's also a political element to this that shouldn't be overlooked: abstinence is \"making a comeback\" under the presidency of Donald J. Trump.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but when it comes to sex-related controversies, there's a certain awkwardness to the circumstances we find ourselves in. The president, after all, is a thrice-married admitted adulterer. He's also currently facing a series of difficult questions about why his personal attorney paid $130,000 in hush money to a porn star who alleges a sexual relationship with Trump that started during his current marriage.\n\nIt's bad enough that the Trump administration has the wrong message, but could this president be a worse messenger?",

                "title": "Why Trump clings to a cynical lie about Dreamers, DACA",
                "body": "Donald Trump delivered a message to the Latino Coalition Legislative Summit last week, telling attendees that the failure to protect Dreamers from his administration's own policy is Congress' fault. More specifically, he urged the Latino Coalition to blame Democrats for not embracing the White House's immigration plan.\n\nTrump insisted that Democrats \"don't care about our immigration system\" which is why the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program - a program the president rescinded - is in doubt.\n\nOver the weekend, at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, the president went a little further:\n\n\"[Democrats] want to stop DACA. DACA is their issue. But I'm willing to go along and get it done. [...]\n\n\"I offered a deal that was so good you can't refuse, right, like the mob pictures. I will give you a deal that is so good, you can't refuse. I made a deal. I gave a deal so good, they could not refused. And I did it because I thought they were going to refuse. And they did. And they are getting killed now by the DACA recipients. They are getting killed.\"\n\nNone of this reflects reality in any way, though in this specific instance, I'm less interested in the fact that Trump is lying about DACA and more interested in why Trump is lying about DACA.\n\nThe facts are unambiguous: after assuring Dreamers that he wouldn't punish them, Trump ended the DACA program. Scrambling to protect these young immigrants, Democrats offered the president six different bipartisan agreements, each of which Trump either rejected or walked away from.\n\nMeanwhile, the president pushed a non-negotiable far-right alternative: he'd extend protections to Dreamers if Congress gave him $25 billion for a border wall and dramatic cuts to legal immigration. Democrats, independents, immigration advocates, and quite a few Senate Republicans said this was simply a bridge too far. In a GOP-led Senate, Trump plan generated just 39 votes.\n\nIt was, to borrow the president's phrasing, an offer that was quite easy to refuse.\n\nBut Trump still won't budge. Even after Democrats agreed to the money for the border wall, Trump said it wasn't enough - he needed cuts to legal immigration, too.\n\nThere is literally no evidence that any immigration advocates involved in the debate are blaming Democrats for any of this. For Trump, the line between wishful thinking and reality is too often blurred.\n\nSo why is the president lying so brazenly? Because Trump realizes that the politics of this debate aren't going his way. As we discussed a month ago, this president has a great many flaws, but he tends to understand what will affect his own personal standing. Trump realizes, in this case, that if he starts deporting hundreds of thousands of Dreamers, the threat of a political backlash is real. After all, the American mainstream supports DACA protections for these young immigrants and opposes the White House's approach.\n\nAnd so, in order to protect himself politically, Trump has to lie - brazenly and repeatedly - as he did again over the weekend.",

That taunt gave way to \"Liddle\" Adam Schiff, and later \"Phony\" Adam Schiff.\n\nThe California lawmaker, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, eventually responded, in a message to Trump, \"Surely you know the key to a good playground nickname is consistency. I thought you were supposed to be good at this.\"\n\nAlas, the president isn't good at this, and his bullying has gotten lazy. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) was labeled \"Dicky Durbin.\" Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) was called, simply, \"Flake Jeff Flake,\" which is the hardly the kind of name-calling one expects from someone who actually cares about name-calling.\n\nAt his campaign rally in Pittsburgh on Saturday night, the president seemed eager to dish out Trump-branded insults, calling Democratic congressional candidate Conor Lamb \"Lamb the Sham,\" which at least rhymes. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) remains \"Pocahontas,\" Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) was described as \"a low-IQ individual\" - a line he also used at the Gridiron event last week, targeting the longtime lawmaker - and NBC News' Chuck Todd was condemned as a \"son of a bitch.\"\n\nOn that last point, Todd asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on \"Meet the Press\" yesterday about the president's antics. This exchange stood out for me:\n\nTODD: I think you most recently appeared before [Maxine Waters'] committee. She's the Ranking Member on House Financial Services. If somebody on your staff referred to her that way in public, would that person still be on your staff?\n\nMNUCHIN: Chuck, you know I've been with the president and at campaigns. You know he likes to put names on people. He did that throughout the entire presidential election. Including all of the Republicans that he beat. So these are campaign rally issues.\n\nThat's not much of an answer. Trump is, after all, supposed to be the president. Making public appearances and using vulgar, juvenile language because he \"likes to\" doesn't really answer the question. Obviously he \"likes to\" do this; the question is whether or not he should.\n\nBesides, describing someone as \"a low-IQ individual\" isn't even an example of name-calling.\n\nBut Mnuchin went a little further in the closing moments of his NBC News appearance, adding, \"I think you should be focused on what the policies are. He's using these vulgarities in the context of a campaign rally and obviously there were a lot of funny moments on that rally.\"\n\nFirst, it's not exactly a stirring endorsement of Trump's character that one of his top cabinet secretaries believes we should be willing to ignore what the president says when he's talking to his supporters in public.\n\nSecond, if we take Mnuchin's advice and \"focus on what the policies are,\" it's not exactly difficult to make the case that Trump's policies offer a degree of vulgarity, too. This is, after all, a president who's pushed a Muslim ban, tax breaks for billionaires, an end to DACA protections for Dreamers, arming school teachers, and taking health security from millions of American families.\n\nI'm all for prioritizing substance over style and reality over rhetoric. But what do we do when Trump's crudeness covers so much ground?",

                "title": "Trump offers new support for executing drug dealers",
                "body": "It started as little more than a rumor. A few weeks ago, Axios had a report that Donald Trump has privately expressed admiration for how Singapore deals with drug-trafficking offenses: the government executes those found guilty. The American president, the report said, has been \"telling friends for months\" that Singapore's model is effective.\n\nTrump kicked things up a notch during a recent White House summit on the opioid crisis, reminding attendees that countries that kill drug dealers \"have much less of a drug problem than we do.\"\n\nNow he's taking this pitch to the public.\n\nPresident Trump on Saturday again called for enacting the death penalty for drug dealers during a rally meant to bolster a struggling GOP candidate for a U.S. House seat here. [...]\n\nTrump said that allowing prosecutors to seek the death penalty for drug dealers - an idea he said he got from Chinese President Xi Jinping - is \"a discussion we have to start thinking about. I don't know if this country's ready for it.\"\n\nSo, Donald Trump believes that to address the drug problem, the American government should probably kill more American citizens. What's more, Trump's thinking on criminal justice issues has apparently been shaped by China - a country led by an unelected president who serves for life, in a country that isn't exactly known for serving as a model on civil liberties.\n\nFor those concerned about Trump's authoritarian tendencies, this won't help.\n\nWorse, whether Trump understands this or not, China still has a serious drug problem of its own, harsh criminal penalties notwithstanding, which is pretty much the opposite of that the Republican told his Pennsylvania audience over the weekend.\n\nAs we discussed a couple of weeks ago, the problem isn't just the president's fondness for solving problems by killing people. While the White House tries to craft some kind of policy agenda to deal with the nation's opioid crisis, the fact that Trump seems to prefer \"very tough penalties\" also tells us something important about what we can expect from the administration. Politico recently reported:\n\n\"It makes us all very nervous\" that the U.S. could move back to a \"penal-first approach,\" said Andrew Kessler, who leads Slingshot Solutions, a consulting firm specializing in behavioral health policy that advocates for substance abuse treatment and prevention. \"I have no love for high-level traffickers or cartels, but a very high percentage of people who sell drugs do it to support their own habit.\"\n\nHe and others said the government would be better offer treating people for addiction than imprisoning them.\n\n\"We have done the experiment with extreme mass incarceration to shrink the drug market and it failed,\" said Mark Kleiman, who leads the crime and justice program at New York University's Marron Institute of Urban Management. \"Between 1980 and today, the number of drug dealers behind bars has gone up by a factor of 30 and the prices of heroin and cocaine have fallen more than 90 percent. So the problem with putting drug dealers in prison is there is another drug dealer in there to take his place.\"\n\nTrump believes the best solution is a solution he can characterize as \"tough.\" For those interested in addressing a major challenge in effective and constructive ways, this isn't at all encouraging.",

                "title": "Is Trump eyeing another change to his legal defense team?",
                "body": "There's practically been a revolving door at Donald Trump's White House, with key aides departing at a dramatic rate, creating a staffing crisis with no modern precedent. But let's not forget that the president's outside legal team has seen some shake-ups, too.\n\nAs the Russia scandal intensified, and the president found it necessary to bring on outside counsel, Trump initially turned to Marc Kasowitz to head up the team. That didn't go especially well - Kasowitz had no relevant background in this kind legal work - and the baton was soon passed to Ty Cobb.\n\nThe New York Times reported over the weekend that a new lawyer is suddenly in the mix.\n\nPresident Trump is in discussions with a veteran Washington lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during the impeachment process about joining the White House to help deal with the special counsel inquiry, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office this past week to discuss the possibility, according to the people. No final decision has been made, according to two of the people.\n\nThis isn't exactly my area of expertise, but Flood has an exceptional reputation, and given the seriousness of the scandal facing the president, Trump would be lucky to secure Flood's services. The performance of the president's current outside legal team has been underwhelming for a while, and Flood's background is exactly what Trump needs.\n\nWhich is why it was of interest when Trump denied the accuracy of the Times' reporting and insisted via Twitter that he's \"VERY happy\" with his lawyers. (The newspaper stands by its article.)\n\nSo, what's going on here?\n\nOne possibility - and this is admittedly speculative - is that Flood simply said no, which led Trump to take a I-didn't-want-to-hire-him-anyway posture. I talked yesterday to a D.C. lawyer, who has no involvement in this case or Flood's firm, but who reminded me of a couple of things.\n\nFirst, the major D.C. law firms tend to be skittish about high-profile clients who have a habit of refusing to pay their bills - and \"Deadbeat Donald\" has a reputation in this area he'll never shake.\n\nSecond, the big D.C. firms, aware of Trump's habit of refusing to pay his bills, would probably insist on an up-front retainer of tens of millions of dollars, which is an arrangement the president isn't likely to accept.\n\nRegardless, the Times' report added that the overture to Flood \"appears, at the least, to be an acknowledgment that the investigation is unlikely to end anytime soon.\" Remember, in recent months, Trump's legal team has said the investigation into the president would end by Thanksgiving.. Then they said it would all wrap up by Dec. 31. Then Jan. 31. Then March 31.\n\nThen Trump World reportedly offered Special Counsel Robert Mueller an interview opportunity with the president if Mueller agreed drop the probe by May,\n\nIf the president is weighing another change on his legal team, it'd be hard to blame him.",

                "title": "Trump is clearly not 'the ultimate deal-maker and negotiator'",
                "body": "At the end of Friday's White House press briefing, a reporter asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders what \"specific steps\" Donald Trump is taking to prepare for a summer with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The president's press secretary suggested there's nothing to worry about:\n\n\"[T]he president is, I think, the ultimate negotiator and dealmaker when it comes to any type of conversation.... And we feel very confident in where we are.\"\n\nAround the same time, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said the other day that Trump is \"one of the best negotiators.\" Soon after, in a separate interview, asked why the American leader agreed to the meeting, a senior administration official added that the president \"has made his reputation on making deals.\"\n\nPerhaps, but has Trump earned that reputation, or is it a sales pitch based on meaningless hype with no grounding in reality?\n\nTo be sure, this presidents wants to be perceived as a world-class negotiator. Not long before launching his presidential campaign, Trump identified what he saw as his greatest strength. \"Deals are my art form,\" the Republican boasted. \"Other people paint beautifully or write poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks.\" It's partly why he paid a ghost-writer to help write a book called, \"The Art of the Deal.\"\n\nBut in practice, this is proving to be one of Trump's biggest weaknesses.\n\nIndeed, as president, the grand total of major deals - foreign or domestic - negotiated by Trump still stands at roughly zero. He tried and failed to negotiate a health care deal. He tried and failed to negotiate an immigration deal. His party approved massive tax breaks for the wealthy, but the president's role in persuading Republicans to do what they wanted to do anyway was, at best, incidental.\n\nTrump has negotiated no new trade agreements. He's negotiated no new security agreements. He's made more than a few unilateral executive-branch actions, but that's largely because the White House's efforts at deal-making haven't amounted to anything.\n\nThose feeling charitable might point to a U.S.-negotiated cease fire in Syria, but even in this case, the administration basically just handed over more power and authority to Trump's allies in Russia.\n\nOthers might argue that Trump hasn't demonstrated any deal-making abilities as president, but we should instead look to the skills he demonstrated in the private sector. But even here, his record isn't what it appears to be. I'm reminded of something Vox's Ezra Klein wrote last year:\n\nThe answer can be found in Trump Steaks. And Trump University. And Trump Vodka. And Trump Suits. And Trump's fragrance line, his board game, his ghostwritten books, his energy drink, his eyeglasses, and his chocolate bars.\n\nYes, these are all real Trump products. And they expose the reality of Trump's dealmaking. Trump is not a guy who makes particularly good deals so much as a guy who makes a lot of deals - many of which lash his name and reputation to garbage products.\n\nTrump, a lifelong teetotaler, didn't scour the globe to find the very best vodka. No -- someone offered him an opportunity to make a quick buck by putting his name on a product he wouldn't ever touch and he took it. Trump University was a far darker scam. Trump Steaks were, and are, a joke.\n\nThis is Trump's pattern: He licenses his brand and lets others worry about the details of the products. Trump's partners often end up going out of business and his customers often end up disappointed, but Trump makes some money, and he gets his name out there, and it's all good.\n\nAs we discussed at the time, this model has made Trump very wealthy, but it has nothing to do with being a successful president who knows how to strike meaningful deals.\n\nWhat's more, none of this is the result of misfortune or near-miss opportunities. Trump has struggled at deal-making because he doesn't care to do the work necessary to reach agreements. To strike big deals, negotiators need to do their homework. They need to be able to listen to competing arguments. They need to be creative. They need to be consistent and show follow-through. They need patience and an appreciation for nuance.\n\nWhatever strengths Donald J. Trump may bring to the table, he has none of these qualities. It's precisely why there's reason for skepticism about our amateur president leading diplomatic talks with a nuclear-armed rogue dictator, and why it's hard to take seriously the idea that the American president is \"the ultimate negotiator and dealmaker when it comes to any type of conversation.\"",

                "body": "We learned last week that Stormy Daniels, the porn star who received $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged sexual relationship with Donald Trump, sat down with Anderson Cooper for an interview to air on CBS's \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nBuzzFeed reported yesterday that the president's attorneys are considering new litigation to block the segment from airing.\n\nLawyers associated with President Donald Trump are considering legal action to stop 60 Minutes from airing an interview with Stephanie Clifford, the adult film performer and director who goes by Stormy Daniels, BuzzFeed News has learned.\n\n\"We understand from well-placed sources they are preparing to file for a legal injunction to prevent it from airing,\" a person informed of the preparations told BuzzFeed News on Saturday evening.\n\nIt's worth emphasizing that Trump World has an unfortunate habit of threatening all kinds of litigation, and those threats often amount to nothing. It was just two months ago, for example, that the president's lawyers tried to block the publication of Michael Wolff's \"Fire and Fury.\" The effort went nowhere.\n\nAnd there's no reason to think litigation against CBS, if it's filed, would be any better. At issue is something called \"prior restraint,\" in which a plaintiff asks a court to suppress media - broadcasts, print content, etc. - that the litigant considers harmful. The existence of the First Amendment makes this difficult and creates a high bar to be cleared.\n\nWe don't know what, if anything, Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told \"60 Minutes\" about her alleged affair. Chances are, Trump's lawyers don't know, either. But if Trump World does bring this to court, it's probably going to claim that Daniels is subject to a non-disclosure agreement - an agreement that CBS News had no part of - and that her claims will be libelous to the president if aired.\n\nI'm happy to let legal experts speak to this in detail, but I have a hunch the end result will be higher ratings for the interview.\n\nIf BuzzFeed's reporting is correct and the president's lawyers follow through on the threat, it would also be the second legal action in as many weeks trying to silence the adult-film actress, reinforcing the impression that the controversy is making Trump World nervous.\n\nIn related news, Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer, now claims he borrowed against his home equity in 2016 in order to finance Daniels' hush money, which (a) reflects a dedication to his client that borders on comedy; (b) further suggests he was probably reimbursed for the $130,000 payment; and (c) opens the door to possible legal sanctions against Cohen, because lawyers aren't supposed to do stuff like this.\n\nNBC News reports, meanwhile, that legal experts believe the hush-money payment may have been an election-law violation.\n\nFinally, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Friday that Team Trump has already \"addressed\" the scandal \"extensively,\" which, strictly speaking, isn't exactly true.\n\nWatch this space.",

                "title": "Despite recent rhetoric, Trump abandons ambitious plans on guns",
                "body": "Two weeks ago, Donald Trump hosted a fascinating meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of senators, and to the surprise of many, the Republican president expressed support for \"comprehensive\" reforms to the nation's gun laws. In fact, Trump said, he envisioned a \"beautiful\" bill that included all kinds of provisions.\n\nSuch as? The president's vision included everything from hiking age requirements on long-guns to \"powerful\" background checks to gun confiscation without due process. As for the National Rifle Association, Trump went so far as to mock Republicans to their face for fearing the far-right lobbying group.\n\nAlmost immediately, the White House signaled that Trump's rhetoric may not reflect the president's actual policy vision, and now that Team Trump has unveiled a blueprint, the 180-degree turn is complete. A Washington Post report noted:\n\nTrump has said he was personally moved by the shooting - and by the persistent and impassioned calls for action from some of the teenage survivors as well as parents of the victims - and elevated the issue of school safety in his administration. He has called for raising the minimum age for purchasing an AR-15 or similar-style rifles from 18 to 21 years old.\n\n\"Now, this is not a popular thing to say, in terms of the NRA. But I'm saying it anyway,\" Trump said in a Feb. 28 meeting with lawmakers. \"You can buy a handgun - you can't buy one; you have to wait until you're 21. But you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it's something you have to think about.\"\n\nYes, and apparently Trump administration officials are done thinking about it and have decided to leave it up to state officials to decide what to do about age requirements.\n\nThe president's plan, however, does include support for arms training for school teachers and creates a commission to examine school safety, to be led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Nearly all of Trump's ambitious vision, however, has been shelved, just two weeks after it was articulated by the president.\n\nAnd that in turn reinforces a few key truths:\n\n1. Donald Trump doesn't speak for the Trump administration. Watching the White House meeting two weeks ago was a surreal experience, largely because most of us knew at the time that the president's team and his allies would ignore everything he was saying. The reversal was inevitable, and now it's happened, to the surprise of no one. We've all internalized the uncomfortable fact that Trump doesn't speak for the Trump administration, and all of his pronouncements are subject to quick walk-backs from others in the West Wing.\n\n2. There's no point in negotiating with this president. Trump doesn't know or care about public policy, and when he makes pronouncements, he generally has no intention of following through on commitments. So why would anyone bother to negotiate with him? How many times - and on how many issues - must this president disappoint his ostensible governing partners before officials simply stop showing up for meetings?\n\n3. Trump's instincts aren't always bad, but they are always irrelevant. When talking about immigration, the president used to voice support for some progressive goals. The same is true on health care. And gun policy. And infrastructure. Trump's instincts aren't the problem. After the latest school massacre, for example, his instincts told him to stand up to the NRA - and admonish those who don't.\n\nWhat ultimately matters is whether he fully understands what he's saying and whether his White House intends to honor the goals. Most of the time, they don't.\n\nFor much of Trump's presidency, Rachel has talked about treating practically everything the White House says like a \"silent movie\" - in effect, pretending not to hear them - because the president and his team simply aren't reliable sources of information, even about themselves and their own agenda. We now know treating everything Trump said at his meeting on guns two weeks ago as a silent movie was the right thing to do.",

                "title": "This Week in God, 3.10.18",
                "body": "Pastor Robert Jeffress of the First Baptist Dallas Church Choir speaks as he introduces President Donald Trump during the Celebrate Freedom event at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Saturday, July 1, 2017.\n\nFirst up from the God Machine this week is a look at the kind of defense Donald Trump's evangelical Christian allies are offering in the wake of the president's Stormy Daniels scandal.\n\nHelping lead the defense is far-right megachurch leader Robert Jeffress - a familiar name to regular readers - who first rose to national political prominence during the 2012 presidential campaign, when he partnered with then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry's (R) candidacy and attacked Mitt Romney as \"a member of a cult.\"\n\nMuch of the country soon became acquainted with the Texan's record of over-the-top extremism, including his description of Roman Catholicism as a \"cult-like pagan religion,\" which represents \"the genius of Satan.\"\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said to associate with Robert Jeffress was \"beneath the office of president of the United States.\"\n\nDonald Trump, however, has embraced Jeffress as a close ally, and the megachurch pastor has returned the favor.\n\n\"Evangelicals still believe in the commandment: Thou shalt not have sex with a porn star,\" Robert Jeffress told Fox News on Thursday. \"However, whether this president violated that commandment or not is totally irrelevant to our support of him.\"\n\nJeffress, who is an evangelical adviser to the president, said Trump's personal behavior isn't an issue. \"Evangelicals knew they weren't voting for an altar boy when they voted for Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nLet's pause to note that anytime a prominent Christian evangelist begins an argument by saying, \"Evangelicals still believe in the commandment: Thou shalt not have sex with a porn star. However...\" the sentence probably won't end well.\n\nNevertheless, in the same interview, Jeffress emphasized his bond with his ally in the White House. \"I'm his friend,\" he said. \"I will never walk away.\"\n\nThis is not an uncommon sentiment among Christian conservatives. In January, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the religious right and the movement's adherents agree that Trump should \"get a mulligan\" when it comes to his personal misdeeds.\n\nPart of the challenge here is the transparent hypocrisy. A decade ago, as Right Wing Watch noted this week, Jeffress specifically condemned any effort to put aside religious principles for the sake of political convenience.\n\n\"Christians need to remember that the kingdom of God is not going to come riding in on Air Force One,\" Jeffress said. \"The danger in all of this discussion is that Christians sometimes are willing to sacrifice the temporal for the eternal, that in order to get their candidate elected, to enact those laws that they feel are crucial, somehow we fool ourselves into thinking we are going to bring about the kingdom of God here on Earth. We are not going to do that. I'm not willing to trade people's eternal destiny for some temporary change in the law.\"\n\nHis perspective, evidently, has changed.\n\nBut it's the result of the change that's worth appreciating. As we discussed after Perkins' \"mulligan\" comments, many Christian conservatives appear to have discovered the virtues of moral relativism.\n\nTrump has high-profile allies in the religious right who've effectively made a moral calculus, borne of political objectives: so long as their partisan ally in the White House delivers on social conservatives' goals, the religious right is prepared to lower the bar on their stated principles.\n\nThe movement, or at least the 2018 version of it, has its priorities, and championing the highest moral standards isn't necessarily one of them. As the Washington Post's Michael Gerson put it a while back, \"The level of cynicism here is startling. Some Christian leaders are surrendering the idea that character matters in public life in direct exchange for political benefits to Christians themselves. It is a political maneuver indistinguishable from those performed by business or union lobbyists every day. Only seedier. You scratch my back, I'll wink at dehumanization and Stormy Daniels. The gag reflex is entirely gone.\"\n\nFollowing his \"mulligan\" comments, Perkins was rather explicit in endorsing the virtues of the religious right's dubious deal. \"This isn't blind allegiance [to the president] on the part of evangelicals,\" Perkins said. \"This is reasoned support for a political leader who has made and kept his campaign promises.\"\n\nBut as we talked about at the time, that only reinforces the underlying point. Moral assessments, in this case, are conditional. So long as politically conservative evangelicals are satisfied with Trump's politics, his allied Christians are prepared to turn a blind eye to Trump's morals. His failings are, in a purely practical sense, less relevant than the religious right's broader wish-list.\n\nWhat's less clear is whether evangelical Christianity in the United States will ever be the same.\n\nMichael Steele, the former Republican National Committee chairman, shared his personal message to the religious right on MSNBC's \"Hardball\" in January: \"Just shut the hell up and don't ever preach to me about anything ever again. I don't want to hear it.... After telling me how to live my life, who to love, what to believe, what not to believe, what to do and what not to do and now you sit back and the prostitutes don't matter? The grabbing the you-know-what doesn't matter? The outright behavior and lies don't matter? Just shut up.\"",

                "body": "In January, Donald Trump surprised White House reporters by making unscheduled comments about a provocative subject: Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Russia scandal. More specifically, the president made a variety of assertions about how much he's looking forward to speaking to Mueller and his team under oath.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it, actually,\" Trump said, adding that he'd \"love to\" talk to the special counsel investigators. The president went on to say he's \"absolutely\" prepared to answer questions under oath, and he suggested the discussion would happen in roughly \"two or three weeks.\"\n\nThat, of course, didn't happen, and according to multiple accounts, Trump's lawyers are hesitant about the president answering the special counsel's questions. The Wall Street Journal reports today, however, that Trump's legal team have a possible \"deal\" in mind.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's lawyers are seeking to negotiate a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller that uses an interview with the president as leverage to spur a conclusion to the Russia investigation, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe president's legal team is considering telling Mr. Mueller that Mr. Trump would agree to a sit-down interview based on multiple considerations, including that the special counsel commit to a date for concluding at least the Trump-related portion of the investigation. One idea is to suggest a deadline of 60 days from the date of the interview, the person said.\n\nAnother consideration for the legal team is reaching an agreement with Mr. Mueller on the scope of his questioning of the president...\n\nYou've heard the expression about making someone an offer they can't refuse? If the WSJ's reporting is correct, this seems like an offer Robert Mueller can easily refuse.\n\nIndeed, if this is the kind of deal Trump's lawyers have in mind, it seems difficult to take seriously. If the president wants to cooperate with the special counsel's investigation, he should cooperate with the special counsel's investigation - not apply a series of conditions about the scope of questions he's prepared to answer.\n\nFor that matter, as Mueller's probe appears to be intensifying, the idea that Donald Trump's lawyers would make an effort to demand a timeline for an ongoing federal investigation - as if the president's attorneys can somehow force the probe's end through an arbitrary deadline - seems bizarre.\n\nIt seems hard to imagine the special counsel's office even considering such an arrangement. Indeed, these possible terms, if true, reek of desperation.",

                "body": "The news from the White House last night was, if nothing else, historic. North Korea's Kim Jong-un extended an invitation for face-to-face negotiations with Donald Trump and the American president has accepted the offer.\n\nIndeed, Trump's decision was apparently quite impulsive. The New York Times reported that events unfolded \"haphazardly,\" with the American president summoning South Korea's Chung Eui-yong for an unscheduled meeting. When Chung mentioned Kim Jong-un's desire to meet Trump, the president \"immediately said he would do it, and directed Mr. Chung to announce it to the White House press corps.\" This, despite Trump administration officials earlier this week dismissing North Korea's offer of direct talks \"in scathing terms.\"\n\nBut was the president's decision so impulsive that it was incorrect? Consider what White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters this afternoon:\n\n\"The president will not have the meeting without seeing concrete steps and concrete actions take place by North Korea.\"\n\nWell, compared to what we were told less than 24 hours ago, that's ... different.\n\nI realize that on Team Trump, it's not uncommon for officials, including the president, to announce a position, only to then announce an entirely different position a day later, but this is starting to look like a rather dramatic example of the phenomenon.\n\nSensitive diplomatic discussions with a rogue nuclear state are complicated, but the underlying question here is not: did Trump accept the invitation for talks with Kim Jong-un? Is the meeting be preconditioned on \"concrete steps and concrete actions\"? Maybe Sanders was referring to a halt in North Korea weapons testing in the lead up to the meeting?\n\nIn case the White House's posture weren't quite confusing enough, an administration official told the Wall Street Journal this afternoon, after Sanders' comments, \"The invitation has been extended and accepted, and that stands.\"\n\nAnd that suggests Trump will, in fact, have the meeting, despite the press secretary's assertion today that the president \"will not have the meeting without seeing concrete steps and concrete actions.\"\n\nLast night, the meeting was a done deal. Today, it's hard to know what to think, exactly. Those looking for evidence that Trump's fine-tuned machine knows exactly what it's doing should probably look elsewhere.\n\nPostscript: Sanders also said today that the Trump administration \"has made zero concessions.\" That's plainly untrue: the president agreed to meet in person with a nuclear-armed dictator, which is exactly what the dictator has long wanted, and which, practically by definition, is a major U.S. concession.",

We know the adult-film star, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges she had a sexual relationship with Donald Trump during his third and current marriage. We know Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, created an LLC to pay Daniels $130,000 shortly before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWe know Daniels is bound by a non-disclosure agreement, which she's suing to break. And we know the president's lawyer is still trying to silence the porn star, recently obtaining a secret restraining order in a private arbitration proceeding.\n\nBut as NBC News reports today, there are still questions that are slowly getting answers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's personal attorney used his Trump Organization email while arranging to transfer money into an account at a Manhattan bank before he wired $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence.\n\nThe lawyer, Michael Cohen, also regularly used the same email account during 2016 negotiations with the actress ... before she signed a nondisclosure agreement, a source familiar with the discussions told NBC News.\n\nAnd Clifford's attorney at the time addressed correspondence to Cohen in his capacity at the Trump Organization and as \"Special Counsel to Donald J. Trump,\" the source said.\n\nIt was previously reported that Cohen, while making the apparent hush-money payment, used First Republican Bank to wire the money shortly before the election. Now there's an email from that bank to Trump's attorney confirming the October 2016 transaction.\n\nWhy is this important? Keep a couple of things in mind.\n\nFirst, just last month, Cohen told the Wall Street Journal, \"Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly.\" He added at the time that he used his \"own personal funds to facilitate\" the $130,000 payment.\n\nThe point was obvious: Trump's lawyer hoped to put some distance between the apparent hush money and the president.\n\nBut as NBC News' report added today, the previously unseen email \"shows First Republic Bank and Cohen communicated about the money using his Trump company email address, not his personal gmail account.\"\n\nIt led Michael Avenatti, Daniels' current attorney, to tell NBC News, \"I think this document seriously calls into question the prior representation of Mr. Cohen and the White House relating to the source of the monies paid to Ms. Clifford in an effort to silence her.... We smell smoke.\"\n\nThis remains a thread worth pulling on. We still don't know, for example, where the $130,000 came from - and in the event it came from Cohen's own account, we also don't know who reimbursed him for the expense.\n\nIt'd also be helpful to know what Trump knew about the \"hush agreement\" at the time, though the White House has been \"suspiciously coy\" on this point.\n\nWe're also kicking around questions about whether the transaction is already the subject of some kind of investigation, which certainly seems like a possibility.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), meanwhile, lodged a civil and criminal complaint this week. The Associated Press reports that the non-profit group has asked the Justice Department and the Office of Government Ethics to investigate whether the Daniels payment \"violated federal law because Donald Trump did not list it on his financial disclosure forms.\"\n\nAccording to CREW, the $130,000 looks like a loan that needed to be disclosed.\n\nLook for Rachel to have more on this on tonight's show.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON, D.C. - FEBRUARY 9: (AFP-OUT) US President Donald Trump looks on during a meeting with Don Bouvet, who has been battling cancer in the Oval...\n\nThe Trump White House doesn't seem to appreciate it when political observers comment of the \"chaos\" at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The label, however, is tough to avoid.\n\nIt's not just the scandals. Or the resignations. Or the palace intrigue. Or even the in-fighting. Perhaps the most important part of the chaotic conditions in the White House is that the staff doesn't appear to know what it's doing.\n\nAnd I mean they literally don't know. After Donald Trump blurted out his plans for trade tariffs the other day, NBC News reported that the president blindsided his own team, announcing a new policy \"without any internal review by government lawyers or his own staff.\" What's more, \"No one at the State Department, the Treasury Department or the Defense Department had been told that a new policy was about to be announced or given an opportunity to weigh in in advance.\"\n\nThat was last week. This week wasn't any better. The Washington Post offered an interesting behind-the-scenes look at how the controversial tariff policy was unveiled.\n\n\"Looking forward to 3:30 P.M. meeting today at the White House,\" [the president] wrote at 7:38 a.m.... The response inside and outside the White House: What meeting?\n\nThere was no mention of the event on the president's schedule, and the major focus of the day was supposed to be a discussion of gun violence in video games. A number of aides thought tentative plans for a tariff announcement had been called off. Soon, there were rumors that the teased event would be canceled or delayed.\n\nLess than four hours later, the White House hosted South Korean officials, who told the press that Trump would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un - sometime fairly soon. Earlier in the day, State Department officials, who were apparently unaware of the developments, had downplayed the possibility of such talks, reinforcing the \"apparent lack of coordination\" between the West Wing and the president's diplomatic team.\n\nWe talk regularly about Team Trump's staffing crisis, but it's important to acknowledge the simple truth at the heart of the White House's problem: no one wants to work in an environment in which they have no idea what their colleagues and superiors may do next.\n\nAnd yet, this is a staple of Trump's presidency. His aides didn't know, for example, that he'd denounce a House Republican surveillance bill that the White House supported. (Trump apparently saw something that confused him on Fox News.)\n\nAs regular readers may recall, Trump's aides were also surprised to learn that he'd announced via Twitter that Christopher Wray was his choice to lead the FBI. They were equally startled to read Trump's tweets banning transgender Americans from military service.\n\nAs we discussed last summer, White House aides also didn't know in advance that Trump would falsely accuse Barack Obama via Twitter of tapping his phone. They also had no idea that the president would tweet news about John Kelly serving as chief of staff. Politico highlighted an instance from early last year in which Trump lashed out at China via Twitter \"while U.S. officials were meeting with a Chinese delegation at the State Department.\"\n\nMy personal favorite was this Associated Press report:\n\nAides to President Donald Trump were in deep talks about how to defuse tensions between Qatar and other Arab nations when the door to the secure room at the White House burst open.\n\nThe urgent message: Trump had just tweeted about Qatar.\n\nOne adviser read the tweet aloud and with that, the policymakers in midconference call had no other choice but to rework their plans to reflect the president's tweeted assertion that Qatar, host to some 11,000 U.S. troops, was funding terrorism.\n\nIt was an accusation against a close U.S. ally that had never been voiced so publicly and with such indelicacy.\n\nIt's easy to feel some sympathy for the U.S. officials who find themselves blindsided by an erratic president who's capable of waking up on any given day and declaring just about anything that pops into his mind. It's a dangerous dynamic that makes it exceedingly difficult for a variety of dedicated professionals to do their jobs.\n\nIt necessarily creates \"chaos.\"\n\nI imagine some of the president's supporters will see this and think, \"If members of Trump's team don't like it, they can always leave.\" And while there's some truth to that, let's not forget that much of the team is now doing exactly that.",

I want the facts... Before I make a statement, I need the facts.\" More recently, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Trump \"believes in making sure that information is accurate before pushing it out as fact.\"\n\nOops.\n\nAs for the road ahead, the Washington Post reported in December, \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is entertaining the idea of appointing a second special counsel to investigate a host of Republican concerns -- including alleged wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation and the controversial sale of a uranium company to Russia -- and has directed senior federal prosecutors to explore at least some of the matters and report back to him and his top deputy.\"\n\nWill the attorney general be able to resist the pressure and acknowledge reality now that the GOP's story has collapsed?",

My advice: take the chatter with a grain of salt. It sounds to me like an elaborate exercise in setting expectations, so that if Saccone wins by three points, in a race GOP officials hoped to win by 23 points, it'll look impressive.\n\n* What's weirder than the Republican National Committee paying rent in Trump Tower for Donald Trump's re-election campaign? The apparent fact that Trump's re-election campaign offices are largely empty.\n\n* Sen. Dean Heller (R), worried about his re-election prospects in November, said the other day that he thinks Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy will retire this summer. The Republican senator believes the news will excite his party's base and boost his candidacy.\n\n* And speaking of Nevada, Rep.

The billionaire replied that he and his political operation make political investments \"so there's less money in politics.\" This, too, seemed like a failure of self-awareness.\n\nAll of which brings us to Koch's new op-ed in the Washington Post, which denounces Donald Trump's new trade tariffs in a memorable way.\n\nTo include millions more of our people in true economic progress, our lawmakers must act on behalf of all Americans - not just the privileged few. If they do, I am confident we can regain our citizens' trust and ensure that America's best days are yet to come.\n\nIt's a bit jarring, isn't it? Charles Koch, an influential billionaire and one of the most powerful mega-donors in politics, wants elected officials to focus less on \"the privileged few.\"\n\nIt's a nice sentiment, to be sure, though as a HuffPost piece added, \"Everyday Americans forking over unearned millions - to make up for slashing the corporate rate and estate taxes for the wealthy - could be a description of what just happened in the new tax law, which was vigorously supported by Koch.\"",

Indeed, the bipartisan leadership of the House Oversight Committee requested information from Team Trump about Porter, including the details of when the White House learned from the FBI about the \"potential derogatory or disqualifying information\" found in Porter's background check.\n\nThe answers matter: Porter, who faced accusations from his ex-wives of domestic abuse, had routine access to highly classified materials. It raises the possibility of Donald Trump and his team mishandling sensitive secrets, sharing them with a vulnerable official who lacked the proper clearance.\n\nTPM reported yesterday that the White House is \"refusing to comply\" with the lawmakers' request.\n\nWhite House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short sent a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-MD) politely neglecting to cooperate with their demands for information on how and why Porter was allowed to continue to work as White House staff secretary, a senior position, for months after the FBI had informed senior White House staff of allegations of spousal abuse. The letter was obtained by TPM Thursday evening, shortly after the committee received it.\n\n\"Consistent with your letters' requests, we would be pleased to update you and others on the progress of the working group at the appropriate time,\" Short writes to Gowdy at the end of the letter after detailing what the White House is doing differently now on security clearance procedures, a courteous way of ignoring Gowdy's specific requests on what the White House's procedures were at the time and who knew what when about Porter.\n\nTPM's report added that Short, instead of responding to the committee's requests for information, \"reiterated what the White House has already publicly said about the new procedures, while ignoring Gowdy's questions.\"\n\nAdding insult to injury, the Oversight Committee originally gave the White House a deadline of last week. Trump's director of legislative affairs delivered his unsatisfying response a week late.\n\nThe answer is what lawmakers intend to do about it.\n\nI heard this morning from Elijah Cummings' office, and the Oversight Committee's ranking member has already written to Gowdy, explaining the need for a subpoena.\n\n\"Last night, we received a completely inadequate response from the White House regarding our Committee's request for information about security clearances,\" Cummings wrote. \"There is an obvious pattern here. Unfortunately, by repeatedly backing down, the Committee has now enabled and emboldened the White House to openly defy congressional oversight. In my opinion, the Trump White House - more than any other in recent memory - needs more congressional oversight, not less. The response last night from the White House is an affront to our responsibilities under the Constitution, and it degrades the integrity of our committee.\"\n\nThe ball is now in Gowdy's court.

Before I make a statement, I need the facts.\" More recently, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Trump \"believes in making sure that information is accurate before pushing it out as fact.\"\n\nOops.\n\nAs for the road ahead, the Washington Post reported in December, \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is entertaining the idea of appointing a second special counsel to investigate a host of Republican concerns -- including alleged wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation and the controversial sale of a uranium company to Russia -- and has directed senior federal prosecutors to explore at least some of the matters and report back to him and his top deputy.\"\n\nWill the attorney general be able to resist the pressure and acknowledge reality now that the GOP's story has collapsed?",

                "body": "Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is one of his party's most effective critics of Donald Trump. What the Arizona Republican has not done, however, is match his rhetoric with action.\n\nI made the case in January that I actually like Flake's speeches, op-eds, and books criticizing the president. I also recognize that it takes some political courage to speak out the way he has. But I keep waiting for the Arizona senator to actually do something - to follow up his welcome words with deeds - instead of preparing the next speech, op-ed, and book.\n\nWith this in mind, it's only fair that I give credit where credit is due: TPM noted that Flake is prepared to use his power to push new legislation to check the White House.\n\nIn response [to Trump's new trade tariffs], Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said Thursday that he will soon draft a bill to block the tariffs from taking effect, calling Trump's move \"a marriage of two lethal poisons to economic growth - protectionism and uncertainty.\"\n\n\"Trade wars are not won, they are only lost,\" he said in a statement. \"Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster. I will immediately draft and introduce legislation to nullify these tariffs, and I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.\"\n\nNow, it's probably worth having a conversation about the fact that Republicans were willing to put up with a whole lot of offensive presidential conduct before this week, and only agreed to take some meaningful legislative action once it was an economic issue on the line. For now, however, let's put that aside.\n\nLet's instead note that many GOP lawmakers, including close allies of the president, are at least sending the right signals about checking Trump's latest moves. \"I don't think Republicans will put up with this, and I personally believe that we may be able to stop it in the Congress,\" Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah said yesterday.\n\nThis is, of course, an important and realistic option. As we discussed the other day, the Constitution may empower Congress to \"regulate commerce with foreign nations,\" but the White House has gradually expanded its power in this area, especially when it comes to tariffs (though the last time Congress changed the law, the idea was to empower the executive branch to eliminate tariffs, not create new ones).\n\nWith this in mind, it would take a new law to block Trump's proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum - such as something alone the lines of Jeff Flake's idea. Alternatively, as the Washington Post noted, GOP leaders \"could try to halt the tariffs by inserting something into a must-sign piece of legislation, such as the government-funding bill that is due later this month.\"\n\nThe question is one of intestinal fortitude. Republicans haven't been shy about criticizing the new tariffs, but it'd be fairly bold for a GOP-led Congress to approve legislation blocking a policy adopted by a GOP-led White House.\n\nSlate's Jim Newell made a compelling case that we should lower our expectations: \"If Flake is leading the charge, that means the congressional Republicans who matter, and who care about maintaining a good relationship with the president, are too scared. Not too scared to criticize the decision -- most of the top Republican players in Congress have voiced their opposition -- but too scared to use powers granted to them by Article I to reverse it.\"\n\nWatch this space.",

                "body": "On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence issued a public, written statement about the White House's posture toward North Korea. By all appearances, it was intended to be unambiguous.\n\n\"Whichever direction talks with North Korea go, we will be firm in our resolve. The United States and our allies remain committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program. All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization.\"\n\nGot it. The administration's position \"will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization.\" Literally two days later, Donald Trump changed the administration's posture, agreeing to meet directly with Kim Jong-un - without credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization.\n\nI suspect Pence thought he was telling the truth about U.S. foreign policy when he issued the statement earlier this week. The vice president simply didn't know that his boss would soon decide to do the exact opposite.\n\nAnd while that's likely the source of some embarrassment for the Indiana Republican, there's a larger context to this: Trump keeps doing this.\n\nIt was just last week, for example, when the president hosted a White House discussion with senators on gun policy, and Pence talked about providing law-enforcement officials with \"additional tools\" to deal with those who are reported to be a potential danger to themselves or others. The vice president emphasized \"allowing due process, so that no one's rights are trampled.\"\n\nTrump interjected, dismissing Pence's concerns, and complaining that the judicial \"takes so long.\" The president added, \"I like taking the guns early.... Take the guns first, go through due process second.\"\n\nIf Pence is getting tired of these public contradictions, it'd be hard to blame him. In fact, as regular readers may recall, the trouble started before they even took office. In the second presidential debate in 2016, ABC News' Martha Raddatz reminded Trump that his own running mate said, in the context of a discussion about U.S. policy in Syria, that \"provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength.\" In an unusual display, Trump denounced the position.\n\nIn fact, the then-Republican candidate said of Pence, \"He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.\"\n\nIt was the first hint that Trump didn't much care what his ostensible governing partner thinks. In August 2017, for example, Pence declared that when it comes to our country's policy toward Russia, the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress are \"speaking with a unified voice.\" Soon after, Trump himself denounced Congress' sanctions against Russia, effectively siding with Putin's government.\n\nDuring the fight over health care, Pence encouraged Senate Republicans to pass one kind of bill, while Trump recommended another. Even on the Russia scandal, Pence said Trump didn't fire former FBI Director James Comey over the investigation, only to watch Trump say the opposite soon after.\n\nI'm not talking about private deliberations, in which there's back and forth between a president and top members his team. I'm referring to public disagreements, in which the vice president, under the impression that he's articulating the administration's position, says one thing, only to have the president say something altogether different soon after.\n\nI joked last week that the next time the vice president makes a declaration, give it a little time. His boss may have some thoughts to share on the matter. Little did I know Pence and Trump would bolster the point so quickly.",

It's a little late for that.\n\nA trade pact originally conceived by the United States to counter China's growing economic might in Asia now has a new target: President Trump's embrace of protectionism.\n\nA group of 11 nations - including major United States allies like Japan, Canada and Australia - signed a broad trade deal on Thursday in Chile's capital, Santiago, that challenges Mr. Trump's view of trade as a zero-sum game filled with winners and losers.\n\nCovering 500 million people on either side of the Pacific Ocean, the pact represents a new vision for global trade as the United States imposes steel and aluminum tariffs on even some of its closest friends.\n\nThe timing was quite striking. As Rachel noted at the top of last night's show, while our former partners finalized their new trade agreement - without many of the provisions U.S. negotiators fought successfully to include during the Obama era - Donald Trump, who rejected the TPP without ever making clear he knew what it was, announced new tariffs denounced by our allies.\n\nAnd as regular readers know, the practical effects are obvious: the United States is now more isolated. A Washington Post report in the fall noted that when Trump withdrew, it \"created a vacuum other nations are now moving to fill, with or without the president.\"\n\nAround the same time FiveThirtyEight piece, noting that the Republican's plans \"backfired,\" explained, \"Japan, the world's third-biggest economy, has assumed the leadership role. Canada, initially a reluctant member of the club, volunteered to host one of the first post-Trump meetings of the remaining TPP countries to work on a way forward - perhaps because research shows that Canadians will do better if they have preferential access that their American cousins lack. Smaller, poorer countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia wanted freer trade with the U.S. but agreed to consider improved access to countries such as Australia, Canada and Japan as a consolation prize for years of hard bargaining.\"\n\nThere's a lot of this going around. The New York Times added in January:\n\n[A]s the global economy gains strength, Europe and countries including Japan and China are forging ahead with deals that do not include the United States.\n\nThirty-five new bilateral and regional trade pacts are under consideration around the world, according to the World Trade Organization. The United States is party to just one of them, with the European Union, and that negotiation has gone dormant. The United States is also threatening to withdraw from one of its existing multilateral agreements -- the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada -- if it cannot be renegotiated in the United States' favor.\n\nPhil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and an economist in the George W. Bush administration, told the Times, \"Maybe there was some sort of presumption on the part of the president and his team that if the U.S. said stop, this process would come to a halt. What this shows is that's not true. The world just moves on without us.\"",

                "body": "It's been quite a journey for Donald Trump on North Korea. The American president announced in May that he'd be \"honored\" to talk to Kim Jong-un. Five months later, Trump insisted that his own chief diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was \"wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.\" Talking to North Korea, he added, wouldn't work.\n\nClose video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/8/18, 9:10 PM ET Trump meeting would end long precedent of North Korea as pariah Michael Beschloss, NBC News presidential historian, talks with Rachel Maddow about the historic nature of Donald Trump agreeing to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. And five months after that, the White House acknowledged that the North Korean dictator had invited the American president for direct negotiations - and that Donald Trump had accepted.\n\nOr put another way, Trump has agreed to give Kim Jong-un exactly what he wants. North Korean leaders have sought this kind of meeting for decades because it would necessarily elevate the rogue state: it would show the world that North Korea's leader can be treated as an equal by the Leader of the Free World. Previous American presidents - from both parties - have left open the possibility of such engagement, but only as a reward for meaningful and tangible results.\n\nTrump, however, tends to assume his modern predecessors were fools who lacked his awesomeness. Why would this president take the one step other presidents would not? The question practically answers itself: Trump agreed to the talks precisely because other presidents didn't. Politico had a good piece on this overnight, highlighting Trump's \"taboo-breaking instinct.\"\n\n[Last night's announcement] spotlighted an instinct that has defined Trump's early foreign policy: say the things others wouldn't say; do the things they didn't dare.\n\n\"He likes to be the first. He likes doing things no one has ever done before,\" one senior Trump official said.\n\nIt doesn't seem to occur to Trump to ask why others haven't taken such actions. Worse, the president apparently hasn't thought through the scope of the risk he's taking.\n\nRemember, Trump is still an amateur, with no clear foreign policy vision that couldn't fit on a bumper sticker, who has literally never been a direct participant in delicate diplomatic talks.\n\nIt's tempting to assume the president will be briefed extensively by his diplomatic team ahead of the talks, but (1) Trump he has an unfortunate habit of ignoring everything his staff tells him, and (2) what diplomatic team? This White House still doesn't have an ambassador to South Korea; the State Department didn't even know yesterday's news was coming; and Joseph Yun, the administration's experienced point man on North Korea, recently resigned after more than 30 years on the job.\n\nThis is not a recipe for success.\n\nYes, North Korea has reportedly opened the door to de-nuclearization, but the dictatorship has made similar overtures before without following through. Besides, from Kim Jong-un's perspective, the purpose of his nuclear program is working beautifully: it's not only prevented hostile actions from its enemies, it's also bringing the president of the United States directly to the negotiating table.\n\nTrump, in other words, has agreed to reward North Korea in exchange for a vague opportunity.\n\nThe Republican will enter the talks from a position of weakness - he's an unpopular, scandal-plagued president, far too eager for some kind of \"win\" to brag about - and as someone with a reputation for saying one thing at the negotiating table, only to do something else soon after.\n\nI'm not opposed to the idea of direct diplomacy with North Korea, but there's nothing to suggest Donald Trump has thought this through in any depth, and the consequences of failures are more than a little frightening.",

                "body": "As recently three years ago, automatic voter registration did not exist in any of the nation's states. As the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law noted yesterday, the policy will soon be the law in a fifth of the states.\n\nWashington is set to become the latest state to automatically register citizens to vote at state agencies. The State House and Senate agreed on language and passed the legislation today. [...]\n\nUnder the bill, Washingtonians who apply for or renew an enhanced driver's license at the Department of Licensing will automatically be registered to vote unless they decline. The bill also requires public assistance agencies to move toward automatic voter registration, and for the state's health benefit exchange to implement electronic voter registration.\n\nAccording to the Brennan Center, the bill in the state of Washington is now headed to Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who is expected to sign it into law.\n\nThe Evergreen State will then join Oregon, California, Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Georgia, West Virginia, and Vermont as states that have adopted AVR.\n\nDon't be surprised if Nevada is next: automatic voter registration will be on the statewide ballot, and most observers expect it to pass.\n\nAlso keep an eye on New Jersey, where the Democratic-led legislature already approved the policy once, though it was vetoed by then-Gov. Chris Christie (R). The Garden State's new governor, Phil Murphy (D), is on record supporting AVR, so it's probably only a matter of time.\n\nCircling back to our previous coverage, I've long believed this is a policy that's tough to argue against. When it comes to registering to vote in the United States, the burden has traditionally been on the individual: if you're eligible to vote, it's up to you to take the proactive steps needed to register.\n\nAutomatic voter registration, which already exists in many of the world's democracies, flips that model. The idea is exactly what it sounds like: under the policy, states automatically register eligible voters, shifting the burden away from the individual. Those who want to withdraw from the system can do so voluntarily without penalty, but otherwise, Americans would simply be added to the voters rolls as a matter of course.\n\nAt the federal level, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) has taken the lead on sponsoring a national AVR bill, and his proposal has 108 co-sponsors. At this point, however, literally all 108 are Democrats, and in a House led by a far-right Republican majority, the bill has no realistic chance of getting a vote, at least in this Congress.\n\nThat said, the scale of the Democratic support suggests the next time control of Capitol Hill changes hands, we may see some real movement on this.",

(Conway was cited earlier this week for improperly using her position for partisan political ends.)\n\n* Brad Parscale, Donald Trump's 2020 campaign manager, backed Robert Stovall's Republican congressional campaign in Texas's 21st district this week. Stovall, however, \"finished sixth in a crowded Republican primary.\"\n\n* I'm not sure this is legal, but Maryland's Democratic-led legislature is moving forward with a proposal to require presidential candidates to release their tax returns in order to be eligible for the state's ballot. The state Senate approved the plan yesterday on a 28-to-17 vote.\n\n* A national Quinnipiac poll released yesterday showed Democrats with a 10-point advantage on the generic congressional ballot, 48% to 38%. That's slightly better than the Dems' nine-point advantage in a Quinnipiac poll from early February, but not as a high as the party's 15-point lead two weeks ago.\n\n* The latest Monmouth University poll, meanwhile, found Democrats ahead on the generic ballot by nine points, 50% to 41%.\n\n* In Georgia, Lucy McBath, a prominent activist calling for new gun restrictions, has launched a Democratic congressional campaign. McBath, who was running in a state legislative race, hopes to take on Rep. Karen Handel (R-Ga.), who won a competitive special election last year.\n\n* And confirming recent scuttlebutt, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) conceded the other day that the 2020 presidential race is \"on my radar screen.\" Some assumed Patrick was headed in the opposite direction when, in 2015, he joined Bain Capital - a firm whose name may sound familiar.",

In the two years leading up to Donald Trump's political career, just 4% of Trump's real-estate buyers used LLCs that obscured the buyers' identities. As USA Today reported this morning, after the Republican entered the political arena, that total jumped to 70%.\n\nThat includes more than $35 million in real-estate transactions in just the first year of the president's first term.\n\nPresident Trump's companies sold more than $35 million in real estate in 2017, mostly to secretive shell companies that obscure buyers' identities, continuing a dramatic shift in his customers' behavior that began during the election, a USA TODAY review found.\n\nIn Las Vegas alone, Trump sold 41 luxury condo units in 2017, a majority of which used limited liability companies - corporate entities that allow people to purchase property without revealing all of the owners' names.\n\nThe trend toward Trump's real estate buyers obscuring their identities began around the time he won the Republican nomination, midway through 2016, according to USA TODAY's analysis of every domestic real estate sale by one of his companies.\n\nJust so we're clear, because Trump refused to divest from his private-sector holdings, the president still owns and profits from these business transactions. When a shell company buys a condo, for example, from a Trump enterprise, the profit ends up in the president's pocket.\n\nAnd in case this isn't obvious, the secretive nature of the transactions at least opens the door to possible corruption on a major scale.\n\nWe don't know, for example, whether foreign officials are creating shell companies to buy Trump business' real estate, establishing a method of putting money in the American president's bank account. We also don't know if there are domestic companies seeking favor from the White House doing the same thing.\n\nUSA Today's report added that attorney Bobby Burchfield, whom Trump hired as an independent ethics advisor to review new deals, says the president's business has a system in place to prevent problematic transactions.\n\n[Burchfield] says a four-part test is used when evaluating deals: is it at fair market value or in the ordinary course of business; is it an appropriate counterparty; is there any indication the deal is intended to curry favor with the president and is there any likelihood the deal could compromise or diminish the Office of the President.\n\n\"If someone wants to do business with the Trump entities in the form of an LLC, we look behind the LLC to see who the owner of it is and where the funding is coming from,\" Burchfield told USA TODAY. \"If we can't determine that, we won't sign off on it.\"\n\nBut those deep-dive identifications and financial disclosures are difficult and easily spoofed, said Ross Delston, a Washington DC attorney specializing in anti-money laundering compliance, who said Burchfield's test is largely subjective.\n\n\"From what we know of the Trump Organization's past real estate deals is they never see deals they don't like,\" Delston said. \"Having an ethics advisor shut down a deal based on a test not mandated by law strikes me as somewhere between unlikely to unthinkable.\"\n\nAsked if he rejected any Trump real estate deals last year, for example, Burchfield wouldn't say.",

Eric Swalwell talks with Ari Melber about the Republican effort to end the House Intelligence Committee's Trump Russia investigation without trying in good faith to fulfill its mission. On Tuesday night, the New York Times published online an important story about Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, who is now a witness cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's prove of the Russia scandal. The article, which appeared on the Times' front page yesterday, was a doozy.\n\nNot only is Mueller apparently \"examining the influence of foreign money\" in the 2016 campaign, but Nader also helped arrange the controversial January 2017 meeting in the Seychelles - a meeting that featured a prominent Trump supporter and a Russian official close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nYesterday, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) reportedly told a CBS News reporter, \"I don't have any clue who George Nader is.\"\n\nAt face value, that may not seem especially notable, except Mike Conaway is a member of the House Intelligence Committee - and he's ostensibly helping lead the investigation into the Trump-Russia scandal. Even if he'd missed the front-page scoop in the New York Times, it stands to reason he'd know who George Nader is, simply by virtue of his own familiarity with the details of his own probe.\n\nNew York's Jon Chait had the appropriate reaction.\n\nIf you're getting the idea that maybe Conaway and his party aren't utterly determined to uncover foul play between Moscow and Trump Tower, your suspicions are warranted. Conaway recently declared the investigation to be nearing its completion. \"All investigations have a natural conclusion,\" he explained. \"As soon as we have everybody interviewed, we'll start working on the report, we'll get the report finalized, and we'll move forward. Every investigation ought to have a conclusion, including this one. So we're coming towards the end of it.\"\n\nInvestigations, you see, have a \"natural\" conclusion. It is out of his hands. And so while Conaway's committee has not forced the witnesses to answer questions Democrats believe they should answer, or even learned the names of major figures in the underlying investigation, there's no arguing with nature. Anyway, it's not like they're investigating something like Benghazi, which took place in 2012 and was still being investigated four years later in a fruitless attempt to establish that the Obama administration deliberately lied.\n\nIn theory, given the seriousness of Russia's attack on American elections, one would like to think the House Intelligence Committee would scrutinize the matter until it had all the facts.\n\nAnd yet, here we are. CNN reported this morning, \"Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is scheduled to be interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, and he could be one of the last major witnesses to appear as part of the panel's Russia investigation.\"\n\nThe Washington Post, meanwhile, added this week that the GOP-led House panel is preparing to move past the witnesses who've refused to answer questions, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, with the hopes of unveiling a final report \"in the coming weeks,\" despite the list of witnesses Democrats still want to call.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that once the House Republicans' report is ready, it'll be about as credible as the already discredited \"Nunes memo,\" as prepared by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and his aides.",

Our relationship with China has been a very good one, and we look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with. We must act soon!\"\n\nPutting aside some grammatical concerns, this was a puzzling missive. The U.S. trade deficit with China last year was a little over $375 billion. We can certainly have a conversation about whether that's good or bad, but for Trump to ask Beijing to \"develop a plan\" to shrink that deficit by $1 billion is practically silly - because even if China had an incentive to help the White House on this, what difference would it make to reduce the shortfall by a fraction of a percentage point?\n\nIndeed, after Trump's strange tweet, it was only natural to wonder just how confused the president really is. Did the administration actually submit such a request? Was the $1 billion figure the result of some kind of negotiation? Was Trump just publishing random thoughts unrelated to any real policies?\n\nThis morning, the answers came into focus. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration really did submit a request for ideas from China on how best to reduce the trade deficit, but the goal is a $100 billion reduction.\n\nTrump, in other words, was \"off by $99 billion.\"\n\nIn the early months of his presidency, Trump repeatedly embarrassed himself with China, to the point that the American president became the subject of mockery in China's state-run media. One headline in April read, \"Trump slaps self in face, again.\"\n\nIf Trump believes he's improved his reputation in Beijing since these incidents, I have a hunch he's going to be disappointed.",

The basis for the case is pretty straightforward: Daniels wants to talk about the alleged affair and is trying to break the \"hush agreement\" that seems to require her silence.\n\nWhat we didn't know until late yesterday was that Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney who facilitated the pre-election porn-star payment, has also taken some fresh legal steps of his own.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's lawyer is trying to silence adult-film star Stormy Daniels, obtaining a secret restraining order in a private arbitration proceeding and warning that she will face penalties if she publicly discusses a relationship with the president, NBC News has learned.\n\nAs NBC News' report explained, Cohen obtained a temporary restraining order against Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, from a private arbitrator. The order \"bars her from disclosing 'confidential information' related to the nondisclosure agreement signed in October 2016, just two weeks before Election Day.\n\nWhy Cohen didn't go to a court, with public proceedings, is unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, for the first time, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday addressed the scandal, insisting that Trump denies the adulterous relationship, and adding, \"I've had conversations with the president about this, and as I outlined earlier, that this case has already been won in arbitration.\"\n\nIt's not altogether clear what case the president's spokesperson was referring to - getting a temporary restraining order isn't the same thing as \"winning\" a case - and Daniels' attorney suggested Sanders' claim is false.\n\nWhat's more, the White House press secretary was less than categorical in response to questions about whether Trump knew about the apparent hush money, with the Washington Post characterizing Sanders' posture as \"suspiciously coy.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans, meanwhile, appear desperate to avoid talking about the controversy, though Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who has an awkward past on matters related to infidelity, conceded that the Daniels matter is \"a big deal.\"\n\nThe South Carolina Republican added, \"If the shoe were on the other foot and there was a Democratic presidential candidate who had done the same, Republicans would probably be holding hearings right now.\"\n\nWould anyone seriously disagree with this? If, one year into Barack Obama's presidency, there was credible evidence his lawyer paid $130,000 in hush money to a porn star, possibly in violation of federal election laws, is there any doubt that congressional Republicans would be demanding answers about the transaction?",

                "body": "The first report about Trump World seeking backchannel communications with Russia came nearly a year ago. The Washington Post reported last May that Jared Kushner, Michael Flynn, and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak had a private meeting in early December - during the Trump presidential transition process - at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nAt the meeting, Kushner reportedly \"discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump's transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring.\" (That didn't work: Kislyak shared Kushner's offer with his superiors in Russia, and those communications were intercepted by U.S. intelligence officials.)\n\nClose video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/7/18, 9:23 PM ET Pursuit of Kremlin link by Trump backer eyed by Mueller: WaPo Sari Horwitz, national reporter for The Washington Post, talks with Ari Melber about Trump backer Eric Prince trying to set up a back channel of communication with the Kremlin at a secret Seychelles meeting with a Russian official close to Vladimir Putin, And now we're learning about another related effort. The Washington Post moved the ball forward overnight with this report:\n\nSpecial counsel Robert S. Mueller III has gathered evidence that a secret meeting in Seychelles just before the inauguration of Donald Trump was an effort to establish a back channel between the incoming administration and the Kremlin - apparently contradicting statements made to lawmakers by one of its participants, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn January 2017, Erik Prince, the founder of the private security company Blackwater, met with a Russian official close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and later described the meeting to congressional investigators as a chance encounter that was not a planned discussion of U.S.-Russia relations.\n\nA witness cooperating with Mueller has told investigators the meeting was set up in advance so that a representative of the Trump transition could meet with an emissary from Moscow to discuss future relations between the countries, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n\nIf you saw Rachel's segment on Tuesday, or Ari's report last night, you know the cooperating witness is Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, who's proving to be a key player in this story. It was Nader who not only attended the pre-inaugural Seychelles meeting, he also helped organize it.\n\nAnd to fully appreciate Nader's significance, note that he's now a cooperating witness for the special counsel's office, and someone who's delivered grand jury testimony.\n\nAs for the Post's latest report, it points to potential trouble for Erik Prince, a major Trump donor and the founder of the controversial Blackwater security firm, who told congressional investigators the Seychelles meeting had nothing to do with the Trump transition team. There's now reason to believe otherwise.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's this: \"While Mueller is probing the circumstances of the Seychelles meeting, he is also more broadly examining apparent efforts by the Trump transition team to create a back channel for secret talks between the new administration and the Kremlin.\"\n\nIt's difficult to think of a benign explanation for Team Trump seeking private, pre-inaugural chats with Russian officials through unofficial channels.\n\nCircling back to a point we discussed last year, I imagine some of the White House's allies will again make the case that backchannel communications between the United States and other countries - friend and foe alike - have been common for many years, so there's no reason to be alarmed by these reports. That defense doesn't make sense in this case: backchannel communications are supposed to involve using diplomatic intermediaries to pursue U.S. foreign policy, not a presidential transition team seeking secret discussions away from U.S. detection.\n\nTo date, no one has been able to explain, even on a theoretical level, why Team Trump would seek a secret communications avenue with Moscow that relevant U.S. agencies couldn't monitor.",

                "title": "Trump ignores legal advice, talks with witnesses about Russia case",
                "body": "About a week ago, Politico reported that Donald Trump's lawyers have given him good advice about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Russia scandal: the president should not discuss details of the probe \"with anyone outside his legal team.\"\n\nClose video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/7/18, 9:00 PM ET Trump wanted WH counsel McGahn to deny Mueller firing story: NYT Ari Melber talks with Michael Schmidt, reporter for The New York Times, about new reporting that The same piece added, however, that when it comes to this scandal, Trump \"often fails to observe boundaries.\" It's a point driven home by the latest reporting from the New York Times.\n\nThe special counsel in the Russia investigation has learned of two conversations in recent months in which President Trump asked key witnesses about matters they discussed with investigators, according to three people familiar with the encounters. [...]\n\nThe episodes demonstrate that even as the special counsel investigation appears to be intensifying, the president has ignored his lawyers' advice to avoid doing anything publicly or privately that could create the appearance of interfering with it.\n\nOn the show last night, MSNBC's Ari Melber did a nice job summarizing some of the possible reasons the president would do this. It's possible, for example, that Trump simply doesn't care about his own lawyer's advice. Maybe he doesn't fully appreciate the possible risks. Perhaps the president recognizes the risk, but he believes it's a gamble worth making.\n\nOr maybe Trump, lacking in impulse control, just can't help himself.\n\nThe article added that the president's conversations with witnesses, according to legal experts, probably doesn't \"rise to the level of witness tampering\" - in other words, Trump's actions probably weren't illegal, unless there was evidence he encouraged a witness to lie - but it doesn't make these chats any less dumb.\n\nComplicating matters is the other part of the Times' reporting.\n\nThe newspaper reported in January that the president ordered Mueller's ouster, before backing off when White House Counsel Don McGahn threatened to resign rather than carry out the order. This has also reportedly drawn scrutiny from the special counsel's team, seeing this as relevant to the question of possible obstruction of justice.\n\nAccording to the latest reporting, Trump responded to the January article by telling an aide that McGahn should issue a statement denying its accuracy. The piece published overnight added, \"Mr. McGahn never released a statement and later had to remind the president that he had indeed asked Mr. McGahn to see that Mr. Mueller was dismissed.\"\n\nIf accurate, it's the sort of detail that could be quite important: did Trump push a bogus claim about his own actions, and then ask the White House counsel to join him in advancing this false narrative?\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the fact that all of this is appearing in the New York Times, while the scandal is intensifying, raising the prospect of someone close to Don McGahn - perhaps even the White House counsel himself - wants the public to be aware of these behind-the-scenes machinations, all of which paints the president in a less-than-flattering light.\n\nFor that matter, there's the question Ari also posed on last night's show: if this is what McGahn (or people sympathetic to him) is signaling to the public, what do you suppose the White House counsel is telling the special counsel investigators in private?",

                "body": "Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/6/18, 9:36 PM ET Untethered Trump fails to process advice on tariff policy MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle talks with Rachel Maddow about the dynamics within the White House that led to the departure of Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn. Much of Donald Trump's economic team told him tariffs on steel and aluminum would undermine the economy. The president's national security team told him the tariffs would run counter to our national security interests. His diplomatic team concluded the policy would be bad for U.S. foreign policy.\n\nAnd yet, Trump nevertheless concluded that these tariffs are a great idea. The process behind his announcement was a mess, even by this White House's standards: Trump made this decision without any internal review by government lawyers or his own staff. NBC News reported, \"No one at the State Department, the Treasury Department or the Defense Department had been told that a new policy was about to be announced or given an opportunity to weigh in in advance.\"\n\nEven Trump's allies in Congress weren't told anything about the policy before it was announced.\n\nWhat's more, as Rachel noted on the show last night, Trump himself seemed to blurt out the specific size of the tariffs to reporters, almost as an afterthought, reinforcing the impression that the president and his team have just been winging it on an important economic policy.\n\nThe Washington Post's Greg Sargent added yesterday that the stated legal justification for the tariffs \"is deeply dubious, and the substantive case for it that Trump himself has offered is based on absurdities.\"\n\nAll of which leads to an awkward fact about contemporary American governance: there's no reason to assume the president has any idea what his policy is, what it means, how and why it'll be implemented, or what it will do once the policy is in place.\n\nThe president is working from the assumption that a trade deficit - any trade deficit - is necessarily a problem that requires an immediate solution. That's plainly false. He insists trade deficits are proof of the United States \"losing\" money, which is both wrong and nonsensical. He believes trade wars are \"easy to win,\" which is dangerously misguided.\n\nMost of the things he says about the issue - from the size of the U.S. trade deficit with China to our surplus with Canada - are factually incorrect.\n\nIn fact, it'd be a mistake to assume Trump's \"fix\" will address Trump's perceived \"problem.\" Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and a co-author of a 2017 book of policy recommendations on how to reduce trade imbalances., told the New York Times the other day, \"If you look across countries, there's no evidence that high tariffs reduce your trade deficit.\" And even if we did dramatically reduce trade deficits, we may not the consequences.\n\nAdopting an exceedingly charitable tone, Zeeshan Aleem said the other day, \"The president doesn't seem to have a full grasp of what's going on here.\"\n\nIt's one thing to consider a White House plan on the merits and conclude that it's the wrong way to go. On tariffs, we're having a different kind of conversation: Trump, after making this issue one of the centerpieces of his campaign, is moving forward with a risky plan he doesn't understand, about an issue on which he doesn't recognize the scope of his own confusion.\n\n\"There's no coherent goal at all in Trump's approach on trade,\" Matt Yglesias explained yesterday, adding that the White House's \"chosen policy instrument bears no relationship to any larger objectives.\"\n\nUnlike most areas of public policy, Trump is able to move forward on issues like these entirely on his own. The decision-making authority rests entirely in the hands of one individual - the president - who in this case, is indifferent to the concerns raised by many of his own aides and allies.\n\nWhat we're left with is an amateur president making unilateral policymaking decisions about an issue he thinks he understands, but doesn't. Worse, Trump seems wholly uninterested in getting up to speed on trade policy - why interfere with \"executive time\"? - either because he doesn't understand the information available to him or because he's too lazy to care.\n\nThis isn't what governing in a modern superpower is supposed to look like.",

                "body": "At yesterday's White House press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, a reporter asked Donald Trump about Russian efforts to influence American elections. His response rambled a bit and mainly focused on his belief that Republicans will do well in the 2018 midterms. Trump acted as if he didn't understand the question.\n\nAnd so, the reporter again asked whether the American president is \"worried about Russia trying to meddle\" in this year's elections. Trump replied:\n\n\"No, because we'll counteract whatever they do. We'll counteract it very strongly. And we are having strong backup systems. And we've been working, actually - we haven't been given credit for this, but we've actually been working very hard on the '18 election and the '20 election coming up.\"\n\nNote, in Trump's mind, it's important to always stress that he and his team be given \"credit\" for their efforts - because in this White House, effective public service is not its own reward.\n\nBut even putting that aside, the problem, whether the president understands this or not, is that he and his team haven't been \"working very hard\" on this at all. In fact, by all appearances, the exact opposite is true.\n\nIt was just last week when Adm. Michael Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, conceded to lawmakers that U.S. officials are \"probably not doing enough\" on this issue, adding that the president still hasn't authorized his office to disrupt Russian cyberattacks\n\nMaking matters worse, we learned soon after that the Trump administration's Global Engagement Center has been allocated $120 million to counter foreign efforts to meddle in elections - and it hasn't yet spent a dime.\n\nThe Washington Post also reported, \"During his first year as president, Trump held no Cabinet or high-level National Security Council meetings about combating Russian interference. He and his administration have sought to roll back or simply have not enforced measures to hold Moscow accountable, such as sanctions passed overwhelmingly by Congress.\"\n\nIt's not exactly a mystery how Russian officials are likely to respond to these circumstances. They attacked the United States in 2016, successfully ended up with the results Putin's government wanted, have faced limited repercussions, and will face limited resistance if they launch another intelligence operation against us this year.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies are currently ringing the alarm, making clear they expect an escalation in efforts from Moscow. The NSA's Rogers told Congress last week that Putin \"has clearly come to the conclusion that 'there's little price to pay here and therefore I can continue this activity.'\"\n\nIt's against this backdrop that Trump is not only doing very little, he also expects \"credit\" for his passivity against a foreign threat.",

                "title": "Republicans can't let go of their dubious Carter Page claims",
                "body": "The principal point of the Republicans' recent \"Nunes memo\" was to prove that federal law enforcement officials had been unfair toward Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. That GOP effort failed spectacularly, and the memo was quickly discredited.\n\nBut Republicans apparently can't yet let go of the idea that the Justice Department violated Page's rights - to the point that a special counsel is now needed to investigate the FBI. Politico reported yesterday:\n\nTwo powerful House Republicans are pressuring Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a prosecutor to investigate the FBI's 2016 decision to spy on Carter Page, a former campaign aide to President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy sent a letter Tuesday to Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, urging them to name a special counsel to review Republicans' allegations that the FBI misled a federal judge to obtain a warrant to conduct surveillance of Page, whose contacts with Kremlin-connected Russians had drawn agents' scrutiny.\n\nThe likely underlying point of this isn't exactly subtle. For Republicans, the investigation into the Russia scandal poses an enormous threat to their party's president, so it's become politically necessary to call for an investigation into the investigators. If there's a special counsel probing the real scandal for the Justice Department, some GOP lawmakers evidently believe there should be another special counsel probing the Justice Department itself.\n\nCommon sense suggests the request is better left ignored. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, explained in a statement yesterday, \"The federal regulation on Special Counsels is clear - the Department of Justice must determine that a 'criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted.' In this case, it is difficult to see what crime the Republicans are alleging.\"\n\nIt is, indeed. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes' (R-Calif.) memo was effectively supposed to serve as an indictment, documenting the Justice Department's wrongdoing, but since the document ultimately proved the opposite, the case for a new special counsel is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nBut perhaps more important is the larger context: Republicans have tied themselves to Carter Page in ways they may regret.\n\nWe are, after all, talking about a man who described himself in writing as an \"advisor to the staff of the Kremlin.\" Indeed, as we discussed in January, the same year in which Page talked up his Kremlin ties, he was also targeted by a Russian spy ring, drawing FBI scrutiny.\n\nSix months after the spy ring was broken up - resulting in multiple criminal convictions - Page joined the Trump campaign as a foreign policy adviser, despite having no apparent qualifications for the job. A few months into his tenure, Page, newly identified by Trump as someone who had the Republican candidate's ear on matters related to international affairs, traveled to Russia, met with prominent foreign officials, and denounced U.S. sanctions against the Putin government.\n\nIt was the sort of thing that was likely to capture the interest of U.S. counter-intelligence officials - and that's exactly what happened. In fact, Page was suspected as a possible agent of a foreign adversary.\n\nAfter Trump won the election, Page went back to Moscow for another visit, during which time he again met with leading Russian officials.\n\nRepublicans like Trey Gowdy, Bob Goodlatte, Devin Nunes, and others are deeply troubled that federal law enforcement in the United States was conducting court-approved surveillance of this guy. What's more, this isn't just some random aside - the GOP's assertions are the cornerstone of the entire pro-Trump effort to undermine the federal investigation into the Russia scandal.\n\nI'm not sure the right has fully thought this through.\n\nPostscript: Asked yesterday whether he'd heard from FBI or congressional investigators since the Nunes memo came out, Page told a Politico reporter he's the victim of \"egregious human rights violations,\" on par with the FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King. For the record, it's worth noting that Page has not been charged with any crimes.",

                "body": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) generally isn't seen as one of the year's vulnerable incumbents, but now that the general-election season has apparently begun in the Lone Star State - statewide primaries were yesterday - the Republican senator feels the need to go on the offensive against his Democratic rival.\n\nAs CNN noted, however, Cruz has picked a curious point to emphasize in his first attack ad.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz's first shot at his expected Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke? Mocking his name.\n\nAs Tuesday's primaries were closing, Cruz's campaign released a 60-second radio ad that was a country music jingle prodding O'Rourke for going by \"Beto\" rather than \"Robert.\"\n\n\"Liberal Robert wanted to fit in, so he changed his name to Beto and hid it with a grin,\" the song says.\n\nIt's true that Beto O'Rourke's given first name is Robert, but he prefers Beto. This shouldn't be especially noteworthy, since plenty of prominent political figures use nicknames. Mitt Romney's given first name isn't Mitt. Rick Perry's given first name isn't Rick. Newt Gingrich's given first name isn't Newt. No one really cares, since people should be called whatever they want to be called.\n\nThat's not the funny part. Rather, what makes this interesting - aside from the fact that a Texas Republican feels the need to go on the offensive against a Democrat in the first place - is that Ted Cruz's given first name isn't Ted.\n\nIn fact, the Texas senator's formal name is Rafael Edward Cruz. He prefers to go by Ted, which is obviously his choice.\n\nBut I suspect you see where I'm going with this. If you're a politician who uses a nickname instead your given name, maybe attacking an opponent for doing the exact same thing isn't such a good idea?\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo asked Cruz about this earlier, and the senator said part of the point was to show \"a sense of humor\" - because if there's one thing Ted Cruz is known for, it's his affinity for lighthearted fun?",

                "title": "McConnell faces new questions about his Russia attack response",
                "body": "Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff under Barack Obama, was asked about the Democratic administration's response to Russia's 2016 election attack and whether Obama and his team did enough. Not surprisingly, McDonough shifted the focus back to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) indifference at the time.\n\nThe comments led McConnell to face a new round of questions, which as the Washington Post reported yesterday, the Republican leader was quick to dismiss out of hand.\n\n\"This is the same old thing they've been saying for weeks,\" he told reporters at a weekly media availability. \"I've issued a statement on that a couple of weeks ago and I'd be happy to send it to you again.\"\n\nThere is no specific statement from a couple of weeks ago, according to McConnell's top spokesman, Don Stewart. Instead, his office provides responses whenever reporters inquire about accusations like McDonough's, he said.\n\nAsked whether he wished he'd handled the accusations about Russian interference differently ahead of the 2016 elections, McConnell said, \"No, I'm perfectly comfortable with the steps that were taken back then.\"\n\nI suspect the GOP leader really is \"perfectly comfortable\" with his actions - or lack thereof - but isn't that the problem?\n\nLet's back up for those who need a refresher. As regular readers know, the Obama White House, swayed by the evidence compiled by U.S. intelligence agencies, wanted bipartisan support to push back against Russian intrusion, and in mid-September 2016, the then-president dispatched counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco, then-FBI Director James Comey, and then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to brief top members of Congress.\n\nObama didn't want to be seen as using intelligence for partisan or electoral ends, so he sought a \"show of solidarity and bipartisan unity\" against foreign manipulation of our democracy.\n\nThat didn't happen - because McConnel refused. As the Washington Post previously reported, when national security officials told congressional leaders about Russia's interference, it was McConnell who not only didn't want to alert the public, he also questioned the validity of the intelligence.\n\nBrian Beutler put it this way: \"McConnell ran interference for Trump during the campaign to stop Obama from warning the country about things Trump was lying publicly about.\"\n\nBy way of a defense, McConnell's office points to the September 2016 letter, signed by congressional leaders from both parties, which was sent to the president of the National Association of State Election Directors. It warned state officials about possible hacking efforts. (This is what I suspect the senator was referring to yesterday.)\n\nBut this wasn't the statement American intelligence officials wanted McConnell to endorse, and the letter made no reference to Russia's attack, which McConnell was briefed on at the time.\n\nDenis McDonough told NBC News' Chuck Todd over the weekend that this statement was \"dramatically watered down\" at McConnell's insistence - and he has no idea why.\n\nThe Republican leader may now see the story as \"the same old thing,\" but there's no reason the matter should simply disappear because McConnell finds it annoying.",

                "title": "Trump relies on warm and fuzzy labels, including 'loving' tariffs",
                "body": "At a brief White House press conference yesterday, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven explained his belief that increased tariffs, such as the ones Donald Trump intends to impose, \"will hurt us all in the long run.\" Naturally, that left the American president in an awkward position, having to defend a controversial economic policy, opposed by U.S. allies, including the official standing a few feet to his right.\n\nAnd so, Trump did his best to present his policy as a gentle economic imposition.\n\n\"We're going to straighten it out. And we'll do it in a very loving way. It will be a loving, loving way. They'll like us better and they will respect us much more.\"\n\nI honestly don't know whether the American president was trying to be funny - with Trump, it's often hard to tell - but the fact that he used the word \"loving\" three times in reference to his tariff policy suggested he expected people to believe it.\n\nWhich isn't likely to happen. In practical terms, a trade tariff is a tax applied to imports or exports. Trump may want to implement the policy in \"a very loving way,\" but this isn't the sort of thing in which politeness or service with a smile makes a difference. Those paying the tax - and/or imposing their own retaliatory tariffs - won't much care if the American president is being friendly about the new economic burden.\n\nBut there's also a larger context to this: have you noticed how frequently Trump turns to warm and fuzzy rhetoric to defend the most controversial aspects of his agenda?\n\nDuring the health care fight, for example, Trump described the House Republicans' proposal - after GOP lawmakers had already voted for it - as \"mean\" and \"cold-hearted.\" The president said his preferred approach would have \"more heart.\"\n\nHe used similar language in January on immigration. The White House may have demanded a regressive plan that included a border wall and cuts to legal immigration, but Trump assured the public that his approach had \"a lot of heart.\"\n\nReality doesn't work this way. A far-right president can't impose a harsh, regressive agenda, frame it in soft lighting, and expect everyone to celebrate his magnanimity.\n\nSimply using words like \"heart\" and \"loving\" doesn't make bad ideas good, or harsh ideas gentle. Trump's preoccupation with branding is well known, but he should at least try to understand that slapping pleasant words on his proposals will not make them more popular.",

                "body": "Shortly after Donald Trump defended racist protesters in Charlottesville, Gary Cohn, the chairman of the White House National Economic Council and the president's top adviser on economic policy, made clear he wasn't pleased. Trump, who expects unflinching loyalty from those in his orbit, responded by refusing to make eye contact with Cohn for a while.\n\nIt led to an interview in early September in which Cohn was asked why he remained a part of Team Trump. The standard answer in any White House is for an official to say something like, \"I believe in this president and his vision, and it's an honor to be part of his team.\" Cohn, however, said, \"Look, tax cuts are really important to me.\"\n\nClose video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/6/18, 9:00 PM ET Trump, apparently winging it on tariff policy, loses Gary Cohn Rachel Maddow reports on the resignation of Gary Cohn, Donald Trump's top economic advisor, as Trump is in the midst of attempting to wing it through the implementation of complicated, consequential tariff policy. Six months later, the Republican tax plan is law, and the president no longer seems to care about Cohn's advice on economic policy. The next step was unavoidable.\n\nGary Cohn, President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, resigned Tuesday after a dispute with the president over tariffs.\n\nThe departure - following reports that Cohn, the National Economic Council director, had opposed Trump's plan for large tariffs on imported steel and aluminum - was the latest in a string of exits by top officials in the administration.\n\nNote, this is the second major departure from the White House National Economic Council in recent months, following Deputy Director Jeremy Katz's resignation in December. Under normal circumstances, we might expect to see an NEC deputy director stick around, waiting for the NEC director to step down, in the hopes of getting a promotion. On Team Trump, however, nearly everyone seems to run away.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.\n\nAt a brief press conference yesterday, the president insisted, \"You know, I read where, 'Oh, gee, maybe people don't want to work for Trump.' And believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office; they want a piece of the West Wing. And not only in terms of it looks great on their résumé; it's just a great place to work.\"\n\nThat might be easier to believe if Trump weren't in the midst of a months-long staffing exodus. Vox's Ezra Klein yesterday described it as a \"staffing crisis,\" which seems more than fair under the circumstances.\n\nAnd on that note, this seems like a good time to update the list of prominent Trump World departures:\n\nCabinet: HHS Secretary Tom Price\n\nWest Wing: Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Director of Public Liaison George Sifakis, Office of Public Liaison Communications Director Omarosa Manigault, Staff Secretary Rob Porter, Deputy Assistant to the President Sean Cairncross, Chief Usher Angella Reid, Assistant to the President Reed Cordish, Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Carroll (who's leaving his post to become the \"drug czar\")\n\nWhite House Communications: Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Assistant Press Secretary Michael Short, Communications Director #1 Mike Dubke, Communications Director #2 Anthony Scaramucci, Communications Director #3 Hope Hicks, Rapid Response Director Andy Hemming, Speechwriter David Sorensen, Senior Communications Official Josh Raffel\n\nNational Security team: National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Deputy National Security Advisor K.T.

                "body": "Donald Trump and his White House team have said effectively nothing about the Stormy Daniels controversy, though that may not be sustainable now that the porn star is suing the president.\n\nAdult film star Stormy Daniels sued Donald Trump Tuesday, alleging that he never signed the nondisclosure agreement that his lawyer had arranged with her.\n\nThe civil suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by NBC News, alleges that her agreement not to disclose her \"intimate\" relationship with Trump is not valid because while both Daniels and Trump's attorney Michael Cohen signed it, Trump never did.\n\nThe lawsuit tells a story that's consistent with the contours of the controversy as we know it: Trump and Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, allegedly began an intimate relationship in the summer of 2006, and their affair lasted \"well into\" 2007. When Daniels prepared to share the details of the alleged affair during Trump's presidential campaign, she accepted $130,000 as part of what the civil suit describes as a \"hush agreement.\"\n\nThe porn star's lawyers are now asking a California court to declare the deal \"invalid, unenforceable, and/or void under the doctrine of unconscionability.\"\n\nI'll leave it to legal experts to reflect on the strength of the case - NBC News' report goes into more detail - but at this point, the lawsuit's existence tells us something important: Stormy Daniels is eager to talk.\n\nThe scandal has unfolded gradually over the course of several weeks, but everything we know about the story has come from journalists who've done a lot of effective digging. Daniels, however, has largely honored the agreement that bought her silence. She did sit down for an interview with ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, but even then, Daniels was careful not to violate the terms of her deal.\n\nNow, however, Daniels wants to scrap the deal, and she's headed to court to help make that happen. And if she succeeds, it's likely the adult-film actress will have an even higher public profile, sharing details of her alleged previous relationship with Trump, which the president's spokespersons claim did not occur.\n\nMeanwhile, as we discussed yesterday, Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, seems to have implicated his client in the controversy, suggesting he was in communications with Trump about the pre-election porn-star payment and expected to be reimbursed the $130,000. When it comes to the question about the legality of the apparent hush-money, this matters a great deal.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the banks that facilitated the transaction, which have raised concerns about the payment. Indeed, the financial institutions' recent actions suggest the matter may already be under some kind of official scrutiny.\n\nThis president didn't need another scandal. Trump has one anyway.",

But the announcement in Little Rock demonstrated the polarizing politics that still swirl around the public insurance program for the poor in some conservative states.\"\n\n* DACA: \"A federal judge in Maryland on Monday struck down a challenge to President Donald Trump's decision to end protections for undocumented immigrants, stating that while he does not agree with Trump's move, it is not his job to set immigration policy.\"\n\n* What a wild story: \"Weeks of drama surrounding one of Trump's 12 luxury hotels culminated Monday morning when armed agents evicted the company's staff from the Trump Hotel in Panama City, Panama, according to the Associated Press.\"\n\n* EPA: \"The Environmental Protection Agency has dismissed a civil rights lawsuit filed by residents of a predominately African American city in Alabama who say a local landfill filled with four metric tons of coal ash has been making people sick.\"\n\n* Good decision: \"The Trump Organization says replicas of the presidential seal displayed at one of its golf clubs were given to the company by club members and have since been removed.\"\n\n* This is a problem: \"Congress requires many unpaid interns to sign nondisclosure agreements.\"\n\n* Zinke's latest move: \"A week before the Interior Department is set to auction off parcels of land in Montana for oil and gas leases, Secretary Ryan Zinke pulled a cluster of parcels from the auction on Monday evening.\"\n\n* An appropriate legacy: \"Last week, the creator of the charity, Philando Feeds the Children, delivered a $35,000 check to St. Paul Public Schools - enough to finish paying off the debt owed by every student enrolled in the National School Lunch Program at the district's 56 schools, including Mr. Castile's former campus.\"\n\n* I'm glad the photograph if Parker Curry, age 2, looking at Michelle Obama's portrait went viral. I'm also glad the former First Lady visited with Parker Curry in person.\n\nAnything to add? Consider this an open thread.",

                "body": "Less than a month after Donald Trump's inauguration, Kellyanne Conway appeared on national television and encouraged the public to buy Ivanka Trump's merchandise. At the time, the White House was pushing back against retailers who'd dropped the president's daughter's product line following poor sales.\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics wasn't pleased, warning the White House there was \"strong reason\" to believe the presidential aide misused her office and violated ethics rules.\n\nSeveral months later, in November, Conway returned to the airwaves and tried to use her position to support Roy Moore's Republican Senate candidacy. We now know this was problematic, too.\n\nKellyanne Conway, a top adviser to President Donald Trump, violated the federal law prohibiting some political activity by high-level officials, in two television interviews she gave, and has been recommended for disciplinary action, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said Tuesday.\n\nA report by that office on Conway's alleged Hatch Act violations said that in both cases, \"Conway appeared in her official capacity\" and in one case \"advocated against one Senate candidate and gave an implied endorsement of another candidate.\"\n\nThe report explained that the White House official engaged in \"prohibited political activity,\" and just to twist the knife, the report added that Conway ignored the rules after receiving \"significant training on Hatch Act prohibitions.\"\n\nThe matter has been referred to the president \"for appropriate disciplinary action,\" which will probably mean nothing will happen to her. That said, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, called for \"swift and serious disciplinary action against Ms. Conway,\" adding, \"Anything else sets a terrible example.\"\n\nLook, I know that the number of scandals surrounding Trump World is itself stunning, and that the Russia scandal alone - to my mind, one of the most dramatic controversies in American history - may yet bring Trump's presidency to a premature end. By comparison, Conway's transgressions no doubt seem trivial.\n\nBut when nearly every day brings news of another White House official with another legal and/or ethical mess, I think it's a mistake to treat routine wrongdoing as background noise.\n\nPostscript: Just so everyone's clear, today's report came by way of the Office of Special Counsel, which is not the same as the Special Counsel's office. This is confusing, of course, but the latter is Robert Mueller and his team, while the former is a Justice Department office that investigates Hatch Act violations and responds to complaints from whistleblowers.\n\nOr put another way, Mueller and his investigators had nothing to do with today's report.",

                "body": "Since Donald Trump put Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA, the agency has faced one controversy after another, but today's is just ... bizarre.\n\nLast year, Pruitt hired a Republican political consultant named John Konkus to serve as the EPA's deputy associate administrator for public affairs. It's not, however, just a public-relations job. The Washington Post reported in September that Konkus, despite his lack of environmental policy experience, is in charge of \"vetting the hundreds of millions of dollars in grants the EPA distributes annually.\"\n\nWe learned at the time that Konkus \"reviews every award the agency gives out, along with every grant solicitation before it is issued.\" As part of his reviews, he looks out for \"the double C-word\" - climate change - and according to the Post, he's repeatedly \"instructed grant officers to eliminate references to the subject in solicitations.\"\n\nIt's against this backdrop that the Associated Press reports that the EPA official is also moonlighting for unnamed private-sector clients.\n\nA key aide to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has been granted permission to make extra money moonlighting for private clients whose identities are being kept secret.\n\nA letter approving outside employment contracts for John Konkus - signed by an EPA ethics lawyer in August - was released Monday by Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe ethics official noted that Konkus' outside contracts presented a \"financial conflict of interest\" and barred him from participating in matters at EPA that would have a \"direct and predictable\" financial benefit for his clients.\n\nApparently, Konkus, a former Trump campaign aide who now receives a $145,000 annual salary at the EPA, received permission to work for at least two unnamed clients, with the expectation that this list will grow.\n\nWhat's more, according to the AP, he's not the only one.\n\nAlong with the information about Konkus' side jobs, the House Democrats also got a copy of letter approving similar outside employment for Patrick Davis, another Trump political appointee working as a senior adviser for public engagement in the EPA's regional office in Denver.\n\nLike Konkus, Davis is a Republican political consultant who led Trump's presidential campaign in Colorado. According to a 2015 report by ProPublica, Davis was accused two years earlier of defrauding a conservative super PAC called Vote2ReduceDebt, which was funded by an elderly oil tycoon. The group collapsed after Davis allegedly paid nearly $3 million of the PAC's funds to organizations run by him or his close associates, according to the news report. [...]\n\nAn EPA ethics lawyer in February 2017 approved of Davis receiving outside compensation for work as sales director for a company called Telephone Town Hall Meeting, which provides services such as robocalls to political campaigns and advocacy groups. The agency redacted how much Davis is to be paid for the agreement, but his outside compensation would also be capped at less than $28,000.\n\nI don't know how long it'll take to repair the Environmental Protection Agency, but I have a hunch it's going to take a while.",

                "body": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) yesterday published a tweet highlighting his latest meeting with European ambassadors, discussing \"economic cooperation.\" Maybe this was a coincidence, or maybe the Speaker of the House was being a little passive aggressive, signaling his support for international trade with European allies while his party's president prepares a \"trade war\" and chides the E.U.\n\nThroughout Donald Trump's tenure, Ryan has played the role of loyal partisan soldier, aligning himself with the White House through thick and thin. The Wisconsin congressman will occasionally wring his hands and express some tepid disappointment with the president's more outlandish antics, but in general, Trump can expect Ryan to be in his corner.\n\nIt's what made yesterday's developments stand out.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had a message for Hill Republicans unhappy with his new trade policy: Get used to it.\n\nAsked about pushback from House Speaker Paul Ryan and congressional GOP leadership, who have ramped up their battle against the president's surprise announcement last week of new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, Trump told reporters Monday that \"we're not backing down.\"\n\nTrump has openly sparred with members of his own party over the move. \"We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,\" Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said Monday. \"The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don't want to jeopardize those gains.\"\n\nOK, but there's a difference between the House Speaker's office not wanting something and House Republican leaders actually taking deliberate action. Ryan's spokesperson expressing \"extreme\" concern is a notable first step, which the president is likely to ignore.\n\nWhich naturally raises the question of what the second step might be.\n\nThe Constitution may empower Congress to \"regulate commerce with foreign nations,\" but the White House gradually expanded its power in this area, especially when it comes to tariffs (though the last time Congress changed the law, the idea was to empower the executive branch to eliminate tariffs, not create new ones).\n\nWith this in mind, it would take a new law to block Trump's proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum - and there's been some chatter about Congress doing exactly that.\n\nAlternatively, as the Washington Post noted, GOP leaders \"could try to halt the tariffs by inserting something into a must-sign piece of legislation, such as the government-funding bill that is due later this month.\"\n\nTo be sure, moves like these would represent aggressive moves by Republican lawmakers against a Republican White House - Trump has a track record of lashing out when his ostensible allies defy him - and it's difficult to say whether Ryan and his colleagues are prepared to be this bold.\n\nThough it seems unlikely, it wouldn't be completely unprecedented. Last summer, the president was staunchly opposed to legislation that imposed new sanctions on Russia for its attack on American elections. Lawmakers largely ignored Trump's position and passed it anyway. (It's precisely why so few members have perfect 100% voting records when it comes to voting with the White House.)\n\nHouse Republicans are \"extremely worried\" about the president's tariffs? It's time to find out just how worried they are.",

                "body": "Donald Trump has an unfortunate habit of describing phone calls that happened only in his imagination, though he presents them to the public as if they were real.\n\nIn August, for example, the president described a phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that, in reality, never occurred. Before that, Trump was excited a phone call he'd received from the head of the Boy Scouts, which also hadn't happened. In July, he offered details of a phone conversation with the head of a large nation, with over 300 million people, who complained to the American president about the foreign country's 9% GDP growth rate.\n\nThere is no such country. Though Trump talked about the phone call more than once, he apparently made it up.\n\nWith this in mind, it seemed quite important over the weekend when the American president told reporters, practically as an aside, that North Korean officials recently called U.S. officials to discuss diplomatic engagement. \"Now we're talking,\" Trump said, referring to North Korea. \"They, by the way, called up a couple of days ago; they said, 'We would like to talk.' And I said, 'So would we, but you have to de-nuke.'\"\n\nAnd while that seemed like an important breakthrough, it now appears the conversation Trump described never occurred.\n\nThe White House said Monday that Donald Trump had been referring to a call with South Korea's leader when he appeared to suggest a landmark direct contact with the nuclear North. [...]\n\nA senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that Trump had in fact been referencing a call he had on Thursday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nAt the risk of sounding picky, there's a big difference between the two countries. One is an ally, one isn't. A phone call from one is routine; a phone call from the other is important.\n\nThis isn't the kind of mistake an American president should make casually when describing a tense national security situation.\n\nAnd more to the point, why is it, exactly, that Trump keeps telling people about phone calls that never happened? The next time he describes the details of some important conversation he claims to have had, why in the world would anyone believe him?",

                "body": "It's no secret that Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) has been ailing over the last several months, and yesterday, the Mississippi Republican conceded that his ill health is forcing him from Capitol Hill. Cochran will resign at the end of the month,\n\nAnd this, in turn, will knock over a series of dominoes.\n\nThe early departure clears the way for Gov. Phil Bryant, a fellow Republican, to appoint an interim successor - perhaps Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves - and sets up a special election on Nov. 6. It also raises the possibility that State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who announced a primary challenge to Republican Sen. Roger Wicker last week, will switch races to take on Bryant's pick.\n\nIt seems likely that Chris McDaniel, who narrowly lost a primary challenge to Thad Cochran in 2014, will end his primary campaign against Wicker, since it would probably be easier for the far-right state lawmaker to win an open-seat Senate contest than to defeat an incumbent senator who enjoys the GOP's institutional support.\n\nBut the statewide special election poses its own challenges. Yes, Mississippi is unmistakably a red state where Republicans tend to dominate, but the special election field is likely to be large. If no one candidate wins a majority of Nov. 6, the top two candidates will advance to a runoff, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nAnd that unusual system opens the door to unexpected developments. Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy (D), for example, intends to run for this Senate seat, and he's likely to have the kind of resources needed to run a credible campaign. Complicating matters, Chris McDaniel has plenty of detractors in Republican politics - including Senate GOP leaders who'd prefer not to see him win.\n\nIf this dynamic sounds kinds of familiar, we saw similar circumstances late last year in the neighboring state of Alabama, where there was a Senate special election featuring a high-profile Republican extremist, who wasn't popular with the party establishment.\n\nIf memory serves, that race turned out pretty well for Democrats.\n\nTo be sure, the smart money says Republicans will keep this seat. But Cochran's mid-term retirement adds an unwelcome complication for the majority GOP, which suddenly has to deal with an open-seat contest featuring a right-wing insurgent the party would prefer to see lose.\n\nPostscript: Also keep an eye on state House Minority Leader David Baria (D), who recently launched a campaign against Wicker, after McDaniel launched his primary challenge. With Wicker out, Baria may decide he, too, would have a better chance of success in an open-seat contest.",

                "title": "Lawyer implicates Trump in porn-star payment, intensifying scandal",
                "body": "It's been a couple of weeks since Michael Cohen, a personal attorney for Donald Trump, publicly conceded that he facilitated the $130,000 pre-election payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, however, that Cohen has privately had several other notable things to say.\n\nWe talked yesterday about the fact that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was prepared to walk away from the deal just a few weeks before Election Day 2016 when she didn't receive the payment Trump World promised. The WSJ shed some additional light on this detail:\n\nMr. Cohen said he missed two deadlines earlier that month [October 2016] to make the $130,000 payment to Ms. Clifford because he couldn't reach Mr. Trump in the hectic final days of the presidential campaign, the person said.\n\nMs. Clifford was owed the money in return for signing an agreement that bars her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump in 2006, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump's victory, Mr. Cohen complained to friends that he had yet to be reimbursed for the payment to Ms. Clifford, the people said.\n\nThese are no small details. If the Journal's article is correct, Cohen has directly implicated the president in a pre-election scheme to pay hush money to one of his alleged mistresses before she undermined his candidacy. In this version of events, Trump was not only aware of the payment, his lawyer expected to be repaid the $130,000.\n\nAnd if that payment was illegal - for example, if it violated campaign-finance laws - then the president likely has some explaining to do.\n\nBut just as important, as Rachel noted on the show last night, is the follow-the-money aspect of this controversy, specifically as it relates to the relevant banks involved in the transaction.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's piece added that the bank Cohen used for the transaction, First Republic Bank, \"flagged the transaction as suspicious and reported it to the Treasury Department.\"\n\nThis dovetails in interesting ways with the latest reporting from the Washington Post, which noted that the bank that received the $130,000 wire transfer, City National Bank in Beverly Hills, also had concerns about the transaction. In fact, the bank asked Stormy Daniels' lawyer about the source of the payment.\n\nBut pay attention to one specific detail about this: the City National Bank in Beverly Hills raised concerns in September 2017 - 11 months after Trump World made the payment.\n\nIt's a curious timeline, isn't it? Two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, an adult-film star who claims she had an extra-marital affair received $130,000 from Trump's lawyer, apparently to buy her silence. Trump's lawyer's bank considered the payment suspicious and alerted federal authorities. Nearly a full year later, the porn star's bank decided to start asking questions about the transaction.\n\nSo, what sparked the interest of the bank that received the money, 11 months after the money was wired? Why, exactly, did the California bank suddenly look backwards and ask for additional information about the suspicious payment?\n\nOne possibility - and admittedly, this is just a possibility - is that the bank received requests for information from law enforcement.\n\nAnd if - if - this matter is being investigated, the controversy is about a whole lot more than Donald Trump's messy personal life and the salacious details of a sex scandal.",

                "title": "Former Trump aide Nunberg plays a risky game in Russia probe",
                "body": "The drama began yesterday afternoon, when the Washington Post reported that Sam Nunberg, an on-again-off-again former aide to Donald Trump, had been subpoenaed to appear on Friday in front of a federal grand jury investigating the Russia scandal. Nunberg said at the time that he intended to defy the subpoena.\n\n\"Let him arrest me,\" Nunberg said. \"Mr. Mueller should understand I am not going in on Friday.\"\n\nIn the hours that followed, the former Trump aide participated in a series of amazing interviews, including appearances with MSNBC's Katy Tur and Ari Melber, in which he defended his posture and made a series of provocative claims, all while making clear he had no intention of honoring the subpoena he received from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team.\n\nThe likelihood of Nunberg going to jail seemed quite high - right up until he signaled a change in direction.\n\nAfter a day spent belligerently defying special counsel Robert Mueller, former Donald Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg appeared to reverse himself Monday night and said he likely will cooperate with a subpoena seeking campaign documents related to the Russia investigation. [...]\n\nMonday night, Nunberg, who said he still hadn't talked with his attorney, told NBC News that he would probably cooperate with Mueller in the end.\n\nJust so we're all clear, Nunberg created quite a public spectacle yesterday, taking pride in his refusal to comply with a federal subpoena, only to end the day conceding that he'll likely end up complying after all.\n\nHe added that he doesn't \"want to make it easy\" on the special counsel's team, though I'm not at all sure what that means. There's an ongoing criminal investigation and there's nothing to suggest Nunberg is in a position to dictate the terms of his cooperation. He can show up and plead the Fifth, but he can't tell federal investigators to limit the scope of their inquiry.\n\nAnd that leads to a few lines of inquiry.\n\nFirst, a lot can happen between now and Friday, and it's hard to say with confidence whether Nunberg will change his mind again about cooperating with a grand jury subpoena. As Rachel noted on the show last night, if he refuses to comply, it's entirely possible he'll be arrested. (\"I think it would be funny if they arrested me,\" Nunberg said yesterday during one of his MSNBC interviews.)\n\nSecond, Nunberg said all kinds of interesting things during his cable-news tour yesterday, including raising the possibility that the Mueller \"may\" have something on the president. I'd recommend caution before embracing those claims at face value.\n\nAnd third, it's not altogether clear why, exactly, Nunberg has expressed such vigorous reluctance about complying with the subpoena. He raised complaints about the time it would take to pull the relevant materials together for the special counsel's team, but if the former Trump aide has several hours to chat with journalists about his plans, it's hardly a stretch to think he has also several hours to prepare subpoenaed documents.\n\nThe drama continues.

                "body": "Donald Trump's affinity for conspiracy theories has never been especially healthy, but making matters worse is his eagerness to connect his conspiracy theories to Watergate.\n\nAccording to the current president, for example, Uranium One is Watergate. So is the non-existent wiretapping of Trump Tower. Benghazi, Trump assures us, is \"bigger than Watergate.\" What's more, Joe Arpaio's investigation into Barack Obama's birth certificate, Trump wrote in 2012, \"could dwarf Watergate.\"\n\nToday, the Republican was at it again.\n\n\"Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.\"\n\nFrom time to time, Trump's conspiracy theories are outrageous in offensive ways, but this latest missive is more pitiful than infuriating.\n\nLet's summarize the basic details that the president doesn't seems to find confusing:\n\n1. The Justice Department began investigating the Trump campaign in 2016 because there was quite a bit of evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n2. The idea that this was done to help Hillary Clinton is unusually silly, not just because the Justice Department was apparently opposed to the Democratic nominee, but also because if the investigation was a scheme to hurt the Trump campaign, the Justice Department would've told the public about the probe.\n\nKeeping this information from voters - even while alerting the public to the investigation into Clinton's email server - is the exact opposite of what federal law enforcement officials would've done if they were trying to help the Democratic ticket.\n\n3. If the president wants us to take his various \"bigger than Watergate!\" declarations seriously, he should perhaps make these claims less frequently.\n\n4. Obama did a lot more than \"nothing\" about the Russian election attack that Trump spent a year and a half denying. Indeed, the Democratic president imposed harsh sanctions on Russia - Trump might recall his national security advisor's chat with Moscow about the sanctions - and the then-president tried to get bipartisan support for a stronger response. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused.\n\nOr put another way, everything in Trump's little Twitter tantrum this morning was wrong in ways he really ought to understand.",

The gambit behind ridiculous \"memo\" failed spectacularly; Democrats are demanding Nunes' ouster from his powerful post; and last week, the California Republican was credibly accused of leaking texts from the Senate Intelligence Committee's ranking member to Fox News as part of an unusually misguided partisan stunt.\n\nSlate added last week that Nunes' greatest hits include \"being forced to admit that he hasn't personally read the court documents that he based an FBI-Hillary conspiracy memo on, being forced to admit that the FBI actually did disclose the information about Trump 'dossier' author Christopher Steele that Nunes had accused it of not disclosing, and being forced to admit that he had coordinated his statements about the phony Obama 'wiretapping' story with the White House and then lied about it.\"\n\nBut don't worry, Nunes' embarrassing failures and ruined reputation haven't stopped him from identifying the real dangers facing the nation.\n\nOne of the nation's exercises in democracy can be found on late-night TV. Hosts crack sharply critical jokes about the country's politicians without fear of retribution from said politicians.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) sees that exercise very differently. He told Fox News Channel that a skit Stephen Colbert did mocking Nunes's memo alleging FBI bias in the Russia investigation is a danger to the country.\n\nColbert aired a segment late last week, showing him on Capitol Hill distributing a joke memo he's prepared. The five-word document read, \"Devin Nunes is a [redacted],\" and the CBS host asked various people what they thought the redacted word might be.\n\n\"I think this is the danger we have in this country,\" Nunes told Fox News a day later. \"This is an example of it.\" The congressman added that Colbert and others on the left \"attack people who are trying to get to the truth.\"\n\nOh, where to start.\n\nFirst, Colbert is a comedian, and while I realize this is the Trump era, and there's an unsettling authoritarian streak in certain corners, American politicians should probably avoid describing late-night talk-show hosts as being part of a national \"danger.\"\n\nThe chairman of the House Intelligence Committee has access to the nation's most sensitive secrets, and in theory, he's acutely aware of real threats. Stephen Colbert isn't one of them.\n\nSecond, we've all had ample opportunity to see the kind of work Devin Nunes does, and the idea that he's someone \"trying to get to the truth\" is demonstrably silly. The California Republican is trying to protect his party and its president, even if that means becoming a national punch-line.\n\nOr as one of Nunes' GOP colleagues put it last year, \"You have to keep in mind who [Nunes] works for. He works for the president and answers to the president.\"",

Chuck Todd also wanted to know, however, whether the policy is actually going to happen, or whether the president is still weighing his options.\n\n\"Well, I think you have to take the president at his word,\" Ross said, though he hedged a bit moments later. \"Whatever his final decision is is what will happen.\" It led to this exchange:\n\nTODD: Meaning this isn't a done deal.\n\nROSS: I didn't say that. I just said what he has said he has said. If he says something different, it'll be something different.\n\nIt was at this point in the interview that the host had the same reaction I did while watching at home: Chuck Todd laughed and asked, \"What does this mean?\"\n\nWhich was precisely the right question. If I understood Ross' comments correctly - and really, your guess is as good as mine - I think the cabinet secretary was trying to avoid a definitive answer because Ross knows what Trump is capable of. At any given moment, the president might see some Fox News segment that will lead him to announce without warning that he now opposes his own agenda.\n\nAnd so, despite everything Trump has said about tariffs, everyone seems to recognize the possibility that he could soon decide the opposite, at which point, as Ross put it, the administration's policy will \"be something different.\"\n\nAll of this made for an interesting television interview, but it was also emblematic of a larger truth: this president, who ran as a consummate deal-maker, is making it impossible to work with him. Indeed, the Washington Post had a piece over the weekend on Trump's mercurial nature and its impact on the political process.\n\nHeading into a new week, lawmakers still have no sense of what Trump truly wants on guns and other key agenda items - a pattern that leaders of both parties say has hindered their ability to move forward on knotty issues that could benefit from presidential leadership.\n\nAfter more than a year of the Trump presidency, members of Congress have learned to brace themselves for unpredictable, confusing and often contradictory positions from the commander in chief on issues ranging from health care to immigration to gun rights.\n\nOther than his unflinching support for Russia and Putin's government, it's genuinely difficult to think of an issue on which Trump has even tried to be steady and consistent.\n\nThe result is a dynamic that's no doubt familiar to regular readers: we have a president who knows very little about public policy and current events, makes no real effort to get up to speed on any issue, makes different commitments to different political contingents, has few core beliefs that he genuinely cares about, routinely changes his mind for reasons the White House struggles to explain, and tends to agree with the last person who has his ear.\n\nWhy is it that Trump has failed to negotiate any deals with anyone on any issue during his tenure to date? In part because there's a collective understanding that the president's pronouncements are meaningless.\n\nAs a consequence, we get to see clumsy cabinet secretaries, fearful of being contradicted without warning, telling a national television audience in reference to the president, \"If he says something different, it'll be something different.\"",

The filing deadline for a new candidate is this week.\n\n* The Dallas Morning News reported over the weekend that early voting among Texas Republicans in this year's primaries is up 16% compared to a comparable period in 2014. Among Texas Democrats, meanwhile, early voting is up 98%. No, that's not a typo.\n\n* The latest Mason-Dixon poll in Louisiana found Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) as fairly popular in the state - he has a 55% approval rating - though the Democrat may yet have difficulty winning a second term. Despite his current support, the same poll found Edwards struggling against likely GOP challengers.\n\n* And Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who isn't seeking re-election this year, said yesterday he believes Trump \"will have a challenge from the Republican Party\" in 2020. For historical context, it's worth noting that the only modern incumbent presidents who've lost re-election bids - Ford, Carter, and H.W. Bush - are those who faced credible primary challenges.",

                "body": "Last week, Adm. Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, unexpectedly made some news. At a Senate hearing, Rogers explained that the United States is \"probably not doing enough\" to combat Russian efforts to attack American elections, and asked about his own agency's work, Rogers added that he hadn't yet been directed by his boss - Donald Trump - to disrupt Russian cyberattacks targeting our elections.\n\nAsked about the testimony, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the Trump administration is doing all sorts of things to address the Russian threat, and she pointed to three pieces of evidence:\n\n1. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has held some meetings.\n\n2. U.S. officials are \"looking at a number of different options,\" none of which Sanders would identify.\n\n3. The State Department's Global Engagement Center has been given resources.\n\nIt's that third one that seems especially relevant today. The New York Times reported:\n\nAs Russia's virtual war against the United States continues unabated with the midterm elections approaching, the State Department has yet to spend any of the $120 million it has been allocated since late 2016 to counter foreign efforts to meddle in elections or sow distrust in democracy.\n\nAs a result, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department's Global Engagement Center - which has been tasked with countering Moscow's disinformation campaign - speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts.\n\nTo put it mildly, this isn't encouraging.\n\nIndeed, it adds new context to Sarah Huckabee Sanders' deeply unfortunate argument from last week. Told that the head of the U.S. Cyber Command hasn't yet been directed to combat Russian cyberattacks, the White House press secretary pointed to a State Department office that hasn't spent the money it's received to combat Russian election interference.\n\nSo, from the administration's perspective, what exactly is Team Trump doing in preparation for an expected Russian attack - aside from delaying implementations of sanctions intended to punish Russia for the last attack?\n\nPostscript: On a related note, CNBC's John Harwood had a great piece the other day, contextualizing Trump's embrace of Russia: \"[W]hatever the special counsel concludes legally about 'collusion,' evidence on public display already paints a jarring picture. It shows an American president who has embraced Russian money and illicit favors, while maintaining rhetoric and policies benefiting Russia and undercutting national security officials of his own country.\"",

                "body": "In Barack Obama's first inaugural address, the new president made a specific vow: \"We'll restore science to its rightful place.\" He did exactly that, prioritizing the integrity of scientific inquiry throughout the executive branch. I remember Time magazine publishing a piece that said the Democratic president showed so much enthusiasm for science, he was \"almost strident\" on the issue.\n\nIt's safe to say no one will ever say this about his successor.\n\nThe AP recently reported, for example, \"When it comes to filling jobs dealing with complex science, environment and health issues, the Trump administration is nominating people with fewer science academic credentials than their Obama predecessors. And it's moving slower as well.\" The White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, meanwhile, is a \"ghost town.\" The top-ranking science official in the White House is a 31-year-old aide with no relevant background in science.\n\nThe New Yorker published a brutal piece last week, noting not only Trump's disdain for science, but also detailing the extent to which Trump's budget blueprint represents an \"assault on knowledge and reason.\"\n\nIt's against this backdrop that Politico reported the other day on Trump's EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, went so far as to dismiss evolution in an old radio interview.\n\n\"There aren't sufficient scientific facts to establish the theory of evolution, and it deals with the origins of man, which is more from a philosophical standpoint than a scientific standpoint,\" he said in one part of the series, in which Pruitt and the program's hosts discussed issues related to the Constitution.\n\nEPA would not say this week whether any of Pruitt's positions have changed since 2005. Asked whether the administrator's skepticism about a major foundation of modern science such as evolution could conflict with the agency's mandate to make science-based decisions, spokesman Jahan Wilcox told POLITICO that \"if you're insinuating that a Christian should not serve in capacity as EPA administrator, that is offensive and a question that does not warrant any further attention.\"\n\nThat's not a constructive response to a reasonable question.\n\nThe issue isn't about whether a Christian can lead the EPA. Rather, what matters in this case is whether someone who struggles to evaluate evidence and scientific information is suitable for this post.\n\nWhich is why it's so discouraging to see the EPA's spokesperson respond in such a knee-jerk way. As New York's Jon Chait put it, it matters if \"the administrator of the agency charged with assessing environmental threats and protecting against them is a kook who rejects out of hand any scientific theory that implies any revision of any right-wing belief whatsoever, including the right of companies to dump endless amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere for free.\"\n\nTo try to shut this down by suggesting any concerns are necessarily anti-Christian is a mistake.",

                "title": "Trump pushes Republicans to kill key infrastructure project",
                "body": "Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) made a bizarre decision in 2010, killing a project called Access to the Region's Core, \"a years-in-the-making effort\" to build a new rail tunnel from New Jersey to New York City. Proponents of the project say it could have created as many as 44,000 jobs in and around the state and hiked local property values by up to $18 billion.\n\nBut for reasons that never seemed to add up, Christie wouldn't budge. Now that the New Jersey Republican has since left office, maybe now the infrastructure investments can move forward? Maybe not.\n\nJust a few months ago, the idea once again appeared to have gained the support it needed in Washington and, once again, it looks as if one powerful official - in this case, the president - could put a stop to it. The latest and perhaps most ominous threat came late Friday night when it was revealed that President Trump had asked Republican leaders to withdraw federal funding for the project.\n\nMr. Trump has promised to spur \"the biggest and boldest infrastructure investment in American history.\" So his opposition to an established project that is widely considered a solution to one of the nation's most critical infrastructure needs has confounded even veterans of his own party.\n\nNote, this isn't just a White House move; it's an issue the president has taken up personally. The Washington Post reported that Trump took it upon himself to directly urge House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) last week not to support funding for the project.\n\nAnd while the White House hasn't offered a detailed explanation for the president's apparent opposition, by all accounts, Trump is rejecting the much-needed infrastructure project in order to spite Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\n\"If the news reports are accurate that he wants to kill it or hold it because he's mad at Chuck Schumer, that makes no sense,\" Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y,) said. \"This is essential to the national economy as well as the regional economy.\"\n\nIt's not like the White House can say the project is unimportant: Team Trump is on record identifying the Gateway project under the Hudson River as the nation's No. 1 infrastructure priority - Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao also endorsed it as a top administration goal - which Trump himself now opposes.\n\nSome may see stories like these as unimportant to people outside the Northeast, but I think there's a larger context. After the 2016 election, Trump critics had a series of fears about the kind of president he'd be. Among other things, Trump's detractors expected the amateur politician to be small and petty, indifferent to the public's needs, more concerned with personal grudges than national interests, governing through a series of child-like tantrums.\n\nA year and a half later, I think it's safe to say those concerns were well justified.\n\nIt's especially odd that Trump would do this to his own home state. It's a given that every American president always has to consider the nation as a whole, but as a rule, presidents tend to be mindful of their home states and home towns.\n\nTrump's judgment is such that he's prepared to hurt his fellow New Yorkers in the hopes of bothering Chuck Schumer. This falls far outside the boundaries of conventional presidential politics.",

Team Trump announced in December 2016 that Icahn, a billionaire backer of the Republican's candidacy, would serve as \"special adviser\" on regulations in the Trump administration.\n\nAs we discussed at the time, it was a difficult arrangement to defend: Trump intended to give Icahn power to help shape regulations that could directly benefit Icahn's own business interests. Indeed, the New Yorker reported Icahn allegedly used his position to shape an EPA rule that affected one of his investments, and unable to answer the obvious conflict-of-interest questions, Icahn parted ways with the White House last summer.\n\nLast week, Icahn's name reappeared in the news, after ThinkProgress noted that Trump's billionaire backer \"dumped $31.3 million of stock in a company heavily dependent on steel\" the week before his presidential ally announced plans for new steel tariffs. The Washington Post had a related report over the weekend:\n\nPresident Trump's decision Thursday to impose crippling tariffs on the imports of steel and aluminum took many by surprise - particularly investors, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day's trading down more than 400 points, or 1.7 percent, at 24,608.\n\nBut one billionaire investor and former Trump adviser, Carl Icahn, was seemingly unvexed, having dumped a million shares tied to the steel industry a week before the president announced 25 percent tariffs for foreign-made steel.\n\nAt issue was Icahn's ownership stake in Manitowoc Company, which makes construction cranes made of steel. Not surprisingly, Manitowoc stock dropped sharply after the president made his tariff plans clear - but Icahn had sold his shares a week earlier.\n\nSure, Trump had talked up the idea of steel sanctions long before last week, but the public didn't know anything about the timing of the administration's specific plan.\n\nAnd that in turn suggests the president's ally had incredible timing.\n\nTrump praised Icahn last year as someone \"who is innately able to predict the future.\" Yep, that's quite a crystal ball the guy has.\n\nJust to be clear, I haven't seen any evidence to suggest Icahn received a private heads-up about Trump's tariff announcement, but given the circumstances, it seems some questions about Icahn's fortuitous timing are inevitable.",

                "title": "New details shed light on when (and why) Trump World paid a porn star",
                "body": "About a week ago, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah was asked about Donald Trump's personal attorney paying $130,000 to an adult-film star, shortly before the 2016 presidential election, raising the possibility of a hush-money payoff to one of the president's alleged mistresses. \"That matter has been asked and answered,\" Shah replied.\n\nStrictly speaking, that isn't quite true - there are plenty of questions that have been asked without being answered - and the story continues to come into sharper focus. The Washington Post reported over the weekend, for example, on how close the deal between Trump World and Stormy Daniels was to falling apart.\n\nThe 2016 election was less than a month away, and Donald Trump's attorney had blown the deadline for paying Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her alleged affair with the future president.\n\nIn an Oct. 17 email, an attorney for Daniels - a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford - threatened to cancel the nondisclosure agreement by the end of the day.\n\nThat very morning, Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, had created a limited liability company, public records show, that ultimately would serve as a vehicle for Daniels's payoff. But the money had not arrived. A second email to Cohen, a short time after the first, said Daniels was calling the deal off.\n\nDaniels' lawyer wrote in an email that the adult-film actress considered her settlement agreement \"canceled and void.\" At the time, there was a growing scandal surrounding Trump's alleged mistreatment of women, including an audio recording in which the Republican was heard bragging about sexually assaulting women.\n\nOn Oct. 27, Daniels received the $130,000.\n\nThese new details start to paint a provocative picture: Daniels was prepared to remain quiet about her alleged extra-marital relationship with Trump, but she was expecting to be paid for her silence. When Trump's personal lawyer was late in making the payment, Daniels was reportedly prepared to walk away from the agreement and go public at a politically inopportune time that could've done real harm to the Republican campaign.\n\nAfter all, the Oct. 17 email was sent just two weeks remaining before Election Day. By the time the apparent hush money was delivered, early voting was already underway in much of the country.\n\nWhy is this important? Because if the $130,000 was intended to help Trump's presidential candidacy, it means the money probably should've been reported to the Federal Election Commission as an in-kind campaign expenditure - and failure to do so may have been illegal.\n\nEllen Weintraub, the vice chair of the Federal Election Commission, recently spoke to Rachel about campaign-finance law in general and she explained, \"The law says that a gift, loan, advance, money anything of value that is made for the purpose of influencing an election is a contribution.\"\n\nAnd it's hardly a stretch to think the apparent hush money was delivered for the purpose of influencing an election.\n\nSo, here are some of the questions for Team Trump:\n\n* If Daniels canceled the deal on Oct. 17, and then received her money on Oct. 27, what were the nature of the negotiations between those two dates?\n\n* Now that Trump's lawyer has publicly acknowledged the $130,000 payment, is the non-disclosure agreement still in effect?\n\n* When did Trump learn about the porn-star payment?\n\n* Did Trump reimburse Cohen for the payment? Was there any kind of financial arrangement between the lawyer and his client? (Cohen recently said in response to these questions, \"I can't get into any of that.\" He didn't say why not.)\n\n* Why $130,000? Isn't that a weird number?\n\n* Wasn't former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) prosecuted for similar actions?\n\nI have no idea whether this controversy is registering with the public, but it's worth noting that the latest CNN poll asked respondents whether the payment to Daniels was intended to protect the Trump campaign, and 65% of the country said it was.\n\nOr put another way, nearly two-thirds of the country believes Trump World illegally paid a porn star to avoid an election defeat.",

                "title": "Despite recent rhetoric, Rubio eyes only modest reforms on guns",
                "body": "Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) didn't appear to enjoy the recent CNN forum on gun violence, where the Republican lawmaker was confronted with angry constituents who saw him as part of the problem. What's more, there's no reason to believe the forum's audience was some kind of political aberration: a Quinnipiac poll released last week found Rubio's approval rating in Florida dropping to just 38%.\n\nThese are the kind of conditions that tend to push politicians toward action, and with this in mind, Rubio unveiled new legislation on the issue last week. \"We can do this,\" the GOP lawmaker said. \"What happened in Parkland doesn't have to happen again. If we can work together, put aside our differences and focus on meaningful legislation that curbs gun violence - we can make real progress.\"\n\nThose are the kind of words one might ordinarily expect from someone advocating sweeping changes to the nation's gun laws. But there seems to be a gap between Rubio's bold vision and Rubio's legislation.\n\nEight days ago, Marco Rubio endorsed raising the age requirement for buying a rifle from 18 to 21 and voiced openness to placing limits on the size of ammunition magazines.\n\nOn Thursday, when the Republican senator from Florida unveiled his plan to address gun violence, he did not outline any specific plans on these very divisive fronts.\n\nWhy not aim higher and include some of the popular measures discussed at the recent forum? \"These reforms do not enjoy the sort of widespread support in Congress that the other measures I've announced do,\" Rubio said Thursday.\n\nBut that's not really what leadership looks like. Raising the age requirement, for example, is broadly popular with the public, and has received praise from, among others, Donald Trump. Rubio could take advantage of this dynamic, push for the idea he seems to support, and try to rally support from his Capitol Hill colleagues.\n\nHe doesn't want to.\n\nSo what is in Rubio's plan? The Washington Post's report added that Rubio's blueprint features \"less controversial measures,\" including freeing up more federal dollars to beef up school security and create 'crisis interventions teams'; creating gun violence restraining orders; pressing school districts to promptly alert law enforcement to dangerous behavior; passing a bipartisan bill to tighten the National Instant Background Check System; and mandating the FBI notify states when a prohibited person tries to buy a gun and fails the requisite background check.\"\n\nTo be sure, there's nothing wrong with these modest measures. That said, they're short of what Rubio voiced support for at the Florida forum, and there's no reason to believe the Republican-led Senate will actually tackle efforts like these anytime soon.\n\nIt's worth pausing from time to time to note that in a 51-49 Senate, a member like Rubio can wield significant influence. If he were to tell GOP leaders that he'll stand in the way of other legislative priorities until he receives assurances that the chamber will vote on new gun measures, it's very likely his colleagues would make time.\n\nJust how hard is Rubio prepared to fight? I'm keeping my expectations low.",

                "body": "It was about a week ago when the world learned about China's plan to allow President Xi Jinping to remain in office indefinitely. In a brief item, I wrote, \"No one should give Trump any ideas.\"\n\nToo late.\n\nIn the closed-door remarks, a recording of which was obtained by CNN, Trump ... praised China's President Xi Jinping for recently consolidating power and extending his potential tenure, musing he wouldn't mind making such a maneuver himself.\n\n\"He's now president for life. President for life. No, he's great,\" Trump said. \"And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday.\"\n\nIt's likely this was an attempt at humor, but given Trump's authoritarian instincts, it's hardly reassuring to see him joking about such a thing.\n\nIndeed, a month ago, this same American president suggested to supporters that Democrats were \"treasonous\" for failing to applaud his State of the Union address. Referring to his political adversaries, Trump added, \"They certainly didn't seem to love our country very much.\"\n\nThe White House later said the comments were intended to be \"tongue in cheek,\" but the more Trump tells these kinds of \"jokes,\" the easier it is to believe they reflect at least part of his genuine beliefs.\n\nChina, meanwhile, which is accustomed to hearing the United States promote democratic principles, is apparently delighted by the American president's praise.\n\nIn fact, whether one is inclined to believe Trump was kidding or not, he appeared to be serious about his support for Xi Jinping. Instead of criticizing the idea of an undemocratic society leaving their unelected leader in office indefinitely, the Republican described China's policy as \"great,\" which, not surprisingly, was a welcome sentiment in Beijing.\n\nThis shouldn't be necessary to say, but Trump's comments contradict how Americans are supposed to think about political power, though it's entirely consistent with how this president - whose record of praise for dictators is painfully long - tends to see the world.\n\nAnd I'm afraid there's nothing funny about that.",

                "body": "For a year and a half, Donald Trump ignored practically everyone, including his own intelligence officials, and embraced the fiction that Russia may not have attacked the American elections in 2016. About a week ago, however, the president shifted his posture - and started blaming his predecessor.\n\n\"Obama did nothing about Russia!\" Trump tweeted, \"Why didn't he do something?\" Trump asked in a different tweet on the same subject.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has pushed the same line. Asked last week about the Trump administration's reluctance to prepare for another round of attacks in 2018, Sanders seemed eager to change the subject: \"Let's not forget that this happened under Obama.... If you want to blame somebody on past problems, then you need to look at the Obama administration.\"\n\nThe problem, of course, is that every time Trump World turns its attention to officials' response to Russian intervention in 2016, we're reminded that it wasn't Barack Obama who was negligent - it was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nFormer White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough on Sunday said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \"watered down\" a warning about Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election and defended the Obama administration's response to foreign meddling in the campaign.\n\nThe language in a September 2016 letter from congressional leaders to state election officials was drastically softened at McConnell's urging, McDonough said in an exclusive interview Sunday on NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"\n\nLet's back up for a minute. As regular readers know, the Obama White House, swayed by the evidence compiled by U.S. intelligence agencies, wanted bipartisan support to push back against Russian intrusion, and in mid-September 2016, the then-president dispatched counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco, then-FBI Director James Comey, and then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to brief top members of Congress.\n\nObama didn't want to be seen as using intelligence for partisan or electoral ends, so he sought a \"show of solidarity and bipartisan unity\" against foreign manipulation of our democracy.\n\nThat didn't happen - because McConnel refused.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported, when national security officials told congressional leaders about Russia's interference, it was McConnell who not only didn't want to alert the public, he also questioned the validity of the intelligence.\n\nBrian Beutler put it this way: \"McConnell ran interference for Trump during the campaign to stop Obama from warning the country about things Trump was lying publicly about.\"\n\nBy way of a defense, McConnell's office points to the September 2016 letter, signed by congressional leaders from both parties, which was sent to the president of the National Association of State Election Directors. It warned state officials about possible hacking efforts.\n\nBut this wasn't the statement American intelligence officials wanted McConnell to endorse, and the letter made no reference to Russia's attack, which McConnell was briefed on at the time.\n\nDenis McDonough told NBC News' Chuck Todd yesterday that this statement was \"dramatically watered down\" at McConnell's insistence - and he has no idea why.\n\nWhen Trump asks in reference to the Russia attack, \"Why didn't he do something?\" the president is directing the question at the wrong \"he.\"\n\nPostscript: Last summer, NBC News' Kasie Hunt asked McConnell if he regrets the way he handled the threat at the time. The Senate GOP leader responded by dodging the question entirely. Perhaps it's time the Kentucky Republican to face a new round of questioning about his negligence in response to warnings about an attack on the United States.",

The AR-15 is the gun used in the Florida high school massacre.\n\nThe Associated Press' report added that this Pennsylvania church's congregation is \"a breakaway faction of the Unification Church, which often is described as a cult.\" If the Unification Church, which didn't condone this week's event, sounds familiar, it's because it was led by a controversial Korean religious figure named Sun Myung Moon, who died in 2012, and whose movement has long been aligned with Republican politics in the United States.\n\nThe Rev. Hyung Jin \"Sean\" Moon, who leads the Pennsylvania church, is one of Sun Myung Moon's sons.\n\nA separate Associated Press report added that the event did, in fact, happen on Wednesday - it featured \"crown-wearing worshippers clutching AR-15 rifles\" who \"drank holy wine and exchanged or renewed wedding vows\" - and while there were no incidents, the nearby school canceled its classes for the day.\n\nAs for the broader context, Vox had a piece this week noting that the Moon business empire is now known as the Tongil Group, \"a multibillion-dollar conglomerate that supports Unification Church goals.\" The piece added that the Moon family has, in recent years, \"made pro-gun rhetoric a major part of their religious and financial activities. Among the Tongil Group's holdings is Kahr Arms: a small-arms company founded by another of Moon's sons, Justin Moon. The company has long received attention from politically connected public figures. In 2016, Eric Trump attended the opening of one Tongil-affiliated gun store.\"\n\nAlso from the God Machine this week:\n\n* Idaho's Republican-led legislature is moving forward with an anti-Sharia measure, which intends to \"prohibit the application of foreign laws in Idaho courts.\" Since Idaho courts are not applying foreign laws, the proposal appears to be addressing a problem that doesn't exist.\n\n* This conflict in Israel was resolved fairly quickly: \"Christian leaders say they will reopen the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem after Israeli authorities suspended a plan to impose taxes on church properties in the holy city. Major denominations, including the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, said the church would reopen early Wednesday after it was shut for three days to protest the Israeli tax plan.\"\n\n* And an interesting Roman Catholic controversy is brewing: \"The Catholic church risks damaging its moral authority and plunging its followers into confusion if the Vatican presses ahead with an imminent deal with the Chinese government, a group of influential Catholics has warned.\"",

Many of the president's top advisers on the economy, foreign pollicy, and national security teams have urged him not to impose new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. On the other hand, Donald Trump himself seems to like the idea, as do some in the Commerce Department.\n\nThe divisions were on display early yesterday when competing White House factions sent wildly contradictory signals to the press about what the president would do.\n\nOvernight, however, Trump made clear to the public that he'd picked a side, announcing that he not only wants to start an international trade war, he also believes \"trade wars are good and easy to win.\"\n\nWhat we didn't know was that this president - who has an astonishing habit of blindsiding his own team with surprise policy pronouncements - made this decision \"without any internal review by government lawyers or his own staff.\" In fact, NBC News reports today that Trump announced his decision after a meeting with executives from the aluminum and steel industries.\n\nThere were no prepared, approved remarks for the president to give at the planned meeting, there was no diplomatic strategy for how to alert foreign trade partners, there was no legislative strategy in place for informing Congress and no agreed upon communications plan beyond an email cobbled together by [Secretary Wilbur Ross's] team at the Commerce Department late Wednesday that had not been approved by the White House.\n\nNo one at the State Department, the Treasury Department or the Defense Department had been told that a new policy was about to be announced or given an opportunity to weigh in in advance.\n\nBehold, Trump's fine-tuned machine.\n\nBut just as interesting is the behind-the-scenes drama that precipitated the president's decision. NBC News' report added that Trump's choice to launch a potential trade war \"was born out of anger at other simmering issues,\" including Hope Hicks' testimony to Congress about the Russia scandal.\n\nThe circumstances reportedly left the Republican \"unglued,\" according to an NBC source familiar with the president's state of mind.\n\nSo we're left with an erratic, amateur president launching a trade war while feeling overwhelmed by scandals and White House chaos. How reassuring.\n\nPostscript: How amateurish was the process this week? The NBC News report added that Ross hadn't informed the White House in advance of the steel and aluminum executives he'd invited to yesterday's meeting. \"As a result, White House officials were unable to conduct a background check on the executives to make sure they were appropriate for the president to meet with and they were not able to be cleared for entry by secret service.

                "body": "Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 3/1/18, 9:00 PM ET Trump nepotism causes strain within White House, security risks Rachel Maddow looks at the strife within the White House as Donald Trump's top White House staff come into conflict with unqualified family members Trump hired. Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's young son-in-law, is having an unusually brutal week. It started in earnest with the loss of his White House security clearance, which will almost certainly impair his ability to do his job, and which stems from his difficulties under the scrutiny of an FBI background check.\n\nThings got much worse when the Washington Post reported that officials in at least four foreign countries concluded that Kushner's financial difficulties and inexperience made him easy to manipulate. It didn't help that White House National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster discovered that Kushner hadn't coordinated - or even fully disclosed - some of his foreign contacts.\n\nMaking matters even more serious, the New York Times published this bombshell report on Wednesday night, which said Kushner's family real-estate company received two enormous loans from two companies whose executives met with Jared Kushner as part of his White House duties.\n\nAs Rachel noted on the show last night, nobody's denying that the loans were made; nobody's denying that Kushner had a personal financial stake in the specific entities that received these giant loans; and nobody's denying that the White House meetings took place with Kushner before those loans were made to his family's company.\n\nThe result is a picture that looks awfully corrupt: a senior adviser to the president of the United States took meetings in the White House with companies who are seeking something from the White House, and then subsequently those companies shoveled hundreds of millions of dollars to that White House official and his family business.\n\nBut as bad as these developments looked, today's NBC News report put Kushner in an even worse light:\n\nFederal investigators are scrutinizing whether any of Jared Kushner's business discussions with foreigners during the presidential transition later shaped White House policies in ways designed to either benefit or retaliate against those he spoke with, according to witnesses and other people familiar with the investigation.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's team has asked witnesses about Kushner's efforts to secure financing for his family's real estate properties, focusing specifically on his discussions during the transition with individuals from Qatar and Turkey, as well as Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, according to witnesses who have been interviewed as part of the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 election.\n\nAs part of the scrutiny of Kushner's discussions with Turks, federal investigators have reached out to Turkish nationals for information on Kushner through the FBI's legal attache office in Ankara, according to two people familiar with the matter. Separately, Qatari government officials visiting the U.S. in late January and early February considered turning over to Mueller what they believe is evidence of efforts by their country's Persian Gulf neighbors in coordination with Kushner to hurt their country, four people familiar with the matter said. The Qatari officials decided against cooperating with Mueller for now out of fear it would further strain the country's relations with the White House, these people said.\n\nBe sure to read the whole NBC News account for the remarkable details.\n\nLet's note for context that a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday whether the president wants Kushner's ouster. \"No,\" she replied. Pressed further for a reaction to Kushner's controversies, Sanders added, \"I would refer you to the statement that was put out by his attorney.\"\n\nGiven the seriousness of the allegations, that's almost certainly an untenable posture.",

                "body": "Donald Trump hasn't yet announced the details of his new tariffs on aluminum and steel, but Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce and a faux billionaire, appeared on CNBC this morning to defend the controversial policy.\n\nRoss used a can of Campbell's Soup to stress his point about what he calls insignificant price increases from Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"In a can of Campbell's Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that's about six-tenths of 1 cent on the price on a can of Campbell's Soup,\" Ross contended. \"I just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\"\n\nAs a rule, I'm not sure it's a good idea to have wealthy Republican cabinet secretaries argue that rising food costs are irrelevant, though at first blush, Ross' pitch probably seems like a reasonable argument. But sometimes consumers buy steel-based products that are much bigger than a can of soup. How about a car?\n\nRoss went on to argue there's about a ton of steel in every car, adding, \"The price of a ton of steel is $700 or so, so 25% on that would be one half of 1% price increase on the typical $35,000 car. So it's no big deal.\"\n\nIn other words, once Trump's tariffs kick in, the price of an average car would go up $175, which according to the Trump administration, is \"no big deal.\"\n\nBut that's not quite compelling, either. If an American family receives $175 from the Republican tax cut, for example, we're supposed to believe that's an extraordinary sum. Now we're also supposed to believe it's trivial?\n\nWhat's more, millions of U.S. consumers buy cars every year. When each of them start paying for Trump's new tariffs on those purchases, the result is a change that effectively looks like multi-billion-dollar tax hike.\n\nBut even if we were to put that aside, what Ross didn't mention is the likelihood of other countries imposing retaliatory tariffs. Indeed, earlier today, the European Union announced plans to respond to Trump's new tariffs on aluminum and steel with their own on motorcycle, bourbon, and jeans.\n\nAnd that's just the EU. Other trading partners are preparing similar moves.\n\nIs there a point at which this starts to look to the Trump administration like \"a big deal\"?",

                "title": "Republicans plan to keep restrictions on gun research in place",
                "body": "The day after the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), a longtime opponent of new gun measures, said Congress needs to \"take a breath and collect the facts.\" The Republican leader added, \"We don't just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.\"\n\nAt face value, that seemed like an entirely sensible approach. After all, who could be against collecting facts and data before engaging in policymaking?\n\nThe trouble, of course, is that there's already a federal restriction in place to prevent officials from collecting facts and data - and Politico reports today that congressional Republicans intend to leave it in place, despite recent developments.\n\nRepublicans are intent on preserving the so-called Dickey amendment, which prohibits the CDC from advocating on gun control, POLITICO's Jennifer Haberkorn reports. [...]\n\nOpponents say the Dickey amendment has had a chilling effect on CDC research into gun deaths. But Republicans say they don't want to add additional controversy to the upcoming spending bills by eliminating it.\n\nI don't imagine most Americans have heard of the Dickey amendment, but it's an important policy. As Vox explained this week, \"Congress has made it effectively impossible for federally funded researchers to study gun violence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health are the gold standards for public health research in the United States. But they are effectively barred from studying a problem that kills more than 35,000 people in a year.\"\n\nLet's back up and review the context to all of this. The Washington Post reported last fall:\n\n[O]ne reason the positions are so intractable is that no one really knows what works to prevent gun deaths. Gun-control research in the United States essentially came to a standstill in 1996. After 21 years, the science is stale.\n\n\"In the area of what works to prevent shootings, we know almost nothing,\" Mark Rosenberg, who, in the mid-1990s, led the CDC's gun-violence research efforts, said shortly after the San Bernardino shooting in 2015.\n\nIn 1996, the Republican-majority Congress threatened to strip funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unless it stopped funding research into firearm injuries and deaths. The National Rifle Association accused the CDC of promoting gun control. As a result, the CDC stopped funding gun-control research - which had a chilling effect far beyond the agency, drying up money for almost all public health studies of the issue nationwide.\n\nAs regular readers may recall, it's common knowledge that the NRA and its allies have fought to kill any kind of restrictions on firearm ownership. What's less recognized is the fact that the gun lobby also helped block basic data collection, to the point that there's \"no current scientific consensus about guns and violence,\" in large part because the NRA \"has been able to neutralize empirical cases for control.\"\n\nNearly 20 years after this policy took effect, the principal author of that policy, Arkansas Republican Jay Dickey, conceded that he has \"regrets\" over the policy that came to be known as the Dickey Amendment.\n\nBut the policy remains in place anyway.\n\nThere's been some chatter lately about possible limits of the Dickey policy. Alex Azar, Donald Trump's new Secretary of Health and Human Services, suggested his agency may be able to do some research on guns and public health, current restrictions notwithstanding.\n\nThose comments have led GOP lawmakers to believe they can turn their attention elsewhere and leave the Dickey amendment in place, presumably indefinitely. What's unclear, however, is how far HHS can go and whether new legislation is necessary.\n\nWatch this space.\n\nPostscript: It's worth emphasizing that there is some private research on guns and public health, including a new report from the Rand Corp. which was just released. The Washington Post's Greg Sargent had a good piece this morning on the latest findings.",

                "body": "The staff churn in Donald Trump's White House is almost hard to believe. The Onion recently ran a satirical piece with a headline that read, \"White House Now Just Holding Continuous Going-Away Party For Departing Staffers.\" It struck a chord for a reason.\n\nBut as much as this president has hemorrhaged staffers, there's a reason the problem isn't even worse: some of those associated with Trump would love to leave, but they're finding it more difficult than expected. BuzzFeed reported yesterday:\n\nA former White House official said he's spoken with more aides inside the White House who are trying to leave the administration, but not necessarily getting the kinds of high-paying offers in the corporate world as former aides usually do.\n\n\"Things are still pretty bleak inside the White House,\" the source said. \"I've talked to several people in the last week trying to find a way out, but they can't get out because no one is really hiring people with Trump White House experience. Not a fun time to say the least.\"\n\nTraditionally, \"White House\" are two words that tend to stand out in a good way on a resume, especially among those looking for work in D.C. But there's a broad understanding that working in this White House isn't something one can credibly brag about.\n\nIndeed, it's quite common to see reports in which White House officials are characterized as almost pitiful. Time magazine recently had this item:\n\nWhite House aides prayed for rain. Inclement weather would mean President Donald Trump would have to take the motorcade to the waiting plane to Florida. That would mean he couldn't take the helicopter from the South Lawn to Joint Base Andrews, which meant he wouldn't walk in front of a few dozen waiting reporters who would of course ask him about Special Counsel Bob Mueller's indictments of 13 Russians for meddling in the 2016 elections.\n\n\"If anyone knows a rain dance,\" a senior White House official said in the hallway around midday Friday. She didn't finish the sentence.\n\nImagine working for a boss - who happens to be the leader of the free world - who's so erratic, you feel the need to pray for rain in the hopes he won't speak.\n\nThe same article added that Trump was pleased when Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted a series of Russian operatives who interfered in the American elections in 2016. Aides tried to tell him that he shouldn't feel any relief from the developments, but the president \"didn't want to hear it.\" So, White House officials communicated with their boss by going on Fox News \"to try to direct Trump toward a little less fanciful readings of the indictments.\"\n\nIs it any wonder the president's aides want to quit? Is it any wonder employers aren't interested?",

                "body": "It's not often that American presidents publicly praise international trade wars, which is probably why this overnight tweet from Donald Trump was seen as important across the globe.\n\n\"When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big. It's easy!\"\n\nIt's important to understand that Donald Trump lacks any kind of meaningful understanding of what trade deficits are and what they mean. Trade wars are not, in fact, \"good,\" and this president's economic illiteracy remains a serious national threat.\n\nBut for me, the two most important words in the presidential missive were actually the last two: \"It's easy!\"\n\nAs a candidate for the nation's highest office, despite lacking any experience in government or public service, Donald Trump repeatedly assured voters that every challenge has a simple solution, and the only reason policymakers hadn't yet implemented these easy solutions is that the nation is run by idiots. Elect Trump, he said, and he'd \"make possible every dream you've ever dreamed.\"\n\nImplicit in the promise was the belief in child-like simplicity. ISIS? Trump would bomb the terrorists, they'd die, and that would be that. Corruption? He'd \"drain the swamp.\" Health care? He'd cover everyone, offering better insurance for less money.\n\nIf you had a complex problem, Trump had an easy solution that could fit on a bumper sticker. After all, \"it's easy.\"\n\nAfter the election, effectively nothing changed. Indeed, Trump continues to respond to deeply intricate challenges like he's the blowhard at the end of the bar who's convinced he knows the solution to every problem. Opiods? Let's just execute drug dealers. Immigration? Let's just built a wall.\n\nAt his White House discussion with senators this week about gun violence, Trump said about proposed solutions, \"I don't understand why this hasn't happened. For the last 20 years, nothing's happened.\" He was being entirely literal: the president really doesn't understand, largely because he hasn't followed the debate and doesn't take the time to get up to speed on the basics.\n\nThe comments came a week after Trump argued that arming school teachers would prevent school shootings. \"Problem solved,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nExcept, responsible adults know that solving problems with overly simplified, knee-jerk ideas nearly always leads to failure. Our amateur president, however, continues to struggle with the complexities of his responsibilities, either unable or unwilling to recognize nuanced solutions.\n\nIssues like international trade are incredibly difficult, and yet, there's Trump, not only assuring the public that \"trade wars are good,\" but also insisting that winning is \"easy.\"\n\nThe sooner the president removes that word from his vocabulary, the better off we'll be.",

                "title": "Trump contradicts Pence once again, this time on guns",
                "body": "Donald Trump surprised much of the political world this week when he expressed support for law enforcement confiscating Americans' firearms without due process. But did you happen to catch what prompted the comment?\n\nVice President Mike Pence was talking providing law-enforcement officials with \"additional tools\" to deal with those who are reported to be a potential danger to themselves or others. Pence added:\n\n\"Allow due process, so that no one's rights are trampled, but the ability to go to court, obtain an order, and then collect not only the firearms, but any weapons in the possession of that individual.\"\n\nThat's when Trump interjected, dismissing Pence's concerns. \" Or, Mike, take the firearms first, and then go to court,\" the president said, complaining that due process \"takes so long.\" Trump added, \"I like taking the guns early.... So you could do exactly what you're saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.\"\n\nPence, likely confused, kept talking, effectively pretending he hadn't just heard what the president had said - because, really, what was the vice president supposed to say?\n\nIt was a bizarre moment for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was the fact that Pence keeps confronting moments like these in which Trump publicly contradicts him.\n\nAs regular readers may recall, the trouble started before they even took office. In the second presidential debate in 2016, ABC News' Martha Raddatz reminded Trump that his own running mate said, in the context of a discussion about U.S. policy in Syria, that \"provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength.\" In an unusual display, Trump denounced the position.\n\nIn fact, the then-Republican candidate said of Pence, \"He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.\"\n\nIt was the first hint that Trump didn't much care what his ostensible governing partner thinks. Last August, for example, Pence declared that when it comes to our country's policy toward Russia, the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress are \"speaking with a unified voice.\" Soon after, Trump himself denounced Congress' sanctions against Russia, effectively siding with Putin's government.\n\nDuring the fight over health care, Pence encouraged Senate Republicans to pass one kind of bill, while Trump recommended another. On North Korea, Pence rejected direct bilateral talks, while Trump endorsed them.\n\nEven on the Russia scandal, Pence said Trump didn't fire former FBI Director James Comey over the investigation, only to watch Trump say the opposite soon after.\n\nI'm not talking about private deliberations, in which there's back and forth between a president and top members his team. This is about public disagreements, in which the vice president, under the impression that he's articulating the administration's position, says one thing, only to have the president say something altogether different soon after.\n\nThe next time the vice president makes a declaration, give it a little time. His boss may have some thoughts to share on the matter.",

                "title": "Trump's new suggestion to address the opioid crisis: executions",
                "body": "Last weekend, Axios had a report that Donald Trump has privately expressed admiration for how Singapore deals with drug-trafficking offenses: the government executes those found guilty. The American president, the report said, has been \"telling friends for months\" that Singapore's model is effective.\n\nTrump \"doesn't just joke about it,\" Axios added. \"According to five sources who've spoken with Trump about the subject, he often leaps into a passionate speech about how drug dealers are as bad as serial killers and should all get the death penalty.... Trump has said he would love to have a law to execute all drug dealers here in America.\"\n\nIt's one thing to see an article like this, which quoted unnamed sources close to the president. It's something else when Trump effectively confirms the reporting.\n\nPresident Trump suggested that executing drug dealers could help solve the opioid crisis during a White House summit Thursday, an event the administration billed as a way to measure its progress in combating the nation's drug problem.\n\n\"Some countries have a very tough penalty, the ultimate penalty, and they have much less of a drug problem than we do,\" Trump said.\n\n\"You know, if you shoot one person, they give you life, they give you the death penalty,\" Trump added. \"These people can kill 2,000, 3,000 people and nothing happens to them.\"\n\nThis comes months after the Republican praised Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for his approach to dealing with drugs in his own country - an approach that involves relying on death squads to kill drug dealers.\n\nFor those concerned about Trump's authoritarian tendencies, this won't help.\n\nBut the problem isn't just the president's fondness for solving problems by killing people. While the White House tries to craft some kind of policy agenda to deal with the nation's opioid crisis, the fact that Trump seems to prefer \"very tough penalties\" tells us something important about what we can expect from the administration. Politico reported:\n\n\"It makes us all very nervous\" that the U.S. could move back to a \"penal-first approach,\" said Andrew Kessler, who leads Slingshot Solutions, a consulting firm specializing in behavioral health policy that advocates for substance abuse treatment and prevention. \"I have no love for high-level traffickers or cartels, but a very high percentage of people who sell drugs do it to support their own habit.\"\n\nHe and others said the government would be better offer treating people for addiction than imprisoning them.\n\n\"We have done the experiment with extreme mass incarceration to shrink the drug market and it failed,\" said Mark Kleiman, who leads the crime and justice program at New York University's Marron Institute of Urban Management. \"Between 1980 and today, the number of drug dealers behind bars has gone up by a factor of 30 and the prices of heroin and cocaine have fallen more than 90 percent. So the problem with putting drug dealers in prison is there is another drug dealer in there to take his place.\"\n\nTrump believes the best solution is a solution he can characterize as \"tough.\" For those interested in addressing a major challenge in effective and constructive ways, this isn't at all encouraging.",

                "body": "At his White House meeting with senators on Wednesday about gun policy, Donald Trump offered hearty praise for the National Rifle Association, but seemed eager to suggest he doesn't really care whether the NRA is satisfied with his agenda or not.\n\n\"They do have great power, I agree with that,\" the president said of the far-right group and its members. \"They have great power over you people. They have less power over me.\"\n\nAt one point during the discussion, when Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) explained his bipartisan background-check bill, Trump effectively mocked his ostensible ally, telling the Republican his proposal didn't deal with age limits \"because you're afraid of the NRA.\"\n\nSoon after, referring to no one in particular, the president added, \"Some of you people are petrified of the NRA.\"\n\nJust one day later, Trump welcomed NRA representatives into the Oval Office, and while we don't know exactly what was said, the far-right lobbying group certainly seemed pleased.\n\nThe top lobbyist for the National Rifle Association claimed late Thursday that President Trump had retreated from his surprising support a day earlier for gun control measures after a meeting with N.R.A. officials and Vice President Mike Pence in the Oval Office.\n\nThe lobbyist, Chris Cox, posted on Twitter just after 9 p.m. that he met with Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, saying that \"we all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don't want gun control. #NRA #MAGA.\"\n\nAround the same time, Trump boasted about the \"good (great) meeting\" he had with the NRA's lobbyist.\n\nThe New York Times' report noted that the twin messages \"suggest that it may have taken the gun rights group only a little over a day to persuade the president to back away from his apparent embrace of gun control during a remarkable, televised meeting on Wednesday with members of Congress.\"\n\nI think \"suggest\" is the right word under the circumstances, because Trump himself doesn't seem to know what he wants, or even intends, to do on gun policy.\n\nAfter the mass shooting in Parkland, he called for action, but stuck to vague generalities. When the president started pointing to specific ideas, the White House took steps to backtrack.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump seemed eager to embrace progressive reforms, bucking the NRA, only to meet privately with the NRA a day later, and apparently tell the group what it wanted to hear.\n\nOne of the more common criticisms of the president from public officials is that he invariably agrees with the last person he talks to, even if he said the opposite to the person before. There's no great mystery as to why this happens - Trump doesn't know or care about public policy - but on guns, he's going out of his way to prove that those criticisms are accurate.\n\nFor their part, Senate Democrats yesterday unveiled a package of reforms, including universal background checks and a debate on assault weapons, because these are the exact ideas the Republican president expressed support for a day earlier. In effect, the Dems' plan is a put-up-or-shut-up challenge to Trump.\n\nI think we know which option the president will choose.",

                "body": "Fairly early on in yesterday's White House meeting with senators on gun policy, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) mentioned the popularity of expanded background checks, despite the political resistance the issue has faced. \"You have a different president now,\" Donald Trump responded. \"You went through a lot of presidents and didn't get it done.... I think it's time that a president stepped up.\"\n\nSoon after, Trump asked Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) to summarize his 2013 background-check bill, which he co-sponsored with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). It led to this exchange:\n\nTRUMP: Do you have support for that, bipartisan support for what you're saying?\n\nTOOMEY: We had 54 votes in 2013. Most of those 54 voters are still in the Senate.\n\nTRUMP: And not a lot of presidential backup?\n\nTOOMEY: President Obama did support it.\n\nTRUMP: But that was your problem.\n\nIt was a confusing back and forth. Trump seemed to be suggesting that Barack Obama didn't step up to support the background-check bill. Told that the Democratic president was actually on board with the plan, Trump then suggested Obama's shouldn't have stepped up to support the bill.\n\nBut the broader point was nevertheless clear: in Trump's mind, Obama should've gotten Congress to pass new legislation to address gun violence, which creates an incentive for this president to do what Obama did not.\n\nIt was a point he returned to, more than once, insisting for example that Obama \"was not proactive in getting a bill signed.\" That's outrageously untrue, but Trump doesn't care: when congressional Republicans blocked bipartisan measures, that should be seen as an example of his predecessor's ineptitude.\n\nIt seems very easy to believe Trump offered unexpected rhetorical support for progressive priorities on guns precisely because they're priorities Obama couldn't get.\n\nBecause in this White House, every light is viewed through an Obama-centric lens.\n\nOn Tuesday, for example, the head of the National Security Agency says he has not been authorized by his boss - Donald Trump - to disrupt Russian cyberattacks targeting our elections. Asked about this, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders replied, \"Let's not forget that [the 2016 attack[ happened under Obama. It didn't happen under President Trump. If you want to blame somebody on past problems, then you need to look at the Obama administration.\"\n\nThe same day, Trump's Council of Economic Advisers published a report on economic growth - which blamed Obama for assorted ongoing areas of concern.\n\nA week earlier, we learned Trump takes great pride in showing off the Oval Office to White House visitors, apparently because Obama didn't.\n\nThe Washington Post reported, \"To hear President Trump tell it, he is tougher than former president Barack Obama. He is smarter than Obama - more shrewd, more effective, more respected. The 45th president is, by his own accounting, superlative to the 44th in almost every way. In private and in public, while devising policies and while crafting messages, Trump frequently draws flattering comparisons with his predecessor - and he does not let the truth intrude.\"\n\nAlas, this has been a staple of Trump's presidency. BuzzFeed published an interesting piece in August based on interviews with \"six top European government officials who've had firsthand dealings on the international stage with [Trump] and his administration.\" Not surprisingly, the foreign officials characterized the American president as erratic, ignorant, and \"something of a laughing stock among Europeans at international gatherings.\"\n\nBut what stood out for me was the description of Trump's obsession with his predecessor. \"It's his only real position,\" one European diplomat said. \"He will ask: 'Did Obama approve this?' And if the answer is affirmative, he will say: 'We don't.' He won't even want to listen to the arguments or have a debate. He is obsessed with Obama.\"\n\nAnd while that's plainly pathetic, it's consistent with everything we've seen from this president - who seems to think about Barack Obama far more than he should, accusing him of all sorts of weird things, including secretly tapping his phones.\n\nWhen was the last time we saw a president so preoccupied with his predecessor? It's as if Trump defines himself by his impressions of Obama, and part of him realizes he's not matching up well.",

                "title": "Did House Republicans leak a senator's texts to conservative media?",
                "body": "For much of the last year, there's been ample reason to believe the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee, led by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), is simply out of control. Nunes' partisan antics and sycophantic attitude toward Donald Trump have the once-respected committee a laughingstock.\n\nThere's news today that suggests the House panel is actually getting worse.\n\nTo quickly recap, Fox News reported several weeks ago that Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, made an effort to reach out to Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence official who wrote a dossier on Trump, through an intermediary. The story, based on text exchanges between Warner and D.C. lawyer Adam Waldman, proved to be meaningless, though the president briefly pretended the Democratic senator had been \"caught\" engaging in some kind of nefarious scheme.\n\nThe transparently dumb non-story, which even some Senate Republicans dismissed as nonsense, faded quickly, but there was a lingering question: how did Fox News get a hold of Warner's texts?\n\nThe New York Times published a report this morning that seems to answer that question in an unsettling way.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee has concluded that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee were behind the leak of private text messages between the Senate panel's top Democrat and a Russian-connected lawyer, according to two congressional officials briefed on the matter.\n\nSenator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the committee's Republican chairman, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat, were so perturbed by the leak that they demanded a rare meeting with Speaker Paul D. Ryan last month to inform him of their findings. They used the meeting with Mr. Ryan to raise broader concerns about the direction of the House Intelligence Committee under its chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, the officials said.\n\nLook, I'm aware of the whole \"politics ain't beanbag\" adage, and assorted partisan pugilists are occasionally going throw a punch. But when Republicans use the House Intelligence Committee to attack the Senate Intelligence Committee, it points to developments that are deeply unhealthy to our system of government.\n\nAnd while this reporting hasn't been independently verified by NBC News or MSNBC, the Times' report suggests there's no real doubt about what happened here.\n\nCopies of the messages were originally submitted by Mr. Waldman to the Senate committee. In January, one of Mr. Nunes's staff members requested that copies be shared with the House committee as well, according to a person familiar with the request who was not authorized to talk about it publicly. Days later, the messages were published by Fox News, the person said. Fox's report said that it had obtained the documents from a Republican source it did not name.\n\nThe documents published by Fox News appear to back up the senators' accusation. Though they were marked \"CONFIDENTIAL: Produced to USSSCI on a Confidential Basis,\" suggesting that they had come from the Senate panel, known as the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the person familiar with the congressional requests said that the stamp was misleading and that other markings gave away their actual origin.\n\nSpecifically, the copy of the messages shared with the Senate was paginated, and the one submitted to the House - while preserving the reference to the Senate committee - was unpaginated.\n\nNunes' spokesperson didn't deny the leak, but instead complained about the New York Times.\n\nI don't know when the House Intelligence Committee will recover from what Nunes has done to it, but I know it won't be anytime soon.",

Pritzker (D) and Daniel Biss (D) by double digits in hypothetical match-ups.\n\n* In Arizona, right-wing Senate hopeful Joe Arpaio (R) believes he may have a supernatural connection with Donald Trump. \"I can read his mind without even talking to him. I think he may be reading mine,\" Arpaio said. \"Is there something that goes through the airwaves? Mental telepathy?\" I'll assume that was a rhetorical question.\n\n* And in California, with Rep.

                "body": "Last summer, during one of the White House's many \"infrastructure weeks,\" Trump unveiled his only meaningful infrastructure idea of 2017. As the president saw it, the nation needed to privatize its system of air-traffic control, and the White House organized a fake signing ceremony to help generate some interest in the idea.\n\nIt didn't work. Congress rejected Trump's idea quickly.\n\nThis year, however, offered the White House a new opportunity to get infrastructure right, and in early February, Team Trump unveiled a long-awaited blueprint on the issue, which was surprisingly awful. Three weeks later, as Reuters reported, the president's plan already looks dead.\n\nThe U.S. Senate's second highest-ranking Republican on Tuesday expressed doubt that Congress will pass legislation to increase infrastructure spending this year, citing time constraints.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters: \"I think it will (be) challenging. I certainly would be happy if we could, but we've got a lot of things to do, that being one of them, and I don't know if we will have time to get to that,\" according to a transcript from his office.\n\nPresident Donald Trump wants Congress to approve $200 billion in federal spending over 10 years designed to spur $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nThere are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, the White House's arithmetic still doesn't make any sense, and there's literally no reason to think $200 billion in federal spending - redirected from other priorities - would spur $1.5 trillion in investments.\n\nSecond, Cornyn may want to blame the calendar, but there's reason for skepticism. Congress has some spending packages to work on, but if lawmakers wanted to make infrastructure a priority, they could. Heck, they wrote, debated, and passed a $1.5 trillion tax plan over the course of a few weeks - which suggests if they could make time for infrastructure if they really wanted to.\n\nBut they don't, in large part because Trump's blueprint is a joke.\n\nPostscript: What about the president's ongoing desire to privatize air-traffic control, splitting it off from the FAA? Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) acknowledged this week that the House is shelving the idea.",

                "title": "It's a new day for Republican rhetoric toward law enforcement",
                "body": "Donald Trump caused a bit of a stir yesterday with a tweet directed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, calling it \"disgraceful\" that Sessions isn't going further \"to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse.\" In reality, those abuses don't appear to exist, but there was an underlying truth that went largely overlooked.\n\nThe president, in this case, was targeting the FBI. Trump believes it was federal law enforcement that unfairly targeted his political operation, and it's FBI officials whom Trump wants the Justice Department to target.\n\nA day earlier, members of the House Republican leadership spoke with reporters and fielded a series of questions about gun violence. GOP leaders directed much of their criticism to law enforcement.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), for example, said of the Parkland shooting, \"In this particular case, there were a lot of breakdowns, from the local law enforcement to the FBI getting tips that they didn't follow up on.\" House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) added, \"I think what angered me the most is when I see breakdowns with law enforcement.\"\n\nA day earlier, much of the country heard about Trump boasting that he would've confronted the Parkland gunman with his bare hands, but did you happen to catch the comments that immediately preceded that claim?\n\n\"The way [local law enforcement] performed was, frankly, disgusting. They were listening to what was going on. The one in particular, he was then - he was early. And then you had three others that probably a similar deal a little bit later, but a similar kind of a thing.\n\n\"You know, I really believe - you don't know until you test it - but I really believe I'd run in there, even if I didn't had a weapon. And I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too, because I know most of you. But the way they performed was really a disgrace.\"\n\nIn 2009, Barack Obama said a Boston-area police officer acted \"stupidly\" when he arrested Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his own home. It sparked months of outrage and years of conservative claims about the Democratic president being \"hostile\" toward the police. The incident served as a reminder of why law enforcement is so often aligned with Republican politics.\n\nNearly a decade later, however, the politics have changed. Suddenly, it's Republican leaders who are blasting law enforcement in ways we're not accustomed to.\n\nFor all his talk about \"law and order,\" Trump has spent much of his presidency targeting law enforcement in stunning ways, including firing U.S. attorneys under unusual circumstances, firing an acting U.S. Attorney General who dared to give the White House sound legal advice, and firing the director of the FBI in the hopes of derailing an ongoing investigation. It's just part of an extended, months-long presidential campaign against federal law enforcement.\n\nBut he's not alone. The NRA's Wayne LaPierre targeted the FBI in his speech last week at the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC), and plenty of other speakers at the same event did the same thing. NBC News reported the other day, \"The Conservative Political Action Conference has an enemies list: the FBI, the Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller.\"\n\nThere's no great mystery here: the more a Republican president faces legal jeopardy, the more Republican politicians feel the need to protect their president by going after those who enforce the law. About a month ago, the Washington Post reported:\n\nRepublican leaders' open defiance last week of the FBI over the release of a hotly disputed memo revealed how the GOP, which has long positioned itself as the party of law and order, has become an adversary of federal law enforcement as the party continues its quest to protect President Trump from the Russia investigation.\n\nThe FBI, the Justice Department and other agencies are now under concerted assault by Republicans, facing allegations of corruption and conspiracy that have quickly moved from the fringes of the right into the mainstream of the GOP.\n\nThe same day, Politico reported that the right has \"learned to hate the FBI,\" which in turn has \"upended the longstanding norms of Washington.\"\n\nThere are elements of this that we don't yet know. Will Republicans shift their posture after the Trump era ends? Will law enforcement overlook the GOP's offensive as a temporary blip?\n\nTime, obviously, will tell, but in the meantime, the traditional ties between Republican politics and law enforcement appear to be fraying in ways that would've been hard to predict in the recent past.",

                "body": "About a month ago, The Rachel Maddow Show was the first to report the creation of the Patriot Legal Expense Fund Trust LLC. Details have been scarce, but as Donald Trump's Russia scandal has intensified, and so many people in the president's orbit have lawyered up, Trump World saw the need for a legal defense fund to help pay for the legal fees.\n\nThere was no public announcement about the fund being established, but on Tuesday, the paperwork was filed in Delaware, and he Patriot Legal Expense Fund Trust LLC came into existence.\n\nThere are all kinds of questions surrounding the fund, and the Washington Post picked up on the fact that no one on Team Trump seems eager to answer them.\n\nA new legal defense fund designed to help defray the costs faced by aides to President Trump drawn into the various Russia investigations has yet to answer key questions regarding how it will vet donors and provide transparency about the contributors who finance the effort.\n\nThe trust plans to allow both individuals and \"entities\" to make unlimited donations that will be pooled to defray the costs of multiple recipients, according to paperwork filed in January with the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nAt first blush, the creation of the fund may not seem especially noteworthy. The Russia scandal has cast quite a net over much of Trump World, and I'm sure many of the president's aides could use some financial assistance paying defense attorneys' bills.\n\nBut given this gang's lax approach to ethics and legal proprieties, it'd be helpful to know who's contributing to the fund, how it will distribute money, who might be deemed ineligible for assistance, and what the fund will do to ensure compliance with conflict-of-interest rules.\n\nAt least for now, those are the questions no one is answering - and it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nJust this week, for example, the Trump Organization said it would \"donate\" its foreign profits to avoid legal trouble for the president. The Washington Post reported, however, that the Trump Organization hasn't said how much money it donated. Or how it arrived at the figure. Or which foreign governments originally paid the president's businesses. Or which parts of the president's private-sector enterprise were included.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump still won't release his tax returns. Trump's White House won't release its visitor logs. Trump's Florida resort has gone to court to keep its customer list secret. Trump's White House even tries to obscure his golfing habits.\n\nDuring the debate over the \"Nunes memo,\" White House officials said they were eager to release classified information in the interest of \"transparency.\" The irony was rich.",

                "body": "US President Donald Trump takes part in a listening session on gun violence with teachers and students in the State Dining Room of the White House on...\n\nCongressional Republicans aren't at all eager to pass meaningful gun measures, which is one of the reasons the right is so upset about Donald Trump's discussion at the White House yesterday: the president explicitly endorsed a \"comprehensive\" approach.\n\nBut it's worth pausing to appreciate exactly what Trump said and why.\n\n\"I like that word, comprehensive,\" Trump said. \"They say it is a bad word. I like the word. I would rather have a comprehensive bill. ... It would be really nice to create something that's beautiful.\"\n\nThe president was being quite literal. It's not that he likes the component elements of a comprehensive bill on gun safety; rather, he likes the word \"comprehensive\" as a branding label he can apply to legislation.\n\nIn fact, earlier in the same meeting with senators yesterday, Trump made clear he has preferences when it comes to bill names. He noted pending legislation on improving the NICS database, and added, \"It would be nice if we could add everything on to it and maybe change the title, all right? The 'U.S. Background Check Bill' or whatever.\"\n\nBecause for this president, the title of the proposal is no small matter. He seemed to lack even a rudimentary understanding of the policies at hand, but what a bill might be named captured Trump's attention.\n\nThis might be less jarring if it weren't so common. During the debate over the Republican tax plan, Trump referenced something called a border adjustment tax, which some GOP leaders intended to use to help pay for the package. \"Anytime I hear 'border adjustment,' I don't love it,\" the president said.\n\nAs we discussed at the time, that led many to believe the White House was, at best, skeptical of the idea, but that wasn't quite right Trump was being quite literal: when he heard the words \"border adjustment,\" he didn't like it, not because he doubted the policy on the merits, but because he wasn't comfortable with the phrase itself.\n\nThe problem also arose during the health care fight. At one point in early March, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke about the GOP's prooposal, and the president said he had had a problem: Ryan had used the word \"buckets\" to describe the additional steps of reform that would follow the initial legislation. \"I don't like that word buckets,\" Trump reportedly said, preferring \"phases.\"\n\nThe House Speaker obliged, but the anecdote was telling. Trump's focus was on branding and sales pitches, not substance. As yesterday helped make clear, this hasn't changed.\n\nA year ago this week, Trump boasted at a meeting with business leaders, Trump \"I'm good at branding.\" That may be true, but is he good at anything else?",
