                "body": "People would be more inclined to unplug from the service if they realized just how much of their data is being shared, he said.\n\nFacebook is facing a backlash from its users and investors, after the company failed to disclose that millions of profiles were used by a third party during the presidential campaign without their consent.\n\nCo-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence this Wednesday, followed by COO Sheryl Sandberg in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. Both executives apologized and said they were open to tighter regulation.\n\nBut was their apology too little too late? Recode managing editor Ed Lee thinks so.\n\n\"We found out they knew about some of the misuse of data from a few years ago. They just didn't tell anyone they knew that,\" Lee told CNBC's \"On the Money\" in an interview.\n\n\"We knew about this because some enterprising reporters started digging into how this data was used,\" he added. \"And that tells us there might be a lot of other places, third parties that are using the data incorrectly or improperly.\"\n\nMore than 2 billion people use Facebook on a monthly basis, according to the company. And in the U.S. more than 80 percent of people age 18-59 are on the platform, according to a 2017 survey by Statista.\n\nResearchers estimate that Facebook will generate $21 billion in ad revenue this year, up almost 17 percent from 2017. Yet it's still an open question as to whether the news will be enough to deter people from using the platform en masse.\n\n\"I think intellectually people realize, 'Oh it's a free service, I understand that I'm giving up something in exchange for that,'\" Lee told CNBC.\n\n\"But if you were presented with the specifics of how they were used, I think people would probably flee in terms of 'I don't like how Facebook is using it,\" he added.\n\nWhen it comes to regulation, the tech editor said regulators will be looking at social media and digital privacy across the board.\n\n\"It's not just a Facebook problem. It became a Facebook problem first, because they collect the most data,\" he said. \"Unlike Google or Twitter who figures out who you are based on sites you visit, Facebook specifically knows your name, your birthday, where you live - and because of that they have the most prized set of data.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Lee said there are several steps Facebook users should take to understand what information is being shared with third parties.\n\n\"If you go into your Facebook profile, go to settings, there are lots of ways to turn things off in terms of how the data is used for advertising. If you are really concerned, turn all those things off,\" Lee said.\n\nHe also warns users to be aware of websites and apps that use a Facebook Login. \"If you're concerned about those things, don't login with your Facebook ID, create a separate one specific to that app.\" Lee said if the website or app only requires a Facebook ID - don't use it.\n\nHowever, if you are willing to sign up with a Facebook login, Lee says you should pay attention to how that company plans to use your data - which will be included in the notices he admits most people never read.\n\nOn the Money airs on CNBC Saturdays at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets.",

                "body": "Global markets were sent sharply lower this week, as fears of a trade war sent shockwaves across global financial markets.\n\nAmid the turmoil, some market participants think emerging markets are a value play to consider. Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA, said developing economies' stocks are a good buy, even in the midst of short-term headwinds.\n\nEarlier this year, Keon took down some of his overweight position in U.S. equities, and upped his exposure to emerging markets.\n\n\"After underperforming for several years in a row, and having a decent year last year, emerging markets still look like pretty good values for us. So we are overweight emerging markets across our multi-asset portfolios,\" Keon told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Friday.\n\nLooking at classic metrics like price-to-book ratios, and trailing and forward price-earnings ratios, Keon said that emerging market equities present a better value at these levels than those in the U.S.\n\nOne large emerging markets exchange-traded fund, the EEM, carries a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.4; that compares to 16.5 on the S&P 500 Index. The EEM, comprised most heavily of Asian equities like Tencent, Samsung and Alibaba, and in 2017 posted its best year since 2009.\n\n\"Across the various metrics, emerging markets look cheaper. They always look cheaper compared to other established markets, on raw measures,\" Keon said.\n\n\"But even adjusting for their normal discounts, I think you get better value, generally, in emerging markets than you do in developed now,\" he added, referring to the relative risk emerging economies sometimes carry relative to more established markets.\n\nKeon contended that while the prospect of rising interest rates in the U.S. stands to hurt emerging market equities in the short-term, the broader issue is whether a global trade war will break out.\n\nJust as in essentially every corner of the global equity market, Keon said, \"there has been a new bout of uncertainty so far this year. But I think when you net it all out, I think the story for this year will be the great rise in earnings in the United States and global growth overall.\n\nHe added: \"I think you'll see that equities will end up having a pretty good year, but clearly right now there is a great deal of uncertainty in the market.\"",

                "body": "Supermodel Chrissy Teigen announced on Saturday she will stop using Snapchat, making her the latest in a rash of celebrities to speak out against the embattled social media platform.\n\nIn a tweet to her nearly 10 million followers, she cited Snap's much-maligned redesign and a controversial ad that made light of domestic violence as reasons behind her departure.\n\n\"I stopped using snap. The update, the constant complaints of people not being able to find me, plus the Rihanna poll...no bueno,\" the celebrity wife of musician John Legend wrote on Twitter.\n\nHer tweet received more than 8,000 likes, 715 retweets and 156 comments, many of them supportive of her move.\n\n@tyleroakley tweet\n\n@slwein tweet\n\nTeigen is just the latest celebrity to speak out against Snapchat.\n\nIn February, Snapchat's parent company, Snap, lost more than $1 billion in market capitalization after reality star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner tweeted her disapproval of the app's new redesign. Many have criticized the app redesign for blurring separate features together and promoting sponsored content.\n\nSnap came under celebrity fire again in March, after screenshots of an ad for a third party app began circulating the internet. The ad, which gave users the option to slap Rihanna or punch Chris Brown, was widely criticized for making light of domestic violence.\n\n@TheRoyceMann tweet\n\nRihanna later made a statement on her Instagram account about the ad.\n\n\"All the women, children and men that have been victims of [domestic violence] in the past and especially the ones who haven't made it out yet ... you let us down! Shame on you,\" Rihanna wrote in an Instagram story.\n\nSnap issued an apology, but was still criticized for failing to properly filter the ad's content. Shares of Snap lost more than 7 percent over two days following the controversy.\n\nSnap has largely remained on the sidelines as social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter increasingly struggle with quality control and content filtering. Snap's revised business model and app redesign puts renewed emphasis on advertising.",

                "title": "This wedding savings strategy comes with added risk",
                "body": "Cutting your wedding costs by avoiding \"wedding season\" may be easier said than done.\n\nIn a recent Student Loan Hero survey, 8 in 10 couples planning to get married in the next year said they would be willing to choose a \"less-preferable wedding date\" if it would save money. That includes looking at weekdays and off-season months.\n\nNo wonder: New data from planning site WeddingWire finds that the average wedding, including the engagement ring and honeymoon, cost $36,000 in 2017. The ceremony and reception alone were $27,000.\n\nAlthough both figures are $1,000 less than in 2016, they still represent a chunk of money.\n\nYet there are still signs couples are overspending. WeddingWire also found that couples underestimated their budget by 42 percent, while Student Loan Hero notes that 74 percent plan to take on debt to cover their wedding bills.\n\nLooking at wedding-date trends, it seems like there are clear peaks and valleys in popularity. (See graphic below.)\n\nAnd the potential savings can be enticing.\n\nFor example, in Hudson Valley, New York, site fees can range from $5,000 to $15,000 during the peak fall season, said wedding planner Angela Christoforo, owner of Elite Wedding & Event Planning. A winter wedding could trim 20 percent to 30 percent off the venue bill, she said, and other vendors may run winter or off-peak specials, as well.\n\nWedding planner Janice Carnevale, owner of Bellwether Events in Washington, D.C., said she's seen a slow growth in couples looking to host weddings Mondays through Thursdays. That shift can help couples bring a desired venue into budget by avoiding high weekend food and drink minimums, or increase the chance of a venue or vendor's availability even in a peak season.\n\n\"In D.C., your venue is one of the most expensive pieces of the budget puzzle,\" Carnevale said, with costs ranging from $8,000 to $20,000. \"If you're looking to reduce that by a third, then a Thursday night might be the way you do that.\"\n\nBut experts caution that going off-peak for your wedding is a tactic rife with potential pitfalls. Here's what to consider before you save the date.\n\nA vendor's underlying costs contribute to how much give there is (or isn't) in offering a deal for off-peak timing.\n\n\"The price of tilapia doesn't care if you're getting married in January, or on a Thursday,\" Carnevale said. \"And people who get hourly wages get paid the same rate regardless of what time of the year or day of the week it is.\"\n\nHigher costs for other items can also offset savings. Flower costs, for example, can be pricier for a winter wedding if your desired blooms aren't in season and need to be imported, she said.\n\nKeep in mind that deals may not be advertised, or offered up with the regular price list -- especially if you make a general price inquiry or initially ask about a prime season or date, Christoforo said. (This is also where your bargaining skills, or those of a wedding planner, can come in handy.)\n\n\"It's always good to ask if there's an off-peak rate,\" she said.\n\nBroadly speaking, winter is a less popular time to get married; however, planners warn that off-seasons vary by market. And there may not be a slow time at all.\n\n\"For wedding locations that are popular wedding destinations -- think Hawaii or Southern California -- or locations where the weather is nice all year round, slow seasons as far as weddings are concerned are basically nonexistent,\" said Christina Farrow, president and co-founder of planning site AislePlanner.com, who previously ran a wedding planning firm in Hawaii.\n\nEven in a generally quiet season, there can be competition from other local events like conferences and sports games that tie up venues and vendors, reducing your odds of scoring a deal, said Carnevale.\n\n\"People think December is off-peak for weddings, and it is,\" she said. \"But it's peak for holiday parties.\"\n\nSkipping Miami's peak tourist season can cut your hotel and venue costs in half, but there are distinct trade-offs to a summer or fall wedding in the area, said wedding blogger Dara Smith of TheFirstLookBlog.com. Stifling heat and humidity aside, off-season also overlaps with hurricane season, the rainy season and mosquito season.\n\nWinter storms can create a host of problems, from power outages affecting the venue to bridal party members, guests and vendors unexpectedly unable to travel in, said Anne Chertoff, trends expert for WeddingWire. And picking a weeknight wedding can reduce the number of family and friends able and willing to attend.\n\nYou'll have to weigh the risk-reward of picking that less-desirable date.\n\nSome issues can be worked around with planning. Smith said she often talks to couples thinking about a summer destination wedding in Miami about avoiding an outdoor, afternoon ceremony, asking the venue about contingencies such as fans, and being flexible with photo timing to avoid midafternoon rain showers. Also key: Dig into venue and vendor policies.\n\n\"Definitely go through all the scenarios,\" Smith said. \"What's the emergency clause ... if there's a hurricane and everyone evacuates? Do you get all your money back?\"\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nHow much you really need to earn to take home six figures\n\nRev up your tax savings with these filing tips\n\nThis is why you shouldn't wait until the last minute to file your taxes\n\nWedding insurance can be cheap way to buy peace of mind, Chertoff said. Rates are based on factors such as the cost of the wedding, with coverage kicking in to cover nonrefundable costs related to natural disasters as well as other wedding woes, such as a vendor going out of business.\n\nSome downsides, such as a slimmer guest list, also have their own advantages for couples looking for a more intimate, less pricey affair.\n\n\"It's the guest list that's really going to determine how much you're spending on your wedding,\" Chertoff said. \"Cutting one table of people could save you thousands of dollars.\"",

Gen. H.R. McMaster.\n\nTrump characterized the tumultuous period for White House job security as being part of a larger plan. \"We're getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want,\" Trump said after Tillerson was fired March 13.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC when asked what the new staff changes could mean for Trump's second year in office.\n\nWhile each of the erstwhile officials brought unique skill sets and worldviews to the Trump administration, all three appointments chafed against Trump's views and personality in distinct ways.\n\nThe new recruits diverge from their predecessors on ideology, experience and style. Here's how:\n\nReports of Tillerson's acrimonious relationship with Trump were a near-constant feature of the Texas oilman's tenure in the White House.\n\nTheir bad blood may have boiled over following a White House leak that claimed Tillerson called Trump a \"moron.\" But both men also held different views on policy matters.\n\nTillerson clashed with Trump over the president's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, for instance. And Trump publicly rebuked him in October over his approach to North Korea. The president tweeted that his top diplomat was \"wasting his time\" trying to communicate with Kim Jong Un.\n\nTrump tweet Rocket Man\n\nCiting a senior State Department official, NBC News reported that Tillerson learned of his firing on March 13 only after Trump tweeted his congratulations to Tillerson's appointed successor, CIA Director Mike Pompeo.\n\nTrump tweet Pompeo\n\nPompeo's policy views appear to align much more closely with Trump's, especially on Russia.\n\nPompeo echoed the White House position that Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election had no effect on the outcome. But the document he cited -- a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence -- said the intelligence community \"did not make an assessment of the impact\" of Russian meddling.\n\nTillerson, on the other hand, said in February that Russia is already interfering in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nOne of Tillerson's final acts in the Trump administration was to quickly accept the conclusions of U.S. and British intelligence that Russia likely carried out the attempted assassination of an ex-Russian spy living in London. Tillerson said Russia was \"clearly\" behind the nerve agent attack long before Trump himself addressed it.\n\nPompeo has also firmly established himself as a critic of the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has called \"the worst deal ever\" and sought to dismantle.\n\nBut the biggest difference between Pompeo and Tillerson may be based not on policy, but on the ability to run a government agency.\n\nTillerson had no prior diplomatic experience when he left his job as the CEO of Exxon Mobil to join the Trump administration. Pompeo, however, boasts decades of experience in politics, and could be better suited to run the State Department for that reason, The Atlantic argued.\n\nWall Street rejoiced when Trump picked Cohn as his top economic advisor. Likewise, it lamented his resignation in March.\n\nA former Goldman Sachs executive, Cohn supported lowering taxes, limiting regulations and creating a more hospitable economic climate for corporations -- all policies that thrilled finacial markets.\n\nTrump had long established himself as a business-friendly candidate, and Cohn's appointment appeared to follow through on that commitment.\n\nTrump and Cohn reached an impasse, however, after the president announced broad, global tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum in March. A free-trade advocate, Cohn had argued against tariffs in a February meeting with the president and industry executives, according to a person in the room.\n\nHe resigned less than a week after Trump announced the tariffs.\n\nBut Cohn's replacement, longtime CNBC pundit Larry Kudlow, shares many of Cohn's economic views. Like Cohn, Kudlow is pro-free trade and pro-tax cuts, and he criticized Trump's protectionist reflexes just days before the president asked him to join the administration. Kudlow also informally advised Trump during his campaign.\n\nKudlow's main distinction from Cohn is his friendship with Trump. Kudlow and Trump are both former television hosts and personal friends. Kudlow has also indicated a willingness to bend in Trump's direction on trade.\n\nBut Kudlow could still put up a fight as the director of Trump's National Economic Council, if his recent tweets are any indication:\n\nKudlow Watch Milton Friedman Refute Steel Protectionists Back in 1978\n\nMcMaster, an accomplished Army general known for his searing analysis of military strategy during the Vietnam War, drew praise from Republicans and Democrats alike as a solid choice to become Trump's national security advisor.\n\nHowever, the announcement on Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace McMaster received a very different response.\n\n\"You can say one thing for the former UN Ambassador,\" wrote retired Army Lt. Col. Daniel L. Davis in an op-ed for CNBC. \"He has been consistent throughout his career. Consistently wrong, that is.\"\n\nBolton, who served under President George W. Bush's administration, is known for his hawkish military views. Even in areas where McMaster and Bolton ostensibly agree, the new national security advisor appears to take a more uncompromising stance.\n\nWhile McMaster has called the nuclear deal with Iran \"fundamentally flawed,\" for instance, CNN reported in October that Democratic lawmakers \"sensed\" that the general was not willing to end the entire agreement.\n\nBolton, on the other hand, wrote in a 2015 New York Times op-ed that \"Iran will not negotiate away its nuclear program\" and that \"only military action... can accomplish what is required.\"\n\nAnd in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Bolton laid out a case for pre-emptively attacking North Korea. The February article, written less than a month before he accepted Trump's job offer, came just before the White House made the decision forward with the possibility of an in-person meeting between Trump and North Korea's dictator.\n\nBolton's hawkish views appear to put him at odds with some of Trump's rhetoric during the campaign, such as the then-candidate's heated criticism for the Iraq War, which Bolton says he still supports.\n\nYet Trump still values Bolton's advice, the president reportedly told Bolton in a White House meeting, \"We need you in here, John.\"\n\n--CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this report.",

                "title": "You're probably paying more for your car loan or mortgage than you should",
                "body": "The Federal Reserve makes headlines from New York to Hong Kong anytime it lifts its benchmark interest rate. Rightfully so, as any increase tends to drive up borrowing costs on everything from credit cards to auto loans and mortgages.\n\nThere's a more important factor that determines how much you'll pay when you borrow money to buy a car or home, and it's entirely in your hands: it's the lender you choose. That's because how much a lender might charge you for a loan can vary dramatically from one to the next. That's why it pays to shop around.\n\nMy research on auto loans shows that most consumers don't do that, which can cost them hundreds or even thousands of dollars over the life of a loan or lead them to purchase a lower-quality car than initially planned.\n\nMore from The Conversation:\n\nWhy union members earn higher wages than their non-union colleagues\n\nWhy do gun-makers get special economic protection?\n\nPoor people are penalised for borrowing to make ends meet - a new alliance gives them another way\n\nFortunately, it's pretty easy to avoid that.\n\nMost of us shop until we drop for price bargains on clothes, computers or virtually anything else. With the internet, finding the best deal among products and companies is easier than ever.\n\nA recent survey found that 92 percent of consumers are always looking for the best deal when they're out shopping, while 80 percent said they're willing to go out of their way to find a bargain.\n\nSo you'd think this logic would carry over to the bigger purchases in life. For most Americans, automobiles are the largest- or second-largest household asset they own. And most cars are purchased with the help of an auto loan.\n\nAnd yet, while people often work hard to find the best possible deal on the price of a car, surprisingly most fail to shop around at all for interest rate bargains. Research shows this behavior isn't limited to just auto loans - most people don't shop around when taking out a mortgage or a personal loan.\n\nAnd that's even though financing costs for a typical loan can make up a significant proportion of the total cost of buying a car. For example, let's assume you're buying a US$25,000 car and financing the entire purchase. A $25,000 loan at a 4 percent rate would cost you $2,600 in interest over its life, adding more than 10 percent to the true price of the car.\n\nLet me explain how a lender arrives at a particular interest rate.\n\nThe lender usually starts with a benchmark rate, such as the prime rate or even a U.S. Treasury bond, both of which tend to move up and down along with the Fed's target rate.\n\nOther variables that go into the rate you ultimately pay include borrower-specific risks like credit scores or your debt-to-income ratio and the lender's markup, which can be influenced by a variety of factors. For secured loans, such as mortgages and auto loans, the size of the down payment and the value of the asset will make a difference.\n\nNot all lenders will price the same loan, for the same borrower, the same way. In fact, a bit more than half of all borrowers overpay on their car loans.\n\nThat's the surprising conclusion of a recent study I conducted with Brigham Young finance professors Bronson Argyle and Taylor Nadauld. We arrived at our findings, after reviewing data provided by software-services firm Visible Equity on more than 2 million auto loans extended by 326 different financial institutions.\n\nThe data allowed us to compare interest rates on car loans that originated in the same metropolitan area and time period for similar amounts on similarly priced cars and to borrowers with similar credit attributes.\n\nWe found that almost 1 in 5 consumers take out a loan more than 2 percentage points higher than the best rate available to people with similar credit scores.\n\nFor example, Mark from Nashville with a credit score of 711 agreed to pay a rate of 5.85 percent to buy a used 2012 Toyota Camry for $18,033 -- which was the average loan size in our study. A different bank in the area, however, offered Jamie a rate of 4.2 percent for roughly the same loan, even though she had the same credit. In other words, Mark will end up overpaying by about $1,000 over the life of the loan, or about $17 every month.\n\nContrast that with the likely consequence of the Fed raising rates by a quarter point this month, which would have much less impact on your cost to get a loan. If an auto loan were to go up by 0.25 percentage point, monthly payments on that typical car loan would rise by just $2 a month, or $120 over five years.\n\nFurther, we found that many car buyers who end up overpaying cope by buying older, cheaper cars rather than shop around for a better interest rate. Had the borrower shopped around for a better rate, he could have spent most of that $1,000 in extra financing on a higher-quality car.\n\nThe same lessons apply to other loans too. A government survey found that failing to shop around for the best mortgage rate could easily cost you $3,500 over just the first five years of the loan and thousands more over the typical mortgage.\n\nWhat accounts for this apparently lackadaisical attitude toward interest rate shopping?\n\nApplying for credit often involves paperwork, which can be tedious or stressful. It could require a trip to a separate lender's office when buying a car is time consuming enough. Borrowers may not even know that there are better deals to be had.\n\nIn fact, we found that a consumer needs only to shop around for three offers to get something pretty close to the best available rate.\n\nOther faulty assumptions may be at play, too, including the notion that you have to finance your car through the dealer (you don't), that your own bank will give you the best deal (often not, according to our data), that the dealer's rate will be best (not always), or that your credit score will be affected if you apply multiple places (it won't).\n\nPart of the problem also seems to be that consumers often don't appreciate the power of compound interest and the extent to which small differences in monthly payments add up.\n\nAdmittedly, it's not as exciting to shop for a loan as it is to test-drive a car, but most of these factors can be overcome or shouldn't be a concern in the first place. While it does take a little more work to seek out other financing options, modern tools make it easier than you might think. Much of the same financial paperwork can be used at multiple lenders, and websites like Bankrate, Credit Karma and NerdWallet allow you to compare multiple interest rate offers.\n\nThe bottom line: Car buyers are literally paying more for less by not doing their due diligence to find the best financing deals. When it comes to credit, it pays to shop around.\n\nChristopher Palmer is an assistant professor of finance at MIT Sloan School of Management.\n\nLike this story?

The route also takes in the Trump International Hotel. President Donald Trump was in Florida for the weekend; a motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning.\n\nAfter the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, students have tapped into a current of pro-gun control sentiment that has been building for years -- yet still faces a powerful counterpoint from supporters of gun rights. Organizers hope the passions of the crowds and the under-18 roster of speakers will translate into a tipping point starting in the midterm elections this year.\n\nPeople flocked, too, to a \"March for Our Lives\" event near the Parkland school where the massacre happened. Police presence was heavy as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in. Eden Kinlock, 17, came from 20 miles away to pass out water, \"a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\" Many Parkland students came to the Washington rally.\n\nWashington is generally nonchalant about protests, but Saturday's gathering prompted more attention and speculation than usual. The protesters, many of them high school students, claim that the youth leadership of this initiative is what will set it apart from previous attempts to enact stronger gun-control legislation.\n\nPolls indicate that public opinion nationwide may indeed be shifting on an issue that has simmered for generations, and through dozens of mass shootings.\n\nA new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the United States should be tightened. That's up from 61 percent who said the same in October of 2016 and 55 percent when the AP first asked the question in October of 2013. Overall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun control laws.\n\nBut even with claims of historic social momentum on the issue of gun control, the AP poll also found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action. Among the questions facing march organizers and participants will be how to translate this one-day event, regardless of turnout, into meaningful legislative change.\n\nOne way is by channeling the current energy into the midterm congressional elections this fall. Students in Florida have focused on youth voter registration and there will be a registration booth at the Saturday rally.",

                "body": "You may not remember the name, but you probably remember the feeling you got when you saw \"Hi Stranger.\"\n\nThe stop motion animation features a skinny nude doll soothingly talking directly to the viewer while a gentle melody plays in the background.\n\nAlthough jarring at first, it's meant to be supportive -- and with 2.4 million views on Vimeo and a coveted \"Staff Pick\" designation, people are captivated. It was covered by The Telegraph and Jezebel. Even \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" did a parody version featuring a cartoon President Donald Trump.\n\nThe character was inspired by a year of going to therapy, her interest in ASMR videos, and being \"creatively exhausted,\" creator Kirsten Lepore said.\n\n\"It was really fun to try out this weird experiment to see if it would work and it would resonate with people,\" Lepore said. \"I was really shocked actually when it took off the way it did. I guess people really identified with this character.\"\n\nVimeo's Staff Picks highlight notable work on the platform, giving them more exposure and notoriety -- and an average of 100,000 views. Out of the more than 600 Staff Picked Vimeo creators, 72 percent said it lead to them receiving paid work.\n\nLepore, who has won the honor five times, said all of hers have led to jobs including Google Doodles, an ad for Motorola, a clip for \"Yo Gabba Gabba,\" and an upcoming project for Belvedere Vodka.\n\n\"The internet has been huge in helping filmmakers from all different walks of life get their work out there and get it seen,\" she explained. \"For better or for worse, it's because no one is seeing you. People just see a name or a screen name or an alias. It kind of keeps things sort of anonymous. It's kind of nice that way. People aren't judging you on what you look like or your gender anything like that. They just see the work, and take it at face value.\"\n\nLepore started making stop-motion videos at 10 after her father lent her their family camcorder. After going to college for experimental animation at Maryland College Institute of Art in Baltimore, Maryland and getting her master's in the same subject at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California, she found herself with a body of work. Finding it hard to secure traditional distribution especially for her shorts, she began uploading her high-definition clips in 2008 to Vimeo.\n\nShe soon got her first Staff Pick for \"Guess Who,\" a whimsical clip where the game characters sing along to \"It's Nasty\" by Grandmaster Flash.\n\n\"It sort of gave me all this confidence, and I started thinking I could maybe do this for a living,\" she said.\n\nLepore's biggest project to date was also tied to a Staff Pick. It was actually her graduate thesis - an animated short about a girl traveling through a magical yet treacherous landscape called \"Move Mountain\". After she submitted it to several film festivals without any luck, she decided to upload it to Vimeo. Within a day, it was named a Staff Pick.\n\n\"Then literally a week later the showrunner from 'Adventure Time,' which was Cartoon Network's big hit show, got in touch with me and said, 'Hey I saw your film on Staff Picks. We feel like your style just gels with the show real well, and you'd be a really good fit to write and direct a stop-motion episode. It was the best news ever.\"\n\nWhile she's doing more projects offline including other commercials and an upcoming feature-length animated film, she'll always upload her content online. She posts on multiple sites, but uses Vimeo as her primary platform because it's an ad-free and better for filmmakers like herself to showcase their work.\n\n\"The online format has been really huge in helping me and my peers getting work, mostly because you can kind of see the films anywhere,\" said Lepore. \" It's kind of like this free distribution platform that's really, really incredible -- not to mention the work looks really beautiful on it.\"",

The closures can often impact a rural communities health and economy.\n\n(To find out how communities are responding click here.)\n\n-- Reporting by Berkeley Lovelace Jr.; data visualization by John Schoen.",

                "body": "The student survivors of February's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. are proving that more than any activists in a generation, they have managed to take over the conversation around gun control and American safety.\n\n\"The world failed us and we're here to make a new one that's going to be easier on the next generation. If you're against that, then get out,\" Cameron Kasky, March For Our Lives co-founder told Time magazine in a new cover story.\n\nToday, at least a half-million people, most prominently students, are expected to gather for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. and over 800 sister marches across the world.\n\nTIME cover\n\nOrganizing the march along with Kasky are survivors Emma González, David Hogg, Jacklyn Corinn, Alex Wind and Ryan Deitsch, all of whom have emphasized their mission to \"demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues.\"\n\n\"The adults know that we're cleaning up their mess,\" Kasky told Time.\n\nToday's March For Our Lives event is just one way the Stoneman Douglas students have mobilized since the February tragedy. Thousands of people across America took part in the #Enough National School Walkout on Wednesday, March 14 to both honor those killed at the high school in February and fight for stricter gun laws.\n\n\"These students are trying to build a different kind of world and correct a lot the mistakes people in previous generations made,\" Columbia University professor Ed Morales, author of the upcoming book \"Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,\" tells CNBC Make It.\n\nMorales argues that González, one of the most vocal student survivors, and her emblematic Gen Z peers (Americans born between 1994 and 2010) have succeeded in leading the March For Our Lives movement because of their youth, protest style and ability to hold inclusive conversations.\n\nGonzález, an 18-year-old senior at Stoneman Douglas, directly called out President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association (NRA) at an anti-gun rally held days after the mass shooting. A week later, González and fellow survivors again criticized the NRA and lawmakers at a CNN town hall on gun violence.\n\nAnd their efforts are showing: New results from a Gallup poll conducted after the Stoneman Douglas shooting found that support for stricter laws on gun sales is at its highest since 1993.\n\nHere are three ways González and her Gen Z peers are pioneering change when so many who came before them failed, according to Morales.\n\nIn an interview of the five students on 60 Minutes that aired on March 18, CBS News correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi asked them how their protest could be different than the parents who made it their life's mission to get real change after the Sandy Hook mass shooting.\n\n\"The thing about it is we are the generation that's had to be trapped in closets, waiting for police to come or waiting for a shooter to walk into our door. We are the people who know what it's like first-hand,\" Wind said.\n\n\"We're the mass shooting generation,\" Kasky added. \"I was born months after Columbine. I'm 17 years old, and we've had 17 years of mass shootings.\"\n\nMorales explains that while politicians in Congress and coalitions of victims' families have pushed for gun law reform after mass shootings, they haven't had the same unprecedented success in getting their voices heard like these high school students.\n\n\"This is the first time that there is a mass movement among pre-college students, staging walkouts and protests in the manner that has been done about other issues in the past,\" Morales says.\n\nCiting the American immigration rights movement, the anti-apartheid movement, AIDS activism and the protests against American involvement in the Vietnam War, Morales says those were protests primarily led by victims directly affected by these particular issues.\n\n\"One of the reasons why the protest movement against the Vietnam War in the 1960s was so massive is that everyone was exposed to this universal draft and there was a real a danger to [men] that might be drafted,\" Morales says. \"Now, we're at this place where mass shootings are so common that young people feel [shootings] are almost as much a threat to their lives.\"\n\nWith regard to Wednesday's high school walkouts, Morales says he's \"not trying to diminish [previous movements],\" but today's students are leading a \"preventative movement\" to avoid becoming victims of another tragedy.\n\n\"They want to put strong pressure on Congress to change laws. They're offering different suggestions like banning bump stocks, high capacity automatic weapons, enforcing an age limit and a background check law,\" Morales says. \"They're trying to put pressure and force action.\"\n\nOn Friday, González shared an op-ed for Teen Vogue in which she repurposed the Preamble to the Constitution in honor of the #NeverAgain movement and today's march:\n\nWe the Wounded of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Future, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common People, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Generations to Come, do ordain and establish this March for the United States of America.\n\n\"People always say, 'Get off your phones,' but social media is our weapon,\" Corin told Time. \"Without it, the movement wouldn't have spread this fast.\"\n\nStoneman Douglas student survivors have primarily used social media to rally the public around hashtags such as #NeverAgain, #March4OurLives and #DouglasStrong.\n\nMorales says Gen Z's activism on social media and their youth helps them enact change so quickly.\n\n\"As millennials raise their concerns, it seems like they're being taken up in a more activist fashion by Generation Z. These [Parkland] students are very motivated and are not compromising,\" Morales said.\n\nHe argues millennials and Gen Z hold more progressive views since they face job insecurity and less opportunity to accumulate wealth than older generations.\n\nMorales adds that Gen Z is better equipped to lead the March For Our Lives movement because millennials are, quite frankly, getting older and are busy being \"successful adults\" with families. That doesn't leave \"a lot of time to be involved in direct action or confrontational politics,\" he says.\n\n\"They have less to lose by devoting a lot of time to [activism],\" says Morales.\n\nGonzález's strong sense of self and identity shines through as a defining characteristic of the most vocal Douglas Stoneman students.\n\nShe begins her Harper's Bazaar op-ed by stating her name and saying, \"I'm 18 years old, Cuban and bisexual,\" but concludes, \"none of this matters anymore\" in light of the tragedy.\n\nIntersectionality, a term first coined by civil rights activistKimberlé Crenshaw, was designed to fight for the rights of marginalized women, such as African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, in the midst of male-dominated liberation movements.\n\nMorales says that González is clearly aware of intersectionality and different political causes, thanks to the convergence of her Latina identity and millennials' growing focus on inclusivity.\n\n\"What you see with Emma is someone who is aware that she's Cuban, aware that she's a woman and aware that she is bisexual and she sees all those things as continuous and intersecting, that these issues should all be thought about together,\" Morales says. \"She's able to juggle a series of interlocking problems and work on all of them at once, rather than just feel like she has to focus on one at the expense of the other.\"\n\nIn order to see political change, Morales argues, people need to understand the challenges different groups of people face. He says González and her peers are doing exactly that.\n\n\"Emma is capable of a large series of interlocking problem-solving things that she has in her life,\" he says, \"and she's able to juggle all of them and work on all of them at once rather than just feeling like she has to focus on one at the expense of the other.\"\n\nEarlier this month González and the members of March For Our Lives met with students from Chicago, one of the country's cities with the most gun-related crimes, to talk about their experiences.\n\nmeeting tweet1\n\nmeeting tweet2\n\nmeeting tweet 4\n\n\"Young people are much more equipped to see the world today. Twenty years ago, you had to struggle just to come up with the language to describe what all these [intersecting] issues meant, but now you can expect an article in Teen Vogue on it and you can see it all over social media,\" Morales says. \"It's exciting.\"\n\nLike this story?

                "body": "Recent history suggests that when lower-seeded teams advance unexpectedly, Final Four ticket prices drop.\n\nHoping to attend an NCAA college basketball game this year? You might be in luck.\n\nA tournament filled with surprising upsets have had the unintended consequences of whipsawing ticket prices, according to ticket sale website TicketIQ, which initially started out at their lowest in 4 years.\n\nThe \"Sweet 16\" round began on Thursday -- but without favorites like the University of Virginia and defending champions University of North Carolina, which got sent packing early. The bracket-busting continued, with #9-seeded Florida State defeating #4 seed Gonzaga, #9-seed Kansas State defeating #5 seed Kentucky, and #11-seed Loyola-Chicago defeated #7-seed Nevada. Number 2 Duke managed to break the upset streak on Friday by staving off a resurgent Syracuse, narrowly avoiding being sent home by the number 11 seed.\n\nTicketIQ said that, as of Thursday, fewer seats than normal were available for regional games. That limited availability has boosted prices slightly since the tournament began, with the average price for a regional round ticket being $432, less than last year's $465.\n\nThat average price is inflated by Omaha, where regional prices have gone up since the start of the tournament by 34 percent, and average $586. The increase may be attributed to Kansas' close proximity to Omaha, where excited fans are spurring demand and prices.\n\nBoston hosts four teams seeded at #5 or lower, and prices there have fallen by 29 percent to $316. Prices for Atlanta and Los Angeles games haven't budged much.\n\nAt the beginning of the tournament, costs to attend the Final Four in San Antonio were the lowest in four years, at $730. The prices have increased to $903, according to TicketIQ's data which includes listings from the Official NCAA Ticket Exchange, all despite the number of upsets.\n\nTo be certain, ticket demand and affordability are influenced by a multitude of factors like region and the intensity of a fan base. And despite the number of upsets this year, prices for the Final Four have been on the rise.\n\nHowever, recent history suggests that fans get less interested -- and tickets get comparatively cheaper -- when top teams get knocked out.\n\nIf the past is any prologue, the number of upsets may prove helpful for fans in search of cheap Final Four tickets. Back in 2011, when lower-seeded teams advancing were fairly common, the ticket price to see the last 4 remaining teams tumbled to $552 -- the lowest ever.\n\nConversely, there weren't nearly as many upsets last year, and fans literally paid the price. Ticket prices skyrocketed by a staggering 83 percent throughout the tournament, which ultimately produced two #1 seeds (North Carolina and Gonzaga) facing off against each other. The Final Four contest produced the most expensive ticket price ever at $1,343, according to TicketIQ.\n\nNonetheless, fans will have to dig into their pockets for this weekend's games at the very least. If upsets continue, prices may drop.\n\nOr perhaps they won't. Because as March has taught us, anything can happen.",

If necessary, the rescue team would then take the patient to the nearest hospital, about 45 minutes to one hour east in Martinsville.\n\nHarris could have taken the patient to the much closer 25-bed Pioneer Community Hospital of Patrick in Stuart, where she had been an employee before she retired. But the hospital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed last year, leaving more than 100 people without a job and the roughly 19,000 residents in the surrounding community without a nearby emergency health facility.\n\nHarris, 72, now spends most of her days responding to 911 calls. She said there are five other rescue squads in the Patrick County area addressing the unmet need in their community of emergency medical services, a broader trend in the U.S.\n\nThe Virginia Association of Volunteer Rescue Squads, a nonprofit organization in Roanoke for rescue squads statewide, has 18,000 dedicated members, according to its website, and is dedicated to providing pre-hospital care.\n\nThe rates of rural hospital closures are the highest seen in the last few decades, according to the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program, a group which tracks rural hospital closures throughout the United States. There has been a total of 83 hospital closures from January 2010 to January 2018 in rural areas across the United States, the NC RHRP's data showed.\n\nHospital closures often hit rural communities hard economically, Mark Holmes, director of the North Carolina Rural Health Research and Policy Analysis Center, told CNBC. They also leave a void of emergency medical services, causing residents to travel sometimes 10 to 25 miles further to meet their critical health-care needs, he said.\n\nWhen Pioneer Community Hospital announced that it was closing last September after financial struggles, some residents had to travel as much as three to four hours to receive their health-care needs, Debbie Foley, director of economic development for Patrick County, told CNBC.\n\nFoley said the hospital's parent company, Mississippi-based Pioneer Health Services, had \"financially mismanaged them\" and the hospital eventually had to file for bankruptcy protection in 2016. The Stuart hospital \"was profitable prior to the cost put down from the corporate level,\" Foley said. (Lackey Memorial Hospital, which acquired Pioneer Health Services, did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The hospital in Stuart was not included in the deal.)\n\nHarris, of Woolwine, said the impact of the Pioneer Community Hospital closure was devastating on her community. \"I got a phone call at about 1 o'clock that told me the hospital had closed and then after that I started getting texts from other people\" who had also lost their jobs, she recalled.\n\nFoley said the hospital closure has also impacted the community economically. \"In order to bring in businesses, health care is important,\" Foley said.\n\nMark Holmes at NC RHRP told CNBC that the reasons for hospital closures vary for every community. But one factor can include social demographics: Rural populations are often older, sicker and poorer than urban populations, he said.\n\nOther factors include decreased demand for inpatient services, consolidation in the health-care space, and a state's decision of whether to expand Medicaid, said Holmes, also a health policy and management professor at the University of North Carolina.\n\nHospital closures have been ticking up since the Great Recession, the research group said, but have slowed slightly in the last few years.\n\n\"Our working hypothesis is that it is the reverse of low-hanging fruit that has gone rotten,\" George Pink, the NC RHRP's deputy director, told CNBC. \"The hospitals that were weak have finally succumbed and now we're moving in an area of hospitals that were hanging on for longer.\"\n\nClosures can also impact communities in ways besides economics and health. Like sports teams can often function as a source of pride for major metropolitan areas, \"hospitals can serve a similar role for rural towns,\" Holmes said. \"We have a certain self-value because we have a hospital in town.\"\n\nHarris of Woolwine recalled that the closure of her community's hospital was also disappointing because the people in the town had donated money to it over several years. \"It was a good hospital. They took care of you,\" she said.\n\nNow Harris, who is on the town's board of supervisors, is working with the mortgage company who foreclosed on the hospital to get it reopened. \"It is a health issue and we need this hospital bad,\" Harris said.",

                "title": "How one of NFL's few female owners is changing her team's formula for identifying talent",
                "body": "Colts owner and vice chairman Carlie Irsay-Gordon (left) and her father, Indianapolis Colts owner and CEO Jim Irsay (right), holding the Vince Lombardi Trophy after the Colts victory over the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI. Former Colts head coach Tony Dungy in foreground.\n\nIdentifying talent and making the right hiring decisions are crucial to any organization. National Football League franchises are no exception. With the rise of computer-driven data analytics, the days of \"gut decisions\" made by scouts are long gone from the world of professional sports. But for the Indianapolis Colts, a better process for identifying talent is being created with insights from one of the NFL's few female owners.\n\n\"Our business is a little bit different from [other organizations],\" Carlie Irsay-Gordon, daughter of Colts owner and CEO Jim Irsay, told CNBC in a recent interview at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics conference. \"I'm a third generation in the line of Colts owners, and [prior to this current arrangement] we sort of were just flying by the seat of our pants.\"\n\nIrsay-Gordon, one of the only women with a prominent role within the NFL's ownership circle, said the Colts organization previously had values and a vision, but those elements came organically rather than as part of a set business objective. With a new generation of ownership at the franchise, the culture has evolved.\n\nIrsay-Gordon spoke with CNBC and shared a few keys to her thought process as she and the Colts' staff search for the best talent among the hundreds of players they review each year.\n\nOpen debate and collaboration are encouraged throughout meeting and film rooms within the team's facilities. Hearing opposing viewpoints is a vital element of the decision-making process within the Colts organization. \"If you remove the ego, if your intention is, 'I just want to help the team,' you're not going to make someone sound dumb,\" Irsay-Gordon said about the team's decision-making environment. \"What kind of progress are you going to make if there's constant pushback [to opposing views].\" She added, \"It's a much more Socratic environment, though there are still decision makers.\"\n\nFinding the right talent to fit within the organization is as crucial as setting the culture. \"For both [on and off-field talent], the potential and the ability is what I look at more, along with how interested and curious a person is,\" she said. \"[That] combined with hard work.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, I'm a curious person; I want to learn. So [I look for people] who are also that way.\"\n\nOn the field, identifying the right players goes beyond physical ability. There's a reason that front offices are placing more and more emphasis on the interview process at the NFL Scouting Combine. Last week each of 336 prospects in attendance spent 15 minutes with as many as 60 officials from NFL teams. While this isn't much time to get to know a player, it's an important part of the talent-identification process.\n\n\"Intangibles are important,\" Irsay-Gordon told CNBC, and they can stand out, since what all of her potential hires have in common won't alone distinguish them: \"Most of these players are freak athletes,\" she said.\n\nConfidence is a factor in choosing talent, and it played a role in one of the Colts' best draft decisions ever: quarterback Peyton Manning over Ryan Leaf back in 1998.\n\n\"When [Manning came for his pre-draft visit], he said, 'If you don't take me, you'll regret it,'\" Irsay-Gordon said. \"I mean, who says that?\"\n\nThe Colts selected Manning over Leaf, who underachieved as a professional, and the methodical Manning brought a championship to Indianapolis and finished his career as one of the best to ever play the position.\n\n-- By C.

Islamic State released a video last month in which it warned Egyptians against taking part in the upcoming vote and urged Islamists to attack security forces and leaders.\n\nState news agency MENA quoted Nemr as saying that two people, a policeman and a driver, were killed in the blast.\n\nPhotos on social media that Reuters could not independently verify showed a burnt out car and smoke at the site of the blast.\n\n\"On Saturday March 24 an explosive device planted underneath a car exploded ... as the Alexandria security chief drove by,\" the interior ministry said in a statement.\n\nEyewitnesses said police and military personnel formed a cordon around the site of the explosion. Local television stations later showed Nemr unharmed and inspecting the area.\n\nIslamic State attempted to assassinate Egypt's defense and interior ministers in December during a trip the pair made to the Sinai Peninsula, where the hardline militant group has been waging an insurgency for almost five years.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Friday that Islamic State militants would soon be defeated in the Sinai as he visited troops battling the jihadists there.\n\nPolls will open on Monday when voters choose between Sisi and one little-known candidate who supports the former field marshal. All credible opponents dropped out in January, citing intimidation by the authorities after the main challenger was jailed.\n\nSisi's critics say he has cracked down harshly on dissent and that tough economic reforms have eroded his popularity. Supporters say such measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.\n\nAs military commander, Sisi led the ousting of Egypt's only competitively-elected leader, President Mohamed Mursi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was toppled amid demonstrations against his rule in 2013, a year after taking power. Sisi took office with a landslide election victory a year later.\n\nState news agency MENA blamed the Brotherhood, which is now banned in Egypt and designated a terrorist group, for Saturday's bombing.\n\n\"This attempt comes in the context of terrorist Muslim Brotherhood elements trying to disrupt the electoral process and influence citizens into not going to the polls and participating in the presidential election,\" the agency said.\n\nIslamic State and other militant groups have successfully assassinated officials in recent years. Islamic State bombed a hotel in Sinai in 2015 during a parliamentary election, killing seven people including two judges overseeing the vote.\n\nEgypt's top public prosecutor, Hisham Barakat, was killed by a car bomb in June 2015.",

Cambridge Analytica tried to make me pay for that work but I refused. It had nothing to do with us,\" Banks was quoted as saying.\n\nEfforts by the ICO to investigate Cambridge Analytica had hit a snag on Thursday after a judge adjourned its application to search the British consultancy group's office by 24 hours.\n\nU.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the British consulting firm gained access to the data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.\n\nFacebook's Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that his company made mistakes in mishandling data and promised tougher steps to restrict developers access to data.",

                "body": "Before you hand in your tax return to the IRS, be sure to go over your receipts: You could miss out on key tax deductions and credits that are about to go extinct.\n\nThat's because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect at the beginning of this year and overhauled the tax code, doubling the standard deduction and doing away with personal exemptions.\n\nThis means that the 2017 tax year is the last time you'll be filing under the old code and it's the last call for certain tax breaks.\n\nThough a number of deductions are scheduled to return at the end of 2025, it will be up to Congress to determine whether these provisions are extended.\n\n\"There are overlooked deductions that are going away, including unreimbursed employee expenses and job-search expenses,\" said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA with TurboTax.\n\n\"With the standard deduction doubling, some people will not be itemizing [in 2018],\" said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.\n\nFurther, Congress recently extended for 2017 a package of tax breaks that would have otherwise expired in 2016.\n\nHere are the key tax deductions and credits you should grab while you still can.\n\nThis year is the last time you can claim a deduction for personal losses that you sustained in a given year due to an event such as a natural disaster, fire or accident.\n\nThe total amount of your losses on personal property must exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income.\n\nGenerally, you must claim these losses as an itemized deduction, but there's an exception for survivors of Hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey, which struck last year.\n\n\"For 2017, people who were victims of the hurricanes or California wildfires can claim a casualty loss even if they don't itemize,\" said Greene-Lewis.\n\nStarting in 2018, you can claim a loss only if it occurs in a disaster that's declared by the president. This provision expires after 2025.\n\nThe 2017 tax year will be the last time that you can deduct interest paid on home equity loans and home equity lines of credit if you borrowed up to $100,000, no matter how you spent the money.\n\nStarting in 2018, new limits will apply to your ability to deduct interest.\n\n\"If the home equity loan was not used to build, buy or improve your home, you won't be able to deduct that in 2018, regardless of when the loan was taken out,\" said Luscombe.\n\nThis break, which allows homeowners to deduct the amount they've paid for mortgage insurance, was set to expire at the end of 2016. Congress renewed it retroactively for 2017 tax returns.\n\nBorrowers who itemize their deductions on Schedule A may apply.\n\nDid you know that you can deduct property taxes on all of the homes you own -- and not just your principal residence?\n\nBe aware: This break is due for some major changes. Starting in 2018, the deductibility of property taxes will be subject to the new $10,000 cap on state and local taxes or SALT.\n\nOwners of multiple homes will esepcially feel the limitation on this tax break.\n\n\"That $10,000 cap is per taxpayer,\" said Greene-Lewis -- not per home. \"The 2017 tax year is the last year you can claim full value of property taxes.\"\n\nGenerally, if a lender cancels all or part of your debt, that amount is considered to be income.\n\nHere's an exception: Filers who had a loan modification, foreclosure or short sale last year can exclude the amount of debt forgiven on their principal residence from gross income in 2017. This break, which would have expired, was among the \"tax extenders\" Congress recently approved.\n\nHere's another break that's back, thanks to the tax extenders. If you or your child are in college, you may be able to deduct tuition, books and supplies for your studies by up to $4,000.\n\nRoom and board, along with other personal expenses, do not qualify.\n\nAlternatively, you may take one of the education credits for your costs: the American opportunity tax credit, which is worth up to $2,500 per eligible student; or the lifetime learning credit, which is worth up to $2,000 per tax return.\n\nBe aware that you can't claim an education credit and the tuition deduction for the same expenses.\n\nCongress extended access to credits for energy-saving home improvements.\n\nThe credit for \"non-business energy property\" is for homeowners who added certain efficient windows, doors and insulation. It's subject to a lifetime limit of $500.\n\nThe \"residential energy property credit\" is also around for the 2017 tax year. It applies to homeowners' purchase of qualified solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps and other alternative energy equipment.\n\nFilers should know that the IRS is still updating its systems to process returns claiming these energy-efficiency credits and certain other tax extenders.\n\nAt the moment, the agency is ready to handle returns that have claimed the extended breaks for mortgage insurance, discharged residence debt and qualified tuition.\n\nThis is the last year you can take miscellaneous itemized deductions, including those for tax preparation and investment fees and unreimbursed employee expenses.\n\nYou can deduct these costs to the extent they exceed more than 2 percent of your adjusted gross income.\n\nThis break is also on its way out.\n\n\"On the Money\" airs on CNBC Saturdays at 5:30 a.m. ET.

                "body": "People lay flowers as gendarmes stand guard in front of the Gendarmerie Nationale in Carcassonne on March 24, 2018 in tribute to the gendarme killed after swapping himself for a hostage during an attack by a gunman who left a total of four people dead on March 23, 2018. Four people were killed on March 23 when a man claiming allegiance to the Islamic State group went on a shooting spree and held people hostage in a supermarket in Trebes, southwestern France before being shot dead by police.\n\nA French police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage died of his injuries, raising the death toll in the attack to four, and the officer was honored Saturday as a national hero of \"exceptional courage and selflessness.\"\n\nCol. Arnaud Beltrame was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday.\n\nBeltrame, who first took his place among the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had organized a training session in the Aude region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to Depeche du Midi, the local newspaper.\n\n\"We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,\" he said then.\n\nBut when he went inside the supermarket on Friday, he had given up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morocco-born captor, he left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.\n\nHis death raises the toll to four. The gunman was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, Beltrame joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and deployed to Iraq in 2005. He served as a member of the presidential guard and in 2012 earned one of France's highest honors, the Order of Merit. He was married with no children.\n\nMacron has said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a car and the apartment complex in central Carcassonne where Lakdim was believed to live.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nA woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He didn't identify her.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury wasn't serious, Lefebvre said.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.\n\nHe shouted \"Allahu akbar!\" -- the Arabic phrase for God is great -- and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. One of those attacks, against a kosher supermarket in Paris, seemed to foreshadow this week's deadly assault in the south.",

                "body": "The United States has flouted trade rules with an inquiry into intellectual property and China will defend its interests, Vice Premier Liu He told U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a telephone call on Saturday, Chinese state media reported.\n\nThe call between Mnuchin and Liu, a confidante of President Xi Jinping, was the highest-level contact between the two governments since U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods on Thursday.\n\nThe deepening rift has sent a chill through financial markets and the corporate world as investors predicted dire consequences for the global economy should trade barriers start going up.\n\nSeveral U.S. chief executives attending a high-profile forum in Beijing on Saturday, including BlackRock Inc's Larry Fink and Apple Inc's Tim Cook, urged restraint.\n\nIn his call with Mnuchin, Liu, a Harvard-trained economist, said China still hoped both sides would remain \"rational\" and work together to keep trade relations stable, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nU.S. officials say an eight-month probe under the 1974 U.S. Trade Act has found that China engages in unfair trade practices by forcing American investors to turn over key technologies to Chinese firms.\n\nHowever, Liu said the investigation report \"violates international trade rules and is beneficial to neither Chinese interests, U.S. interests nor global interests\", Xinhua cited him as saying.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said it had filed a request - at the direction of Trump - for consultations with China at the World Trade Organization to address \"discriminatory technology licensing agreements\".\n\nChina's commerce ministry expressed regret at the filing on Saturday, and said China had taken strong measures to protect the legal rights and interests of both domestic and foreign owners of intellectual property.\n\nDuring a visit to Washington in early March, Liu had requested Washington set up a new economic dialogue mechanism, identify a point person on China issues, and deliver a list of demands.\n\nThe Trump administration responded by telling China to immediately shave $100 billion off its record $375 billion trade surplus with the United States. Beijing told Washington that U.S. export restrictions on some high-tech products are to blame.\n\n\"China has already prepared, and has the strength, to defend its national interests,\" Liu said on Saturday.\n\nFiring off a warning shot, China on Friday declared plans to levy additional duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium, imposed after a separate U.S. probe.\n\nZhang Zhaoxiang, senior vice president of China Minmetals Corp, said that while the state-owned mining group's steel exports to the U.S. are tiny, the impact could come indirectly.\n\n\"China's direct exports to the U.S. are not big. But there will be some impact due to our exports via the United States or indirect exports,\" Zhang told reporters on the sidelines of the China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday.\n\nChina's state-run Global Times said Beijing was only just beginning to look at means to retaliate.\n\n\"We believe it is only part of China's countermeasures, and soybeans and other U.S. farm products will be targeted,\" the widely-read tabloid said in a Saturday editorial.\n\nWei Jianguo, vice chairman of Beijing-based think tank China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, told China Daily that Beijing could impose tariffs on more U.S. products, and is considering a second and even third list of targets.\n\nPossible items include aircraft and chips, Wei, a former vice commerce minister, told the newspaper, adding that tourism could be a possible target.\n\nThe commerce ministry's response had so far been \"relatively weak\", respected former Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei said at the forum.\n\n\"If I were in the government, I would probably hit soybeans first, then hit autos and airplanes,\" said Lou, currently chairman of the National Council for Social Security Fund.\n\nU.S. farm groups have long feared that China, which imports more than third of all U.S. soybeans, could slow purchases of agricultural products, heaping more pain on the struggling U.S. farm sector.\n\nU.S. agricultural exports to China stood at $19.6 billion last year, with soybean shipments accounting for $12.4 billion.\n\nChinese penalties on U.S. soybeans will especially hurt Iowa, a state that backed Trump in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nBoeing jets have also been often cited as a potential target by China.\n\nChina and the U.S. had benefited by globalization, Blackrock's Larry Fink said at the forum.\n\n\"I believe that a dialogue and maybe some adjustments in trade and trade policy can be in order. It does not need to be done publicly; it can be done privately,\" he said.\n\nApple's Tim Cook called for \"calm heads\" amid the dispute.\n\nThe sparring has cast a spotlight on hardware makers such as Apple, which assemble the majority of their products in China for export to other countries.\n\nElectrical goods and tech are the largest U.S. import item from China.\n\nSome economists say higher U.S. tariffs will lead to higher costs and ultimately hurt U.S. consumers, while restrictions on Chinese investments could take away jobs in America.\n\n\"I don't think local governments in the United States and President Trump hope to see U.S. workers losing their jobs,\" Sun Yongcai, general manager at Chinese railway firm CRRS Corp, which has two U.S. production plants, said at the forum.",

                "body": "Some of the world's top economists and business leaders were in Beijing on Saturday for the annual China Development Forum, and one topic overshadowed the entire gathering: The looming threat of a trade war between the U.S. and China.\n\n\"There's a lot of unease,\" leading economist Larry Summers told CNBC during the event. \"A lot of unease about broad geopolitical developments, and a lot of unease around the conflicts of the last week.\"\n\nBeijing on Friday said it may target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion as retaliation for President Donald Trump signing an executive order earlier this month that imposed broad duties on foreign aluminum and steel imports.\n\nTrump also announced tariff plans for up to $60 billion in Chinese imports this week, but China did not officially connect its Friday threats to that White House action.\n\n\"I don't think we've previously at the [China Development Forum] felt like we might be on the brink of a trade war, and I think that certainly is a very unfortunate development,\" added Summers, who previously served as president of Harvard University, the director of the National Economic council, the chief economist of the World Bank and the U.S. Treasury secretary.\n\nNobel-prize winning economists Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz were also at the annual meeting, and they predicted pain ahead for the U.S. economy if Beijing and Washington ramp up tit-for-tat trade penalties.\n\nU.S. companies, Shiller warned, are not prepared to have China cut out of their supply chains or business models.\n\n\"The immediate thing will be an economic crisis because these enterprises are built on long-term planning, they've developed a skilled workforce and ways of doing things. We have to rediscover these things in whatever country after the imports are cut off,\" Shiller told CNBC. \"It's just chaos: It will slow down development in the future if people think that this kind of thing is likely.\"\n\nStiglitz, for his part, warned that China's leaders are likely prepared to initiate tariffs based on \"a very good economic map with which they will target certain places in the United States where the pain will be maximized.\"\n\nAn escalating trade war, the Nobel laureate said, could have political ramifications for Trump -- especially if trade partners' retaliations hit the president's base.\n\n\"If there is a broad range increase in tariffs, it would affect their cost of living, the inflation would lead the Fed to raise interest rates at a higher rate, it would certainly impose a risk to the return to the U.S. to robust economic growth,\" Stiglitz said. \"This may be the one thing that actually does change this group of people who seem to have stuck with him even as he demonstrated bigotry, misogyny, support of people who [have a] Nazi background.\"\n\n\"They stood with him so far. The question is: When their pocketbook gets hit, will they still?\"\n\nBusiness leaders at the Beijing meeting also addressed the escalating trade tensions, with Johnson & Johnson's CEO and chairman, Alex Gorsky, emphasizing that open trade is the best policy for businesses to succeed.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we think that having, first of all, fair, equitable trade around the world is in everyone's best interest -- Johnson & Johnson's, but I think for all companies and all countries,\" he said.\n\nRio Tinto CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques, meanwhile, predicted that \"common sense would prevail\" between the U.S. and China. Either way, he added, he'll be focusing on making the best of whatever business situation he's faced with.",

                "body": "Cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology need a decentralized network in order to be successful long term, said Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb.\n\nUse of a centralized financial payment network will result in \"a system that is no better than SWIFT or PayPal,\" McCaleb said.\n\n\"The real vision is that you have a network, much like the internet, that anyone can participate in,\" McCaleb said Friday on CNBC's \"Fast Money.\" \"There's not one central entity that can decide that it's going to start charging. This is the way this thing can actually grow and reach ubiquity.\"\n\n\"That's the key thing to make these things successful,\" he said.\n\nMcCaleb co-founded Ripple, whose ripple currency is the third-largest digital coin by market cap, but split off from the Ripple team to form Stellar in 2014 because of different beliefs in how the system should be run.\n\n\"It's very hard to run nodes outside of ... Ripple Labs,\" McCaleb said of ripple coins. \"[The Ripple team is] running the majority of the nodes, which should be concerning for people.\"\n\nThe developer, who also created the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange and then sold it in 2011, said the only other successful decentralized network he's seen is the internet.\n\n\"What we're trying to build at Stellar is an internet-level protocol,\" said McCaleb, Stellar's chief technology officer. \"That's important that that be done by a nonprofit entity. If you imagine an internet created by a for-profit company, it would just be a very different world.\"\n\nAnother key to Stellar's success, McCaleb said, is to not limit the investor base to a few participants.\n\n\"One of the things we're doing at Stellar is distributing the underlying coin very widely,\" he said.\n\nStellar's XLM coins, known as lumens, were among the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization earlier this year. But the currency has declined approximately 34 percent so far this year.\n\nThe coin's transaction settlement times are 5 seconds or less, a fraction of bitcoin's time, McCaleb said.\n\nEarlier this week, McCaleb told CNBC that cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology will change the way banking takes place in the future by creating a public ledger that everyone can see -- but that cannot be changed at random.\n\nWithin the next 10 years, McCaleb predicted most assets, even non-crypto assets, will become digitized.",

                "body": "The Human Rights Campaign lashed out against the administration's decision.\n\nPresident Donald Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in military except under \"limited circumstances,\" following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.\n\nThe White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\" -- those who may require substantial medical treatment -- \"presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nTrump surprised the Pentagon's leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and three federal courts have ruled against the ban.\n\nThe Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\n\n\"This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards -- including those regarding the use of medical drugs -- equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing \"anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.\"\n\n\"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" said HRC President Chad Griffin.\n\nTrump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.\n\nEarlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\nThe issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.",

                "title": "Zuckerberg takes steps to calm Facebook employees",
                "body": "For the past week, Mark Zuckerberg has grappled with a backlash from lawmakers, regulators and users over Facebook's mishandling of data privacy. He has also had to face another restive group: his own employees.\n\nThe Facebook chief executive has taken multiple steps over the past few days to communicate with the social network's 25,000 employees over revelations last week that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly obtained data of 50 million Facebook users.\n\nThe Silicon Valley company held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica, featuring one of Facebook's lawyers, Paul Grewal. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Zuckerberg addressed employees directly, according to two Facebook employees who asked not be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Mr. Zuckerberg also spoke with staff on Friday at a regularly scheduled employee meeting, said two people who attended the event.\n\nMore from the New York Times:\n\nZuckerberg, Facing Facebook's Worst Crisis Yet, Pledges Better Privacy\n\nFacebook's Role in Data Misuse Sets Off Storms on Two Continents\n\nHow Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions\n\nFacebook declined to comment on the meetings.\n\nSpeaking to Facebook's employees was a crucial prong of what has become an apology tour of sorts for Mr. Zuckerberg over the Cambridge Analytica fallout. The revelations have raised calls for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear before Congress to explain himself, as well as a #DeleteFacebook movementand other criticism.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg had stayed silent on the matter for days, until he released a statement on Wednesday vowing that Facebook had to do betterand gave several interviews to quell the crisis. That has not stopped pressure from Congress, with bipartisan leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee saying on Friday that they had sent a formal request for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear in a hearing over Facebook's \"harvesting and sale of personal information\" related to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCalming employees was particularly vital because morale had sunk at the company, Facebook employees have said, especially after months of scrutiny over how the social network was used by Russian agents to influence the 2016 presidential election. Keeping workers engaged is crucial in Silicon Valley's highly competitive job market, where recruiting and retaining talent often is difficult against deep-pocketed rivals.\n\nEarlier this week, some Facebook employees had said that colleagues had started looking to transfer from the main social network product to other branches of the company, such as to messaging app WhatsApp and photo-sharing site Instagram, which have been relatively unscathed by the recent scandals.\n\nOne Facebook recruiter, who declined to be identified because of a nondisclosure agreement, said there were concerns that top talent might choose other Silicon Valley companies over Facebook.\n\n\"It's such a shocking difference for company employees who are used to having esteem for where they work,\" said Eric Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, a consulting firm, and who has been speaking with people at Facebook. \"Ten years ago, Facebook was the hottest place to go out of college. This year, the best graduates are not necessarily looking at Facebook.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Zuckerberg did not appear at the Tuesday staff meeting hosted by the company lawyer, Mr. Grewal, his absence made headlines.\n\nWhen he spoke to workers on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg focused on concrete measures that Facebook was taking following the Cambridge Analytica reports, two employees said. Staff members asked questions about how Mr. Zuckerberg planned to regain user trust, especially in light of the #DeleteFacebook campaign from users, the two employees said.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg said the social network was investigating apps like the third-party quiz app that had obtained access to \"large amounts of information\" from the social network, which had then been used by Cambridge Analytica. He also said the company would restrict third-party developers' access and would notify users whose data had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nOf the #DeleteFacebook campaign, Mr. Zuckerberg told The New York Times in an interview, \"I think it's a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that.\"\n\nThree Facebook employees said morale had improved following the interviews and the internal communications that Mr. Zuckerberg did on Wednesday. One of them said he had avoided a trip home to see his family last weekend because he did not want to answer questions about the company he worked for.\n\nOn Friday, Facebook's senior managers promised an open line of communication as the company continued to re-evaluate its privacy and security measures, said two employees.\n\nThere was a feeling, said one of the people, that Facebook wanted to take aggressive steps to make sure it could regain user trust. And over all, he said, confidence was up.",

                "title": "Fear grips US agriculture industry as China proposes hefty duties for pork, wine and fruit",
                "body": "Beijing proposed levying up to 25 percent tariffs on some U.S. agricultural goods.\n\nU.S. agriculture is bracing itself potentially costly tit-for-tat trade retaliation between the Washington and Beijing that could hit everything from American pork to wine.\n\n\"The producers of the commodities that are being targeted will probably feel the effects of it,\" said Larry Karp, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Berkeley. \"And there's no reason to think that the Chinese will stop at this.\"\n\nOn Friday, China's Ministry of Commerce said $3 billion in U.S. goods could face new tariffs following the Trump administration's imposition of duties on imported steel and aluminum. Among the goods listed for retaliatory tariffs were several agricultural products, including pork, wine, nuts, fresh fruit and dried fruit.\n\nOverall, U.S. agricultural exports to China represent about $20 billion annually for American farmers.\n\n\"It just seems like any time there are trade disputes, food is top of the list just because it's an emotional issue,\" said Larry Sailer, an Iowa farmer who produces pork, soybeans and corn. \"I wish these countries wouldn't use that as a weapon, but that's basically what they are doing.\"\n\nStill, Sailer said he \"totally supports the administration we have right now,\" adding that trade issues with other countries such as China have been ignored for too long.\n\nEarlier this week, an editorial in China's Global Times, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, made a case for targeting \"subsidized U.S. soybeans,\" charging the commodity is \"dumped on China.\" That said, the Chinese ministry's announcement Friday didn't identify soybeans.\n\nSome experts suggest the Chinese have looked to target U.S. pork initially and may strike next at American soybeans since it could impact some farm-belt states where President Donald Trump has enjoyed strong political support. The U.S. ships about $14 billion worth of soybeans to the world's second largest economy, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\n\"China no doubt considered the parts of the U.S. that Trump relies on most heavily for political support,\" said Karp. \"It would be very surprising if they didn't make their list with the view to how this play with his base.\"\n\nEven so, the Chinese ministry's target list provided Friday also includes agricultural commodities such as wine, fruit and nuts -- all products tied to California, a state Trump lost in the 2016 election.\n\nThe Chinese government proposed levying up to 25 percent tariffs on U.S. pork and some other agricultural exports but they haven't actually been implemented yet. Citrus would face a 15 percent tariff.\n\n\"Citrus is on the list and it does create some consternation,\" said Joel Nelsen, president of the California Citrus Mutual, a citrus producers trade group. \"This thing could ratchet up and be just a negotiating step taken by both administrations. We're watching it closely.\"\n\nNelsen said China has been a growing market for the $3.3 billion California citrus industry and now ranks as the third-largest export market behind Canada and South Korea. He said the market is dominated by orange and lemon exports.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the wine produced in the U.S. comes from California and U.S. wine exports to China (including Hong Kong) were $197 million last year, according to the San Francisco-based Wine Institute.\n\n\"Chinese retaliation against U.S. wine would put our producers at a significant disadvantage in one of the most important markets in the world at a critical time,\" said Robert Koch, CEO of Wine Institute. \"As a result of free trade agreements, a number of our foreign competitors will soon have tariff-free access to the Chinese market. This, combined with additional punitive tariffs on California wine, could result in lost market share for years to come.\"\n\nCalifornia's $5 billion almond industry depends on exports despite strong domestic demand for the crop. Approximately two-thirds of the almonds produced in California go to the export market and China is one of the top buyers.\n\nSimilarly, the pork industry is seen as vulnerable since it relies heavily on exports to China. One in four hogs in the U.S. is exported overseas and the Chinese are the world's top consumers of pork.\n\n\"We sell a lot of pork to China, so higher tariffs on our exports going there will harm our producers and undermine the rural economy,\" Jim Heimerl, an Ohio pork producer and president of the National Pork Producers Council said in a statement. \"No one wins in these tit-for-tat trade disputes, least of all the farmers and the consumers.\"\n\nLast year, China was the second-largest volume market for American pork industry after Mexico. At about $1.1 billion, China and Hong Kong together are the third-largest market for pork based on value.\n\nThe U.S. pork industry has expanded in recent years due to increasing demand for the product, led by growing demand overseas.\n\nOne of the industry standouts in the pork industry is Smithfield Foods, the world's largest pork producer and a wholly-owned subsidiary of China's WH Group. The company acquired Virginia-based Smithfield Foods back in 2013.\n\nUBS analyst Christine Peng said in a report Friday that China's WH Group is exposed to the tariff risk because it could increase the company's \"earnings volatility if China/U.S. hog price disparity increases.\" Furthermore, the analyst sees a risk of higher soybean prices since soy is used as a livestock feed for the company's pigs and chickens.\n\nAt the same time, there's also export exposure for other U.S. livestock producers, including Hormel and Tyson.\n\n\"Tyson and Hormel have enjoyed several years of strong commodity margins in pork based on tight domestic processing capacity and strong commodity prices,\" Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow said Friday in a note. \"They need export markets to remain strong in order for commodity pork prices to remain high.\"\n\nAdded Moskow, \"With cold storage inventories of beef, pork, and turkey now at record levels and U.S. livestock producers planning to increase production significantly in 2018, even a small change to the export markets might have an outsized impact on price.\"\n\nTyson spokesperson Caroline Ahn said in a statement, \"A healthy export industry benefits independent farmers like those who raise chicken, cattle and hogs for our company, as well as the communities where they live. Having good trading relationships builds certainty and stability in international trade, which is important to sustain a healthy domestic export industry and jobs.\"\n\nHormel didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nShares of Tyson and Hormel were lower Friday amid a steeper sell-off in the broader market.",

                "body": "SRI International is developing a robot that can be used to dismantle bombs or perform surgery with a little help from virtual reality headsets.\n\nThe non-profit research and development group in Silicon Valley previously created Apple's Siri and the core technology used by Intuitive Surgical in its da Vinci systems.\n\nDubbed the Taurus, SRI's new robot is remotely operated using a consumer VR headset and controller.\n\nThe Taurus' arms are affixed with plier-like pincers that can pick up and manipulate various tools like a scalpel, sutures or a screwdriver. The robot also has cameras between the two arms, giving it a vaguely spider-like appearance.\n\nWith a VR headset (running the appropriate Taurus software), a user can see exactly what the robot is viewing. Inside the virtual environment, there's also a dashboard with information, for example, related to a patient's vitals or the temperature in a vehicle.\n\nHand controls and foot pedals are used to maneuver the Taurus. It's relatively easy with the Taurus to pick up small pieces and move them around a peg board but more challenging to sew a stitch or move a thin wire.\n\nAccording to the Thomas P. Low, director of medical systems and telerobotics at SRI, the rising popularity of VR is helping his lab to speed up their research. Previously, SRI's robotic labs had to develop their own graphic interfaces to make robots easier to use.\n\n\"Very early on, we started looking at consumer VR as an interface to our robot systems,\" he said.\n\nWill the Taurus put bomb squads, police or medics out of work? Not likely, even long term, said Low.\n\n\"We really see the Taurus acting as a force multiplier,\" he said.\n\nIn the case of battlefield medicine, Low said the Taurus would allow a combat medic to call in help from an experienced specialist in a city hospital to consult from afar and do some of the less-demanding physical work involved in an open surgery.\n\nTaurus could one day allow a surgeon on Earth to operate remotely on an astronaut en route to Mars, Low said.\n\nThe robot can already be used to dismantle bombs inside of trucks or other vehicles, without destroying forensic evidence. Weighing around 15 pounds, the Taurus is made to be highly portable and operable within confined spaces.",

                "title": "Stocks now in downward spiral, as political risk becomes bigger threat than rising interest rates",
                "body": "Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) moments before the Closing Bell.\n\nPolitical risk has replaced rising interest rates as the bigger fear in the stock market, and concerns about trade wars or other White House drama will be the market focus in the week ahead.\n\nThe stock market had its worst week since January 2016, in a violent sell-off that sent the Dow into a full-blown correction, 11.6 percent from its January highs. The Dow fell 5.7 percent for the week, to 23,533, and is on track for its worst quarter since the third quarter 2015, with a 4.8 percent decline so far.\n\nStocks sold off hard into the close Friday, with the S&P 500 plummeting 2.1 percent to 2,588, just above its low of the day at 2,585 -- also the 200-day moving average.\n\n\"This is basically a weekend where the geopolitical risk is very high, and I think people were very reluctant to take exposure home over the weekend. Having seen the most recent flow data, it's hard to make the case that the public is a buyer here as well,\" said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.\n\n\"It's a cumulative air of uncertainty with the escalation of trade tensions and the personnel turnover [at the White House], along with the signal that lower yields, higher oil prices are sending investors,\" Emanuel said.\n\nWhen stocks corrected in February, the catalyst was a quick jump in interest rates and the fear inflation would prompt the Fed to speed up its rate hikes. Now, as the market looks set to retest those February lows, investors are more fearful about what might come out of the White House.\n\nIn the past week, President Donald Trump's lead lawyer on the Russia investigation resigned, and H.R. McMaster was replaced as national security advisor by former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton.\n\nAnalysts said the hardline Bolton could look for a more aggressive stance against some U.S. adversaries, such as Iran. Analysts say Bolton could push the administration to drop out of the Iran nuclear deal when it is up for renewal in May, and that in turn could drive oil prices higher.\n\n\"It's a pretty big wild card. The S&P 500 hit the 200-day right as the market closed, and it didn't have time to react there. You could either have a Black Monday-type day or not,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com.\n\nThe 200-day is widely watched, and it could be a support level, as it was in the February sell-off. But Redler points out that the Feb. 9 low was a lot easier for traders to play since the S&P hit it during the trading day, when it bounced off it and closed higher. This time it's unclear whether there will be a bounce since the market closed right on that level, and traders won't know if the retest worked until Monday.\n\n\"This could be the type of weekend where sentiment gets even more negative and you get more rhetoric out of Washington that could trigger a harsher response from China that the markets might not like,\" Redler said.\n\nThe market is extremely worried about the potential for trade wars that could slow global growth and pinch corporate profits. Trump announced tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods Thursday, and investors reacted by selling stocks that could be hurt in a trade war, including industrial and tech names. Technology was also at the heart of the week's sell-off, losing 7.9 percent because of concerns about new regulation after the Facebook data scandal.\n\n\"We think there's further underperformance likely in the tech sector, but does that mean the market has to go careening through its lows? Not necessarily,\" said Emanuel. \"The next week is potentially a quiet week, a holiday week; you could see, albeit potentially short term, you could see at least a little firming in the market.\"\n\nPatrick Kernan, principle with Cardinal Capital, said he expects lots of volatility in the holiday-shortened four-day week. He trades S&P 500 options and said there was a lot of activity Friday but no panic in the market, as there was in February.\n\n\"I am really concerned that nobody wants to step in right now. I think the moves are going to be much more violent next week, whether they be up or down, as a lack of liquidity in the market increases as we go into the end of the month,\" said Kernan.\n\nKernan and many in the markets have been watching the ticking up of Libor [London interbank offered rate] over the past several weeks, and he expects that move up in short-term bank funding costs will continue. Traders look at the premium of Libor above the overnight index swap, and it has risen to 58, a new 9-year high, according to Reuters.\n\nTraders are concerned because the spread tends to rise when there is stress in the market, but now it's being blamed on a large issuance of Treasury bills and the repatriation of overseas cash by corporations, in response to the new tax law.\n\nMichael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said Treasury yields could rise at the short end in the coming week unless the headlines around trade disputes get more negative.

                "body": "A Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by United Airlines takes off from Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nBoeing is close to winning a keenly fought contest to supply 787 Dreamliner jets to American Airlines, beating European competition from the Airbus A330neo, three people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe deal, which remains to be finalized, also marks a victory for General Electric, whose engines are expected to power the Boeing aircraft, beating proposals from rival Rolls-Royce, they said, asking not to be identified.\n\n\"We are continuing to look at our wide-body options and are focused on making the right decision for American. No final decisions have been made at this time,\" an American spokesman said.\n\nOther parties declined to comment.\n\nShares of American Airlines closed down 2.5 percent, while shares of Boeing were up 0.4 percent.\n\nBoeing's expected win deals a fresh blow to the struggling A330neo, weeks after Hawaiian Airlines dropped an order for six Airbus A330-800neo jets in favor of the 787, leaving that particular variant of long-haul A330neo with no customers.\n\nAirbus updated its profitable A330 series in 2014 with new Rolls-Royce engines, but after an initial foray, sales have been sluggish.\n\nRecently appointed sales chief Eric Schulz has made boosting A330neo sales a top priority this year.\n\nAmerican Airlines said in January it was reviewing the Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A330-900neo, which is in test flights before entering service this summer.\n\nIndustry sources had said American was looking for about 25-30 wide-body jets, making a Boeing deal potentially worth some $7-8.5 billion.\n\nAircraft analysts had predicted American's decision would be important for the health of the A330neo program, because a win there could spur further sales and prevent new defections.\n\nThe latest setback is expected to trigger a scramble by Airbus to prevent the A330neo's top buyer - and one of its largest corporate customers - AirAsia, changing its mind after announcing it would stick with the A330neo.\n\nAirAsia executives visited Boeing earlier this month and have said they were examining the 787.\n\nThere are also growing doubts over the fate of an order for 28 A330neo jets by IranAir, part of a deal for 100 Airbus jets, as U.S. President Donald Trump strikes an increasingly hawkish tone over the future of an international sanctions deal.\n\nBetween them, AirAsia and IranAir make up over 40 percent of the current order book for the A330neo.\n\nLonger-term, Airbus faces deeper unease over its wide-body position in case failure to impose the A330neo leaves it over-dependent on a single model, the newer A350-900, according to two industry sources. Airbus insists the larger A350-1000 is also ripe for an upturn in sales after a recent calm period.\n\nAirbus officials also say other airlines are looking at the A330neo. Bloomberg News reported this week that the planemaker could introduce a freighter version.\n\nUK-based Rolls-Royce meanwhile denied a Bloomberg report that its Trent 7000 engines, which power the A330neo, were affected by issues on the Trent 1000, which is available on the 787 and which has faced reliability problems.",

                "body": "In the lightning round, Cramer gives his take on two semiconductor names.\n\nCNBC's Jim Cramer welcomed Dropbox's successful initial public offering on Friday as a reminder that even in a sell-off, good things can still happen.\n\nShares of the cloud-based data storage company closed up over 35 percent after its first day of trading, at $28.48 a share, well above the company's stated price of $21.\n\n\"If you were paying attention over the course of the session, you know that this was a white-hot deal,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"This is exactly the kind of stock that Wall Street wants right now.\"\n\nCramer's main point of concern was whether Dropbox would be able to keep turning its non-paying subscribers into paying customers. To maintain its growth rate, it needs to switch between two million and four million free users into paying customers each year.\n\nBut that's less than 1 percent of its 500 million free subscribers, Cramer noted, adding that the company will now have millions of dollars to invest in and bolster the business.\n\n\"Put it all together and I'm a big fan of Dropbox the company and its CEO, Drew Houston,\" he said. But for Dropbox the stock, he asked investors to be a little more careful.\n\nCramer was disheartened to see the market tumble again on Friday after a week of Washington turmoil turned stocks sour.\n\n\"I hate to say it, but I honestly think the president's become pretty frightening to investors in the stock market,\" he said. \"Maybe if things calm down [and] the White House starts trying to make deals instead of making enemies, then the earnings will matter again. They sure didn't matter to the market's trajectory this week because we had some very good [reports], but I live in hope.\"\n\nWith that hope in mind, Cramer turned to his weekly game plan. He'll watch for earnings reports from Red Hat, McCormick and more, pay close attention to Nvidia's investor day and host a health care conference for CNBC.\n\nAfter a week of panic and selling for the stock market, Cramer zeroed in on a buying opportunity he thought could bounce back \"like a coiled spring:\" the stock of retailer PVH Corp.\n\nShares of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent company fell sharply during February's market-wide sell-off as investors cooled on retail stocks.\n\n\"But this company reports next Wednesday night, and based on the publicly available clues, ... I bet it will deliver a very good quarter,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"In short, I think this is your chance to pick up a high-quality piece of merchandise that's now down almost 12 percent from its January highs.\"\n\nTo back up his call, Cramer went over the six pieces of evidence that made him so bullish on PVH ahead of its earnings report.\n\nAlso on Friday, Cramer jokingly wondered whether President Donald Trump was shorting the stock market by the way his announcements sent stocks down during the week.\n\n\"I know he's not actually betting against stocks, but when I try to make sense of his recent actions, it's like somebody in the White House, after generating fabulous returns in his first year, now wants the averages to get crushed,\" Cramer said.\n\nWith the uproar about tariffs, White House firings and back-and-forth about the omnibus spending bill, Cramer warned that more chaos would only make things worse on Wall Street.\n\n\"You have to wonder what the heck happened to the guy who used to grade his job performance based on the performance of the market,\" he said. \"As long as the president keeps firing high-level people, undoing policies from last week and antagonizing the Chinese with no clear objective, he'll be a headwind for stocks, not a tailwind. A suboptimal and ill-advised situation indeed.\"\n\nCramer also addressed a potentially dangerous type of IPO, as exhibited by home security play ADT: the private equity-backed IPO.\n\nThe company was taken private by Apollo Global Management two years ago before coming public again two months ago. But the speed of the turnaround was a major red flag for Cramer.\n\n\"The lack of time spent private was a real red flag,\" he warned. \"This is a sure sign that a private equity shop is looking to unload a dud investment, because, presumably, they don't think it's worth the effort to spend more time turning things around.\"\n\nBut private equity-backed deals don't always have to go poorly. Cramer pointed to Burlington, which was taken private by Bain Capital in 2006 and once again became public in 2013.\n\n\"The next time you see a private equity-backed IPO like ADT, I want you to run in the other direction,\" he concluded. \"When these firms take a company public again in less than two years, it may be a sign that something is wrong. When they take their time, though, like Bain did with Burlington Stores, these so-called vultures can work miracles.\"\n\nIn Cramer's lightning round, he zipped through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:\n\nCypress Semiconductor Corp.: \"Cypress Semi is a very good semiconductor [company]. However, there is a lot of speculative money in it. I think it can go down to $16. Don't pull the trigger now.\"\n\nON Semiconductor: \"I like [it] very, very much. It's an inexpensive semi. They're coming down. It's a buy.\"\n\nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia.\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

                "body": "Cramer, a self-proclaimed fan of the data storage company, warns investors about buying its red-hot stock fresh off its IPO.\n\nCNBC's Jim Cramer welcomed Dropbox's successful initial public offering on Friday as a reminder that even in a sell-off, good things can still happen.\n\nShares of the cloud-based data storage company closed up over 35 percent after its first day of trading, at $28.48 a share, well above the company's stated price of $21.\n\n\"If you were paying attention over the course of the session, you know that this was a white-hot deal,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"This is exactly the kind of stock that Wall Street wants right now.\"\n\nDropbox, a cloud-based data storage company that lets users access their online files anytime and from anywhere, was founded in 2007 as a simple online storage play.\n\nSince then, it's grown into what Cramer called a \"digital collaboration platform,\" reducing the time users spend searching for files, managing workflows and switching between applications.\n\nOne of Cramer's favorite things about Dropbox is that its platform basically sells itself. The company gives away free versions of its product to users, only asking them to pay up for the full capabilities after they've filled up a certain amount of storage space.\n\nDropbox has said that 300 million of its 500 million non-paying registered users have similar characteristics to its paid subscribers -- a huge growth opportunity, Cramer said.\n\nCramer was also impressed by the company's numbers. In 2017, Dropbox had 31 percent revenue growth, in line with most other public cloud companies. Its gross margin, or what it makes after the cost of goods sold, exploded from 32.5 percent in 2015 to 66.7 percent in 2017.\n\n\"The balance sheet? Clean as a whistle,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"The company's using the proceeds of the IPO to pay back its modest amount of debt, and it already [had] $430 million in cash on the balance sheet at the end of last year. Given that they just raised anywhere from $600 [million] to $750 million, Dropbox is going to have a pretty deep pocket for a newly public company.\"\n\nCramer's main point of concern was whether Dropbox would be able to keep turning its non-paying subscribers into paying customers. To maintain its growth rate, it needs to switch between two million and four million free users into paying customers each year.\n\nBut that's less than 1 percent of its 500 million free subscribers, Cramer noted, adding that the company will now have millions of dollars to invest in and bolster the business.\n\n\"Put it all together and I'm a big fan of Dropbox the company and its CEO, Drew Houston,\" he said. \"But what about Dropbox the stock?\"\n\nTrading at 8.5 times next year's sales estimates and 124 times 2019 earnings estimates, Dropbox's stock may seem expensive, but is more or less in line with the other \"cloud kings,\" Cramer said.\n\n\"You have to ask yourself, does it deserve to trade like a cloud king? I think so,\" he continued. \"Dropbox is cheaper than Adobe, but it's growing faster than Adobe. Ideally, I'd like to wait for pullback before telling you to pull the trigger, but you know what? I'm not sure you're going to get one.\"\n\nSo as Dropbox shares settle, Cramer said any cloud-hungry investors should keep an eye on the newest public player in the space.\n\n\"Look, you need to be careful with these red-hot IPOs. That said, I absolutely feel comfortable giving you my blessing to speculate on Dropbox,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"There aren't that many first-class cloud plays out there, and the group will only become more attractive if people keep freaking out about a trade war with China ... because this is the kind of secular growth theme that keeps working even if the economy slows down. I say put on part of your position and then hope the stock of this incredibly well-run company gets slammed so you can buy more later and lower.\"\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

                "body": "Cramer says all the available evidence points to a strong quarter for the Calvin Klein parent.\n\nAfter a week of panic and selling for the stock market, CNBC's Jim Cramer zeroed in on a buying opportunity he thought could bounce back \"like a coiled spring:\" the stock of retailer PVH Corp.\n\nShares of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent company fell sharply during February's market-wide sell-off as investors cooled on retail stocks.\n\n\"But this company reports next Wednesday night, and based on the publicly available clues, ... I bet it will deliver a very good quarter,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said on Friday. \"In short, I think this is your chance to pick up a high-quality piece of merchandise that's now down almost 12 percent from its January highs.\"\n\nTo back up his call, Cramer went over the six pieces of evidence that made him so bullish on PVH ahead of its earnings report.\n\nWhen he starts to analyze a company, Cramer likes to look at its recent earnings performance.\n\n\"In other words, what have they done for you lately?\" he said. \"In the case of PVH, the trend [is] your friend.\"\n\nIn its last eight quarters, PVH has beat Wall Street's earnings estimates eight times and topped revenue estimates seven times, with the only revenue miss occurring a year and a half ago.\n\nMost of PVH's quarterly results have also topped the company's own guidance. And while Cramer recognized that past performance doesn't guarantee future results, he liked the bullish signs.\n\n\"It helps to know that in recent years, PVH has become a well-oiled machine,\" he said. \"Even better, the company's sales have been accelerating over the past few years and accelerating revenue growth is something Wall Street loves so much that we normally just call it by its acronym in Cramerica, ARG.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Piper Jaffray retail analyst Erinn Murphy published a note highlighting the strength of PVH's Calvin Klein business in China.\n\nPeople may be worried about Chinese retaliation against U.S. companies because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, but Cramer saw more good than bad in Murphy's note.\n\n\"This strength in Asia [is] a double-edged sword,\" he admitted. \"But the company has far more exposure to the U.S. and Europe. And look, I'd rather they have a booming Chinese business that might come under threat than a lousy Chinese business that isn't worth threatening.\"\n\nCramer firmly believes that \"the single best place to learn about any publicly-held company\" is from its quarterly earnings conference calls.\n\nIn PVH's call for the quarter that ended in November, management told a very optimistic story, Cramer said. Even though that was months ago, PVH's next quarter lasted from November to January -- the heart of the holiday season, he noted.\n\nPVH CEO Manny Chirico also told Cramer in November that early holiday sales were \"running well ahead of [PVH's] financial plans,\" and that December would see \"a lot of momentum, tighter inventories\" and less promotional activity -- all bullish statements for a retailer.\n\nCramer's next clue? \"Everything we've heard from other companies reinforces the idea that the fourth quarter was fabulous for PVH's apparel business,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Mastercard, online and in-store holiday spending grew by 4.9 percent year over year. Kohl's same-store sales, a key metric for retailers, grew by 6.9 percent. Nordstrom saw the best holiday season in three years.\n\nNike's Thursday earnings report was also strong, with CEO Mark Parker talking about \"a strong global appetite for athletic footwear and apparel\" on the conference call.\n\nA global operator that gets roughly 75 percent of its operating income from overseas, PVH benefits from a weak dollar. This happens because as the dollar sinks versus other currencies, PVH products get cheaper in other countries and foreign earnings translate into more dollars.\n\n\"This will be a major tailwind for the quarter the company reports next week,\" Cramer said.\n\nBecause PVH makes apparel, it's not directly subject to the chronic pain of the brick-and-mortar retailers struggling to compete with Amazon, Cramer explained.\n\n\"Think of them as an arms dealer to everyone in retail, including Amazon, ... one of the company's long-standing partners,\" he said. \"Together with Amazon, they created a bunch of Calvin Klein pop-up stores in New York and Los Angeles. This was a holiday exclusive and I have a very good feeling about these numbers.\"\n\nThe \"Mad Money\" host did have one caveat about PVH's quarter, even though he liked its stock as a buy on its recent weakness.\n\n\"Even if the numbers are excellent, if Chrico says anything really worrisome about the escalating trade dispute with China, it could torpedo the whole story,\" Cramer said, noting how much exposure the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands have in the Chinese market.\n\n\"Here's the bottom line: even with the newfound trade war worries, I think the stock of PVH has come down too far too fast,\" Cramer concluded. \"This company is set to report what I believe will be a terrific quarter next week and, given how well apparel has been selling, I think it's absolutely worth buying ahead of earnings.\"\n\nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nordstrom and Amazon.\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

                "title": "Uber's self-driving cars were struggling before Arizona crash",
                "body": "An Uber driverless Ford Fusion drives down Smallman Street on September, 22, 2016 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nUber's robotic vehicle project was not living up to expectations months before a self-driving car operated by the company struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Ariz.\n\nThe cars were having trouble driving through construction zones and next to tall vehicles, like big rigs. And Uber's human drivers had to intervene far more frequently than the drivers of competing autonomous car projects.\n\nWaymo, formerly the self-driving car project of Google, said that in tests on roads in California last year, its cars went an average of nearly 5,600 miles before the driver had to take control from the computer to steer out of trouble. As of March, Uber was struggling to meet its target of 13 miles per \"intervention\" in Arizona, according to 100 pages of company documents obtained by The New York Times and two people familiar with the company's operations in the Phoenix area but not permitted to speak publicly about it.\n\nYet Uber's test drivers were being asked to do more -- going on solo runs when they had worked in pairs.\n\nAnd there also was pressure to live up to a goal to offer a driverless car service by the end of the year and to impress top executives. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, was expected to visit Arizona in April, and leaders of the company's development group in the Phoenix area wanted to give him a glitch-free ride in an autonomous car. Mr. Khosrowshahi's trip was called \"Milestone 1: Confidence\" in the company documents.\n\nRead more from the New York Times:\n\nWhere self-driving cars go to learn\n\nWaymo's autonomous cars cut out human drivers in road tests\n\nBolton was early beneficiary of cambridge analytica's Facebook data\n\nTech companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft, as well as automakers like General Motors and Toyota, have spent billions developing self-driving cars in the belief that the market for them could one day be worth trillions of dollars.\n\nThe crash, which occurred Sunday night, was a major setback for Uber, which has been trying to improve its image since Mr. Khosrowshahi replaced Travis Kalanick as the company's chief executive in a messy transfer of power last August. In February, Uber also settled a longstanding legal fight with Waymo.\n\nThe death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.\n\nOn Monday, Uber halted autonomous car tests in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. It is not clear when the company will revive them.\n\nThe Tempe Police Department said it was investigating the crash, and has not determined whether the car was at fault. A Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle equipped with Uber's sensing technology struck Elaine Herzberg, 49, while it was going 40 miles an hour in a 45-mile-an-hour zone. According to the police, the car, with one safety driver and operating in autonomous mode, did not slow down before impact.\n\nA video shot from the vehicle's dashboard camera showed the safety driver looking down, away from the road. It also appeared that the driver's hands were not hovering above the steering wheel, which is what drivers are instructed to do so they can quickly retake control of the car. Ms. Herzberg, pushing a bicycle across the street, appeared in the camera right before she was hit.\n\n\"As we develop self-driving technology, safety is our primary concern every step of the way,\" said Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman. \"We're heartbroken by what happened this week, and our cars remain grounded. We continue to assist investigators in any way we can.\"\n\nUber has been testing its self-driving cars in a regulatory vacuum in Arizona. There are few federal rules governing the testing of autonomous cars. Unlike California, where Uber had been testing since spring of 2017, Arizona state officials had taken a hands-off approach to autonomous vehicles and did not require companies to disclose how their cars were performing.\n\nWaymo and Cruise, a self-driving car company owned by GM, reported their \"intervention\" numbers to California regulators. Uber's goals in Arizona were mentioned in internal documents -- Arizona does not have reporting requirements -- and it has not been testing self-driving cars in California long enough to be required to report them.\n\nUber's first road tests in its self-driving car effort, code-named Project Roadrunner, were actually in Pittsburgh in September 2016. The Phoenix area was added a year ago, and quickly became the company's main testing ground, with 400 employees and more than 150 autonomous cars driving local roads because of \"favorable regulatory environment, favorable weather conditions,\" according to a company document.\n\nWhen Mr. Khosrowshahi took over as Uber's chief executive, he had considered shutting down the self-driving car operations, according to two other people familiar with Mr. Khosrowshahi's thinking.\n\nBut he became convinced that it was important to Uber's long-term prospects. His visit to Phoenix was seen by the Arizona team as a critical opportunity to demonstrate their progress, according to the people familiar with the company's operations in the Phoenix area. They wanted to take him on a ride without human interventions to demonstrate that the cars could handle so-called edge cases, tricky road situations that are hard to predict.\n\n\"With autonomy, the edge cases kill you, so you've got to build out for all the edge cases,\" Mr. Khosrowshahi said at a conference in November. \"Which makes it a very, very difficult problem.\"\n\nBy September 2017, Uber's autonomous cars had driven one million miles in a year nationwide. Uber tallied its second million in 100 days and added its next million at an even faster clip, according to company documents.\n\nEarly on in Phoenix, there were two groups of test drivers. A smaller group \"stressed\" the cars by putting them in challenging situations where, without human intervention, they would have crashed.\n\nA larger group of drivers was focused on picking up customers in the autonomous vehicles. Those drivers were expected to pay more attention to little details, often taking control to prevent a \"bad experience\" like hard braking, according to a company document.\n\nAround October, Uber merged the two groups to get to a point where it could offer a truly driverless car service to customers \"as quickly as possible.\" The customer pickup service was mostly dropped so drivers could focus on accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable.\n\nAround the same time, Uber moved from two employees in every car to one. The paired employees had been splitting duties -- one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed, and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting. The second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on a laptop computer. Mr. Kallman, the Uber spokesman, said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks, not safety.\n\nWaymo had also moved from two operators at all times to one in some situations in late 2015, said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. Waymo still uses two test drivers when it is adding new systems or moving to a new location.\n\nBut Uber's autonomous cars are not operating nearly as well as those of its competitors. Cruise reported to California regulators that it went more than 1,200 miles per intervention. After its strong California results, Waymo is now testing cars in Chandler, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb, with no safety drivers.\n\nMr. Kallman said miles per intervention was not a measure of safety but a rate of system improvement that could differ depending on where and how the cars were driven.\n\nWhen Uber moved to a single operator, some employees expressed safety concerns to managers, according to the two people familiar with Uber's operations. They were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving. Mr. Kallman said it delayed the start of its single-driver initiative to allow for more training and to make sure drivers felt comfortable for the new role.\n\nUber also developed an app, mounted on an iPad in the car's middle console, for drivers to alert engineers to problems. Drivers could use the app anytime without shifting the car out of autonomous mode. Often, drivers would annotate data at a traffic light or a stop, but many did so while the car was moving, said the two people familiar with Uber's operations. Mr. Kallman said it designed the app to meet government safety guidelines for in-car software to minimize distractions.\n\nWaymo had a different solution when it moved to a single safety driver. It added a button on the steering wheel for drivers to create an audio explanation when they took the car out of autonomous mode.\n\nNot all drivers followed Uber's training. One was fired after falling asleep at the wheel and being spotted by a colleague. Another was spotted air drumming as the autonomous car passed through an intersection, according to the two people familiar with Uber's operations.\n\nUber was planning to seek regulatory approval by December to start a self-driving car service in Arizona, according to company documents. Uber said the vehicles would have to be safer than human drivers before they would commercialize it. They would not operate around the clock and would stop for bad weather or traffic. And the service did not need to prove \"longer-term financial viability.\"\n\nAlready, one milestone will be missed. Mr. Khosrowshahi will not travel to Phoenix next month, because of scheduling problems that came up before the crash, Mr. Kallman said. But it is unclear how the crash will ultimately affect Uber's plans for autonomous vehicles.\n\n\"The collection of bad news around Uber creates a reputation in people's minds,\" said Michael Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner. \"Every other company would get a black eye, too, but they might be forgiven. For Uber, it's going to be hard to shake.\"",

                "body": "Cramer lives in hope, even as he admits that the president's moves have started to weigh on stocks.\n\nCNBC's Jim Cramer was disheartened to see the market tumble again on Friday after a week of Washington turmoil turned stocks sour.\n\n\"I hate to say it, but I honestly think the president's become pretty frightening to investors in the stock market,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"Maybe if things calm down [and] the White House starts trying to make deals instead of making enemies, then the earnings will matter again. They sure didn't matter to the market's trajectory this week because we had some very good [reports], but I live in hope.\"\n\nWith that hope in mind, Cramer turned to his weekly game plan:\n\nPaychex: This old Cramer-fave will report earnings on Monday. Shares of the payroll processor are down dramatically from when it last reported.\n\n\"Yet we've had a rate hike since it reported, which is bullish for Paychex because their clients give them money and they collect interest on it until they deposit your wages in your account,\" Cramer said. \"Plus, we've had very robust employment. I think these guys are going to have a very good story to tell.\"\n\nRed Hat: While Cramer expected the cloud play's earnings report to be fine, he was worried about Red Hat's stock, which has run up 23 percent for the year.\n\n\"It's almost impossible for any stock to live up to that, and Red Hat has enough key reporting variables ... that I think someone will find fault with one of them,\" he said.\n\n\"I wish I didn't have to say this because it's one of my favorite companies with one of my favorite CEOs, but I'd be tempted to recommend ringing the register on some of your position going into the quarter just in case we get a confusing report card.\"\n\nNew York Fed: New York Fed President William Dudley will speak on Monday. Cramer said the Fed chief, who is set to retire this summer, could be \"a little more freewheeling\" in his speech and address the presidential tariffs, tax cuts and inflation with more candor than usual.\n\nMcCormick: The spices and condiments maker will report earnings on Tuesday amid a confusing backdrop in the food space, with some missed earnings reports and some strong beats.\n\n\"Which will McCormick give us, especially now that it has Frank's Hot Sauce under its wing?\" Cramer wondered. \"This spice company is not prone to misses and yet its stock is down 10 percent already. It's tough to bet against these guys at these levels.\"\n\nRH: The company formerly known as Restoration Hardware will also report, and Cramer was bullish on the furniture chain ahead of earnings.\n\n\"I think the company is brilliantly run. I don't understand why it's only valued at $1.65 billion,\" he said. \"But when you consider it was worth a little less than half that at this time last year, maybe it's not a totally outrageous valuation.\"\n\nNvidia: An investor day at the chipmaker will offer market-watchers a glance at the \"cutting edge of technology\" when co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks, Cramer said.\n\n\"Jensen's the go-to CEO when it comes to semiconductors for the data center, for gaming, and for autonomous vehicles, among many areas,\" he continued. \"He's been known to move whole markets when he speaks, so [we'll] be paying close attention.\"\n\nHealthy Returns: Cramer will host CNBC's first Healthy Returns conference on Wednesday to examine every corner of the U.S. health-care system.\n\nWalgreen's: The market will also get an earnings report from drugstore chain Walgreen's, which has been squeezed by competition from the all-encompassing Amazon.\n\n\"Here's a former market darling that's fallen from the $80s to the $60s over the last year,\" Cramer said. \"Walgreen's has been in its own personal bear market ... and even a good quarter may not be enough to save it.\"\n\nPVH: Even though it does a lot of business in China, Cramer expected Calvin Klein parent PVH to deliver a strong quarter for six reasons that he detailed later in the show.\n\nBeer, wine and liquor giant Constellation Brands will report earnings on Thursday and Cramer anticipated a good report.\n\n\"Constellation missed the last time it reported,\" he noted. \"The culprit was the wine business and CEO Rob Sands explained to us that the issue was a short-term phenomenon. Either way, I think the beer business is on fire.\"\n\nMarkets will be closed on Good Friday, and if the market turmoil continues, the bulls will cherish the day off, Cramer said.\n\n\"The bottom line? Hopefully the White House will get a grip, allowing the market to calm down so we can get back to a placid planet where we focus on earnings again, not government policy,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But be prepared for more chaos just in case nothing changes.\"\n\nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia, Amazon and Constellation Brands.\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

                "title": "North America's largest steel tube CEO says tariffs are first step in revamping trade",
                "body": "President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs are only the first step in re-evaluating trade, said a steel industry CEO.\n\n\"We think this is the first round of those type of negotiated solutions, which will probably be a combination of tariffs and quotas,\" Barry Zekelman, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Zekelman Industries, told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\"We do need imports of steel, but we need them responsibly traded in here and at responsible volumes,\" Zekelman said on \"Closing Bell.\" \"We're looking to stem the quantum flow of imports into the country, so we can produce more steel and employ more people.\"\n\nTrump signed an executive memorandum on Thursday, imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports. The tariffs are intended to penalize China for trade practices that the Trump administration says involve stealing American companies' intellectual property. Earlier this month Trump signed an order imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nHowever, the U.S. has granted Canada, Mexico, Australia, the European Union, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea, a temporary exemption from the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nZekelman said excluding so many countries from the tariffs, in particular South Korea and Brazil, would be a mistake, because then China could simply purchase products by way of another country.\n\n\"I don't see that happening,\" he said. Instead Zekelman said he thinks how much each country will be exempted is up for negotiation.\n\nZekelman, whose company is the largest independent steel tube manufacturer in North America, with sales exceeding $2.7 billion each year, has been pro steel tariffs for some time. When news broke earlier this month about the tariffs, Zekelman Industries released a press release saying the company would hand out $1,000 bonuses to each employee after the tariffs were implemented, and each year after on the anniversary of the tariffs.\n\nLast August, Barry Zekelman told CNBC: \"The pipe and tube industry has been used as a conduit for foreign steel producers, primarily China, to circumvent duties and decimate our industry for many years. We are tired of playing 'whack-a-mole.' The future of our industry is at stake, we don't want handouts, just fair trade!\"\n\nA \"realistic\" solution, by way of negotiated tariffs, Zekelman said, would be good for not only the U.S. and American workers, but also for the European Union.\n\n\"That's what it's about: employee more people,\" he said.",

                "body": "Dropbox celebrates their IPO at the Nasdaq market site, March 23, 2018.\n\nY Combinator, the influential start-up accelerator, almost passed on a chance to invest in Dropbox because it had misgivings about bringing on a solo entrepreneur.\n\nAfter Drew Houston, the creator of Dropbox, scrambled to find a co-founder in time for his in-person interview, the company was admitted into YC in 2007. Four years later, venture capitalists poured money into Dropbox at a $4 billion valuation.\n\nYC has since become a power player in Silicon Valley, helping spawn numerous companies valued at over $1 billion today including Stripe, Airbnb, Instacart and Coinbase. It also backed Twitch, which Amazon acquired in 2014 for about $970 million, and the self-driving tech start-up Cruise, which GM bought in 2016 for over $1 billion.\n\nBut in its 13-year history, YC had yet to see any of its companies go public until Dropbox's stock market debut on Friday. Shares of the cloud file storage company surged 36 percent to $28.48 in their first day of trading, giving the company a market value of over $11 billion.\n\nHouston is now worth over $3 billion and co-founder Arash Ferdowsi owns shares valued at more than $1 billion. According to estimates from Pitchbook, Y Combinator bought shares in Dropbox for 3 cents, though it's not disclosing how many it owns. Over the past 11 years, Dropbox took money from at least 95 different investors (including some who obtained shares via secondary sales), according to AngelList.\n\nWhile the Dropbox IPO marks a watershed moment for Y Combinator, it probably won't change much about the way the fund and organization operate. YC has been in a years-long process of scaling, investing in a wider variety of founders and technologies, and providing start-ups with help through various stages of growth.\n\nY Combinator president Sam Altman said founders should study the fundraising approach employed by Dropbox.\n\n\"They did a great job of managing their dilution -- most of what they raised, they raised after the company was worth a lot,\" he said. \"That's in contrast to startups today who are raising very large seed rounds and selling a lot of their companies at a low price.\"\n\nYC has plenty more IPOs to look forward to in the future, but it could take a while. Airbnb has said it could debut as early as next year and Stripe's CEO said in late 2017 that an offering for his company was \"years away,\" according to The Information.",

                "body": "On Friday, as investors reacted to the possibility of a trade war between the United States and China, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 400 points into correction territory, marking its worst week since January 2016. The Dow dropped a total of 5.7 percent over the week, while the S&P 500 fell 5.9 percent and the Nasdaq composite fell 6.5 percent.\n\nThat leaves many investors worried and wondering what to do.\n\nDuring times of stress and uncertainty, Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett recommends keeping a level head. In response to wild market fluctuations back in 2016, he told CNBC that buy-and-hold is still the best strategy.\n\n\"Don't watch the market closely,\" he advised those worried about their retirement savings at the time. \"If they're trying to buy and sell stocks, and worry when they go down a little bit ... and think they should maybe sell them when they go up, they're not going to have very good results.\"\n\nMost analysts still consider this drop to be a normal correction, as opposed to a sign of an incipient bear market. Though losses are unsettling after 2017, the first year in history where the S&P 500 showed gains every month, Nick Holeman, a CFP at Betterment, agrees that you shouldn't panic.\n\nHe tells CNBC Make It that he recommends investors \"re-watch their favorite Super Bowl commercials, get ice cream with their kids and say hi to a friend they haven't spoken with in a while.\"\n\n\"As long as you are invested appropriately for your goals, stay away from your investment portfolio,\" he says.\n\nThat said, if the drop does turn out to be more prolonged than expected, things get more complicated. Holeman recommends that investors be sure to re-balance their portfolios. \"When market volatility picks up, your portfolio can get unbalanced, which means you may be taking more or less risk than you think.\"\n\nHe also advises tax loss harvesting, \"a time-tested strategy that uses market losses to help save taxes.\" It entails selling an investment in order to generate a loss that will ultimately maximize your tax-return.\n\nAmid small market fluctuations, however, and even a normal bull-market correction, the consensus is that you should not make any rash decisions.\n\nLike this story?

On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive memo that will slap tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports. China responded on Friday by proposing a list of 128 U.S. products as potential retaliation targets.\n\nWhile experts have called China's response muted, a former advisor to President George W. Bush, John Rutledge, expects to hear more from China. \"They're going to come back hard,\" he told \"Power Lunch\" earlier Friday.\n\nCashin said numbers are \"being thrown around wildly,\" noting that Trump's $60 billion figure is the size of the trade. He expects the tariffs to be more like $3 billion to $4 billion.\n\nAnother factor in the sell-off was the thin volume, or lack of people in the market, on Friday, he said.\n\n\"You get a disproportionate effect. A small amount of selling takes the index lower than normal because there's just nothing there to hold it back,\" Cashin said.\n\nThe veteran trader has been in the business for more than 50 years, beginning his career at Thomson McKinnon in 1959. In 1964, at age 23, he became a member of the NYSE and a partner in P.R. Herzig & Co.\n\n-- CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.",

                "title": "Conservatives rip Trump for signing massive spending bill that ignores many of their priorities",
                "body": "President Donald Trump speaks about the spending bill during a press conference in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House on March 23, 2018.\n\nSome of the nation's loudest and most prominent conservative voices tore into President Donald Trump on Friday, lambasting the president over his decision to sign a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill just hours after he threatened to veto it. The attacks represented a swift about-face from a group that typically comprises some of Trump's biggest cheerleaders.\n\nLaura Ingraham, the conservative radio host, wrote on Twitter that it was a \"missed opportunity\" for the president. \"If he loses the House, Dems will go straight to impeachment,\" she added.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM TWEET\n\nAuthor and commentator Ann Coulter also warned the president that signing the bill, and thereby betraying his conservative base, could lead to his impeachment.\n\n\"I will never sign another bill like this again,\" Coulter quoted Trump saying during remarks about the bill. \"Yeah, because you'll be impeached,\" Coulter added below the quote.\n\nCoulter, whose most recent book was titled, \"In Trump We Trust,\" also labeled Trump as \"President Schumer,\" a reference to liberal Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nANN COULTER TWEET\n\nThe actor and outspoken conservative James Woods also also took a swipe at the president, writing: \"The Democrats gave you the rope, Mr. President, and you just hanged yourself with it.\" He added the hashtag #ByeByeGOP, an apparent reference to the Republican majority in Congress.\n\nJAMES WOODS TWEET\n\nAt the White House on Friday, Trump tried to justify his decision to sign the bill by saying it was in the interest of national security. The measure contains billions of dollars in additional spending for the Pentagon, which Republicans sought. Yet it also has funding for discretionary domestic programs, which Democrats demanded in order to help get the bill over the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. To staunch fiscal conservatives, this combination was the worst possible outcome.\n\nThe bill Trump eventually signed also angered conservatives by maintaining funding for Planned Parenthood, the nonprofit women's health-care provider and perennial target of the right.\n\nAnti-abortion activists had hoped the spending bill would expand the current ban on taxpayer funding of abortions, known as the Hyde Amendment, to include private insurers who received federal bailout money. They wanted the omnibus to contain a so-called \"conscience protection\" clause, allowing health care providers to refuse to perform abortions if the procedure violates their religious or moral beliefs. But neither of these were included in the final legislation.\n\nMuch of the frustration on the far right was exacerbated by Trump himself, specifically his by suggestion Friday morning that he could veto the spending bill. He said the reasons he objected to the spending bill were that \"800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\n\nTRUMP TWEET\n\nThe president's tweet immediately raised hopes among prominent conservatives that Trump would veto the spending bill, and potentially even force a partial government shutdown. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was one of the lawmakers encouraged by Trump's tweet.\n\nMARK MEADOWS TWEET\n\nWhen the president failed to follow through on his threat, conservatives took it doubly hard. The right-wing news aggregation site the Drudge Report wasted no time hammering Trump, calling him out for a \"FAKE VETO.\"\n\nBut it was Erick Erickson, a widely respected voice on the right, who perhaps best captured what conservatives were feeling on Friday afternoon.\n\nERIC ERICKSON TWEET\n\nThe bill will keep the government funded through the end of September, when the usual spending negotiations will be made all the more sensitive by the impending midterm elections in November.",

                "body": "U.S. Marines during a graduation ceremony aboard Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Parris Island, S.C.\n\nAfter teasing a potential veto of the colossal $1.3 trillion omnibus, President Donald Trump signed the spending bill into law Friday touting it as a \"matter of national security.\"\n\n\"We had no choice but to fund our military because we have to have by far the strongest military in the world,\" Trump said during an impromptu White House press event. \"You see the players out there and you see what we are dealing with.\"\n\nTrump's signature on the 2,200-page legislation grants the most significant increase in defense funding in the past 15 years. The Department of Defense is set to gain $61 billion more than last year's enacted funding for a top line of $700 billion.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan referred to the bill as the \"Trump-Jim Mattis budget,\" on \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday morning. He added: \"Obama shortchanged our military, this fixes us.\"\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis, who stood behind Trump during the presser, framed the bill as a needed measure to preserve the lethality of U.S. forces.\n\n\"Today we have received the largest military budget in history, reversing many years of declining and unpredictable funding, and together we are going to make our military stronger than ever,\" Mattis said. \"We in the military are humbled and grateful to the American people for their sacrifices on behalf of this funding. Now, it is our responsibility in the military to spend every dollar wisely in order to keep the trust and the confidence of the American people and the Congress.\"\n\nThe funding in the defense-friendly bill will be spread over the Pentagon's base budget of $589.5 billion and $65.2 billion for the overseas contingency operations, or OCO, budget. The remainder of the $700 billion is appropriated to other defense-related programs outside the Department of Defense.\n\nThe measure also provides $238 billion for operations and maintenance, $89.2 billion for research and development, $9.5 billion for the Missile Defense Agency and $137.7 billion for personnel pay - a 2.4 percent increase from fiscal year 2017.\n\nThe omnibus allocates $144.3 billion for military equipment procurement, too. Here's a look at some of the big-ticket items:\n\n- $1.1 billion for the upgrade of 85 Abrams tanks: America's stalwart M1 Abrams, used in nearly every major U.S. conflict since its inception in 1980, serves as the main battle tank of the Army and Marines. At close to 70 tons, the mighty Abrams tank is among the heaviest in the world, but it makes up for its weight with terrifying firepower and impressive maneuverability.\n\n- $483 million for the upgrade of 145 Bradley fighting vehicles\n\n- $300 million for Stryker lethality upgrades\n\n- $23.8 billion for 14 ships: \"Our Navy is at about the lowest point in terms of ships that it has been in over a 100 years,\" Trump said. \"We are adding a significant number of extremely advanced, advanced vessels.\"\n\nThe Navy ship procurement includes funding for one aircraft carrier replacement, two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, two Virginia-class submarines, three littoral combat ships, one expeditionary sea base, one expeditionary fast transport, one amphibious ship replacement, one fleet oiler, one rescue ship, and one oceanographic survey ship.\n\n- $10.2 billion for 90 F-35 fighter jets: Lockheed Martin's fifth-generation stealth fighter, valued at an acquisition cost of $406.5 billion, is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons system.\n\nTrump called the F-35 \"the most sophisticated aircraft in the world\" and noted its stealth capabilities.\n\n\"They're hard to find, they're hard to see, therefore they are hard to beat. It's very tough to beat a plane when you can't see,\" Trump said.\n\n- $1.8 billion for 24 F/A-18 fighter jets: Earlier this month, Trump called Boeing's F-18 fighter jet \"a work of art\" and said it was \"his favorite plane.\"\n\nTrump also noted that the U.S. plans to buy 24 more F-18 jets, saying the planes would be the \"latest and the greatest stealth and a lot of things on that plane that people don't even know about.\"\n\nAnd while the Navy and Boeing are currently negotiating a service life modification contract that could add some components native to a stealth aircraft, as it stands now, Boeing does not field stealthy F-18s capable of evading radar.\n\n- $1.1 billion for 56-UH 60 Black Hawk helicopters: Trump described Sikorsky's Black Hawk helicopters as \"fighting machines\" and the \"most advanced helicopters in the world.\"\n\n- $1.6 billion for 30 new and 50 remanufactured Apache helicopters\n\n- $2.9 billion for 15 KC-46 tanker aircraft: Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of jetliners, has missed several deadlines for the Air Force's new aerial refueling tanker.\n\nThe defense giant is currently under contract to deliver 18 tankers to the Air Force by the end of this year.\n\n\"The tanker aircraft is very important based on everything. It allows our planes to travel anywhere in the world without landing,\" Trump said.",

                "title": "Warren Buffett recommends investing in index funds  --  but many of his employees don't have that option",
                "body": "This article was co-published with The Washington Post.\n\nWarren Buffett, the most successful investor of our time, is a huge fan of low-cost index funds -- funds that replicate a market index rather than try to outperform it -- as the way for the average investor to succeed in the stock market. \"By periodically investing in an index fund ... the know-nothing investor can actually outperform most investment professionals,\" he wrote in his 1993 letter to shareholders of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. \"Paradoxically, when 'dumb' money acknowledges its limitations, it ceases to be dumb.\"\n\nHe returned to the subject in this 2016 letter, writing, \"Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds.\" And in his newest shareholder letter, Buffett said that one reason he made a widely publicized bet (which he has now won) that a low-cost Vanguard index fund would outperform a group of hedge funds over a 10-year period was \"to publicize my conviction that my pick -- a virtually cost-free investment in an unmanaged S&P 500 index fund -- would, over time, deliver better results than those achieved by most investment professionals, however well regarded and incentivized those 'helpers' may be.\"\n\nMore from ProPublica:\n\n'Cutting' old heads at IBM\n\nSeeing Journalism Make a Difference in Election Results\n\nHow the Crowd Led Us to Investigate IBM\n\nGiven Buffett's praise of index funds -- specifically, those with low fees -- you'd think that all the employees at Berkshire Hathaway companies would get to practice what the boss preaches by being able to invest their 401(k) money in such funds.\n\nBut you'd be wrong.\n\nIt turns out that employees of many Berkshire subsidiaries have the same problem -- and it's one that, as we'll see, also affects millions of Americans outside of Buffett's companies. To wit, your employer, not you, chooses your 401(k) investment options and your choices may be less than optimal either because your employer doesn't know any better or because your employer's interests are different from yours.\n\nYou wouldn't expect to see this problem at a company run by a brilliant investor like Buffett, but it's there. I've looked at the retirement plans of each Berkshire subsidiary whose investment options I could find on file at the Labor Department, which turned out to be about 50 of the 63 subsidiaries listed on Berkshire's website.\n\nEach offers its own investment options rather than having Buffett or someone else at headquarters pick a package of suitable company-wide investments. That's not surprising in one sense: Buffett is famously hands-off in how he oversees the companies owned by Berkshire.\n\nBut the result is that many of the subsidiaries offer little or nothing in the way of index funds. And even when they do offer such funds, different Berkshire employees can end up paying wildly divergent fees for the same investment, depending on which operation they work for. Those differences can cost -- or save -- them tens of thousands of dollars over the course of decades.\n\nConsider two examples that I got from a list assembled by Eli Fried, an investment consultant who advises pension and endowment funds and is the person who brought the Berkshire disparities to my attention. Fried told me he was looking at 401(k) investment options offered by the top companies on Fortune's list of most admired companies and was surprised by what he found at Berkshire.\n\nOn the index fund front, there's a big difference between the S&P 500 index funds that employees of Berkshire-owned NetJets, General Re, GEICO, FlightSafety, Clayton Homes and H.H. Brown Shoe Group can buy, and the one that BoatU.S. employees can buy. BoatU.S. employees pay a fee of 0.62 percent, or $62 a year for a $10,000 investment. That's more than 15 times the 0.04 percent -- $4 a year per $10,000 -- that employees of the six other Berkshire companies pay.\n\nThere are also some big differences in fees among the actively managed funds that Berkshire companies make available. Employees of Business Wire pay a 0.5 percent ($50 per $10,000 invested) for shares in American Funds' EuroPacific Growth Fund, while employees of Applied Underwriters, Jordan's Furniture and MiTek pay 1.14 percent ($114 per $10,000).\n\nAs a longtime Berkshire shareholder, a contrarian from birth and someone who's watched Buffett for more than 40 years, I was intrigued when Fried approached me. And I was shocked at the huge differences among the plans that emerged when I did my own digging.\n\nFor example, as of year-end 2016 -- the most recent information the Labor Department has on file -- Borsheim's Fine Jewelry offered employees 71 investment options, virtually all of which (other than 10 Vanguard target date retirement funds) consisted of actively managed funds, while Precision Steel Warehouse and Nebraska Furniture Mart offered a relative handful of options, most of which were low-cost index funds. Precision and Nebraska Furniture also offered Berkshire common stock as an investment option, which only a handful of the plans did.\n\nThere are plenty of other examples of disparities among the plans, but by now, I think, you get the point. The most successful investor of our age, who advises average investors to buy low-cost index funds (which have become wildly popular at least in part because of his longtime advocacy of them) presides over a company where many employees don't have a chance to invest as he suggests.\n\nI would love to give you Buffett's explanation for this -- Berkshire is highly decentralized, as I told you, and it's possible that until recently he might not have known about the big differences among the plans that its subsidiaries offer -- but I can't.\n\nHe wouldn't respond to my detailed request for comment. Nor would Marc Hamburg, Berkshire's chief financial officer.\n\nThe four Berkshire subsidiaries I asked to discuss their 401(k) choices wouldn't respond, either. The four are BoatU.S., Borsheim's, See's Candy and Applied Underwriters.\n\nWhy am I taking you through all of this? Three reasons.\n\nFirst, because when a plainspoken, widely admired investment god like Buffett proves to have feet of clay, I think people should know about it.\n\nSecond, because the investment choices offered in 401(k) plans are a big deal. Along with Social Security, they are almost certain to be the major retirement vehicles of the future, given the vast shrinkage of traditional pensions. About 63 million people have access to 401(k) plans. Some 87 percent of the retirement plans that serve them now offer at least one index fund, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America. But the biggest portion of employees' retirement investments still consists of actively managed domestic stock funds, according to the PSCA.\n\nThird, because the Berkshire situation typifies the fact that when it comes to 401(k) plans, your employer's interests may be different from yours.\n\nTake target date funds, the big trend in retirement plans these days. You pick a year in which you'll be old enough to retire -- say 2035 -- and buy into a fund that gradually changes over to a more conservative investment mix as the target date nears.\n\nHowever, not all target date funds are the same. Vanguard's consist entirely of low-cost index funds, as do Fidelity's Freedom Index funds (though not its other target date funds). Their average management fee was 0.13 and 0.12 of one percent, respectively, as of year-end 2016, according to Morningstar. But most other target date funds are actively managed, with fees four or five times as high.\n\nI think that a major reason for these differences and for the differences among Berkshire funds is that the more fees an employee pays for her 401(k) funds, the lower the recordkeeping, administrative, custodial and other costs her employer has to pay. In essence, some employers save money by having their employees pick up more of the tab.\n\nI stumbled on this back in the day, when I was trying to figure out why an index fund that I owned in my personal Vanguard account carried a lower management fee than in my Washington Post Co. 401(k) account. Someone who shall remain nameless explained to me that this was the way of the world -- if I paid less, my employer would pay more.\n\nI suspect that if I could get someone at Berkshire or its subsidiaries to talk candidly with me, they'd say this phenomenon explains many if not most of the disparities among the Berkshire plans.\n\nIn order to get perspective on all this, I discussed the Berkshire situation with two experts -- Ric Edelman of the Edelman Financial Services financial planning firm, and Teresa Ghilarducci, a retirement maven who teaches economics at the New School for Social Research in New York. Neither of them knew about the Berkshire situation until I told them about it. \"In today's marketplace, there's no longer any excuse for saddling employees with high-cost retirement plans. Employers can offer low-cost investments while keeping their own costs very low,\" Edelman told me.\n\n\"The practice of pushing the costs onto employees and offering dozens of funds doesn't meet today's standards,\" Ghilarducci said.\n\nSo there you have it. Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting is on May 5. With luck, someone will ask Buffett the questions about Berkshire's 401(k) plans that he wouldn't answer when I posed them. It would sure be interesting to hear what he says.\n\nDISCLOSURES: The 403(b) plan of ProPublica and the 401(k) plan of The Washington Post, co-publishers of this article, both have what I consider excellent investment options, heavily weighted to low-cost index funds. I don't participate in either plan. The employer match at the Post was reduced to 1 percent from as much as 5 percent after Jeff Bezos bought the paper in 2014.\n\nAlice Crites of The Washington Post and Derek Kravitz and Claire Perlman of ProPublica provided reporting assistance.",

Michelle Berrey.\n\nMore from Triangle Business Journal:\n\nHere's what N.C. has to lose by Trump's proposed tariffs against China\n\nWhy one economist says N.C. could lose Amazon - and still win\n\nHow these N.C. companies are scoring big as Major League Baseball looks to protect fans\n\nIn fact, data presented by Chimerix at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation in Lisbon, Portugal, showed that one in three pediatric stem cell transplant recipients in a recent study developed an adenovirus infection within six months of transplant. The data also showed that there was a \"greater than ten-fold risk of mortality\" in those recipients with the highest levels of the virus.\n\nThe goal with brincidofovir is to \"decrease the amount of virus in the blood very quickly,\" says Berrey.\n\nChimerix started setting up the first sites for the clinical trial in December, she says, and will continue enrolling to 30 to 35 sites in the U.S. and Europe for the next couple of months. The company expects to see data from the 140-patient trial in the second half of next year, and the program could ultimately lead to the company's first approval of a drug for clinical use.\n\nAside from brincidofovir, Chimerix is also developing the drug for the treatment of human herpesviruses and smallpox in animals. Chimerix is also developing another candidate for the treatment and prevention of norovirus.\n\nThe company currently employs 80 people in Durham, and a team of three people in Europe, which it is looking to build out further in the near future as it believes its first launch will be in Europe, closely followed by the U.S., according to Berrey.",

                "title": "Inching closer to a world without polio",
                "body": "At its height in the 1940s and '50s, polio paralyzed more than 35,000 Americans every year. But thanks to vaccines as well as good hygiene and sanitation practices, polio has largely been forgotten in the developed world.\n\nNow, even in less-developed regions, it's close to being wiped out entirely. But there are still challenges to overcome before polio can join smallpox as a virus that has been eradicated worldwide.\n\nWith the support of the World Health Organization, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (a strategic partner of The Conversation US that provides funding for The Conversation internationally), Rotary International and others, public health workers and volunteers work tirelessly and in dangerous conditions to vaccinate every one of the world's children. The number of polio cases globally dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to just 37 in 2016. Thirty years ago, polio was regularly found in 125 of the world's 190 or so countries. Today, only three countries continue to see regular cases: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan.\n\nMore from The Conversation:\n\nWhy Denmark dominates the World Happiness Report rankings year after year\n\nForced sterilization programs in California once harmed thousands - particularly Latinas\n\nArchbishop Oscar Romero was gunned down inside his own church 38 years ago. Soon he'll become El Salvador's first saint\n\nOf these, Pakistan is closest to becoming polio-free thanks to its persistent, innovative vaccination campaign programs. But its poor security, weak health system and lack of proper sanitation work against this effort.\n\nThe lessons infectious disease preparedness and response researchers like us are learning in Pakistan, during what's hopefully a final push against polio, will also apply elsewhere, as public health experts work to wipe out other infectious diseases around the world.\n\nWild poliovirus is not particularly hardy and can't survive for long in the environment. If the virus cannot find an unvaccinated person to serve as its host, it will die. This fact means vaccination efforts can fully exterminate the virus by denying it a place to live in human hosts.\n\nThe world's polio eradication campaign has already done away with two of the three naturally occurring wild polioviruses. Wild poliovirus type 2 was last seen in 1999, and there has not been a case of wild poliovirus type 3 since 2012.\n\nPolio spreads primarily through water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Where sources of drinking water come into contact with sewage waste - often the case in developing countries like Pakistan - the virus spreads easily.\n\nTo complicate matters, nearly 3 out of 4 people infected with the poliovirus never have any symptoms at all. So most carriers of polio never know they harbor the virus, or that they're spreading it to others.\n\nIn addition, those who do have symptoms usually seem to have the flu, with fever, headaches, body aches and vomiting. In only around 1 percent of cases do symptoms include temporary or permanent paralysis.\n\nThis means that it is possible for the virus to exist and spread in a community even when there are no diagnosed cases of polio. For that reason, public health workers use two different measures to gauge the success of a vaccination effort: the number of people diagnosed with polio, and how much of the virus is found in the environment.\n\nIn Pakistan, these two measures paint somewhat different pictures of disease eradication. The not-so-good news is that 16 percent of the water sources tested in 2017 contain the polio virus, a slight increase from 2016 levels.\n\nThe better news is that from 2014 to 2017, the number of new polio cases dropped a whopping 97 percent, from 306 cases to just eight. The country's government, with the support of the international community, has vaccinated most Pakistanis, which no doubt accounts for the impressive drop in diagnosed cases. However, because vaccination is not universal, the virus persists in some regions of Pakistan and poses a threat to those who are not vaccinated or who have not received vaccination boosters as scheduled.\n\nThere are several cultural barriers to wiping out polio in Pakistan. Vaccinations are usually given at health clinics and transit points, where public health workers can make contact with a large share of the population. Mobile vaccination units reach people in other locations, but cannot safely get to children in high-conflict areas.\n\nIn many of these areas, armed militants refuse to let public health officials vaccinate children, claiming that the polio vaccine is part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslims. In 2012, the Taliban, which remain in control in some mountainous areas, imposed a ban on vaccinations, which slowed the polio eradication effort. Furthermore, polio vaccine campaign workers have been targets of violence, as seen most recently in the killing of a mother-daughter vaccination team in January and an ambush this past week in a remote tribal area that killed two medical workers and wounded two others.\n\nWith armed security, a Pakistani health worker marks a house after administering polio vaccine. AP Photo/Shakil Adil\n\nIn order to overcome some of the challenges, members of the eradication campaign have coordinated vaccination efforts with military operations. When a large military offense in 2015 pushed the Taliban out of the northern provinces of Pakistan, it cleared the way for hundreds of thousands of children to receive vaccination.\n\nHigh illiteracy rates, extreme poverty and religious beliefs also can cause parents to refuse vaccines - in Pakistan and elsewhere - for their children. In these instances, education and outreach are vitally important. Helping parents understand the dangers of disease may help overcome misinformation about the vaccine and increase positive association with vaccination, as it has in the United States.\n\nPublic health officials have two types of polio vaccine in their medical supply kit: an oral vaccine and an inactivated vaccine. Both are necessary to eradicate polio. The oral vaccine is made from live weakened virus. The inactivated version is made with dead virus.\n\nThe oral vaccination works significantly better against naturally occurring poliovirus, known as wild poliovirus. Additionally, the administration method - being given by mouth - is thought to increase vaccine uptake because it does not require an injection.\n\nThe body builds immunity from this live vaccine, and then can withstand the virus if exposed to it in the future. Countries where polio is present must use the oral vaccine in order to eliminate wild poliovirus because the inactivated vaccine does not stop its transmission since it produces lower levels of mucosal immunity.\n\nThough necessary, using the live oral vaccine comes with some challenges. For example, it can cause vaccine-derived cases of polio, which include cases of paralysis. In this unfortunate and extremely rare scenario, the vaccine meant to prevent a terrible illness directly transmits it. Of the 10 billion doses of oral polio vaccine administered since 2000, there have only been 760 cases of vaccine-derived polio.\n\nThough the oral vaccine is vital to the eradication of wild poliovirus, its use must be discontinued as soon as the wild virus is wiped out. Otherwise, it runs the risk of hindering complete eradication by perpetuating existence of poliovirus in the environment through human excrement and continuing to introduce new vaccine-derived cases of the disease.\n\nOnce Pakistan is declared free of wild poliovirus, the eradication campaign must switch to using the inactivated vaccine.\n\nBecause the inactivated vaccine provokes a weaker immune response, it doesn't effectively disrupt transmission of wild poliovirus. But it does protect against the weaker vaccine-derived poliovirus, and it doesn't contribute to vaccine-derived cases. Once the only remaining strains are vaccine-derived, inactivated vaccines can be used to completely wipe out the disease.\n\nIt is likely that a world without polio may not be too far off in the future -- and then infectious disease researchers can make use of the lessons learned in Pakistan as they move the fight to other diseases elsewhere around the world.\n\nCommentary by Christine Crudo Blackburn and Morten Wendelbo , a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Lecturer at Texas A&M University, respectively.

The U.S. goods, including wine, fruit and steel pipes, had an import value of $3 billion in 2017.\n\nRutledge, who has advised government leaders in China, said it comes down to the fact that two individuals are making decisions -- Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping -- rather than a group. Groups tend tend to think rationally, he noted\n\nHowever, not only is there uncertainty surrounding Trump, Xi has basically been named \"emperor of China\" with his recent re-election as president and the removal of term limits on the office, Rutledge said Friday on \"Power Lunch.\"\n\nThat means Xi is \"in a very politically vulnerable spot where he has to show testosterone to his local audience. And so, they're going to come back hard,\" said Rutledge, who was one of the principal architects of the Reagan economic plan.\n\nTrump targeted China on Thursday, when he signed an executive memo that slapped tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nThe new measures are meant to penalize China for trade practices that the Trump administration says involve stealing U.S. companies' intellectual property.\n\nRutledge, now chief investment officer at Safanad and a CNBC economics contributor, said China's initial response was seemingly moderate because it doesn't know what other actions Trump is going to take.\n\n\"We don't see a very firm response here because they're not sure what they're dealing with but they cannot afford to not deal with it, he said.\n\nThings like capital goods, technology and agriculture are vulnerable, he noted.\n\n\"There's big, big dollars there and we don't know when it all stops.\"\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told \"Power Lunch\" on Thursday that he expects some \"ultimate retaliation\" from China but \"I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth.\"\n\n-- CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.",

                "body": "Michael Dell is going to have to sell VMware on a deal to merge. Fortunately for him, he may about $9 billion of found money to play with.\n\nAnd getting the deal done may come down to how much of that he immediately transfers to VMware shareholders.\n\nThe \"found money\" would come from Dell's tracking stock, DVMT, which trades at about a 40 percent discount to VMware for a variety of reasons, including having no voting rights. The tracking stock's purpose is to mimic the performance of VMware within Dell, the closely held technology company owned by Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake.\n\nIf DVMT is consolidated within Dell and VMware, the tracking discount will disappear, as all shareholders will own the same publicly traded stock. There are about 200 million outstanding shares of DVMT, each of which trades around $74. VMware shares trade at about $120. Erasing a discount would be the equivalent of more than $9 billion in new wealth.\n\nTheoretically, that value could be transferred to VMware shareholders through a still-to-be-determined exchange ratio. And VMware's special committee may demand most of it, given the company's consternation over a deal.\n\nVMware employees and shareholders have reacted with concern over a potential merger, especially as the company's shares have slumped on several CNBC stories detailing news of a potential merger.\n\nDell hasn't yet submitted a formal proposal to VMware's special committee, according to people familiar with the matter. Dell is working with Bain & Company to get a perspective on a valuation for the company and an impartial assessment of synergies between the two companies. That is needed so VMware can fairly judge a merger, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\n\nDell, VMware and Bain declined to comment.\n\nStill, the $9 billion, which could be split among DVMT, Dell and VMware shareholders via an exchange ratio, may need to be skewed toward VMware shareholders who are otherwise reluctant to approve a larger, more diversified combined company saddled with debt and lower-growth hardware.\n\nEarlier this week, T. Rowe Price, the largest institutional VMware shareholder, said publicly it opposed a potential merger. T. Rowe owns about 12 percent of all outstanding class A shares.\n\nJericho Capital, which owns about 1.8 percent of outstanding shares, sent a letter to VMware's board of directors earlier this month outlining other potential acquisitions for VMware that would keep the company on a higher growth trajectory.\n\nJericho also said a deal was \"highly concerning\" because it would use VMware's cash to \"go towards servicing Dell's debt instead of towards share buybacks or strategic acquisitions.\" Dell has about $52 billion in debt.\n\nWhile some shareholders have complained, merging with Dell could make the new company more appealing to index funds and technology investors looking for large-cap bellwether investments.\n\nA combined Dell-VMware would fuse Dell's hardware with remaining aspects of EMC's hybrid cloud solution and VMware's virtualization software. Dell acquired EMC -- and its 81 percent stake in VMware -- for $67 billion in the largest pure technology deal in history in 2015.\n\nIf Dell can't get a deal done with VMware, it may sell off other assets for liquidity or potentially pursue a reverse merger through DVMT, becoming a public entity that way, said two of the people. Pivotal Software filed its S-1 for an initial public offering today, which will give Dell proceeds to help pay off its debt. But the VMware deal is still option number one, the people said.\n\nWhile DVMT and VMware shareholders aren't guaranteed shareholder votes on a deal, the Dell and VMware special committees have the option to allow for them.",

                "title": "Cardi B demands to know where her taxes go -- here's the answer",
                "body": "Cardi B attends the Marc Jacobs Fall 2018 fashion show during New York Fashion Week at Park Avenue Armory on February 14, 2018 in New York City.\n\nCardi B might be making \"money moves\" but she's not happy that so much of that money goes to Uncle Sam and she's not sure what she gets in exchange.\n\nThe Bronx-bred rapper reveals that 40 percent of her income goes to taxes in a video posted to Instagram that immediately began going viral. Yet city streets are still dirty, she points out, while subways are rat-infested and prisoners live in sordid conditions.\n\nTaking all this into account, Cardi has one question for the government: \"I want to know what you're doing with my f------- money.\"\n\nTWEET\n\nThe rapper's post caught on with celebrities, too: P. Diddy chimed in and also demanded answers. So we got them for you. Here's where your money goes.\n\nAccording to the Peterson Foundation, a lot of your federal tax dollars go toward the military, which accounts for roughly half of all discretionary spending in America. As of April 2017, the U.S. spent $611 billion on defense which, the foundation points out, is \"more than China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, United Kingdom, India, France and Japan combined.\"\n\nEducation makes up 6 percent of discretionary spending and another 6 percent goes to additional Medicare and health accounts.\n\nThe rest of your tax dollars are divvied up among mandatory spending priorities, which make up nearly two-thirds of the total federal budget. These include health care initiatives, social security, transportation and anti-poverty programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\n\"Social Security alone comprises more than a third of mandatory spending and around 23 percent of the total federal budget. Medicare makes up an additional 23 percent of mandatory spending and 15 percent of the total federal budget,\" reports the National Priorities Project.\n\nCardi B specifically calls out New York state, which has one of the highest tax rates in the country and which sends more money to the federal government than it gets back.\n\n\"I'm from New York ... we were voted the dirtiest city in America,\" says Cardi. \"What is y'all doing?\"\n\nHere's what the state is doing: According to the state budget office, taxes account for 79 percent of its proposed $100 billion operating fund. School aid and Medicaid account for nearly half of all spending and the rest goes to higher education, mental hygiene, transportation and other categories.\n\nSome state taxes also trickle down to New York City, where Cardi lives. However, those who live in the Big Apple must pay a separate city income tax in addition to the state income tax, and the city's income tax makes up 13.75 percent of its budget.\n\nAs with the state, most of NYC's spending goes to education, health and social services for its record 8.6 million residents.\n\nCardi may have a point about the subway's shoddy conditions, though: Just 4 percent of the state's estimated budget goes toward transportation. And while daily ridership has nearly doubled over the last two decades, the city's contribution to MTA operations has dropped by almost 75 percent, according to a recent New York Times investigation.\n\nThe rapper's Instagram rant has since received more than four million likes and over 37,000 comments. Although the video likely took off because it's funny and frank, its popularity also suggests that many Americans care, and want to know more, about how their tax dollars are spent.\n\n\"When you donate to a kid in a foreign country, they give you updates [on] what they're doing with your donation,\" explains Cardi and she presses the government to do the same. \"I want to know. I want receipts.\"\n\nLike this story? Like CNBC Make It on Facebook!\n\nDon't miss: 55 percent of Americans can't define this key tax term",

The stock market is way up. When I came into office the stock market was from a different planet. It's way up,\" Trump said at a news conference Friday. \"China is gonna end up treating us fairly.\"\n\nThe Dow dropped 724 points Thursday after Trump signed an executive memorandum that would impose tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nFrom its high on Jan. 26 at 26,616.71, the benchmark index has declined more than 2,600 points or nearly 10 percent through Thursday's close at 23,957.89.\n\nTrump still has a big cushion. The Dow closed at 19,827.25 on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2017, which means it has about 4,100 points to go before the Trump rally gains disappear.",

The report, citing people familiar with the matter, said the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another banking regulator, is getting close to finalizing its own enforcement action and civil penalty related to Wells Fargo's risk controls.\n\nThe retirements are part of a reorganization of the bank's risk management functions. The corporate risk group is getting more power to stop or modify business activities, the Journal reported.\n\n\"Strengthening and transforming how we manage risk is a top priority for Wells Fargo,\" the company said in a statement on Friday. \"While more work is under way, we're making meaningful progress that is allowing us to better serve our customers and enable our team members to more effectively manage risk across the company. \"\n\nThe retiring executives include Jim Richards, the head of financial crimes risk management; Kevin Oden, the head of operational risk and compliance; Keb Byers, the head of enterprise risk; and Vic Albrecht, the head of the community banking risk group, the report said, adding that the Fed and OCC have discussed the departures with the bank.\n\nIn January, the bank said Mike Loughlin, its chief risk officer, would retire.\n\nWells Fargo has been struggling to recover after admitting to a widespread fake accounts scandal that came to light in 2016. Wells Fargo workers had opened 3.5 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization.\n\nSince then, more has come to light. The bank charged for insurance for auto loan customers without them knowing it, and extra fees on some mortgages. Most recently its wealth management division has come under scrutiny for sales practices.",

                "body": "As Dropbox soared in its stock market debut on Friday, shares of cloud software rival Box went the other way, plunging 7 percent.\n\nThe two companies have been competing for over a decade in the market of cloud file storage, with both benefiting from the rapid move to mobile devices and the need to access data from anywhere at all hours of the day.\n\nBox CEO Aaron Levie has insisted that his company is more focused on working with big businesses than is Dropbox, but investors clearly recognize the threat. Dropbox gained wide adoption in the consumer market with a product that has free and paid tiers and started getting traction in businesses as users brought the app to work.\n\nBox is one of seven competitors that Dropbox lists in its IPO prospectus, along with much bigger companies like Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft. Dropbox says it competes with Box \"on a more limited basis\" for enterprise customers\n\nDropbox shares jumped as much as 50 percent from their IPO price of $21 to as high as $31.60, giving the company a stock market value of over $12 billion. Box dropped as much as 6.9 percent to $21.18 and is valued at about $3 billion.\n\nUntil Friday, Dropbox had faced criticism for not living up to its $10 billion valuation from 2014, and investors had marked down their private Dropbox shares in recent years.\n\nDropbox said in its prospectus that is has 500 million registered users, but only 11 million paying subscribers. About 30 percent of those are on a business plan.\n\n\"That's around kind of $330 million or so in revenue as compared to our $500 million, which is entirely enterprise-driven,\" Levie said about Dropbox at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom conference in San Francisco earlier this month.\n\nDropbox CEO Drew Houston has also occasionally spoken about how the company is distinct from Box.\n\n\"We've got a competitor out there, they're like, oh, we're Dropbox for the enterprise,\" he said, referring to Box, at a 2015 company event, as Wired reported. \"But the challenge is they don't have that kind of bottom-up adoption.\"\n\nBox shares fell sharply early this month after the company issued a weaker revenue forecast than analysts expected for its fiscal quarter.",

Carter also said that if his help is needed, he'll be there.\n\nCarter, 93, made those remarks in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning\" anchor Jane Pauley that will air on the morning news show on Sunday. Carter added that he's had over 20 hours of talks with top North Korean leaders throughout his career. \"And I understand what they want and need,\" said Carter, a Democrat.\n\nTrump's decision to quickly accept North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's offer shook his administration and the international community.\n\nThe White House said on March 16 that Trump plans to meet with Kim by the end of May. The news broke following the release of a transcript of a phone call between Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\n\"The two leaders agreed that concrete actions, not words, will be the key to achieving permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\" the White House said, \"and President Trump reiterated his intention to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by the end of May.\"\n\nCarter, who has been involved in international affairs since his term ended, said that the Trump White House briefed him on the situation with North Korea. He said he would travel to the rogue nation for Trump if asked.\n\nCarter was president from 1977 to 1981 and drew major criticism for the Iran hostage crisis, which began in 1979. Fifty-two American diplomats and civilians were held hostage at the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran for 444 days during the crisis. The hostages were eventually released to the United States, following failed diplomatic and military attempts to rescue them.\n\nThe potential meeting between Trump and Kim approaches as the State Department transitions to a new Secretary of State. On March 15, Trump fired former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a tweet, picking CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his replacement.\n\nBefore Trump's acceptance of Kim's invitation, he had openly mocked Tillerson for pushing for diplomacy with the North Koreans. Relations between Trump and Kim had not previously been so kind, with Kim referring to Trump as a \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard\" and Trump calling Kim \"Little Rocket Man.\" Trump also made threats in response to the peninsula's repeated missile launches.\n\nTrump tweet\n\nCarter's interview with Pauley on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" will air on March 25 at 9 a.m. ET.",

Ambassador, makes it even more likely that the Trump administration will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal when it is up for review in May, and tensions could ramp up against the Middle Eastern country. Bolton replaces H.R. McMaster, who resigned.\n\n\"I can't think of a more hawkish appointment than John Bolton,\" said Helima Croft, head global commodities strategy at RBC. \"He's a powerful advocate for a confrontational approach.\"\n\nCroft also said the appointment leaves the question of whether Defense Secretary James Mattis looks like he's the only one representing a moderate foreign policy at this point. \"Are the Iranians seeing the writing on the wall? Will they curb their activities? His appointment should put the fear of God in them, but who knows.\"\n\nBolton has advocated for pre-emptive action against both Iran and North Korea because of their nuclear programs. His first act may be to successfully encourage Trump to end the deal, struck with Iran by the U.S., the European Union and other countries as a way to curb its nuclear program in return for ending sanctions on the country, including its oil.\n\nMattis and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had been reluctant to abandon the Iran deal, which also included China and Russia. Further financial sanctions against the country have also been discussed.\n\nVenezuela's economic crisis is complicating matters and damaging its energy production capabilities. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is running for re-election despite the objections of the U.S. and other countries that the election is unfair. Venezuelan oil already is coming off the market, and could continue to decline as the country's energy infrastructure deteriorates.\n\n\"Even if it's just additional sanctions on Iran, that could hurt investment in the country and reduce flows of their oil. The market would really miss their oil this time around because of Venezuela,\" said John Kilduff from Again Capital. \"Because of Iran's advanced ballistic missile capabilities, the other countries have offered additional sanctions to try to keep Trump in the nuclear pact.\"\n\nOil prices were higher Friday, with West Texas Intermediate futures trading over $65, a nearly 2 percent gain. Gold, benefitting Friday from fears about trade wars, could also gain if the U.S. becomes more aggressive, not just with Iran but others like Venezuela or North Korea. Gold futures for April rose 1.5 percent Friday, to $1,347 per ounce.\n\nCroft said May will be important for oil prices, with the Iran deal up for renewal May 12 and the Venezuela election on May 20. \"If they go forward with those elections, we could see much more coercive economic policies toward Venezuela. That's when the oil market might start paying attention,\" she said.\n\n\"The oil market is under-appreciating the importance of the personnel changes,\" she added. \"They're under-pricing the personnel changes.\"\n\nGlobal oil demand has been improving and the pact between OPEC and Russia has helped steady prices and send them higher. Growing U.S. production from shale fields like the Permian Basin has added supply while Russia and Saudi Arabia have reduced theirs.\n\nKilduff said geopolitical tensions have moved prices higher recently, including anti-Iranian comments from Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who said that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon, so will Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn an interview on CBS' '60 Minutes,' the prince also compared Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, to Adolph Hitler. The prince is currently in the U.S., and met with Trump earlier this week.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran are engaged in a proxy war in Yemen, and are at odds on Syria, which Iran has supported.\n\nCroft said if the U.S. drops out of the nuclear deal it could take an even harsher posture toward Iran. \"The question is ,are we talking about efforts to economically isolate Iran, or are we talking about efforts to change the regime?\" she said. \"This is where the Permian makes things different. If this had been 2010, oil would be much higher. There's a view that U.S. short cycle oil makes a difference. We could just make up for anything.\"\n\nBut Croft doesn't see proof that U.S. shale could make up for a shortfall in the world market.\n\n\"I haven't gotten any evidence,\" she said. \"I don't see any signs that OPEC is going to be quick to rush in and save things.\" She said with the changes in Washington, it's possible there could be 200,000 to 300,000 Iranian barrels off the market by the fourth quarter, and Venezuelan production losses could total 1 million barrels.\n\nBolton served in the Reagan administration, and President George W. Bush named him undersecretary of state for arms control and international security. Bush also appointed him as his representative to the U.N., which Bolton called irrelevant. Ultimately, Congress blocked his confirmation and he had to step down from that role.\n\n\"...Bolton is the hawk's hawk,\" wrote Cliff Kupchan, chairman of Eurasia Group. He noted that besides pushing for pre-emptive strikes on North Korea's nuclear program, he has criticized the planned Trump-Kim Jong-un summit as useless.\n\n\"He's a fierce opponent of the Iran nuclear deal. In 2015, before the deal, Bolton penned an op-ed titled 'To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran.' Bolton's appointment will likely make US policy on both hot-button issues more hardline,\" added Kupchan. \"At least on the margins, the chance of a strike on North Korea goes up, of successful US-North Korea diplomacy goes down, and the Iran deal is in even more trouble.\"",

                "body": "A barista froths milk for a drink inside a Starbucks Corp. coffee shop in New York.\n\nStarbucks has achieved 100 percent equal pay for its U.S. employees of all races and genders and is working \"with deliberate speed\" to do the same globally, the coffee company announced on Wednesday. It took the company 10 years.\n\nAs Starbucks continues to thrive with a workforce that is now compensated more fairly, here are four other companies that say they have also made equal pay a reality.\n\nLast year, Adobe announced that all of its male and female employees in the U.S. are now receiving equal pay for equal work.\n\n\"We were already close to pay parity in the U.S. through our strong people practices, and now we are proud to have achieved and documented this last step of full parity,\" said Donna Morris, executive vice president of Customer & Employee Experience at Adobe, in a statement. \"It means a lot to our U.S. employees, and we're excited to extend that same commitment to our global employee base in the upcoming year.\"\n\nIn January, the software company announced that it has also achieved pay equity in India, helping to close the gap between its male and female employees in 80 percent of its global workforce.\n\nIn 2016, Apple announced that it had finally closed its gender pay gap and that all male and female employees in the U.S. are being compensated equally.\n\n\"Pay equity is simply the right thing to do,\" the company said on its inclusion and diversity page. \"It's something we're deeply committed to.\"\n\nWhile reaching pay equity is a huge accomplishment, the tech giant admitted that it still has a long way to go to create a workforce that's more balanced in terms of gender and race. To that end, Apple has committed to hiring more women and minorities and, according to the company's website, 50 percent of its new hires from July 2016 to July 2017 were from historically underrepresented groups.\n\nLast year, Intel released a diversity and inclusion report that showed that the company has reached 100 percent gender and racial pay equity in the U.S.\n\n\"We view pay and promotion parity as signals of the overall health of our company as well as a means of ensuring equity for all employees,\" the companies chief diversity and inclusion officer at the time, Danielle Brown, said in the report.\n\nIntel says that it will continue to work towards its 2020 goal of having full representation of underrepresented minorities in its workforce while also maintaining a high employee retention rate.\n\nIn 2015, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff revealed at Fortune's Global Forum that his company had spent about $3 million to close its pay gap. In 2017, Benioff said that, after inheriting the pay practices of 13 new companies they had acquired, Salesforce was spending an additional $3 million to ensure that it was eliminating any new pay disparities.\n\n\"Every CEO needs to look at if they're paying men and woman the same. That is something that every single CEO can do today,\" Fortune reports him saying at the 2017 World Economic Forum. \"We all have modern human resource management systems, but as a CEO are you willing to step up and say I pay men and women the same?\"\n\nIn 2008, Starbucks conducted a company-wide compensation study that included regular salary check-ins to identify and address pay disparities. Since then, the company has implemented a few practices to ensure equal pay. One is a calculator that objectively determines an employee's pay range based off experience. Another is a tool that analyzes bonuses before they are finalized to ensure there is no bias in the compensation process.\n\nStarbucks says that, in addition to checking pay, hiring managers have also stopped asking candidates about what they've been paid at previous jobs. That's a move many states are making, too, as some ban questions about salary history from the interview process.\n\n\"One of the most important things to get right is starting pay,\" Sara Bowen, an attorney who leads Starbucks Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility team, said in a statement. \"If a woman comes into a company low, she tends to stay low. If a job candidate comes to Starbucks making 70 or 80 cents on the dollar, and we use that as the basis for her pay at Starbucks, we simply import gender inequality into our own system.\"\n\nLike this story?

                "body": "All congressional offices are not created equal -- especially when it comes to how much they'd pay you.\n\nA new LegiStorm analysis showed that Democrats pay an average salary of $52,142, while Republicans average $51,490.\n\nThe highest-paying member of Congress is Rep. Mike Capuano, D-Mass., whose office has a median salary of $81,491. His office is also the only one where the median salary reaches the $80,000 point.\n\nMore from USA Today:\n\nShe was mad about being bumped from her flight to Austin. Then United gave her a $10,000 voucher\n\nSalon's Ivanka Trump Facebook post sets people's hair on fire\n\nFrench police kill gunman in supermarket siege that left 2 hostages dead\n\nRounding out the rest of the top five are:\n\nRep. Mike Simpson, R-Ind. ($78,665) Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas (74,795) Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. ($73,123) Rep. Macy Clay, D-Mo ($73,000)\n\nAnd if you left the top-paying offices to work at one of the lowest-paying ones, you'd take more than a 50% pay cut.\n\nAt the lowest paying congressional office, Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont, pays a median salary of just $35,925. His is the lowest paying office by almost $3,000.\n\nThe rest of the bottom five in the low-paying category are:\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. ($38,567) Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind. ($39,000) Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif. ($39,241) Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind. ($39,996)\n\nIf you're looking to make a top salary on Capitol Hill, becoming a chief-of-staff is your best bet. The median salary for that role is $154,634. A district/state chief-of-staff trails behind with $136,443 as its median salary, followed by state directors, information technology directors and chief counsels, all of which have six figure salaries.\n\nStaff assistants make the lowest median salary at $35,480. Following are district/regional coordinators, fellows, press assistants and research assistants.\n\nYou also might have a better shot at a high-paying job depending on the state your boss represents. In the House, the highest median salaries (at $66,454) are from Utah's delegation. Utah is closely followed by Idaho and Alaska as the only three state delegations with a median salary of more than $60,000.\n\nFor the Senate, Rhode Island pays the most, at a $65,735 median salary. Kansas ($65,520) and Mississippi ($64,594) are the next highest-paying.\n\nLegiStorm notes that while median salaries are useful for analyzing trends, several factors influence the final number, like the composition and size of office staff. For example, some offices might have a high number of low-ranking employees, while other offices have mainly highly-paid, high-ranking employees.",

                "body": "Worried investors should stay focused on their long-term goals, though financial advisors say there are a couple of moves that could make sense.\n\nThough stocks have had a bumpy ride this week, most financial professionals will advise you to leave your long-term investments alone.\n\nYet there are certain circumstances in which you might want to act.\n\nConsider what happened this week: The Dow Jones industrial average fell 724.42 points, or 2.9 percent, to end at 23,957.89 on Thursday, its biggest decline since Feb. 8. The S&P 500 dropped to 2,643.69 following a 2.5 percent decline.\n\nThe sharp drops came as President Donald Trump unveiled plans to impose new tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nIn addition, news of the Facebook data leak has sent the company's market value down more than $50 billion this week and also had an impact on technology stocks.\n\nWhat's more, the Federal Reserve's decision to raise rates this week may have also contributed to the market fluctuations, according to Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe Fed approved a quarter-point rate hike on Wednesday, bringing the benchmark funds rate, which is tied to consumer interest rates, to 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.\n\nMany retirees will be better off with the move as interest rates on their investments rise (as long as inflation stays low.)\n\n\"The same retirees who want rates to go up have to be prepared for a little market pain to go with it,\" Cox said. \"This is going to benefit income-oriented investors. What we're going through now is part of the process to get there.\"\n\nWhen it comes to your long-term investments, financial advisors generally will tell you not to let those market jitters steer you off course.\n\n\"We are biologically wired to react, to steer ourselves away from the danger,\" said Michael Conway, CEO of Conway Wealth Group in Parsippany, New Jersey. \"That's one of the surest ways to destroy wealth for long-term planning.\"\n\nIf you already have a long-term diversified portfolio with the right allocations, you are better off doing nothing, Conway said.\n\nIf you went to cash during the financial crisis in 2008, you would have missed an approximate 17,000 point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average over the past 10 years.\n\n\"Had someone reacted to their biological instincts and gone to cash, they would have missed out on what has gone on in the last decade,\" Conway said.\n\nHaving a portion of your portfolio dedicated to cash will help you weather market downturns, according to Cox.\n\nThat is because having that money available will enable you to use it for income or spending when it would not be wise to sell stocks amid volatility, he said.\n\nIf you do sell stocks when the market is down, you will have to sell more shares to get the amount you desire. That could in turn reduce your dividend yields, Cox said.\n\nIdeally, you want to hold 5 percent to 10 percent of your portfolio in cash, Cox said.\n\n\"If you can prevent selling your equities during a correction, having that extra cash enables you to do so,\" Cox said. \"The correction doesn't hurt you unless you have to take action.\"\n\nDon't forget to consider your age when evaluating your portfolio amid market declines.\n\nIf you're at or close to retirement and have not properly factored your time horizon in with your investment strategy, that is when you might want to consider pulling back, Conway said.\n\nCheck with a financial advisor to make sure your portfolio is in line with your objectives and risk profile.\n\n\"Stay diversified and maintain a long-term investor mind-set,\" Conway said.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nStock market volatility could kill this risky Social Security strategy\n\nIf you win $421 million Mega Millions jackpot, here's what you should do\n\nPopular tax software may expose users to phishing attacks",

That preserves and creates upside scenarios for Wynn Resorts, especially ahead of concession renewal in 2022, amid wide speculation that the Chinese government would prefer more Chinese ownership in Macau.\n\nBack in the United States -- Steve Wynn's complete removal from any kind of influence or association with Wynn Resorts could have a positive impact on the investigations ongoing in Massachusetts and Nevada. Though, in Massachusetts, the lead investigator for the Gaming Commission has been clear that the suitability of the executives and the board is also under scrutiny. Questions continue to be raised about why the board failed to recognize or to take action on allegations against Steve Wynn regarding sexual misconduct in the company.\n\nAt least two private settlements were made between former employees and Steve Wynn and CNBC has been informed by multiple sources that his behavior was well-known.\n\n\"It wasn't occasional. It was all the time,\" says one Las Vegas gaming executive with personal knowledge.\n\nBut when new CEO Matt Maddox sat for an exclusive interview with CNBC on March 9, he insisted the company was intent on cooperating with the gaming board investigations and on listening to employees. When asked whether he was under pressure to stop any further damage to the Wynn brand, he answered, \"The Wynn brand is not about one person. It's about 25,000 people that deliver the best luxury and the best service on the planet.\"\n\nMaddox continued, \"What I can tell you is the moves that we're making as a company: Getting rid of the noise, removing litigation, investing in our employees and meeting with the governments to make sure we're fully cooperating. I'm not concerned these lingering allegations are going to impact the $25 billion company and the 25,000 employees that work for it.\"\n\nJefferies Gaming Analyst David Katz expects Galaxy, T. Rowe Price and Capital Research Management to be influential to the company's future, with a combined 13 percent stake. Katz writes, \"The removal of an overhang related to Steve Wynn's shares and the presence of a diplomatically connected entity in Macau should reduce the risk priced into the shares. Remaining is the question of the outstanding holdings of Elaine Wynn, which should fairly be considered a modest overhang.\"\n\nElaine Wynn becomes the largest shareholder in Wynn Resorts, with a 9.3 percent stake in the company -- and now, she can vote those shares, something she was prohibited from doing under a deal with her ex-husband, which also prohibited her from selling her shares. Though Elaine Wynn is now also free to sell her stake, she's under no pressure to do so, unlike her ex-husband.\n\nInstinet analyst Harry Curtis says he thinks it's more likely that Elaine Wynn would seek and get a seat on the board of directors. One advantage to her more active participation could be a persuasive reason for the company to retain the Wynn name, especially in Massachusetts where questions have been raised about whether a name change might be a condition for keeping the gaming license for Wynn Boston Harbor.\n\nAdditionally, Wynn Resorts is actively pursuing new board members to replace Ray Irani and Alvin Shoemaker, and it's especially focused on finding women directors. Maddox told CNBC, \"We need diversity on the board, and we need business experience. ... It will really provide a different perspective on our board.\"",

                "body": "John Bolton, Former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Oxon Hill, Maryland in February.\n\nJohn Bolton is a hardline Republican, a foreign policy super-hawk and President Donald Trump's pick to replace H.R. McMaster as national security advisor.\n\nSenate confirmation is not required for the White House national security post and Bolton, a former ambassador to the U.N., will inherit a staff of several hundred specialists from the Pentagon, State Department and U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nHe will be responsible for advising Trump on a wide spectrum of national security issues, from the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State to China's aggressive actions in the South China Sea to North Korea's growing nuclear threat.\n\nBolton will be the third national security advisor to serve Trump, following the departures of three-star Army generals Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster.\n\n\"It's kind of a head-scratcher because he seems really out of step with what the president has said and stood for going all the way back to the campaign,\" retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Daniel Davis, who served under McMaster during the Persian Gulf War, told CNBC.\n\nDavis, who is now a senior defense fellow and military expert for Defense Priorities, notes that Bolton has taken an opposite position on several topics Trump pushed for in 2016.\n\n\"[Trump] was adamant about no more regime change, that was one of his mantras in the campaign, no more stupid wars, all this kind of stuff and that's what Bolton has lived for,\" Davis said.\n\nAs George W. Bush's undersecretary of state for arms control, Bolton was a supporter of the invasion of Iraq and was confident that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\"The president has also said that he was against President Bush's war in Iraq saying it was a disaster. And Bolton was one of the architects of that [war,]\" added Davis who wrote an opinion piece on Bolton's appointment for CNBC.\n\nAfter leaving the Bush administration, Bolton joined the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, where he expressed some of his confrontational rhetoric in op-eds like \"To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran.\" Within the last year, he wrote \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First\" and \"How to Defund the UN.\"\n\n\"If you take his advice and attack North Korea and if you take his advice and change the regime in Iran, I mean, my goodness, if you thought Iraq was bad, this is like 10 times that,\" Davis said in regards to Bolton's op-eds.\n\n\"Bolton doesn't even talk about diplomacy. For him, it's either abject surrender on the opposition or its war and there doesn't seem to be any room for negotiation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ian Bremmer, president of political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group, called Bolton's post \"a dramatic shift in favor of a more military-first approach to policy.\" Saying it is \"less \"jaw-jaw\" and more \"war-war.\"\n\n\"That matters a great deal for an America First president who is inclined to take policies on his own, without consulting allies or, frequently, dissenting opinions in his own cabinet,\" Bremmer added.\n\nBolton through a spokesperson declined comment for this article.\n\nHere's a roundup of Bolton's views on various national security matters:\n\nBolton on the Iran nuclear deal\n\nSimilar to Trump, Bolton has called the nuclear agreement a \"strategic debacle,\" and said in January on Fox News that the deal should be scrapped, sanctions reimposed, and regime change encouraged.\n\nIn January, Trump said he would stick with the deal for now, but wants to fix the agreement's \"terrible flaws.\"\n\n\"The appointment of John Bolton is bad news for those who were hoping the Iran deal would somehow survive, said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest. \"The deal is RIP as of right now.\"\n\nAnd while it is unclear if Trump will rollback the 2015 nuclear agreement, Davis said it would be \"disastrous\" if the U.S. were to withdraw because it would \"undermine\" negotiations with North Korea.\n\n\"What possible motivation would any country have to begin negotiations with you when they see a fellow country that did exactly what the United States is asking you to do, just throw it away? You wouldn't trust the paper the thing was written on,\" Davis said.\n\nBolton on North Korea's nuclear program\n\nIn the aforementioned op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, published one month before Trump's on-the-spot acceptance to meet with Kim Jong Un, Bolton made a case for taking preemptive strikes against the North.\n\nUnder third-generation North Korean leader Kim, the reclusive state has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, launched its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile and threatened to send missiles into the waters near the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nWhat's more, the acceleration and frequency of testing show not only Kim's nuclear ambitions but also that the nation has developed an arsenal.\n\nIn 2003, on the eve of six-nation talks over Pyongyang's nuclear program, Bolton called then-North Korean leader Kim Jong II a \"tyrannical dictator.\" The North responded by calling Bolton \"human scum.\"\n\nAt present, the North has yet to formally acknowledge the proposed meeting, which was announced two weeks ago and is slated to occur by the end of May.\n\nWhile the U.S. waits to enter negotiations with North Korea, Bremmer said Bolton's new post will make the summit between Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un \"far riskier.\"\n\nSimilarly, Kazianis agreed that Bolton will take a harder line than his predecessor.\n\n\"Bolton will not tolerate any sort of games from Pyongyang. If the North Koreans ask for bribes or incentives to talk, look for the administration to snap to an even harder line, think the maximum pressure on steroids, Kazianis said.\n\nBremmer also added that the likelihood \"the U.S. ends up in military conflict with North Korea\" has increased.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon will move forward with its annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises that usually agitate North Korea. The massive war games have been described by the North's government as a dress rehearsal for an invasion of the Korean peninsula.\n\nBolton on Russia's new weapons\n\nEarlier this month, during a two-hour state-of-the-nation speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a slew of new nuclear weapons as well as a hypersonic missile.\n\nBolton responded to Putin's latest military capabilities with his trademark bellicose rhetoric on Twitter.\n\n\"There needs to be a strategic response to Russia's new nuclear missiles to show our allies in Europe that we will not let #Russia push the U.S. or its allies around,\" he wrote.\n\nHis actions made Davis question if Bolton was \"really an upper-level diplomat\" and if Trump would appreciate his national security advisor stepping into the limelight.\n\n\"Those are the kinds of things you need to handle under the radar and off the front page,\" Davis added.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump announced Tuesday that he plans to \"get together in the not-too-distant future\" with Putin in order to discuss the international arms race.",

                "body": "California growers are cashing in on China's increasing wealth and growing hunger for almonds and other high-quality fruits and nuts that don't grow as well in the Asian nation.\n\nAs Americans brace for a price increase in anything made from of steel and aluminum, Chinese consumers were preparing to shell out more for nuts and fruit.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry announced Friday that close to 80 fruit and nut products from the United States face higher tariffs, as Beijing prepared to boost duties on as much as $3 billion of U.S. imports. The increase follows President Donald Trump's decision to boost tariffs on Chinese steel and a recent announcement that another round of tariffs are coming on as much as $60 billion in Chinese goods.\n\n\"At the end of the day it's us common people who will pay the bill because fruits will become pricier,\" said one user on China's Weibo social media platform, where the prospects for a U.S.-China trade war ranked as the most-read topic Friday.\n\nTrump's decision to boost tariffs on Chinese goods has been widely criticized by business leaders, economists and members of both parties on Capitol Hill. The U.S. Trade Representative recently noted that some 900,000 American jobs depend on U.S.-Chinese trade\n\nIt remains to be seen how wide the Trump administration will expand its trade offensive. The White House said Thursday that the final list of more than 1,000 categories of goods subject to higher duties will be released in two weeks. The administration argues that the increased tariffs are meant to punish Beijing for what it said are unfair trade practices, including theft of U.S. intellectual property.\n\nSo far, the Chinese response has been measured. The few industrial commodities on China's list pose little risk to the growth of the Chinese economy. Ethanol is already taxed at nearly 40 percent. China's demand for imports of U.S. scrap aluminum, another product singled out by Beijing for higher tariffs, will likely soften now that the U.S. has imposed higher tariffs on Chinese aluminum imports.\n\nThat leaves a long list of fruits, frozen juices and nuts that have become increasingly popular with Chinese consumers household incomes have risen in recent decades. The U.S. is a major supplier of apples, cherries, walnuts and almonds, much of which is produced by growers in California, Florida and Michigan.\n\nBut those products remain only occasional purchases for many Chinese households. And while the U.S. is a major supplier, China has other sources to turn to.\n\nHigher tariffs could also help Chinese growers of targeted fruits and nuts, who have been expanding production to meet local demand. China has become the world's largest walnut producer, for example, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nThat could help blunt the economic impact of Beijing's higher tariffs on Chinese households.\n\n\"These products all have domestic equivalents,\" said another Weibo commenter. \"This could lift demand!\"\n\nReuters contributed to this article.",

                "body": "As President Donald Trump's much-debated tariffs on aluminum and steel go into effect on Friday, some entrepreneurs like Andrew Berman are breathing a sigh of relief.\n\nBerman is president of Spectrum Printing & Graphics in Rockville, Maryland. His commercial printing business runs a printing press that utilizes aluminum plates imported from France. He'd been bracing for price increases as Trump has levied a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports and a 25 percent tariff on imported steel.\n\nTo his knowledge, there isn't a domestic manufacturer of the plates he uses, and if he were to find one, he'd have to overhaul his system, a process that could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nBefore the tariffs were to go into effect, Trump exempted the European Union from the order temporarily, along with other trading partners including Canada and Mexico. The price hikes Berman was gearing up to absorb disappeared, for the time being, as the administration shifts its focus to China. Trump announced a package of up to $60 billion in tariffs Thursday that take aim at China for intellectual property theft.\n\n\"I'm going to hope the tariffs were well-intended, but as a domestic manufacturer with 40 employees, doing everything we can to support those employees and to do the best for our customers ... there are unintended consequences,\" Berman said.\n\nWell-intended or not, Trump's tariffs have received a mostly cold response from Main Street advocacy groups. Many argue that while trade policies tend have pros and cons, they also negatively impact a broad swath of the economy in ways that are often overlooked.\n\n\"In general, we think there is more room for harm to happen with small companies than good,\" said Todd McCracken, president and CEO of the National Small Business Association, a nonpartisan advocacy group. \"The ripple effects of higher steel prices and a potential trade war and higher tariffs in other countries that can result from this will hurt companies across the economy.\"\n\nThe group added that according to its most recent data on exports, China is the fourth-largest market for goods produced by U.S. small businesses. \"Our small businesses are concerned about likely materials cost increases and ongoing retaliation by China and other countries which could stymie small-business export growth in industries far beyond those targeted by the tariffs,\" said Molly Day, vice president of public affairs at the NSBA.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Raymond Keating, chief economist at the nonpartisan Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, who said there was very little in the way of \"upside\" in Trump's new trade policies.\n\n\"The fact that the administration is concerned about intellectual property is a good thing, but this is not the way to go about it.\"\n\nThe conservative lobbying group the National Federation of Independent Business did not respond to request for comment on the tariffs. However, worries about exporting ranked dead last out of 75 issues polled among its membership on its last \"Problems and Priorities\" survey in 2016.\n\nFor now, entrepreneurs importing from exempted countries like Berman are in the clear. But he's worried about other equipment costs going up with action being taken against China.\n\n\"I have no idea where the raw material [in our equipment] comes from. I have concerns about the folders, the cutters and printing presses,\" Berman said. \"I think exempting countries was the right thing to do because the threat of reciprocating tariffs wasn't good for anybody. But he is playing a game of chicken,\" in exempting trading partners with just a day to go before the order was set to kick in.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

And again, Musk responded in the affirmative.\n\nthis should be deleted too right?\n\nDefinitely.

                "body": "Larry Miller stands before Larisa Oleynik and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a scene from the film '10 Things I Hate About You', 1999.\n\nFor the first time in over 30 years, the house from 1999's cult favorite movie \"10 Things I Hate About You,\" located in Tacoma, Washington, hit the market for $1.6 million.\n\nIt didn't last long: The dwelling, listed by agent Jeff Jensen, was scooped up after less than a week. Although the buyer knew that the property was featured in the movie, it wasn't a deciding factor, Jensen tells CNBC Make It.\n\nBut the Victorian home, with its iconic wrap around porch and custom woodwork, still conjures up plenty of nostalgia for the rest of us. Here's a peek inside what it looks like now.\n\nOutside, the iconic wrap around porch, on which star Julia Stiles famously sat in the movie, frames the home.\n\n\"The most recognizable and most memorable part of the house was the front porch and curb appeal of the home,\" Jensen says.\n\nInside are custom inlay hardwood floors and wood panels, as well as original details like 400-pound solid oak pocket doors, according to the listing.\n\nThe 5,760-square-foot space was built in 1907 and has been largely preserved over the years.\n\n\"It is essentially in original condition with updates to the mechanical and other systems of the house,\" Jensen says. \"Kitchen was remodeled in 2006 but walls, rooms and original details are all intact.\"\n\nThe kitchen features ample countertop space and plenty of natural light.\n\nThere are five bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms, each spacious enough to comfortably fit queen-sized beds.\n\nThe listing notes that the property was \"built for entertaining and living large.\"\n\nA den with a built-in bar provides an ideal space to hang out with guests. Or perhaps kick back and catch a rerun of Stiles and Heath Ledger in \"10 Things I Hate About You.\"\n\nDon't miss: This $38 million LA mansion has a $450,000 speaker system and was designed by Lenny Kravitz -- take a look inside\n\nLike this story?

                "title": "More women are the breadwinner at home, but most still say men treat them differently at work",
                "body": "Today, 49 percent of employed women in the United States, including 42 percent of working women with children, say they work primarily because they are their family's main breadwinner, according to a joint NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll. That's up from 37 percent in 2000. Unfortunately, the way women are treated in the workplace overall hasn't changed much.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. adults, found that 52 percent of Americans say men do not treat women equally in the workplace while 61 percent of women say that their male counterparts fail to treat them as equals. Those numbers are virtually unchanged since the poll asked the same question in 1999.\n\nWhat's more, 44 percent still say they've personally experienced discrimination because of their gender. That number hasn't improved either in almost 20 years.\n\nMajorities of employed men don't believe that there's a significant gap in how women are paid, promoted and valued at their workplaces, the poll shows. In reality, women, on average, are paid 20 percent less than men. In industries like tech, they are offered lower starting salaries than their male counterparts for the same job at the same company 63 percent of the time, and, according to some employees, still experience discrimination even at companies like Google.\n\nThey also get stuck with the grunt work more often, including low-status and tedious tasks as opposed to more coveted assignments, according to the Harvard Business Review. It reports that women are \"more likely than white men to report doing more office housework than their colleagues\" while they \"have less access to glamour work than white men do.\"\n\nThere are some signs of progress.\n\nPerceptions of working women who are also raising children, for instance, have become more positive in the last two decades, according to the poll. In 2000, 46 percent of Americans said that more women working while raising children was a \"positive development.\" Now, that share is up to 78 percent.\n\nNewer women's movements such as \"MeToo\" and \"Time's Up\" have gained traction as they advocate for victims of gender inequality, sexual misconduct and sexism in the workplace. And nearly half, or 48 percent, of respondents say the \"MeToo\" movement has increased discussion about what's appropriate in their workplace, for example, the poll notes. Over half, or 58 percent, now say that the problem of sexual harassment is being appropriately addressed, and 67 percent say the changes will be long-term, up from 60 percent in December.\n\nOn a national scale, leaders such as Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, and California Senator Kamala Harris are trying to address the issue of gender inequality, including efforts to close the pay gap. Some business, like law firm Fisher Phillips, are following suit.\n\nCorrie Hunt of Hart Research, which conducted the poll, sees room for improvement on a larger scale, though.\n\n\"While Americans have become less judgmental about working mothers, this is a story about taking one step forward and one step back,\" she says. Americans have become \"more willing to say the right things about women in the workplace, but we haven't put the supports in place to back it up. Our words have not yet been put into actions.\"\n\nLike this story?

                "body": "The potential breakup of General Electric may unlock more value than previously thought, Melius Research analysts wrote in a note Friday.\n\nPast looks at the value of GE's individual businesses - also known as a \"sum-of-the-parts\" analysis - cast doubt on whether a fire sale of GE's assets would even fetch today's price at $13.28 per share. But Melius found that spinoffs from U.S. industrial companies return twice the value of the broader stock market, revealing a more optimistic forecast for GE.\n\n\"GE's [some-of-the-parts] as an example...likely undervalues the assets by 25 percent or more,\" Melius wrote.\n\nFormer industrial conglomerates are shedding assets due to pressure from both shareholders and activist investors, Melius found. Coupled with a \"lack of interest in traditional conglomerates,\" more spinoffs from GE, Johnson Controls, Honeywell and others are likely in the near future, according to the firm.\n\nThese spinoffs have \"historically created outsized value,\" Melius said. A spinoff removes what Melius called the bureaucratic culture that comes with a large conglomerate. Therefore, \"even with lackluster\" spinoffs, employees are reinvigorated and able to achieve greater efficiency than were ever probable under the conglomerate.\n\nSpinoffs also get a boost from \"the scrutiny of a new shareholder base,\" according to Melius. Taken out from under the wing of a conglomerate, a spinoff can no longer disguise financial results from investors.\n\nSpring has sprung and Wall Street is waiting to see if and how GE breaks up its businesses. The stock has slid 23 percent since January, when GE first announced a review of its GE Capital insurance portfolio.\n\n\"[These] problems preclude the company from moving forward as previously planned, even a few months ago,\" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note Jan. 17.\n\nThen came the SEC investigation into GE's accounting practices and the U.S. Justice Department investigation in connection with subprime mortgages.\n\nJ.P. Morgan's sum-of-the-parts analysis said, before the investigations were announced, that there may be \"many dis-synergies not incorporated\" in its analysis of GE. Those unknown risks may justify a further degraded value, between $12 and $16 per share.\n\nWith GE shares trading Wednesday at the lower end of Wall Street's previous estimates, a breakup looks increasingly positive for GE's investors. In Melius' view, those spinoffs are one of the best ways forward if the company's shareholders are going to recoup value lost from the decline of a once-dominant American conglomerate.\n\n- CNBC's Morgan Brennan contributed to this report.",

                "title": "The economy looks weak in the first quarter, but better days are coming",
                "body": "With expectations increasing that first-quarter growth will be nowhere close to earlier projections, there's good news: The rest of the year still looks fine.\n\nThat point was driven home Friday when Bank of America Merrill Lynch became the latest Wall Street forecaster to knock down its growth estimates for the first three months of 2018. The firm's economists now see GDP rising at just a 1.7 percent pace, compared to the 2.3 percent as of its most recent estimate.\n\nHowever, BofAML economists Michelle Meyer and Anna Zhou see the weakness as temporary.\n\nThere will be \"a stronger payback\" in the second quarter, with growth now projected to run at a 3.7 percent pace, which is an increase from the original 3.3 percent estimate, they said. The third quarter also got a forecast bump, from 3.3 percent to 3.6 percent.\n\nAll said, that would put the annualized GDP gain at 2.9 percent, or just a shade below the 3 percent minimum growth that the Trump administration has targeted. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve pushed its 2018 forecast from 2.5 percent to 2.7 percent.\n\n\"The economy still looks strong and we believe the upcoming earnings season will be solid,\" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in a note.\n\nHopes had soared for the first quarter after some of the early 2018 data, particularly in manufacturing, came in well ahead of estimates. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker at one point showed growth at 5.4 percent, which would have been the best quarter of the recovery.\n\nBut a slew of reports since then, from disappointing auto sales to retail to housing, have caused virtually every economist to walk back their optimism. BofAML's revision still keeps its forecast above the lowest, believed to belong to UBS at 1.4 percent.\n\nFriday, though, provided some more good news.\n\nFebruary durable goods orders popped 3.1 percent, well ahead of the 1.7 percent consensus estimate and good for the fastest pace since June. The number was especially impressive considering how strong the metric was for 2017, rising 13.8 percent in the fourth quarter to make it the second-best gainer of all the components that go into figuring out GDP.\n\nOverall, the number is not a huge contributor to the economy -- about 7.6 percent for 2017 -- but could be indicative of larger trends, particularly in investment.\n\n\"With borrowing costs low, capacity utilization on the rise and the recent corporate tax cuts likely to provide further support, we expect business investment to continue to expand at a healthy pace over the coming quarters,\" Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed did not alter its 1.8 percent projection from the day's data, saying the gains in durable goods were offset by a slightly below consensus reading on new home sales.\n\nCNBC's own Rapid Update tracker, derived from a select group of economists, has been more optimistic about the first quarter, putting its Q1 growth estimate at 2.3 percent.\n\nThe market will get the final revision for the fourth quarter, which was last reported at 2.5 percent and expected to stay there, according to consensus. However, Rapid Update puts the final estimate at 2.7 percent, and BofAML expects 2.8 percent. BofAML expects growth to slow to 2.4 percent in 2019.",

                "body": "Boeing will not appeal against the U.S. trade commission ruling that allows Canada's Bombardier to sell its newest jets to U.S. airlines without heavy duties, a Boeing spokesman said on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) unanimously voted in January to reject Boeing's complaint and discarded a Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of the 110-to-130-seat Bombardier CSeries jets for five years.\n\nThe ITC had widely been expected to side with Chicago-based Boeing, the world's largest maker of jetliners, which accused Bombardier of dumping the planes, or selling them below cost, in the U.S. market.\n\nHowever, the ITC said it rejected placing duties on Bombardier jets partly because Boeing had lost no sales or revenue when Delta Air Lines ordered the aircraft in 2016 from the Canadian planemaker.\n\nThe ITC ruled the 110-seat CSeries jets ordered by Delta and Boeing's smallest 737 MAX 7 plane do not compete.\n\nThe smaller end of the jet market is an increasing focus for the major manufacturers. Airbus has agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries in a deal expected to close later this year, while Boeing is in tie-up talks with Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer.\n\nThe Boeing spokesman declined to elaborate on the decision not to appeal.\n\nIt was not yet clear how Boeing's decision will impact the planemaker's relationship with the Canadian government, which is holding a competition for fighter jets worth between C$15 billion and $C19 billion.\n\nA Bombardier spokesman was not immediately available to comment.",

Led by Sarcos Robotics, other X-TAG members include Bechtel, BMW, Caterpillar, GE, Schlumberger and additional leading companies representing aviation, construction, heavy machinery and utilities.\n\n\"There is no greater responsibility we have than to keep our people and our customers safe,\" said Gil West, Delta's chief operating officer, in a statement. \"This X-TAG is an innovative opportunity to think about how fitting our employees with wearable robotics can build on our strong personal safety culture and further protect our people from injury by giving them an additional layer of strength and protection.\" Read the full announcement here.\n\nMore from Atlanta Business Chronicle:\n\nDelta jumps to No. 2 US passenger carrier in 2017; airport still busiest in the nation\n\nTechFlash: Goodyear chooses Atlanta; Mercedes-Benz USA plans innovation hub\n\nFormer Georgia Gov. Zell Miller dies at 86\n\nThe Sarcos Guardian XO and XO MAX robots are battery-powered exoskeletons that enable workers to perform hours of physical activity that would otherwise be impossible for a single human to perform, the company says. The Guardian XO robot is capable of repeatedly lifting and supporting up to 80 pounds without fatigue or strain for up to a four-hour work session. The XO MAX is capable of lifting and supporting up to 200 pounds without fatigue or strain for up to an eight-hour work session.\n\nAccording to Sarcos, the human operator bears none of the load of the exoskeleton or its payload, and can be donned and doffed in 30 seconds. These exoskeletons require minimal operator training because they permit natural, fluid and intuitive movement.\n\nThe Guardian XO and XO MAX robots are in development and are expected to be commercially available in late 2019.",

                "body": "European Union member states agreed at a summit in Brussels to take further punitive steps against Russia in the coming days for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a London-driven hate campaign against it.\n\nLate on Thursday, in a boost for British Prime Minister Theresa May, the 28-member EU collectively condemned the attack on a former Russian spy and said it was \"highly likely\" Moscow was responsible. They also recalled the EU ambassador to Russia.\n\n\"Additional steps are expected as early as Monday at the national level,\" summit chair Donald Tusk told reporters.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Paris and Berlin would be among countries taking further rapid and coordinated measures which other leaders said would include the expulsion of Russian officials and possible other retaliatory actions.\n\n\"We consider this attack a serious challenge to our security and European sovereignty so it calls for a coordinated and determined response from the European Union and its member states,\" Macron told a news conference.\n\nStanding beside him, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said EU countries would debate what measures to take \"and then act\".\n\nOne senior official familiar with discussions said the extent of measures in the coming weeks could be \"surprising\" and not confined to expulsions. There is no talk of more economic sanctions, whose enforcement has divided the EU in the past.\n\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he was likely to announce the expulsion of several people on Monday, after returning to Prague and consulting with his foreign minister.\n\nLithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said she was ready to expel Russian spies, whose activities she said were deeply harmful: \"It is certain that a coordinated action will be taken next week, maybe at the start of it,\" she said.\n\n\"It's absolutely obvious that the network exists and that it acts aggressively.\"\n\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis stressed that national governments wanted to retain control of the details in an area where they guard their sovereignty from Brussels. But most of those present would go home and prepare suitable steps.\n\nRussia has denied responsibility for the March 4 attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two. A British judge said on Thursday that both victims may have suffered brain damage from the attack.\n\nMoscow retaliated against May's move to expel 23 Russians by announcing the expulsion of the same number of Britons.\n\nOn Friday, the Russian foreign ministry described the EU accusation as \"baseless\" and accused the bloc of spurning cooperation with Moscow and joining \"another anti-Russian campaign deployed by London and its allies overseas with an obvious goal: to put another obstacle on the path to the normalization of the situation on the European continent\".\n\nIn Moscow, the expulsion of British diplomats went ahead, a convoy of minibuses speeding out of the embassy compound to applause after British embassy staff said their goodbyes in the courtyard under a light snowfall.\n\nA special charter flight is expected to fly the diplomats back to Britain later on Friday.\n\nFrance's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, on a visit to Kiev, signaled that Paris was considering expelling Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain. \"You will see,\" he said.\n\nThe summit statement hardened previous EU language on Russia's alleged role as French President Emmanuel Macron and others helped May overcome hesitation on the part of some of Moscow's friendlier states, some of whom questioned how definitive Britain's evidence is.\n\n\"What we will now consider in the coming days is whether we want to take individual action relating to Russian diplomats in Ireland,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters.\n\n\"We're not going to expel people randomly.\"\n\nWelcoming the solidarity she secured from the summit, May told reporters on leaving: \"The threat from Russia is one that respects no borders and I think it is clear that Russia is challenging the values we share as Europeans and it is right that we stand together in defence of those values.\"\n\nStill, some said they could ill afford Russian retaliation against their own Moscow embassies, some of which employ barely a handful of accredited diplomats.\n\nAustria said it did not plan to expel Russians.",

MGA Entertainment CEO Isaac Larian and other investors have pledged a total of $200 million and hope to raise four times that amount in crowdfunding to save part of the business, according to the Associated Press.\n\nToys R Us shoppers will have until April 21 to use their remaining gift cards at stores or online.\n\nClick here to see a map of all of Toys R Us' U.S. stores.",

                "body": "Hire seasoned attorneys and wealth managers and be ready to protect against lawsuits.\n\nIf the $421 million Mega Millions drawing Friday night has a winner, the lucky person will likely discover that buying the ticket was the easy part.\n\nWith the prize marking the fifth-largest jackpot in the game's history, whoever ends up snagging that windfall -- if anyone does -- will discover that handling that sudden wealth can be overwhelming. It's not as simple as getting a check and going on with your life.\n\nFirst up, say experts, is trying to protect your identity. Some states make it easy to remain anonymous when claiming the prize, while others require a bit more planning. And in some states, it's impossible.\n\nWhen you buy a lottery ticket, you should be aware of that state's laws. Even if you live in a different state, where you bought the ticket determines your options for remaining anonymous.\n\n\"Although the odds of winning a large jackpot are astronomically low, it's still worth a few minutes to do some Google research in advance,\" said Jason Kurland, an attorney with Certilman Balin Adler & Hyman, a law firm in East Meadow, New York.\n\nHere are some other tips for winners of big jackpots.\n\nThe general advice is to sign the winning ticket and make several copies. The idea is that if you somehow are separated from the ticket, your signature should help ensure you get the prize.\n\nHowever, a recent lawsuit in New Hampshire shows the importance of knowing your state laws before you do much of anything.\n\nIn that court case, a women known only as Jane Doe sued to keep her identity private after winning the $559.7 million Powerball drawing on Jan. 6. She had signed the back of her ticket, only to discover that her signature meant she could not try to claim her winnings anonymously.\n\nWhile the judge in the case ultimately ruled that her right to privacy was more important than the public's right to know her name -- she was allowed to collect the money via a trust -- the situation illustrates the importance of knowing your options.\n\nTypically, lottery winners have several months to claim their prize. This gives you time to assemble a team of experts that includes a financial advisor, accountant and attorney. (This should be your first call.)\n\nWhen you suddenly become one of the wealthiest people in the country, protecting your assets will become a priority. Make sure you choose your advisors carefully.\n\nWhether you remain anonymous or not, actually spending the money could reveal your new-found wealth. Experts say that having this cash makes you more vulnerable to lawsuits.\n\n\"If someone gets in a car accident with you or falls in your home and they think you have deep pockets, they might try taking legal action against you,\" said Annmarie Camp, an executive vice president at Chubb Personal Risk Services.\n\n\"Even if you're in an accident, and a high-end luxury vehicle comes to pick you up, the other person might say, 'Hmm, maybe my neck does hurt,'\" Camp said. \"That is absolutely a reality.\"\n\nConsult with an insurance agent who can offer protection against such potential claims, and make sure there are no gaps in your coverage.\n\nFigure out whether to take the lump sum or 30 allotments over 29 years. This decision is often made based on your tax situation. This is when relying on the advice of pros (and not family or friends) makes sense.\n\nBefore spending a dime, think about what this sudden wealth means -- not only financially, but emotionally.\n\nGive yourself time to process the magnitude of your win. This is often when winners begin to think about their legacy and what societal contributions they want to make. Some even set up their own charitable organizations.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nFor financial success, plan for the best and prepare for the worst\n\nThe best and worst states for the wealthy\n\nBad Social Security advice cost recipients $131 million, report finds",

That meant United now had one less seat to offer on the fully-booked flight.\n\nRead more from USA TODAY:\n\nIn a trade war between US and trading partners, small stocks may fare best\n\nSee 7 sexy new cars, SUVs debuting at the New York Auto Show\n\nRoyal Caribbean takes delivery of Symphony of the Seas, world's largest cruise ship\n\nOnce it looked like she was about to be that passenger, Preiss -- a communications director from Washington -- took to Twitter with a long list of complaints and gripes.\n\n\"United is offering $1K in travel credit for an oversold flight. If nobody bites, they will kick off the lowest fare passenger by pulling them out of the boarding line. For a flight that THEY oversold. Unreal,\" she said in an 8:19 a.m. ET tweet on Thursday that kicked off a Tweetstorm about the incident.\n\nShe continued in various Tweets:\n\ntweet\n\n\"I AM THE LOWEST FARE PASSENGER.\"\n\n\"They are kicking me off this flight.\"\n\n\"They can't board me on this plane because there is a broken seat.\"\n\n\".@united IS THE WORST.\"\n\nPreiss told NBC Washington she didn't want to miss the flight out of concern she would miss her friend's bachelorette weekend in Texas.\n\nWhen there were no volunteers to be bumped, Preiss says United singled her out because -- she claimed -- she paid the lowest fare.\n\nPreiss told NBC that United agents had offered her a $2,000 voucher, but she pressed for cash instead. Preiss said she thought the gate agent was about to issue a check -- not a travel voucher -- for $650 when another agent offered a $10,000 travel voucher and a spot on the next plane.\n\nPreiss accepted, tweeting a photo of the voucher while saying \"this is how badly United didn't want to give me cash.\"\n\ntweet2\n\n\"They really do not want to give me cash. They just offered me $10,000 in travel credit. TEN THOUSAND,\" she said in another tweet.\n\nUnited confirmed the woman's account to ABC News, adding: \"We issued this voucher per our policy.\"\n\nAs you might expect, Preiss ultimately concluded that the episode turned out OK for her.\n\n\"Well, I can say it was the best flight delay ever,\" she said to ABC News.\n\nUnited raised its cap last April for what its employees could offer fliers on oversold flights to $10,000 per passenger. That, of course, came after the global public relations crisis faced by the airline after passenger David Dao was bloodied as he was dragged off United Express Flight 3411 to free up a seat on the full flight.\n\nThe move was one part of a 10-point plan for customer-service changes that United enacted in the wake of the incident.\n\nBeyond that, United has struggled to stave bad press for a number of other incidents during the past year. Most recently, the airline faced scrutiny after a passenger's dog died in the overhead luggage bin after a flight attendant reportedly insisted the flier put it there. And in March, United reversed course after an employee backlash over a plan to replace bonus payments with an extravagant-but-limited lottery-style reward scheme.",

                "title": "Facebook data privacy scandal has one silver lining: Thousands of new jobs AI can't handle",
                "body": "More Americans may be deleting Facebook in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, but the social media giant is adding people to its ranks in a way that does pay: through thousands of new jobs. Facebook's struggles to contain the privacy and linked Russian election interference headlines underscore a big trend in technology careers that is still being sorted out and spent heavily on by major players. As smart as artificial intelligence (A.I.) gets, it is still not up to many critical job tasks that are required to protect companies from risks that can destroy not only bottom lines but reputations. The number of new jobs being created by Facebook reflects the scope of the challenge.\n\nFacebook is adding 5,000 jobs before the end of the year in security and community operations. That is on top of 5,000 new positions already added this year. By year-end, Facebook jobs in these areas will have increased from 10,000 to 20,000 (the teams involved are at 15,000 currently).\n\nOne position, content reviewer, is already staffed by Facebook with 7,500 workers. That's roughly the same number of employees as the entire workforce of Twitter and Snap combined. The 5,000 Facebook workers still to be added this year is a larger number than either of those companies, and represents 20 percent of Facebook's reported total employee level of approximately 25,000.\n\nFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg told CNBC on Thursday, \"We need to do more, we continue to do more. We are massively ramping hiring. We are going to continue to ramp even faster.\"\n\nIt was Facebook CEO's Mark Zuckerberg's comments to the New York Times and Wired, though, that laid out the limitations of AI and the need for human hiring. \"One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company. It's not all A.I., right? There's certainly a lot that A.I. can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at. So we're going to double the amount of people working on security this year. ... So it's really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal,\" he told the Times.\n\nThe Facebook CEO told Wired that when he started Facebook in 2004, \"People shared stuff and then they flagged it and we tried to look at it. But no one was saying, 'Hey, you should be able to proactively know every time someone posts something bad,' because the AI tech was much less evolved, and we were a couple of people in a dorm room. ... But now you fast-forward almost 15 years and AI is not solved, but it is improving.\"\n\nSandberg told CNBC that AI can catch \"99 percent\" of the \"bad actors,\" but Internet watchdogs are less sure, and after a loss of roughly $50 billion in Facebook's market capitalization over the past week, it seems like the responsibility of companies merits more spending on human talent. Simply put, algorithms are not as good as people at context.\n\n\"What we are learning is that you can't just throw more AI at a lot of these problems. You need people who understand how to train these systems so that they have the insight they need, and then how to monitor them,\" said Natasha Duarte, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy & Technology. \"They have to review flagged content and see what the tools might be missing, and understand how to go back and add training and data and try to improve the tools accuracy.\"\n\nFacebook is looking for workers to fill jobs in content moderation -- \"content reviewers\" -- who are tasked with taking correct action on a reported piece of content based on the company's Community Standards. The focus in hiring for this type of role is language and market knowledge to ensure the company has the most appropriate cultural context to cover content coming from all over the world, according to information provided to CNBC.\n\nThese people work to detect fake accounts, improve authentication, reduce harassment and scams, and promote child safety, among other tasks related to safety. Facebook moderators are paid above average in the industry, according to information provided by Facebook to CNBC, and are offered additional benefits which includes resiliency training (stress-related training) and support.\n\nDiversity in hiring is also key, a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nDuarte said diversity in hiring is critical. \"If you ask me what I think is the most important, whoever tech companies hire they need people from diverse backgrounds, racially diverse and diverse in terms of gender, and especially when we are talking about content moderation, there is a cultural element to that. You want to make sure people working on automated solutions for content are not just all from one cultural background.\"\n\nThe exact number of Facebook hires to be made in content review is not known, and will be a part of the 5,000 new jobs spread across security and safety. The broader team includes experts in enforcement in areas like child safety, hate speech, counter-terrorism and legal specialists. So it would include roles such as engineers or those who work directly with law enforcement. Not all of the new jobs are full-time with Facebook. The 5,000 jobs number includes a mix of full time employees, independent contractors and outsourced positions managed by vendor partners, at least in part driven by the need to match the work with Facebook's needs across global time zones, languages and markets.\n\nSamantha Wallace, who leads the technology practice for Korn Ferry's division that focuses on mid-level search, said the Facebook hiring drive reflects the difficulty companies are having in figuring out how to best take advantage of AI, and how to not become overly confident in it at the same time.\n\n\"It is a topic of conversation that comes up with increasing frequency,\" Wallace said. \"It's bleeding edge, AI and machine learnings and analytics and data scientists and all of it wraps into this one space with lots of buzzwords, which leads to lots of ambiguity.\"\n\nWallace said that she can't speak to Facebook's hiring specifically, but the search firm has found that outside of the core competencies related to AI, which require advanced degrees in science and math, traits like curiosity and persistence and creativity are important for hiring in roles related to the massive amount of data. \"Harnessing it is one thing and there's a technical role, but to make it something useful and strategic in decision-making requires non-technical traits within the AI world.\"\n\nWallace said there is an ocean of data that creates security and content issues, and that requires the subjective perspective from a human being to decide which pieces of data are content make it to the smaller pool that is widely shares. Google has in the past year been hiring more workers to filter terrorism-related content, but this isn't just an issue for social media companies, though they may feel it most acutely.\n\n\"Across industries the content management question is real for all organizations,\" Wallace said. \"In social media there is wide audience interacting with the platform on daily basis but others could be web-based or product descriptions disseminated through other channels. The content piece is important. ... These challenges are true for any organization, the integrity of data and security.\"\n\nThe Korn Ferry recruiter said there is a huge movement to fill these positions but there is also ambiguity about the responsibilities of the positions because it's an emerging field.\n\n\"We're a successful enough company that we can employ 15,000 people to work on security and all of the different forms of community [operations],\" Zuckerberg told the Times. \"As AI tools get better and better, will be able to proactively determine what might be offensive content or violate some rules, what therefore is the responsibility and legal responsibility of companies to do that?\"\n\n\"I think across industries there is a tidal wave of need coming, and there is an ongoing shortage of talent coming into the space,\" Wallace said. Companies aren't only playing catch-up but \"over-resourcing\" for these positions, she said, because they know they will have to \"upscale\" certain workers and create new skill sets in the future.\n\n\"They now there will be a need and know there will be a shortage so they build a team ... to make sure they have the resources in place when risks materialize in a critical way,\" Wallace said. She added, \"Organizations are moving to the 'we have to add these people now even if we don't know what they will do, what we will do with them.'\"\n\n\"You can't just build an algo to police the algo,\" Duarte said.\n\nCompanies need to have a diverse human pool with different academic backgrounds to come together and decide what a platform is really about and how a company wants it to serve users, and what harms it is concerned about, content concerns part of that policy discussion. If that is left to AI and the engineers who build the code, it will invariable get it wrong.\n\n\"Hate speech and sarcasm can be confused,\" Duarte said. \"It takes humans who understand the full scope and context to spot issues where we should be worried about an [A.I.] classifier going wrong.\"\n\nShe said Zuckerberg's comments about bridging the technical systems with the people in operations speaks to the potential divisions that stand in the way of proper decision-making. There are teams that work on content policy and on privacy policy and make the decisions to advocate for policies to govern platforms, and then there are the engineers who build the tools.\n\n\"Ideally, you have integration between policy and engineers, so policy goals are then informing tool builds,\" Duarte said.\n\nEven when companies like Facebook try to get it right in response to failings, the responses still have a history of failing themselves. Duarte pointed to her group's efforts to get Facebook to crack down on affinity targeting in ads, for example, routing ads related to homebuying away from minority groups -- a social media ad version of the unfair mortgage and real estate industry practices that made home-buying for African-Americans difficult for much of the 20th century. In 2016, the Center for Democracy & Technology advocated for more rules and guidance around how advertisers could target those ads. Facebook said it was fixing the problem and put out a blog post on its efforts. A subsequent investigation by ProPublica found that the Facebook fix didn't fix the problem -- ProPublica was able to serve ads in the exact way it shouldn't have been allowed to do anymore.\n\n\"We can't just throw AI at it and we don't want to have policy team and engineers siloed separately while building tools,\" Duarte said.\n\nOne option for Facebook suggested this week by one of the New York Times's reporters to interview Zuckerberg was to cut down on data and content issues by taking the option of getting smaller -- veering away from its free ad-supported model that makes malicious bots' manipulation more possible. But comments from the company's top brass shows that while it considers a version of its platform that could be offered on a paid basis, there are few signs it thinks that's the way to go for the majority of its global business.\n\nSandberg's comments on AI, though, present misgivings, or in the least, highlight the tension between man and machine. In addition to \"massively ramping\" hiring, she told CNBC, \"We are massively investing in machine learning and automation. ... There are areas where we've had great success. We take down 99 percent of ISIS or that kind of terrorist content before it even hits the platform. Machines make that possible and out commitment is clear.\"\n\n\"Right now, AI tool needs to be thought of like a student, that is where you get the most value,\" Wallace said. \"But right now many actually operate like a 5 year-old. You are getting some benefit and insight but need to teach them, so they are a ways away from full impact. How we teach them will effect what happens to jobs subsequently.\"\n\nMore from @Work:\n\nFacebook's leadership crisis explained\n\nYour next job interview may be with an AI\n\nAT&T's $1 billion gamble on the job of the future",

                "title": "Facebook under fire: Mark Zuckerberg's actions questionable in data scandal",
                "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook\n\nMuch of the news this past week has focused on what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did -- or did not do -- when he found out that Cambridge Analytica had gained unauthorized access to information about tens of millions of Facebook users.\n\nWhile much of the anger is connected to the billions of dollars of wiped-out stock value, little has been said about his leadership style: Only a few have questioned how the CEO of such an influential company could lack such self-awareness.\n\nAnyone can talk a big game, but true leaders follow through on their promises and commitments with their actions. Zuckerberg has faced the privacy of the data question, as well as the consumer protection question for as long as Facebook has existed. Over the recent years, his assurances have been more forthright. Words aside, did Zuckerberg act sufficiently over this recent debacle? Did he do everything he could to live up to the promises he made to his consumers with his actions, no matter what?\n\nHere are some of the basic things great leaders in business do to gain respect, maintain transparency and win success.\n\nToo many senior executives say things they don't really mean. What they often don't realize is that their subordinates and colleagues notice. As a result, they lose credibility. The last thing executives want is to lose credibility and trust from their team. The outcry of former employees -- senior and junior -- of late against Zuckerberg seem to suggest a credibility issue with teams and former colleagues.\n\nA common response is, \"I take full responsibility\"; \"The buck stops with me\"; \"We will sort this one out.\" The reality is measured by actions. Delayed, reluctant or indecisive actions do not build trust when the house is on fire. Actions speak louder than words.\n\nThe best way to secure your team's support is to win their hearts and minds. A good leader takes action -- consistent action.\n\nThe notion of servant leadership is grossly underrated and ignored by many. This means the leader exists to serve those under him. In contrast, traditional leadership is a top-down pyramid where the leader sits at the top, and subordinates do as the leader commands. Servant leaders turn that pyramid upside down by sharing power with their teams, placing the needs of their team before their own, and helping subordinates develop and grow so they can perform at the highest level possible.\n\nThe path to fulfillment as a corporate leader doesn't run through the boardroom; it runs through others.\n\n6 ways servant leaders achieve great results\n\n1. Commit genuine acts of empathy and self-sacrifice.\n\n2. Take bullets for the team so they don't have to.\n\n3. Stand up and stand tall for the team with stakeholders.\n\n4. Prioritize team learning and development and find opportunities to accelerate self-development.\n\n5. Create an empowering atmosphere, and encourage the team to take risks by letting them know they'll have the team's back if they fail.\n\n6. Above all, walk the talk; servant leaders make sure their own actions are consistent with what they expect from the team.\n\nI have seen corporate executives become crippled by fear of failure. When they face a big obstacle or a tenacious competitor, all they can think about is, \"What if I lose? What will the board say?\" They become so worried about losing that they can't focus on what they should be doing -- executing. In a sense, they end up defeating themselves.\n\nFear of failure often limits an executive's ability to act decisively and take action. As a result, these leaders and their companies tend to lose their \"priceless asset\" -- their reputations.\n\nMore from @Work:\n\nThe suddenly hot job market for workers over 50\n\nSilicon Valley reeling as Trump chokes off tech talent\n\nRecent college grads compete for a $12,000-a-year job in Chicago\n\n-- Vishal Agarwal is the bestselling author of Give to Get.

His anti-establishment message resonated strongly with Americans and catapulted him to the White House.\n\nTrump's selection on Thursday of John Bolton to succeed H.R. McMaster as National Security Advisor is a step in the wrong direction, as Bolton is as status-quo as they come.\n\nYou can say one thing for the former UN Ambassador, however: he has been consistent throughout his career. Consistently wrong, that is. In 1998, Bolton was one of 25 co-authors who published an open letter to President Clinton advocating for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.\n\nBecause it would be too difficult to confirm whether or not Iraq was genuinely disbanding its WMD program, Bolton's letter warned, \"in the not-too-distant future we will be unable to determine with any reasonable level of confidence whether Iraq does or does not possess such weapons.\"\n\nAs a consequence, the authors said the president must show \"a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing.\"\n\nYet diplomacy had in fact not failed, and Saddam had actually disarmed. Perhaps the most damning finding from Bolton and his colleagues was this claim: \"Although we are fully aware of the dangers and difficulties in implementing this policy, we believe the dangers of failing to do so are far greater.\"\n\nAfter more than 15 full years later, the spiral of chaos and violence unleashed in 2003 continues to burn in Iraq (and now Syria), and thousands of U.S. troops are still deployed there.\n\nOne might give the Ambassador some slack for having been wrong before-the-fact, but one would expect that with the passage of time and as the true scope of the failure has become clear, Bolton would have grudgingly acknowledged that fact.\n\nYet in an opinion article penned more than a decade later -- and despite mountains of evidence to the contrary -- Bolton remains emphatic in his claims that the invasion was a good idea.\n\nIn the 2016 article, Bolton asserted that by, \"eliminating Saddam's threat to Middle Eastern peace and security, the 2003 invasion fully justified itself.\" Leaving Saddam in power, Bolton argued, \"would have all but guaranteed further conflict with other Arab states, and a resumed quest for weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nThe evidence not only doesn't support that theory, it directly refutes it: as was confirmed, the UN weapons inspectors had successfully disarmed Saddam, he had dismantled his nuclear facilities, and with the sanctions then in place, he would have had no way to reconstitute the program and would have posed no threat to the region. Moreover, al-Qaeda would never have carved out a presence in Iraq and ISIS would never have risen. Unfortunately, that's not the only incidence of Bolton's suspect judgment.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolton argued that \"talking to the North Koreans is a waste of time.\" Yet Trump has now scheduled historic talks with North Korea's leader, and it appears the president actually does value talking to the North Koreans.\n\nOn Iran, Trump has made no secret of the fact he considers the nuclear agreement with Tehran to be \"the worst deal ever,\" and he wants to negotiate a better one. He does not, however, seek regime change. As president-elect in December 2016, Trump categorically said the United States, \"will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn't be involved with.\" Bolton, however, recently advocated the opposite. \"Our goal should be regime change in Iran,\" he stated.\n\nBolton will have to temper some of his personal views and recognize that the role of the National Security Advisor is not to push his own agenda, but to advise the president on how best to accomplish his objectives. George W. Bush's NSC chief Stephen J. Hadley, warned that whoever fills the role must avoid \"using the privileged position accorded to the National Security Advisor in this process to 'tilt' the process in favor of the outcome favored by the National Security Advisor.\"\n\nOver the past 17 years, the total number of people estimated to have been killed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria since those wars began is close to 819,000. Using a so-called 'preventive' strike in North Korea would almost certainly explode into an all-out war, potentially resulting in a million deaths in the war's opening weeks.\n\nBefore advocating for either regime change in Iran or war in North Korea, Bolton must offer a credible plan for how the likely results will not harm U.S. interests and make the situation materially worse than it is today.\n\nPresident Trump has had good instincts on several foreign policy matters since the 2016 campaign. If he does indeed hire Bolton to become his next National Security Advisor, let us hope that Trump does not sacrifice his good instincts in deference to Bolton's poor track record of advocating hawk-like impulses.\n\nCommentary by Daniel L.

                "body": "The Bank of America Merrill Lynch offices in the financial district, also known as the Square Mile, on January 24, 2017 in London, England.\n\nBank of America's Merrill Lynch routinely mislead customers by telling them billions of stock trades had been managed in-house when they were actually turned over to outside firms, part of a five-year scheme that New York's attorney general says made the bank's trading services appear more sophisticated than they were.\n\nOn Friday, the attorney general announced a $42 million settlement with Bank of America over what it called the \"masking\" strategy, which was applied to 16 million client trade orders between 2008 and 2013, representing over 4 billion traded shares.\n\nNew York's Eric Schneiderman said Bank of America admitted to having undisclosed agreements with electronic trading firms Citadel Securities, Knight Capital, D. E. Shaw, Two Sigma Securities and Madoff Securities to handle the trades instead.\n\n\"Bank of America Merrill Lynch went to astonishing lengths to defraud its own institutional clients about who was seeing and filling their orders, who was trading in its dark pool, and the capabilities of its electronic trading services,\" the attorney general said in a statement.\n\nThe misleading activity began in 2008. Bank of America hid the secret trading activity by reprogramming its systems to alter confirmations sent to clients about how their trades were handled. Bank of America employees referred to this activity as \"masking,\" Schneiderman said.\n\nIn an emailed statement to CNBC, Bank of America said, \"The settlement primarily relates to conduct that occurred as long as 10 years ago. At all times we met our obligation to deliver the best prices to clients. About five years ago, we addressed the issues concerning communicating to clients about where their trades were executed.\"\n\nBank of America was also accused of making inaccurate representations to investors about its trading services. It told them that as many as 30 percent of trades in an internally managed electronic trading pool came from retail investors, for example, when it was really more like 5 percent.\n\nTwo years ago, Schneiderman struck settlements with Credit Suisse, Barclays and Deutsche bank over trading abuses. Credit Suisse and Barclays paid $30 million and $35 million, respectively, to settle allegations they misrepresented to customers how trades were handled in so-called dark pools, which are private electronic trading sites where buyers and sellers are supposed to be protected from predatory high-speed trading behavior. Deutsche Bank paid $18.5 million to settle allegations it engaged in fraud in its trade order routing practices.\n\nThe three banks also settled parallel investigations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",

The survey did not ask how much students were investing and many could be buying only smaller amounts.\n\n\"I was definitely surprised,\" said Drew Cloud, The Student Loan Report's founder.\n\n\"Living on a tight budget, one would think students would spend that money on groceries, rent or school supplies rather than bitcoin and ethereum.\"\n\nUndergraduate students received on average around $4,600 in federal loans in the 2016-2017 academic year, according to the College Board.\n\nA student who spends their student loans on cryptocurrencies is violating their agreement with the government, said Elyssa Kirkham, of Student Loan Hero, a website for managing student loans.\n\n\"Investing is not an educational expense, so it's against the rules to use your student loan money to buy cryptocurrencies, \" Kirkham said.\n\nPlus, any gains are likely to be offset, she said, by the taxes a student would have to pay on them along with the fees and interest that come with student loans.\n\nShe did suggest an alternative.\n\n\"If you end up with extra funds, you can return those through your bursar's office to cancel out some of your debt. That's the wisest option.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies are certainly on the minds of college students.\n\nCourses on the digital tokens are now available at a number of colleges. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, students meet weekly at the Bitcoin Club. A company called Campus Coin is working to establish cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange at colleges across the country.\n\nBut there's a big difference between learning and experimenting, and putting your financial health at risk by using borrowed money to invest in a digital currency that could not exist in a few months.\n\n\"If you invest the student loans in cryptocurrency and lose money, you will still owe the student loans,\" said Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert. \"And, where will you get the money to pay for college costs?\"\n\nTo be sure, students aren't the only ones using debt to get into cryptocurrencies.\n\nNearly 20 percent of all people who own cryptocurrencies went into arrears to invest in them, according to a recent survey of 3,000 people by CoinDesk, a digital tokens information company.\n\n\"Investing from a credit card or a loan is a terrible idea as these assets are extremely risky and volatile,\" said Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who researches blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe added, \"Nobody should invest any amount in this space that they cannot afford to lose immediately.\"\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nBitcoin, once 'sketchy,' becomes more mainstream\n\nSome cryptocurrency-backed debit cards dropped from Visa network, leaving users scrambling\n\nBitcoin is too risky to treat as a 'serious' investment, financial advisers say",

                "title": "It's National Puppy Day -- here's why some dog lovers pay up to $250,000 to compete in shows",
                "body": "Flynn, a Bichon Frise, was crowned Best In Show, the most prestigious title awarded at the 142nd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City on February 13. Flynn beat out six fellow group champions and more than 2,800 other canines for the title. To celebrate, he took home the Westminster Legend Trophy and a polished pewter gallery bowl, among other rewards.\n\nNotably missing from the prize package: monetary compensation.\n\nWinning the show isn't really lucrative. In fact, few dog shows offer monetary prizes. But many competitors still believe the events are worth it and that there's nothing that can beat the feeling of a win.\n\nIn dog showing, a successful night is \"absolutely unforgettable and you have tears in your eyes,\" Glen VanDerHart, an owner who competed at Westminster with his Puli, Blu, tells CNBC Make It.\n\nWhile some best-in-show recipients can earn huge awards, such as the $50,000 offered by the AKC National Championship, dog-show competitors generally aren't focused on getting rich. But even competing is expensive.\n\n\"Depending on the number of shows you go to, it can go into the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands,\" VanDerHart says. Personally, he estimates that he spends a couple thousand dollars per year showing his dogs.\n\nSharon Fremer, the owner of a five-year-old Cardigan Welsh Corgi, Houston, says the same. She estimates that she invests around $7,000 per year on traveling, grooming and showing Houston.\n\nCosts can vary dramatically depending on how much owners are able, and willing, to spend. Leading up to a big competition like Westminster, top competitors typically \"campaign\" for a year to garner interest in their dog.\n\nThis can add up to more than $250,000 when you combine the costs of travel, entry fees and a professional handler, since handlers are common and range in price from $100 to $300 or more per show, depending on their experience level.\n\nWhen Jeanine Dell'Orfano travels with her Bergamasco Sheepdog, Faggia, she works with professional handler Amanda Shea of Sheaman Kennels. Shea's fees vary, according to her website: For all-breed shows, she charges around $100 but, for Westminster and other elite national competitions, that price rises to $300 to $500.\n\nMaintenance costs vary by breed as well. While Fremer describes her Corgi as \"wash-and-wear\" compared to other breeds, it takes VanDerHart a long time to clean and dry his Puli's cords. He grooms his dogs himself and says the most expensive part of taking care of the breed's dreadlock-like coat is conditioner, which runs around $25 per bottle. VanDerHart uses two bottles per dog per wash, as well as an arsenal of other products.\n\n\"If you're using high-quality products, you pay high-quality money,\" he says.\n\nOne of the largest costs associated with showing isn't specific to the dog at all: It's the price of traveling to out-of-town shows. Between transportation and hotel fees, travel expenses can add up quickly, especially for owners who frequently take to the road.\n\nYet despite this deluge of expenses, many owners remain committed to showing, even without a clear path to recouping their investment. Why do they choose to go through the laborious steps of prepping, training and traveling with pets?\n\nFirst and foremost, it's about passion. \"I have loved dogs for as long as I can remember,\" Fremer says. \"I used to steal people's cats and dogs and bring them home and hide them in my mother's laundry room as a child. I have a connection with all my animals. For me, it's teamwork. It's getting to bond with him. It's succeeding at something.\"\n\nVanDerHart cherishes the quality time spent with Blu. He compares the experience of showing dogs to that of parents watching their kids succeed academically. \"There's no prize money for the child doing well at school, but you take pride in the child doing well,\" he says.\n\nThe same feeling exists for VanDerHart when Blu succeeds: \"You have that thrill and that excitement, that love that exists there.\"\n\nDog shows also offer a more practical purpose for dog enthusiasts: breed awareness. Dell'Orfano's Bergamascos have only been recognized by the American Kennel Club for three years. She helped advocate for the breed to become AKC-recognized and she shows her dogs as a way to continue to generate excitement about them.\n\n\"Because they're new to AKC, we really want to promote the breed and make the public aware that they exist, and also to uphold their breed standard,\" she tells CNBC Make It. \"We show them so that judges become more familiar with the breed and get to know the breed, and get to know the standard so that they can compete on an even playing field with other breeds.\"\n\nIn the past, the AKC has garnered criticism for not enforcing stricter rules on breeders and failing to punish puppy mills that breed dogs without properly taking care of them.\n\nBut, others argue, when breeders handle litters responsibly, providing high standards of care and finding good homes for their puppies, they help with the long-term preservation of historical breeds.\n\nFor Dell'Orfano, who dedicates hours per day to her six Bergamascos, all the work is \"a labor of love ... something you want to invest in for the sake of your breed.\"\n\nIndeed, many owners and handlers say they are doing what they love. \"The dog show community is tight,\" Dell'Orfano says. \"We literally just have fun.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, showing simply comes down to pure enthusiasm for dogs for many owners. Taking home a trophy -- or a polished pewter bowl -- isn't bad, either, but \"it's never about the prize,\" VanDerHart says. \"It's about the thrill of the win. It's about your dog going out there and doing well and succeeding.\"\n\nThis is an update of a previously published article.\n\nDon't miss:\n\nExperts everywhere tell you to buy a home -- here's why they're wrong Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl puts every paycheck directly in the bank and drives a 'family car' Only 19 percent of Americans think they earn enough money\n\nLike this story?

According to research from McKinsey, nearly one-third of U.S. workers will need to find new jobs by 2030 in response to automation and rapid advancements in technology. However, billionaire philanthropist Melinda Gates says these stats should not be cause for concern.\n\n\"To be successful, every single one of us has to learn new skills -- not just once, but throughout our careers,\" she writes in a recent LinkedIn post.\n\n\"Anybody can learn science. Anybody can learn to be a good writer,\" Gates says in an accompanying video interview. \"It may be harder for some people, but that means you put your shoulder against it and you have some grit and you stick with it.\"\n\nGates acknowledges that emerging sectors such as robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are already affecting the types of jobs that are available. In light of this, she says that gaining expertise in new industries will be the deciding factor in your ability to maintain a successful career.\n\n\"If you're going to switch jobs, getting a little bit of training ... will help you with that,\" Gates explains. \"It'll not only help you with the confidence, it'll help you with the skills.\"\n\nIn recent years, there's been an increased focus on skills-based training programs as companies look to bolster their tech teams, including IBM. CEO Ginni Rometty announced in 2016 that the company was making a concerted effort to hire workers based on their skills, as opposed to their credentials, such as whether they attended a traditional four-year college.\n\n\"As industries transform,\" she wrote in a USA Today column, \"jobs are being created that demand new skills - which in turn requires new approaches to education, training and recruiting.\"\n\nHowever, Gates says that a typical four-year liberal arts education will always have a place in the job economy because it teaches students about curiosity, learning and how to face problems. She adds that while certain jobs, particularly those in tech, will require specific skills, other roles will require things like people skills, so having that educational background in terms of how you think, question and analyze will always be important.\n\nThe billionaire leaves workers of the future with this word of advice on learning new skills: \"You can absolutely do it. You just have to have the confidence to it.\"\n\nLike this story? Like CNBC Make It on Facebook.\n\nDon't miss: Bill Gates reveals the surprisingly simple reason he won't run for president in 2020",

                "title": "The Fed just raised interest rates -- here are 4 steps you can take to protect your money",
                "body": "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a point. That's the sixth rate hike since it began raising rates from when they were at near-zero in December 2015, and there are three more increases predicted for 2018.\n\nWhy does this matter outside of the finance world? Because, simply put, when interest rates rise, the price of money rises too, Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, tells CNBC Make It: \"That ripples out to every business, every consumer, every municipality, even other governments all over the world.\"\n\nFor the average consumer, it means that lots of things can become more expensive. And especially for those saddled with variable-rate debt, like credit-card debt, it can seem alarming. But don't panic.\n\n\"At this point, a rate hike is a vote of confidence in the economy and reflection of the fact that the economy is doing better,\" McBride explains.\n\nPlus, there's plenty you can do to protect your own finances. Right now, \"worry is not the right word,\" McBride says. Instead: \"Take action.\"\n\nHere are four ways you can insulate yourself from rising interest rates.\n\nIf you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, now is the time to try and switch over to a fixed-rate one, so you aren't as susceptible to further increases. \"If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, you could be in for a doozy of a payment increase at the next reset,\" McBride says.\n\nSay you lock in a 30-year fixed rate mortgage today at the average rate of 4.58 percent. If rates rise again later this year, your rate won't jump up to 4.75 or 5 percent.\n\nThat's because damage to your wallet from rate hikes happens cumulatively, McBride points out. Although your bills might not change too much after Wednesday's bump, things can start to add up after a few more.\n\nAnyone with debt will see an increase on their monthly bill within the next cycle or two. The best way to combat this, as well as the effect of future rate hikes, is to pay off as much outstanding debt as possible now.\n\nTry reading up on the most effective strategies for paying off debt. Here are some tips and tricks to get you started.\n\nYou can also take inspiration from this man who paid off $116,000 to become debt-free by 30 and this couple who eliminated $127,000 worth of debt in four years.\n\nAlthough most savings won't increase dramatically, some online banks are beginning to offer rates as high as 1.75 percent. To find the most competitive offers, check out Bankrate's comparison tool.\n\nHowever, if you choose to take advantage of these higher rates, be mindful of how long you're signing on for. \"Don't lock your money up for too long or you won't benefit from further interest rate increases,\" McBride says. \"Keep your money in short-term or very liquid accounts like savings accounts or short-term CDs.\"\n\nAs interest rates rise, it's normal to see volatility in the stock market. However, \"don't get too wrapped up in that -- focus on the long term,\" McBride says.\n\nAvoid buying impulsively or selling out of fear. During times of volatility, seasoned investors Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio agree that it's best to stay calm and stick to the basics.\n\n\"Don't watch the market closely,\" Buffett told CNBC in 2016 amid wild market fluctuations. \"If they're trying to buy and sell stocks, and worry when they go down a little bit ... and think they should maybe sell them when they go up, they're not going to have very good results.\"\n\nMcBride offers similar advice. \"The bottom line is, interest rates are going up because the economy is better,\" he says. \"It's that better economy that's ultimately good for corporate profits and stock prices. It just might be a bumpy ride in the meantime.\"\n\nDon't miss:\n\nYou may be paying off your credit card bill wrong -- here's the best way A man who paid off $116,000 to become debt-free by 30 shares his strategy A simple equation will show you if you're on track to save enough for retirement\n\nLike this story?

                "title": "Here's how Cambridge Analytica played a dominant role in Kenya's chaotic 2017 elections",
                "body": "Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta takes the oath of office during his inauguration ceremony in Nairobi, Kenya, on November 28, 2017.\n\nThe managing director of Cambridge Analytica, the data analysis firm at the center of a firestorm over its sway in multiple elections, was filmed describing its dominant role in Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's election campaigns in 2013 and 2017.\n\n\"We have rebranded the entire party twice, written their manifesto, done two rounds of 50,000 (participant) surveys,\" Mark Turnbull, MD of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, was covertly filmed saying by U.K. broadcaster Channel 4 in a report aired this week.\n\n\"Then we'd write all the speeches and we'd stage the whole thing -- so just about every element of his campaign,\" Turnbull added.\n\nCambridge Analytica is in the midst of a dispute after an undercover sting operation caught senior executives boasting about psychological manipulation, entrapment techniques and fake news campaigns. The company's CEO has been suspended and the U.K.'s Information Commissioner is seeking a warrant to raid its London office.\n\nIt is alleged to have used data gathered from Facebook users via a third party app to influence votes, including in the U.S. presidential election and the Brexit referendum, both in 2016. Cambridge Analytica has said that it was \"committed to being responsible, fair and secure with data.\"\n\nThe company's website describes its work in Kenya in 2013 as \"the largest political research project ever conducted in East Africa,\" which enabled the crafting of a campaign \"based on the electorate's real needs (jobs) and fears (tribal violence).\" The 2013 vote was the first after brutal violence in 2008, in which over 1,000 people were killed.\n\nCambridge Analytica's methods involved working with a local research partner \"to ensure that variations in language and customs were respected.\" The outcome targeted young voters via social media.\n\nThe spotlight on Cambridge Analytica's methods comes at a time when internet and social media-based influence over Kenyan voters has reached an apex, according to a Nairobi-based data analysis company.\n\n\"Misinformation and disinformation have been part of the Kenyan electoral experience since time immemorial,\" Samer Ahmed, founder of Odipo Dev, told CNBC via email. But it was during 2017's initial August election, and its subsequent October re-run, that a \"critical mass\" of the voter population was exposed to the internet and social media.\n\n\"This changed the game significantly with regards to the misinformation landscape,\" Ahmed said. He described \"filter bubbles\" on social media that acted as a \"strong conduit for the fake news we saw spreading within the country.\"\n\nAccording to Odipo Dev, Kenya's electorate was susceptible to influence in 2017 like never before, despite an equivalent vote occurring only four years earlier.\n\nA report by Nigerian e-commerce platform Jumia released in April 2017 found that 67 percent of Kenyans were internet users, in comparison to the African average of 18 percent -- a trend supported by the country's encouraging economic growth and burgeoning middle-class.\n\n\"In a developing, mobile-savvy country like Kenya, four years is a lot of time,\" Ahmed said. Improving infrastructure meant that internet and smartphone access was \"getting cheaper and better by the day.\" \"This is enabling adoption of social media and internet use on massive scales across the country,\" he added.\n\nKenya has approximately 7 million Facebook users, in comparison to just 4 million in 2013, Ahmed said.\n\nThe country's presidential election in August 2017 unraveled an unprecedented story. The vote, which pitted incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta against his long-standing rival Raila Odinga, was overruled by the Supreme Court in September, citing procedural irregularities. The election was held again in October, although Odinga boycotted the second race and Kenyatta emerged victorious with 98 percent of the vote.\n\nThe saga was marred by violence. 24 people were killed between the election on August 8 and August 12, when a statement was published by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR). Over 100 people were injured, according to Human Rights Watch later that month. From September 1 to October 25 -- with the second election taking place on October 26 -- the KNCHR recorded 25 deaths.\n\nThe 2017 election was a key driver of engagement on social media. Dominant conversations were amplified by coverage on traditional media too.\n\n\"Measuring whether and how 'misinformation' actually influences voters' choices is difficult, but there were certainly a number of sites and campaign ads that were flagged by Kenyans and international organizations as using scaremongering tactics to win votes ahead of the August 2017 elections,\" Rebekka Rumpel, research assistant for the Africa program at think tank Chatham House, told CNBC via email.\n\nThe 2017 vote saw two key incidences of misinformation, Odipo Dev said, the first being a video entitled \"The Real Raila,\" which depicted a post-apocalyptic world three years into an imagined Odinga presidency. On YouTube, this has been viewed over 141,000 times.\n\nThere was also misinformation about the violence that surrounded the electoral process, in which \"people were taking videos and photos of past occurrences and posing them as currently going-on events,\" Ahmed said.\n\nLondon-based charity Privacy International traced \"The Real Raila\" video back to Harris Media LLC, a U.S. digital advertising firm linked to President Donald Trump's election campaign.\n\n\"This shows the importance of widening the conversation beyond Cambridge Analytica and its role in the Kenyan elections, and examining the involvement and impact of Western PR and digital media firms in election campaigns in Kenya and across the world more generally,\" Rumpel said.\n\nKenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and its Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology did not respond to CNBC's multiple requests for comment.\n\nKenyan media giant Safaricom said in its 2017 sustainability report that its \"biggest challenge\" was tackling fake news.\n\nTurnbull also referenced work in Nigeria in the Channel 4's report. Cambridge Analytica's website also outlines its role in the first post-apartheid elections in South Africa, which took place in 1994.",

                "title": "The outrage over Facebook data leak is sending regulators 'a dangerous message'",
                "body": "I'm worried. As we all know, Facebook has a massive scandal on its hands with the Cambridge Analytica data leak. It's not clear the company knows what actually happened or how to handle it. There's a tremendous amount of untapped anger out there heading Facebook's way (what we've seen so far is just the beginning). And the message that anger, that outrage sends to politicians and regulators is very dangerous: \"Tech can be very, very bad. Don't trust them. Go ahead and regulate extensively.\"\n\nAnd whether Facebook likes it or not, regulation is coming. The California state senate is already debating legislation that would determine how \"Big Tech\" companies can collect and use consumer data. On the federal level, senators are calling for probes, the FTC is considering the same. And this is just the beginning.\n\nTweet\n\nBut just because Facebook has a lot of coming scrutiny and regulation doesn't mean we should throw out the tech baby with the bathwater.\n\nSaying that tech is good or tech is bad is like saying people are good or people are bad. It's not a one-size-fits-all definition. Either out of convenience, laziness or an unassailable love for a pre-set narrative, there's a danger that we will lump in anything that uses a semiconductor, a platform or an app as \"tech\" and then try to create laws and rules to govern it.\n\nThat's why the risk the Facebook scandal poses is far broader than just what happens to Facebook or how we regulate platforms in elections. It's that Facebook's sins of either omission or commission (probably some of both) can become an excuse to crack down on innovation - a way for politicians to do the bidding of their donors and get away with it.\n\nWe need to figure out what happened at Facebook. We'll likely need regulations to ensure it doesn't keep happening. But just as important, we need to make sure that Facebook's investigation and punishment doesn't become a justification to stifle competition and kill new ideas across the board.\n\nFacebook has as much in common with a startup created last month as the Yankees do with my son's little league team. How each \"tech\" company impacts society is radically different. The way we regulate and talk about them should note the radical differences too.\n\nFacebook is a massive company, who, like any massive company, uses its wealth, influence and market power whenever possible to curb regulation, deter competition and grow unabated - even while maintaining the brand's patina of reform, tolerance and concern for social good. This is how the world works - people with power want to stay in power.\n\nOther than a hoodie or two, Mark Zuckerberg no longer has anything in common with your average startup founder. His job - his fiduciary duty to his shareholders - is to keep growing and to take out anything in his way. That's no different from John Rockefeller or Andrew Carnegie or Sam Walton.\n\nFacebook has a lot more in common with the mega industries fighting disruption - casinos, hotels, hospitals, car dealers, electricity utilities - than it does with a company raising its seed round. Facebook's role in monetizing people's data or failing to respect their privacy or allowing interference with the 2016 election has nothing to do with a new startup offering a better way to provide birth control or sell cheaper insurance or allowing people to use the blockchain to transmit their legal documents.\n\nWhatever happens to Facebook cannot be used as an excuse to clamp down on innovation broadly, to stifle competition, to allow elected officials and their staffs to do the bidding of their campaign donors and justify it with \"Look at what Facebook did! We can't trust tech companies!\"\n\nEvery new startup is labeled \"a tech company.\" But there's no such thing as a new product or service that isn't tech-enabled in some way (technology was used to manufacture the paper cup I'm drinking coffee out of right now).\n\nAnd the vast majority of startups are new ideas, platforms and approaches that take an existing product or service and make it a little better, a little cheaper, a little more convenient - they're not massive technological innovations. That effectively makes every single new company a tech startup in some way - and it also makes every tech startup a regular company in some ways.\n\nRegulation of any new company should be designed to protect the public and allow the economy to grow and the market to function. Startups shouldn't be free from any regulatory scrutiny just because they have venture funding. And regulators shouldn't be free to deny permits and licenses just because they play golf with the incumbents facing disruption or because they don't like change.\n\nCommentary by Bradley Tusk, venture capitalist, political strategist and founder and CEO of Tusk Holdings.

                "title": "You can now eat a Bill Gates-backed, meatless 'Impossible Burger' at this Major League Baseball stadium",
                "body": "As Major League Baseball teams get ready for opening day 2018 on March 29, the kitchen at one stadium in California is making preparations of its own.\n\nThe Oakland Alameda Coliseum, home of the Oakland A's, announced Wednesday it will be serving up a twist on a ballpark classic that may be surprising to fans: a cheeseburger that doesn't use a scrap of beef.\n\nIt's the Impossible Burger, a burger made from all plant-based ingredients like wheat, coconut oil, potatoes and soy leghemoglobin, combined to replicate the look and taste of beef -- it even sears and is juicy like meat. The 300-employee Redwood City-based company behind the burger, Impossible Foods, has raised over $250 million in investment funding since its launch in 2011, with backing from investors like Bill Gates and Alphabet's GV (formerly Google Ventures).\n\n\"We're not getting rid of our regular cheeseburger, because this is not going to be for everybody,\" Jay Satenspiel, the senior vice president of food service and hospitality for Comcast's Spectra, which manages the stadium, tells CNBC Make It.\n\n\"This is a healthy alternative in the ballpark,\" he says. It's aimed for \"that person that lives a healthy lifestyle, the person that is involved in the carbon footprint that cattle and all sorts of feed do to the environment.\"\n\nIndeed, raising beef produces five times more climate-warming emissions than pork or chicken, according to 2014 research. Still, beef is a favorite at games: For a sold-out event with 40,000 people in attendance, the stadium can sell 12,000 burgers in a night, Satenspiel says.\n\nSo when he first heard of the Impossible Burger, he wasn't sure it would compare.\n\n\"I was very skeptical,\" he says. \"They cooked it for me, and I watched it cook, and I smelled it, and I watched it caramelize, and then I tasted it.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh my god, this is insane.' You could not tell the difference,\" he laughs. \"Especially if you put it on a bun with some lettuce and tomato.\"\n\nFor the Oakland Alameda Coliseum, selling the burger is also a strategy to compete in a changing market for sports fans, Satenspiel says.\n\n\"It used to just really be about the game that was on the field,\" he explains. \"Now, it's become an experience. It's become a destination for people to come to, and the culinary aspect of that experience is huge. It is probably the biggest factor in a fan's overall experience outside of the product that's on the field.\n\n\"We have to push the envelope and ensure we're not just some some cookie cutter [stadium] offering hamburgers, hotdogs, nachos and pretzels,\" Satenspiel continues.\n\nBaseball stadiums have \"led the way\" in upgrading the menus served at professional sports stadiums according to a 2017 report by The New York Times, partly thanks to \"22 major league stadiums that have been built since 1990.\" But traditions remain, and the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council estimated baseball fans would eat nearly 19 million hot dogs in 2017.\n\nFans seeking Impossible Foods' non-traditional burger can find it during the Oakland A's exhibition game Sunday, March 25 at a concession stand and the stadium's Shibe Park Tavern restaurant.\n\nSelling a plant-based burger in a sports stadium is a big feat for Impossible Burgers, and signals a shift in consumer attitudes toward food, Jessica Appelgren, the vice president of communications at Impossible Foods tells CNBC Make It.\n\n\"Certainly there is a major cultural milestone here that [selling] the burger at the Oakland Coliseum represents,\" Appelgren says. \"The cultural significance of our burger weaving its way into sports culture is wonderful.\"\n\nAnd, she says Impossible Foods is increasing its production capabilities to meet growing demand for the burger in eateries like the stadium and the 1,000 restaurants across the U.S. that sell the dish.\n\nThe company's manufacturing facility in Oakland is on track to produce 1 million pounds a month of the burger, Applegren says. The facility is also looking to add 50 more employees in 2018 to its current staff of 50.\n\n\"That's all just to ramp up supply to meet this demand,\" Appelgren says.\n\nFake meat products like the Impossible Burger may be so convincing that the beef industry is starting to worry. In February, the U.S. Cattleman's Association filed a petition with the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking the agency for an official definition for terms like \"beef\" and \"meat.\"\n\n\"The labels of 'beef or 'meat' should inform consumers that the product is derived naturally from animals as opposed to alternative proteins such as plants and insects,\" according to the USCA's petition.\n\nDon't miss: Ikea test kitchen's new menu has Swedish meatballs made out of mealworms\n\nLike this story?

                "title": "Cadillac is reinventing its entire lineup after years of losing US market share",
                "body": "The company has been heavy on sedans in an SUV market, has had issues with dealers and has not been able to connect with key groups of customers.\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade, a full-size luxury sport utility vehicle, sparked a renaissance for Cadillac a decade ago. Today, rivals print money from a boom in SUV and truck sales, while General Motors' high-end brand is left mostly on the sidelines\n\nCadillac dealer Will Churchill of Frank Kent Cadillac in Fort Worth, Texas, said the situation is tough to witness.\n\n\"We have four cars in the fastest-shrinking segment in the industry, and only two in the fastest growing,\" Churchill told CNBC. \"It is amazing we are selling as well as we are.\"\n\n\"It is highly frustrating when all your luxury competitors are doing big things,\" he said. \"The SUVs we have are selling well, we just don't have enough of them.\"\n\nChurchill knows Cadillac SUVs will sell. He saw it happen with the Escalade, which went into production in the late 1990s. In fact, that vehicle was crucial to Cadillac's success at that time.\n\n\"Without the Escalade, I don't know where we would be as a brand,\" he said.\n\nBut, finally, plans are taking shape. In late March, Cadillac will unveil a new, much-hyped luxury crossover called the XT4, marking the start of an extensive and long-awaited reinvention of Cadillac's global vehicle portfolio.\n\nAds featuring the silhouette of the XT4, which GM will unveil Tuesday ahead of the New York Auto Show, are already airing. After that debut, a torrent of 11 new vehicles will follow -- about one every six months through 2021. It is all part of a much-needed, 10-year plan to rebuild Cadillac as a global luxury carmaker with a broad product portfolio at a key time.\n\nThe revamp also extends to its dealerships, where customers should see a better shopping and service experience, and perhaps a new approach to marketing, which could help it to win new buyers.\n\nCadillac has lost ground in the U.S., even as premium vehicle sales have risen and Cadillac's business has boomed in Asia. This is despite the fact that Cadillac had its second-highest global sales volume in its 115-year history in 2017.\n\nIn 2010, Cadillac commanded a 10.7 percent share of the premium auto market, according to IHS Markit. By 2017, its share slipped to 7.6 percent.\n\nDuring that time period, premium car sales in 2017 rose 51 percent to 2.07 million units from 1.37 million units in 2010. But Cadillac sales barely budged. The brand sold about 156,000 units in the U.S. in 2017, up from 147,000 units in 2010.\n\nThe marquee name that once called itself \"The Standard of the World\" and for decades defined American-style luxury automobiles with its large, spacious cars, was outshined by competition on its home turf.\n\n\"With a smaller product line than brands like Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, including having fewer CUVs, Cadillac has not taken part in the sales growth of the premium segment over the past seven years,\" said IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley.\n\nCadillac's leadership says it has a long-term plan, and that the organization is on track to meet goals.\n\n\"In 2015, Cadillac set out on a 10-year journey, which has been well documented, to build the brand for long-term success,\" Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen told CNBC. \"Now, in the beginning of our fourth year of this plan -- despite 2017 being a year without major launches -- Cadillac as a global organization is exactly where it should be. The brand is rising across the board and we are poised for a very strong 2018 and beyond.\"\n\nBut numbers are painting a less flattering picture. Cadillac's U.S. sales in 2017 were down 8 percent from the previous year.\n\nCadillac does make some widely praised cars. Its CTS-V and ATS-V cars, for example, have been extolled as first-rate, track-ready sport sedans. The larger CT6 sedan has also garnered praise, and some reviewers have deemed Cadillac's Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system one of the best available.\n\nDespite that praise, Cadillac sedans might still be a bit too small for what Americans want in a sedan, said George Peterson, president of AutoPacific, a market analysis firm. Prices might also be a bit too high.\n\n\"De Nysschen is trying to build the brand by establishing a high price and sticking to it come hell or high water, and I think it is working against them,\" Peterson said. \"It is a tough thing to premium price a car when it doesn't deliver on that price.\"\n\nChurchill, the Cadillac dealer, did not think price was a significant factor holding back buyers. He thinks the sheer takeover of SUVs in recent years is Cadillac's biggest obstacle. Since the recession, SUVs have shot up in popularity, with sales rising to 7.28 million in 2017 from a mere 2.88 million in 2009.\n\nSUVs have also increasingly taken over the higher end of the market, where large sedans and high performance cars used to dominate. In 2009, premium SUV and crossover sales were a mere 440,000 units, down from 702,000 in 2007, according to IHS Markit. But that has more than rebounded since then, reaching 1.19 million units in 2017.\n\n\"In examining the sedan marketplace, you cannot simply look at the price and size [of] the ATS and CTS, but rather examine what is transpiring across all luxury automakers in the sedan category,\" de Nysschen said. \"As SUVs continue to dominate sales, all automakers are struggling to move their respective sedans.\"\n\nThe hard time car companies are having moving sedans, even highly desirable brands, is reflected in the extraordinarily high incentives dealers are offering to get cars off their lots.\n\nDe Nysschen, citing JD Power data, added that other brands have at times resorted to incentive spending on sedans that reach 30 to 50 percent of average transaction prices.\n\n\"The industry has never witnessed those levels of incentives,\" he said.\n\nThe SUVs Cadillac does make are selling well, de Nysschen said. Sales of the XT5, for example, rose 73 percent year over year in 2017. The SUV occupies the No. 2 position in its segment and is the third best-selling luxury SUV in the U.S, he said.\n\n\"We have also carried that momentum into 2018 where the Cadillac Escalade has gained significant retail market share and posted large increases in average transaction prices despite new competition in the segment,\" he said.\n\nCadillac's ongoing overhaul of its dealer operations, called Project Pinnacle, is controversial among some of its dealers. De Nysschen acknowledged that the program has led to tensions at times.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, it is doing what it was intended to do,\" he said. \"Many of the dealers who have embraced the program are delivering an elevated customer experience and are seeing commensurate returns.\"\n\nChurchill, who is chairman of the National Cadillac Dealership Council, a group representing the roughly 900 dealers around the country said the changes created a lot of new requirements for dealers and changed how they were paid.\n\n\"There were a lot of new requirements, and any time you change the way dealers get paid, there is going to be a lot of angst in the system,\" Churchill said.\n\nThe new plan rewards dealers based on how much they invest in resources specifically for Cadillac, including things like dedicated sales staff and roadside assistance. If Cadillac wants to compete with Mercedes, Audi and Lexus, Churchill said, the brand will have to ensure the shopping and ownership experience is as premium as those offered by other luxury brands.\n\nSome industry watchers have also questioned the direction Cadillac's marketing has taken in recent years. Cadillac moved its headquarters from Detroit to New York, and much of its advertising appears to be targeting folks living in coastal cities, said Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland. Advertisements frequently featured cars driving over cobblestone streets in places like Manhattan's Soho district.\n\nWhile this may be bringing in new buyers and raising the brand's profile, it doesn't resonate with many of Cadillac's core buyers, who are often wealthy, but oriented toward domestic brands, Lindland said.\n\n\"Our data show that vehicles Cadillac owners consider are not limited to German or Japanese luxury. They are also looking at a fully loaded Buick or totally tricked out Fords,\" she said.\n\nPeople considering a Cadillac are almost twice as likely to be domestically oriented as the general public, which is to say they want to buy products from American companies.\n\n\"I don't think it is about benchmarking the German cars,\" she said. \"What is unique and needs to be celebrated is that the CTS and ATS are luxury American muscle cars.\"\n\nOther research suggests Cadillac's buyers tend to be older, which could present challenges for it in the future. The brand is not connecting with young buyers, said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, which conducts large surveys of vehicle owners and buyers.\n\nYounger people aren't considering Cadillac in the way they are considering other brands, even those they cannot afford at the moment, such as BMW.\n\nStrategic Vision's research has found that 34 percent of buyers younger than age 29 would definitely consider buying a Tesla, 28 percent would consider Audi, 26 percent would consider Lexus and 25 and 22 percent would consider BMW and Mercedes, respectively. Only 9 percent would consider Cadillac. To be fair, even fewer would consider buying a Chrysler, a Mini, a Buick or an Alfa Romeo.\n\nCadillac has always appealed to older buyers, but it needs to think about winning buyers from emerging markets, ethnic minorities and young people to stay relevant, Edwards said.\n\n\"I would be sure I understand those younger buyers,\" he said. \"Cadillac doesn't have a long way to go to find success. However, they have to shift their thinking from trying to think 'how can we be as good as Mercedes?' to 'what are we going to do to get younger people, emerging markets ethnic minorities?'\"\n\nIt is important to point out that Cadillac is just one brand in GM's stable, whereas Mercedes stands on its own. So GM can also steer younger buyers toward its other, less premium names.\n\nDe Nysschen said Cadillac has made moves to target younger buyers.\n\n\"This is not easy task, nor one that will happen overnight,\" he said.\n\nCadillac hired a new chief marketing officer, Deborah Wahl, in early March. It is a sign that the company is pursuing a new direction, Churchill said.\n\n\"Johan has sent it down a path that dealers are engaging in and excited about,\" Churchill said. \"There is a lot going on that is positive, but we have to get the sales volume to go with it.\"",

                "body": "You receive an email from your tax software provider: \"There's been some unusual activity on your account,\" it reads. \"Please click on this link to reset your password.\"\n\nOn the website, you log in, unwittingly providing criminals access to a trove of personal data, including your Social Security number, bank account information, address and salary.\n\nThat's because that email and website didn't actually belong to your tax software provider but to a so-called \"phisher,\" who used your log in information to break into your real account. Such attacks are on the rise -- recently, the IRS warned of a \"phishing epidemic.\"\n\nNow a new report by Global Cyber Alliance, a cyber-security research firm based in New York and London, found that some of the most popular tax software providers don't use enough email protections to secure communications with customers.\n\nThose include: FreeTaxUSA, TurboTax, H&R Block and TaxAct.\n\nTo be sure, the report determined the safety of these providers based on just one criterion -- whether or not they use a highly secure method known as DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance), which weeds out phony emails from phishers.\n\nFreeTaxUSA and TurboTax have the DMARC protocol in place, but neither are using it to block fake emails, and H&R Block and TaxAct are not using the method at all, the report said.\n\nIt found that Liberty Tax was the only one of the top tax software providers (based on a PC Magazine ranking of tax software) that uses DMARC to reject phishing emails.\n\nAlmost half of taxpayers who file federal income taxes use tax prep software, according to personal finance website NerdWallet. In 2016, one in 131 emails contained malware, the highest rate in 5 years, according to Symantec, a digital security company.\n\n\"One of the best ways to stop phishing is to deploy DMARC,\" said Philip Reitinger, president and CEO of Global Cyber Alliance.\n\nThe tax software companies disagree.\n\nThe report's method was narrow and cannot come to a conclusion about a company's security, said Matt Gause, of FreeTaxUSA.\n\n\"The Global Cyber Alliance report only tells part of the security story,\" Gause said, describing the other protective measures it takes.\n\nHe said those include DomainKeys Identified Mail or \"DKIM,\" which verifies email senders and Sender Policy Framework or \"SPF,\" which prevents sender address forgery. It's also in the process of updating its DMARC protocol, Gause said.\n\nA spokeswoman for TurboTax echoed that message.\n\n\"TurboTax takes the security of our customers and their data seriously,\" said Lisa Greene-Lewis, senior communications manager at TurboTax. \"We leverage DMARC and an array of security protocols and best practices while engaging with our customers.\"\n\nTom Collins, vice president of corporate communications at H&R Block, said it takes the protection of emails very seriously.\n\n\"We continue to assess the threat and available tools in the ongoing effort to combat phishing attacks,\" Collins said.\n\nTaxAct did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlthough DMARC is not the only way to block these attacks, it's a very good one, said Giovanni Di Crescenzo, an adjunct professor at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering who researches phishing.\n\n\"The number of attacks are rising and consumers should chose the service that provides the highest level of security,\" Di Crescenzo said.\n\nA quick glance at the email address might have you believe it's legitimate, but if you scroll over it with your mouse, you'll see that the address is completely different -- and suspicious.\n\nSame goes for any website an email directs you to: double check the URL and look for any warning signs, for example, the TurboTax website you're looking at is not in fact TurboTax's website.\n\nAnother popular phishing method is to get you to click on a link in the email, which then installs malware that could potentially give hackers free reign to your computer.\n\nTry not to click on any links within an email, said Engin Kirda, professor at the College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University.\n\n\"If you can avoid this, you will be much safer against attacks,\" Kirda said.\n\nIf you have to click: Do it on a smartphone, which are still less targeted by hackers than traditional desktop, he said.\n\nThe Global Cyber Alliance recommends never emailing personal or sensitive information.\n\nYour tax software provider typically should only require you to input such data by logging directly into your account.\n\nInstall a \"Domain Name System\" (DNS) security solution that will help to block malicious website links should a phishing email make it to your inbox, says the Global Cyber Alliance.\n\nOne such free solution is Quad9.net. Another one is OpenDNS.\n\n\"DNS is a great way for people to protect themselves,\" Reitinger said.\n\nShould you suspect you've been attacked, make sure your credit score is protected by freezing it at Equifax, Transunion and Experian, the major credit reporting companies.\n\n\"This does cost something like $5, but it is totally worth it,\" Kirda said. \"Attackers cannot access it.\"\n\nYou should also change your password immediately.\n\n\"Be vigilant,\" Kirda said. \"Always monitor all your bank accounts and credit and contact the authorities as soon as you spot something suspicious.\"\n\nPhishing is not the only tax scam. People need to be aware of the risks from these fake returns and others schemes, which are increasingly on the rise.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nWhy it's time to push for lower insurance rates\n\nTax season is here: How to make filing relatively painless\n\nThese new rules will help protect older Americans from fraud",

                "body": "More than 25 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan have fundamentally changed the size and makeup of the U.S. veterans' population. The Department of Veterans Affairs says Gulf War-era veterans -- which it defines as those who served at anytime between the start of Operation Desert Shield in 1990 and the present day -- are now the largest group of veterans, comprising nearly half the veteran population, and outstripping Vietnam veterans by more than 600,000.\n\nThe changing makeup of the veteran population -- including a larger percentage of younger veterans -- is also changing the nature of fraud involving the veteran community. The VA's Office of Inspector General reports that between last April and October alone, its Office of Investigations made 80 arrests, and recovered $2.9 million in restitution, fines and penalties relating to things like VA health-care benefits fraud. That is more than twice the amount recovered in the same period a decade ago.\n\nAmong the most egregious cases in recent years involved former Idaho National Guard Lt. Darryl Wright, who admitted in 2016 to scamming state and federal governments out of more than $700,000 in benefits -- not to mention a Purple Heart -- by lying about injuries he claimed to have suffered while serving in Iraq.\n\nSpecial Agent Joe Rogers with the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General, who investigated Wright's disability claims, found what investigators would later call \"a tale of two Darryls.\"\n\n\"Mr. Wright first filed in 2010, and he told Social Security that his disabilities were pretty severe,\" Rogers told CNBC's \"American Greed,\" \"that he couldn't get out of bed several days a week, he had trouble walking, he used a cane, he couldn't feed himself, he couldn't tie his shoes, he couldn't manage his belt, button his pants.\"\n\nBut undercover surveillance showed Wright doing yardwork outside his home in Snoqualmie, Washington, and coming and going without the use of so much as a cane. Security video even showed him getting into a bar fight.\n\nAnd his lies went beyond disability claims. Wright used his concocted injury story to apply for two medals -- the Army's Combat Action Badge and the Purple Heart -- even using the name of a fellow soldier, Sgt. Brad Aune, to try and bolster his claims.\n\n\"I was furious,\" Aune told \"American Greed.\" \"We really did a hell of a good job as far as I'm concerned while we were in Iraq and to have someone throw our good name under the bus and just start creating all these documents with my name on them -- 99.9 percent of that stuff is not true.\"\n\nToday, Aune works full time as a veterans' advocate and counselor in Fargo, North Dakota, part of a growing network of vets and veteran groups trying to fill gaps left by the beleaguered VA.\n\nOne such organization is the Texas-based Green Beret Foundation, which says it has provided support for more than 2,500 veterans of the Army Special Forces since the organization was founded nearly a decade ago. Increasingly, the foundation is also fielding complaints about so-called stolen valor cases not unlike Wright's scam.\n\n\"Really, what we're trying to do is we're working to educate the public,\" said Lyle Hendrick, a former Green Beret and a private investigator who serves as an ambassador for the foundation. \"The stolen valor acts that these people commit are just inexcusable.\"\n\nVeterans' advocates say stolen valor is more than just repugnant. It can also sap vital benefits from veterans who truly need it.\n\n\"The VA and the pot of money, it's a limited amount,\" Hendrick said. \"So those programs that they are supposed to be sponsoring, the benefits that they're supposed to be giving to legitimate veterans, doesn't always make it to them.\"\n\n\"You get a broken wheel like Darryl Wright, that screws it up for the rest of us,\" Aune said.\n\nWright might have been able to continue the scam for much longer were it not for a supervisor at the federal agency where he worked. After reporting her suspicions about Wright, C.J. Jackson found herself under fire for allegedly violating the privacy of a disabled veteran. She was eventually vindicated, but not before racking up, she says, hefty legal bills and untold stress.\n\nEven so, Hendrick urges employers to report suspected fraud to authorities. One way is via the VA Office of Inspector General hotline, staffed weekdays between 8:30 a.m .and 2 p.m. Eastern time, at 1-800-488-8244.\n\nHendrick also urges people to take the time to learn about military culture, not only as a way to spot potential fraud, but also to understand why veterans, by and large, are such a special breed.\n\n\"We really like talking to groups, people that don't know, well, what is a Green Beret and how are they different from the Rangers,\" he said. \"Because when you look at the history of the U.S. Special Forces, and look at the number of warriors that have received the Medal of Honor for actions on the battle field, that in itself is impressive.\"\n\nDarryl Wright, sentenced to three years in prison and stripped of his medals, is an exception to the rule. And while he has been ordered to pay more than $600,000 in restitution, it is clear he stole more than just money from his brothers on the battlefield.\n\nGo inside the double life of Darryl Wright, and see how authorities finally bring him down, on the next all-new episode of \"American Greed,\" Monday, March 26, at 10 p.m. ET/PT on CNBC.",

                "title": "Elon Musk: Starting SpaceX and Tesla were 'the dumbest things to do'",
                "body": "Elon Musk isn't afraid of a bad idea. In fact, the billionaire CEO recently tweeted, \"Creating a rocket company has to be one of the dumbest and hardest ways to 'make money'.\"\n\nTweet\n\nAnd as USA Today pointed out, the billionaire CEO recently described starting SpaceX and Tesla, the two companies he's best known for founding, as possibly \"the dumbest things to do\" in terms of new ventures.\n\nThat's surprising, to say the least, especially considering that Tesla a market cap over $52 billion, while Forbes values the private rocket company SpaceX at more than $20 billion.\n\n\"If you were to do a risk-adjusted rate of return estimate on various industry opportunities, I would put building rockets and cars pretty close to the bottom of the list. They would have to be the dumbest things to do,\" Musk told Jonathan Nolan, the co-creator of HBO's \"Westworld,\" during a SXSW Interactive panel in Austin in March.\n\nMusk said he founded SpaceX and became CEO of Tesla because he believed in the companies' abilities to change the world for the better.\n\n\"I gave basically both SpaceX and Tesla from the beginning a probability of less than 10 percent likelihood to succeed,\" Musk said, citing the wide array of challenges associated with building rocket ships within the private sector. He also noted the difficulty of launching a mass-market electric car in the ultra-competitive auto industry, where he said there is a \"graveyard of companies\" that went bankrupt trying to do so.\n\nDespite the risks, Musk said he wanted to find solutions for \"things that don't seem to be working that are important for our life and for the future to be good.\"\n\nAnd Musk's career shows that he is nothing if not a risk-taker.\n\nMusk has said that a \"crazy\" number of people tried talking him out of going into the rocket business before he founded SpaceX in 2002. \"One good friend of mine collected a whole series of videos of rockets blowing up and made me watch those. He just didn't want me to lose all my money,\" Musk said on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" in 2014.\n\nMusk reportedly earned $180 million in 2002 from eBay's $1.5 billion purchase of PayPal. Musk had been the largest shareholder of the money-transfer service after it merged with his own online payments company, X.com, in 2000.\n\nMusk said during his talk at SXSW, that after the sale of PayPal, he was trying to decide between new ventures involving either electric cars (he had planned to study \"advanced energy storage techniques for electric vehicles\" at Stanford before dropping out of his PhD program at age 24) or space. He felt that space ventures were the least likely to attract a lot of entrepreneurs.\n\n\"I thought, 'nobody is going to be crazy enough to do space, so I'd better do space,'\" said Musk.\n\nBut instead of focusing solely on what was already an ambitious venture in SpaceX, Musk decided two years later, in 2004, to get involved with Tesla, leading a Series A investment round and joining the company's board as chairman.\n\nAt SXSW, Musk said it was the \"biggest mistake of my career\" to think that he could easily balance his time between SpaceX and Tesla.\n\nInstead, Musk noted, SpaceX had to endure a series of failures before becoming a viable private rocket manufacturer. In 2008, SpaceX nearly died completely, as the company's first three launches of its first rocket, the Falcon 1, failed. A fourth failure \"would have been absolutely game over,\" Musk said, speaking about that period at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) conference in Adelaide, Australia in 2017. Luckily, the fourth launch attempt was successful, and the company then landed a government contract from NASA worth about $1.6 billion.\n\nTesla also nearly went bankrupt in 2008, Musk has said, and the company continues to face challenges that include current production delays on the company's Model 3 sedan. Nevertheless, Tesla's shareholders recently approved a $2.6 billion stock compensation plan for Musk.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk is still not shying away from taking on further risky ventures, such as the cheekily named The Boring Company's plan to dig tunnels and build an ambitious high-speed, underground transportation system. (Musk has even sold more than 50,000 branded hats at $20 each, as well as 20,000 flamethrowers for $500 a pop, to raise money for The Boring Company.)\n\nMusk also confirmed to CNBC Make It that he's looking to get into the media business with a new venture called \"Thud,\" which he's reportedly staffing with former writers for the satirical publication The Onion.\n\n\"It's pretty obvious that comedy is the next frontier after electric vehicles, space exploration and brain-computer interfaces,\" Musk recently told CNBC Make Itvia a Tesla spokesperson. \"Don't know how anyone's not seeing this.\"\n\nIf Musk is concerned about any of his multiple risky ventures, he isn't letting on. At SXSW, Jonathan Nolan asked the billionaire if he tries to plan around failures based on his experience dealing with SpaceX and Tesla obstacles in the past.\n\n\"I don't really have a business plan,\" Musk said at SXSW, noting that he hasn't had a formal business plan since he launched Zip2, his first successful startup in 1995.\n\n\"These things are just always wrong, so I didn't bother with business plans after that.\"\n\nDon't miss: Elon Musk explains his motivation to succeed: \"There need to be things that inspire you\"\n\nLike this story?

                "body": "A worker carries lumber as he builds a new home in Petaluma, California.\n\nSales of new U.S. single-family homes unexpectedly fell for a third straight month in February, weighed down by steep declines in the Midwest and West.\n\nThe Commerce Department said on Friday new home sales dropped 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 618,000 units last month. January's sales pace was revised up to 622,000 units from the previously reported 593,000 units.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast that new home sales, which account for 10 percent of housing market sales, would rise 4.4 percent to a pace of 623,000 units last month. New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis.\n\nThey rose 0.5 percent from a year ago. Sales decreased 3.7 percent in the Midwest and 17.6 percent in the West, which has experienced rapid price growth amid a shortage of homes for sale. They rebounded 19.4 percent in the Northeast and 9.0 percent in the South, which accounts for the bulk of new home sales.\n\nThe housing market has slowed in recent months as an acute shortage of homes, especially on the lower end of the market, squeezes sales while pushing up prices. Rising mortgage rates could make buying a home even less affordable for first-time buyers, who have been largely priced out of the market.\n\nThe median new house price was $326,800, a 9.7 percent increase from a year ago. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is hovering at a four-year high of 4.45 percent, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. In contrast, annual wage growth has been stuck below 3 percent despite the unemployment rate dropping to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.\n\nIn February, there were 305,000 new homes on the market, an increase of 2.0 percent and the highest level since March 2009. The stock of new homes still remains well below its peak during the housing market bubble in 2006.\n\nAt February's sales pace it would take 5.9 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the most since August 2017 and up from 5.8 months in January. About two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built",

It came a day after Trump's announcement of tariffs on up to $60 billion on Chinese imports.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping \"had a list that was so ready of what they're blocking,\" Cramer said on \"Squawk on the Street\" Friday. \"They are so ready for what we do, it's embarrassing.\"\n\n\"Do you think that [China] has not figured this stuff out,\" asked Cramer. \"They've got a game plan.\"\n\nTrump said his tariffs on China, which primarily target certain products in the technology sector, would be \"the first of many\" trade actions. Beijing said it would take measures against the U.S. goods in two stages if it cannot reach an agreement with Washington.\n\nCramer said Trump will have to \"up his game,\" because China was more prepared than the U.S., calling it a \"beat down.\"\n\n\"You don't wing it with the Chinese. The Chinese are so ready for us,\" said Cramer, the host of CNBC's \"Mad Money.\" Trump \"better understand that these guys have been in a war against us for years.\"\n\n\"If you're going to be in a trade war with these guys, you have to be better than they are,\" he added.",

The three-year mapping effort showed plastic pollution in the world's oceans is \"increasing exponentially\" since measurements began in 1970.\n\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Julia Reisser, chief scientist of the study, said in a statement. \"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\"\n\nThe patch is not a solid mass of plastic. Nonetheless, it includes 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic and its weight is thought to be the equivalent of 500 jumbo jets.\n\nOf the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic, microplastics -- small plastic pieces less than 5 millimeters long -- accounted for about 8 percent of the total trash afloat an area of 1.6 million square kilometers.\n\nThe study's use of boats and aerial surveys could help to explain why the latest estimates are much higher than in the past. Nonetheless, rapidly increasing levels of plastic pollution in recent years is also likely to be a significant factor.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Foresight Future of the Sea Report forecast the amount of plastic in the world's oceans could be set to triple over the next decade unless litter is curbed.",

Accounts from 176 universities outside the U.S. were also targeted.\n\n\"The conspiracy successfully compromised at least approximately 7,998 accounts worldwide, of which at least approximately 3,768 belonged to professors at United States-based victim universities,\" the indictment said.\n\nThe data breach could cost universities billions of dollars, Rosenstein said.\n\nThe Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued sanctions against the Iranians on Friday.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was set to announce the indictments alongside multiple senior officials -- including David Bowdich, who succeeded Andrew McCabe as the FBI's acting deputy director following McCabe's firing last week.\n\n--CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

                "title": "Bill Gates and Richard Branson are betting lab-grown meat might be the food of the future",
                "body": "Vegetarians have long touted the ethical and environmental problems with meat production and consumption. Start-ups such as MosaMeat, JUST and Memphis Meats are tissue-engineering meat in a lab to allow people to enjoy being a carnivore without any of the environmental or ethical hang-ups.\n\nDubbed clean meat, the efforts are distinct from \"fake meat,\" like the soy protein \"chicken\" you can find in your grocery store today. Unlike Morningstar or Boca Burgers, clean meat really is meat; it just grows in a lab instead of being part of an animal. But lab-grown meat leads most skeptical diners to think of a big hurdle: taste.\n\n\"When they taste the product, they have to have the experience of meat, not the experience of a product that looks like meat and comes close to meat or has the distinct hints of something that looks like meat,\" said Peter Verstrate, the CEO of MosaMeat. \"It just has to be meat.\"\n\n\"The ultimate filter is, 'Does it taste exactly like the meat you're used to?'\" said Josh Tetrick, CEO of clean meat start-up JUST, who already tasted success with JUST Mayo.\n\nThere are two business-world barometers for clean-meat products that are make-or-break as well: price and scale.\n\nRight now clean meat is much more expensive to produce than traditional meat because of scaling and infrastructure. The land, feed, farmers, slaughterhouses and transportation are already in place to produce meat from dead animals. Growing clean meat may be more efficient and will require less total marginal costs in the end, but until the systems needed to grow clean meat on a large scale exist, it will be more expensive.\n\nInvestors aren't deterred by the challenges, with sustainability forecasts chief among their concerns and motivations. Scientists estimate the world population will reach 9.6 billion by the year 2050. This population will increasingly live in urban areas and have a rising middle class, both of which mean more meat consumption. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, world food production will need to increase 70 percent. Feeding that many people with traditional meat production will require double the amount of deforestation, which will increase greenhouse-gas emissions by 77 percent.\n\nBill Gates has invested in lab-grown meat companies, as has Richard Branson. \"Raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact,\" Gates wrote on his personal blog, Gatesnotes.com, a few years ago. \"Put simply, there's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people. Yet we can't ask everyone to become vegetarians. That's why we need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources.\"\n\nMeat production is wildly inefficient. It takes more than 38 pounds of feed to produce 1 pound of beef. That same pound of beef requires 1,799 gallons of water. We give 20 times the amount of grain needed to eliminate world hunger to farm animals instead. If the population grows according to forecasts and land disappears, the simple fact is we won't be able to keep producing meat. There won't be enough water to feed 2 billion more people eating meat. Lab-grown meat requires 100 times less land and 5.5 times less water than traditional meat.\n\nPaul Shapiro, author of Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World, says the first clean burger in 2013 cost about $300,000 dollars. Although the price is closing in on around $11 a burger, there is still a ways to go.\n\nThe price and scale issues have led clean-meat companies to aim in both directions, developing laboratory-grown replacements for cheaper grocery-store staples, like ground meat products -- burgers, chicken nuggets -- and also steak tips. Current versions already contain filler (some of which are unsettling), so clean-meat companies will have an easier time making them. But foie gras, the incredibly expensive and controversial dish made from fatty duck liver, is also a potential success story.\n\nJUST (formerly Hampton Creek) is experimenting with foie gras. Animal rights activists have fought foie gras production for years, because the luxury food requires producers to force-feed ducks with a pipe so they eat enough to enlarge the liver. (The duck livers must be 10 times larger than normal.)\n\nFoie gras costs an estimated $50 per pound. Because the meat is so expensive, it is a good industry for clean-meat companies to start disrupting. \"That is something we're looking at,\" Tetrick said.\n\nIt doesn't cost JUST any more to make gourmet foods than it does to make chicken nuggets. The company's high prices won't make as much of a difference if it's competing with a food that's already very expensive.\n\nBruce Friedrich, the CEO and co-founder of a think tank accelerator called The Good Food Institute, estimates clean-meat products will be available at a high price within two to three years, and he believes they will be cost-competitive within 10 years.\n\nFriedrich knows that until the infrastructure for clean meat is in place, companies will have to stay creative. \"The soft opening will absolutely be at high price points,\" he said. \"Certainly, foie gras is one way of going about that.\"\n\nThe problem, however, may be that the type of person willing to pay top dollar for such a controversial food is probably not likely to be interested in an environmentally and ethically friendly alternative. Verstrate understands the foie gras strategy but has different plans.\n\n\"Foie gras is a really emotional product for meat eaters,\" Verstrate said. \"I don't think you would stand much chance in France or Spain with foie gras from a lab.\"\n\nMosaMeat plans to start with burgers in high-end restaurants, where it can be price-competitive.\n\nBoth Tyson Foods and Cargill have invested in clean-meat company Memphis Meats, alongside billionaires Gates and Branson.\n\n\"It's a train that's leaving the station,\" Verstrate said of the need for the established meat giants to invest early. \"It's relatively cheap to buy a train ticket today.\"\n\nTom Hayes, the president and CEO of Tyson Foods, said in a statement earlier this year: \"A protein strategy inclusive of alternative forms is intuitive for Tyson Foods. It's another step toward giving today's consumers what they want and feeding tomorrow's consumers sustainably for years to come.\"\n\nWhen digital cameras became available, Canon invested heavily and Kodak did not. Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2011. \"Everybody wants to be Canon; nobody wants to be Kodak,\" Shapiro said.\n\nClean meat requires a biopsy from an animal. Scientists can then grow the muscle cells and develop them in a lab the same way the cells would grow on a living organism. To grow clean meat requires what companies call \"growth media,\" a mixture of sugars, amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Verstrate compares it to baby food. Clean meat will grow in factories that will resemble a sort of meat brewery. Clean meat will not require the land, water or crops of traditional meat production.\n\n\"This is not magic; this is what they're [the cells] made to do,\" Verstrate said.\n\nSurveys show about a third of the population across the United States and U.K. are willing to try clean meat, but that number could increase if it became more prevalent. Friedrich said the powerful antibiotics in live animals should turn people toward clean meat.\n\n\"People are eating meat now despite how it's produced; they're not eating meat because of how it's produced,\" he said. He believes that when the public can choose between two identical products and one is produced safely and humanely while the other is produced in a slaughterhouse, people will choose the former.\n\nClean-meat advocates and companies believe history is on their side, and it's just a matter of time until people come around. Ice used to come only in frozen blocks taken from lakes; now we produce ice in the comfort of our kitchen. \"We call it a freezer,\" Shapiro said. \"We don't think there's anything artificial about it at all.\"\n\nOthers, even among the lab start-ups, are more skeptical. Tetrick thinks meat is trickier than egg-free mayonnaise -- Hampton Creek's first product -- or dairy-free chocolate chips. It's tied to a societal image of toughness. \"Meat is too ensconced in our identity,\" he said. \"We're trying to decouple that.\"\n\nFor now, JUST's plan is to start small and win people over with a few products. Even if one of those first products, foie gras, is associated with luxury dining, Tetrick said that early success doesn't equal big success.\n\n\"If you make meat that only people who shop at Whole Foods can afford, you've done nothing,\" Tetrick said.\n\n-- By Rick Morgan, special to CNBC.com",

It's the latest push under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to undertake a sweeping overall of tobacco and nicotine regulation.\n\nThe FDA expanded the definition of tobacco products in 2016 and in doing so, brought premium cigars within its oversight. With this request, the FDA wants feedback on how to define premium cigars, how these products are used and any public health considerations.\n\nIt also wants to understand whether premium cigars pose different risks or are used in different patterns compared to other combustible tobacco products, Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\n\"As we continue to move forward with this multi-year roadmap aimed at significantly reducing tobacco-related disease and death, we're aware of the ongoing interest into how 'premium' cigars fit into our policy framework,\" he said.\n\nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids President Matthew Myers urged the FDA not to revise the rule that allowed the agency to regulate premium cigars and other tobacco products.\n\n\"There is no public health justification for exempting any tobacco product from FDA oversight,\" Myers said in a statement. \"Instead, the FDA should move forward with several critical actions to accelerate progress in reducing tobacco use.\"\n\nThe FDA announced its comprehensive plan last summer. The agency has adopted the idea that nicotine products live on a continuum of risk, with conventional cigarettes being the most harmful and alternatives like e-cigarettes possibly being less risky.\n\nLast week, the FDA took the first step in lowering the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. Earlier this week, the agency said it would examine the role flavors, including menthol, play in attracting young people to tobacco products and adult smokers in switching to products that are potentially less harmful than cigarettes.",

                "title": "How to surf the web anonymously and keep Chrome from tracking you",
                "body": "Also keep in mind that, while these will help you surf mostly anonymously, an already-compromised computer can still be tracked.\n\nWhen you surf the web using Chrome or any other browser, your computer saves some of the data on websites you're visiting as part of your browser history. Chrome doesn't need to collect that data, particularly if you want to surf the web more anonymously.\n\nHere's how to browse the web without being tracked.\n\nFirst, you'll want to use a VPN. We recently published a guide on how to install and use one. A VPN, or virtual private network, allows you to connect to the internet in a more secure manner and helps to prevent from others on the same network from seeing what you're doing.\n\nYou can think of it like surfing the web through a steel tube, where your data is much harder to see and collect. It's particularly important to use a VPN when you're surfing from a public Wi-Fi network, such as those in coffee shops or hotels.\n\nI recommend and pay for PIA, better known as \"Private Internet Access\" but there are plenty of options out there.\n\nChrome, and most other browsers, have a feature built-in called \"Incognito mode.\"\n\nThis prevents a browser from saving any data from the websites you visit, including cookies, history, or the data you might enter into a web form (such as a credit card number, your address, name, or anything else.) Incognito mode doesn't mean you can't be tracked by people who might be snooping on you. That's why you'll first want to start with step one, setting up a VPN. Also, keep in mind that if you're using a school or employer VPN, instead of your own, administrators can still see what you're doing.\n\nTo use Incognito mode, follow these steps:\n\nClick the three dots on the top-right of your browser. Choose \"New Incognito window.\" Begin browsing. To exit Incognito mode, close the open window.\n\nGuest Mode is the option you want to use if you're on someone else's computer and surfing the web, perhaps if you're using a spare computer at work or the library to print documents.\n\nIt allows you to visit websites without them storing cookies or browser history. You can think of this as browsing from a clean slate: you won't have access to any of your bookmarks or data that are saved to your Google account inside Chrome.\n\nTo activate Guest Mode:\n\nTap the small person icon at the very top-right of the screen, next to the minimize and close window buttons. Select \"Guest.\" Close this window when you're finished browsing.\n\nUsing the web in incognito mode and with a VPN doesn't protect you 100 percent. If you save things to your hard drive (images, videos, documents) that's all still technically available for people to see later.\n\nAlso, as Google notes, any bookmarks created in Incognito mode will still be available when you exit Incognito mode, which means you shouldn't save any sites that you don't want others to know you're visiting.\n\nYour location may still be visible to the websites you visit. A VPN can help you disguise this, since you can manually change the server that you're accessing and make it appear as though you're logging in from another place -- like a foreign country. If you don't use a VPN, Google Location Services inside the Chrome browser can get access to Wi-Fi routers nearby, the strength of your Wi-Fi connection, your device IP address (which can help identify you) and more.\n\nFinally, know that your data is never invulnerable. You can always better protect yourself from intrusion or tracking by following the rules above, but anyone who might have your password -- or someone who has already infiltrated your computer through other means -- could still potentially see what you're doing. This guide should help you feel better about keeping most eyes out, but it doesn't mean you should use it for illegal activities.",

His book \"The Accidental Billionaires\" was the basis of \"The Social Network\" blockbuster, which won Aaron Sorkin a best adapted screenplay Oscar.\n\n\"Our relationship with Facebook is kind of built on lies a little bit, because we believe that we own our data,\" Mezrich said in a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"But the reality now, we all know, is that our data is out there for other people.\"\n\nThe 2 billion-plus active users of Facebook every month need to realize their data and the company's ability to target custom ads are the reasons they get a \"free\" platform, he said.\n\n\"There's nothing free. If you thought Facebook was a free service, now you know that you get to use it but they get to use what you put up there,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not as nefarious as that sounds all the time,\" Mezrich argued. \"Every now and then you get an ad directed at you because they know what you like. That's not necessarily a bad thing.\"\n\n\"But they are also using that data in lots of different ways,\" he continued. \"We just saw one instance where someone was using it to target political stuff at us.

                "body": "Stocks sold off Thursday, pressured by worries of a potential trade war and a decline in tech shares.\n\nThe market's recent sharp losses are healthy, and stocks are still in a bull market, technical strategist Katie Stockton told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\"It's not often that you see the S&P 500 gap down in the way that it did,\" said Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies. \"To me, it's actually a positive.\"\n\nStocks sold off on Thursday, pressured by worries of a potential U.S.-China trade war and a decline in tech shares. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down more than 700 points after briefly dipping into correction territory. The S&P 500 closed below its 100-day moving average for the first time since early February.\n\nStockton, a former BTIG strategist,told CNBC that stocks needed \"a bit more of a shakeout ... to see the correction phase mature.\" Stocks had sold off in early February and eventually bottomed out on Feb. 8 on a closing basis, briefly plunging into 10 percent correction territory.\n\nThursday's market drop was \"the retest process,\" she told \"Squawk Box,\" adding that the S&P 500's 200-day moving average of 2585.49 is still intact. \"For the first time, we have an oversold condition this month and the last time we had that was at the February lows.\"\n\nJeremy Zirin, head of investment strategy at UBS Wealth Management Research, told CNBC that President Donald Trump's announcement Thursday on tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports didn't seem that bad.\n\n\"The economic impact of [the tariffs] is less than one-tenth of 1 percent,\" Zirin told \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"It's actually pretty bullish what we heard yesterday,\" he added. \"If you look at the steel and aluminum tariffs as a template, things got watered down and then scaled back. So, if you look at the whole economic backdrop, still a very good profit momentum.\"\n\nJason Trennert, chairman of Strategas Research Partners, told CNBC he was being cautious because of other factors happening in the market, including Facebook's recent data leak scandal.\n\nHowever, \"I'm not sure I would be running around with my hair on fire either,\" he said. \"These are things that are going to be a process.\"",

                "body": "After six years of evaluating thousands of start-ups, CNBC has seen how some CEOs have been able to break the rules, challenge established markets and create new ones. The most impressive start-up founders have defied the odds and scaled businesses with such momentum that they've forced the corporate establishment to make changes. Business owners and investors can learn a lot from these growth champions.\n\nAs CNBC's annual Disruptor 50 list enters its sixth year, we're taking the project on the road. CNBC is hosting a new event, bringing together Disruptor 50 founders past and present, along with leaders and investors in thriving start-up communities.\n\nThe roadshow's first stop is Los Angeles, with one of the country's most vibrant and diverse start-up scenes, at the intersection of technology, media and fashion. Home to CNBC Disruptor graduates Snap and Dollar Shave Club, more than $20 billion has flowed into the southern California start-ups since 2010, according to PitchBook. That makes it the fifth-largest venture capital ecosystem in the country, behind only San Francisco, San Jose, New York and Boston.\n\nLA's start-up community -- with access to the creativity of Hollywood's top talent -- has also drawn big investments from tech giants. Google continues to invest in its YouTube Space Los Angeles studio, Facebook recently expanded its own Los Angeles studio, and Netflix continues to take over more space in Hollywood as it doubles down on exclusive content.\n\nIn the Fall we'll take the Disruptor 50 Roadshow to Philadelphia. Philadelphia start-ups have attracted more than $3 billion in venture capital over the past four years, including a record $1 billion in deals in 2016, according to PitchBook. Despite a funding setback in 2017, in line with a national trend, in only a few years Philadelphia has become an attractive place for start-ups to take root, as its more than 100 degree-granting institutions churn out top talent. The city is a prime example of what legendary investor Steve Case calls the \"rise of the rest\" -- the explosion of innovation in cities around the country rather than just limited to the coasts, as the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs come down.\n\nThis is a unique moment for private companies. Last year global venture capital investing hit a decade high of $155 billion following a strong final quarter to the year. The global VC investment market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 27.5 percent between 2018 and 2022, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com.\n\nFive-time CNBC Disruptor Dropbox begins trading as a public company after its IPO on Friday.\n\nMany of the disruptive companies on the CNBC Disruptor 50 list are in the midst of crucial transformations. It's no longer enough to have a big idea to challenge the status quo -- a giant can often swoop in and shut newcomers down in a flash. Companies need to transition from breaking the rules to making, and abiding by, a new set of rules for the industry faster than ever. The companies on Disruptor 50 lists past and present have had a lot to learn, and now they have a lot to teach to the next generation of innovative start-ups.\n\nMore from CNBC Disruptor 50:\n\n23andMe is getting more specific with its DNA ancestry tests, adding 120 new regions\n\nPalantir CEO says investors will be 'positively surprised' at the company's margins\n\nA college-town hotel chain that is the anti-Airbnb",

I wouldn't want it done to me.\"\n\nMcDougal admitted that she knew Donald Trump was married during the alleged affair, saying she was reluctant to bring it up because \"she felt guilty.\"\n\nShe also said that Donald Trump offered to pay her after they had been intimate for the first time in 2006 and that it made her cry.\n\n\"After we had been intimate, he tried to pay me, and I actually didn't know how to take that,\" McDougal said. \"I've never been offered money like that. I looked at him and said, 'I'm not that type of girl.\"\n\n\"And he said, 'Oh,' and he said, 'You're really special,'\" McDougal said, adding: \"It hurt me that he saw me in that light.\"\n\nMore from USA Today:\n\nCryptic tweet from Stormy Daniels' lawyer hints at photos tied to alleged Trump affair\n\nAlleged $150K payoff to Trump accuser, ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal: Was it illegal?\n\nTrump is at center of lawsuits from former Playboy model, former 'Apprentice' contestant\n\nAccording to McDougal, the relationship lasted for about 10 months. She says she broke it off in April 2007 because she felt guilty. She recalled traveling to meet Trump at his properties in New York, New Jersey and California and said she had sex with him \"many dozens of times.\"\n\nMcDougal had feelings for Trump, but the affair was \"just tearing me apart,\" she said. \"There was a real relationship there. There were real feelings,\" she added. \"He would call me baby or he would call me beautiful Karen.\"\n\nTrump married his current wife, Melania Trump, in 2005, and their son, Barron, was born in 2006.\n\nMcDougal is just the latest to come forward about alleged affairs with Trump or unwanted sexual advances. At least 19 women have made accusations, including most recently with porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nDaniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, is in the middle of a lawsuit with Trump and his personal attorney Michael Cohen. She alleges she was paid $130,000 and signed a \"hush\" agreement to keep quiet about her 2006 affair with the President.\n\nMcDougal filed a suit Tuesday targeting American Media Inc., the company that owns the National Enquirer, which allegedly paid her $150,000 not to speak about her affair.\n\n\"AMI lied to me, made empty promises and repeatedly intimidated and manipulated me,\" McDougal said in a statement provided to USA TODAY. \"I just want the opportunity to set the record straight and move on with my life, free from this company, its executives and its lawyers.\"\n\nThe company, in a statement, said McDougal has been allowed to speak about her relationship with Trump since 2016 and their contract with her only gave the company discretion over whether they would publish the story.\n\nIt also allowed for her to write columns for the company and to appear on magazine covers.\n\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission have been asked by a watchdog group to investigate the alleged payment to McDougal.",

                "body": "A Sears customer shops near General Electric appliances in Schaumburg, Illinois, September 8, 2014.\n\nNew orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rebounded more than expected in February after two straight monthly declines and shipments surged, pointing to strong growth in business spending on equipment in the first quarter.\n\nThe Commerce Department said on Friday orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 1.8 percent last month. That was the biggest gain in five months and followed a downwardly revised 0.4 percent decrease in January.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast those orders rising only 0.8 percent last month after a previously reported 0.3 percent decline in January. Core capital goods orders increased 7.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.\n\nShipments of core capital goods increased 1.4 percent in February, the biggest advance since December 2016, after an upwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in January. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.\n\nThey were previously reported to have slipped 0.1 percent in January. Business spending on equipment powered ahead in 2017 as companies anticipated a hefty reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The Trump administration slashed that rate to 21 percent from 35 percent effective in January.\n\nThe surge in core capital goods orders in February suggests further gains. Investment in equipment is likely to be bolstered by robust business confidence, strengthening global economic growth and a weakening dollar, which is boosting demand for U.S. exports.\n\nThat is helping to support manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity.\n\nThe strength in core capital goods shipments could help offset the impact of soft consumer spending on first-quarter growth. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 1.8 percent annualized rate in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe government reported last month that the economy grew at a 2.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter.\n\nLast month, orders for machinery soared 1.6 percent. There were also hefty increases in orders of primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for computers and electronic products fell 0.2 percent.\n\nOverall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, vaulted 3.1 percent last month as demand for transportation equipment soared 7.1 percent. That followed a 3.5 percent tumble in January.\n\nBoeing reported on its website that it received 30 aircraft orders in February compared to 28 in January.\n\nOrders for motor vehicles and parts increased 1.6 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in January.",

                "title": "Stock market volatility could kill this risky Social Security strategy",
                "body": "A prolonged bull market has prompted some retirees to rely on one Social Security strategy: Claim benefits early and invest the money.\n\nBut use that strategy at your own risk.\n\nThough most prognosticators do not think recent volatility signals an end to the nine-year bull market, the wild swings are likely here to stay.\n\nAnd a full-on downturn is always a possibility.\n\n\"I don't know when or how large it will be, but there's always going to be a bear market and correction in the future,\" said Aaron E. Graham, a financial planner at Abacus Planning Group in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nWhile you can claim Social Security retirement benefits starting from age 62, your benefits will be larger if you wait.\n\nYou receive 100 percent of your retirement benefit if you claim at full retirement age -- 66 or 67 for most individuals, depending on when you were born.\n\nIf you claim earlier than your full retirement age, you will receive a reduced benefit.\n\nIf you wait past full retirement age, your benefit will grow by as much as 8 percent per year up to age 70.\n\nThat is one key reason financial advisors caution against taking Social Security early to invest in the market.\n\n\"The longer the time span is, the greater the chances you have to be wrong,\" Graham said.\n\nConsistently getting a return of 8 percent -- the top rate by which your benefits can potentially increase if you wait to claim -- will pose a challenge for any investor, said financial advisor Thomas H. Yorke, managing director at Oceanic Capital Management in Red Bank, New Jersey.\n\n\"If you think you can do better than that, I think you should be a hedge fund manager,\" Yorke said. \"Not only on a risk-adjusted basis you'll likely be way underperforming, but we're just humans and we're subject to all these biases.\"\n\nWhile you may be able to beat that 8 percent return a few years in a row, you could run into another year like 2008, Yorke said.\n\nAnd the closer that sharp downturn is to retirement, the harder it is to make up. If there's a 50 percent pullback in the market, for example, you may need a 100 percent return to get you back to where you need to be, Yorke said.\n\nTaking Social Security retirement benefits at 62 only makes sense in a limited number of circumstances, such as if you are single and terminally ill.\n\nBut if you are married and are not expecting to live a long time, taking benefits early could reduce the survivor benefits your spouse receives.\n\nA widow or widower is eligible to start receiving reduced benefits on your record as early as age 60 and full benefits at their full retirement age.\n\nIn addition, children under 18 or who are disabled may receive 75 percent of your benefit. A widower or widower who is caring for a child under 16 may also receive benefits.\n\nBy delaying your payments, you are also increasing the survivor benefits your family may receive. That is particularly relevant if your spouse earns less than you do, said Brett D. Horowitz, a wealth manager at Evensky & Katz/Foldes Financial in Coral Gables, Florida.\n\n\"Ultimately, they could be taking money out of everyone else's pockets if they collect early,\" Horowitz said.\n\nWhenever you receive Social Security, up to 85 percent of it could be subject to federal income tax depending on your modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI.\n\nRegardless of when you take your retirement benefits, you are subject to those tax thresholds.\n\nIf you do claim early, those extra years will also be subject to taxation, said Ronald L. Myers, managing member at Fortune 360 Group in Plantation, Florida.\n\nWhile you are eligible to receive 75 percent of your retirement benefits at age 62, that could be reduced to as little as 50 percent depending on your tax bracket, Myers said.\n\n\"When you're comparing it, you have to look at the net number,\" Myers said.\n\nIf you do claim Social Security benefits early, chances are you will take money from another source to make up for that lost income, Myers said.\n\nAnd if you live to 90 or 95, you could leave tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table, he said.\n\nFor those reasons, Myers said he always encourages clients to wait to claim their retirement benefits.\n\n\"That's a decision you can't unwind,\" Myers said. \"By the time people digest it, it's too late.\"\n\nWhen you do realize you have made a mistake, your career prospects could be significantly diminished, according to Yorke.\n\n\"If at 85 you don't have enough money coming in, you probably won't go out and get a job,\" Yorke said.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nStates are helping future retirees get more cash from Social Security\n\nRetire to these overseas locations to get the most from your Social Security check\n\nHere's when it makes sense to claim Social Security early",

The athletic apparel and footwear maker's revenue beat forecasts, as well. Nike's results were boosted by strong demand in international markets.\n\nMicron Technology - Micron came in 8 cents a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.82 per share. The chipmaker's revenue was above forecasts, as well, as both demand and pricing for memory chips jumped during the quarter. However, the company said nitrogen supply disruptions at one of its production facilities would have a two to three percent impact on production during the current quarter.\n\nCisco Systems - The networking equipment maker was added to the \"Conviction\" list at Goldman Sachs, which sees Cisco as a defensive play in a volatile market. Goldman calls Cisco's end markets \"healthy and improving.\"\n\nPfizer - Pfizer said it is continuing to evaluate options for its consumer health-care unit, but has not yet made a decision on a sale, spinoff, or other transaction. That statement comes after GlaxoSmithKline dropped out of the bidding, a day after British consumer products maker Reckitt Benckiser did the same. Analysts had been projecting that the unit could fetch as much as $20 billion.\n\nDropbox (DBX) - Dropbox priced its initial public offering at $21 per share, above the expected range of $18 to $20 per share. Earlier in the week, the expected range for the IPO had been $16 to $18 per share. At $21 per share, the data storage company would have a market valuation of about $9.2 billion. The stock will begin trading today on the Nasdaq.\n\nWynn Resorts - Former CEO Steve Wynn has sold his entire stake in the casino operator, completing that process with a sale Thursday after selling about a third of his stake on Wednesday.\n\nKB Home - KB Home reported adjusted quarterly profit of 40 cents per share, 12 cents a share above estimates. The home builder's revenue was below forecasts. The company said it sees demand remaining steady and inventory staying tight for the foreseeable future.\n\nCintas - Cintas beat estimates by 10 cents a share, reporting quarterly profit of $1.37 per share. Cintas, which makes uniforms and provides facility services, saw revenue beat estimates, as well.\n\nGeneral Mills - The food company was upgraded to \"positive\" from \"neutral\" at Susquehanna, which cited an attractive valuation. General Mills shares tumbled earlier this week to a multi-year low following its quarterly earnings reports, in which it beat estimates but lowered its full-year forecast in the face of rising input costs.\n\nOccidental Petroleum - The energy producer's stock was upgraded to \"buy\" from \"hold\" at Deutsche Bank, which points to both an improved outlook and current valuation.",

                "body": "Investors have renewed confidence in Nike after a blowout quarter. Even before the company reported earnings, the charts showed Nike as a buy, says one market technician.\n\n\"We like the chart, we like the longer-term setup from what we're seeing here,\" Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray, told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Thursday. \"You can see that there's this big base that's been forming over the last two years.\"\n\n\"You're seeing improving relative strength and from our perspective on the charts, a close above $68 is going to open up the possibilities of a whole 'nother leg higher from here,\" he added.\n\nNike shares are consolidating around the 50-day moving average, a level of resistance around $67 to $68 a share, says Johnson. As of Thursday's close, Nike was trading slightly below its 50-day moving average, though it has held above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages this year.\n\nThe sporting brand's relative strength index is also headed lower, moving closer to oversold conditions after a sell-off this week. Its RSI, a measure of overbought and oversold conditions, ended Thursday at 41.43. A level below 30 indicates a stock is oversold.\n\n\"We like what we're seeing, we like the relative strength, we think it's a buy,\" said Johnson.\n\nNike earned an adjusted 68 cents a share over its third quarter, far higher than an anticipated estimate of 53 cents. Revenue surged more than 6 percent to $8.99 billion, led by international growth. Sales came in higher than consensus.\n\nA broader market sell-off dragged Nike shares lower this week. Its stock was down nearly 3 percent in the week as of Thursday's close, putting it on track for its worst weekly loss in more than a month. However, the stock was up nearly 5 percent in Friday's premarket. For the full year as of Thursday's close, shares have added 3 percent, making it just one of eight Dow stocks positive in 2018.\n\nThere's value elsewhere in the retail space, notably among home improvement chains, adds Larry McDonald, founder of the Bear Traps Report. McDonald predicts a big windfall for retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's, housed in the XHB Homebuilders ETF, if Congress finalizes financial reforms in the next few weeks.\n\n\"Legislation in Washington on community banks is extremely beneficial to the XHB,\" said McDonald. \"Those homebuilders have exposure to the consumer, and this legislation is really going to free up a tremendous amount of lending to smaller banks.\"\n\nMcDonald expects easing of Dodd-Frank regulations implemented after the 2008 financial crisis to lead to a pickup in activity at smaller and regional banks. Increased lending might then incentivize homebuilding and homebuying, trickling down to the home-improvement space.\n\nAs of Thursday's closing, the XHB ETF had fallen 8 percent this year, while Lowe's and Home Depot had dropped more than 7 percent.",

                "title": "China's tariffs won't hurt US tech giants because Beijing has blocked so many anyway",
                "body": "Any tariff aimed at these firms is therefore unlikely to have a big financial impact, analysts say.\n\nChina's retaliatory import tariffs against the U.S. are unlikely to hit technology giants, including Alphabet and Facebook, because such services have already been blocked by Beijing.\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports. China then hit back with tariffs of its own on 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion.\n\nChina's government hasn't specifically named the technology sector as one of its targets, but could potentially do so if the trade war was to escalate. Even if it did, analysts have said that the big technology giants in the U.S. would be insulated.\n\nFacebook and Google, for example, are blocked in China by the government's internet censorship system, known as the Great Firewall.\n\nIn 2016, Netflix launched its biggest international push, but stayed out of China. The streaming service currently serves a small portion of its original content in China via Baidu's iQiyi video platform.\n\nChinese internet giant Baidu, which is often dubbed the \"Google of China,\" is the dominant search player in China. Netflix, meanwhile, faces competition not only from Baidu, but also from Tencent and Alibaba, which have their own video content products.\n\nAmazon has a small presence in China with its retail business and, in 2016, launched its Prime subscription service in the world's second-largest economy. Amazon is estimated to have a negligible share of the online shopping market in China, which is dominated by domestic players Alibaba and JD.com. Even the e-commerce giant's cloud business in China is small in comparison to local players.\n\nThe story is similar for all the technology companies. Government censorship and rules have hampered the tech sector's ability to grow in China. And that means they have small businesses in the country, and would mean any tariffs imposed on them by Beijing would have a small effect.\n\n\"We continue to strongly believe that given the primarily services nature of traditional FANG names, and very internationally distributed from a revenue perspective, that Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google/Alphabet are 'primarily insulated' from tariff worries and a potential retaliatory trade war with China. Ultimately, the bark is much worse than the bite,\" Daniel Ives, head of technology at GBH Insights, told CNBC by email Friday.\n\nApple, perhaps, looks the most vulnerable. The company is arguably one of the only big U.S. tech firms to have a decently-sized business in China and is the fifth-largest smartphone vendor in the country. In the three months to the end of December, its Greater China revenues totaled $17.9 billion, up 11 percent year-on-year.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based firm has been investing heavily in China and has made concessions to the government. In February, it made a move to host Chinese users' iCloud accounts in a new data center based in China, to comply with new laws.\n\nApple also has a manufacturing partnership with Taiwanese firm Foxconn in China. Given the strong investment and this partnership, Ives said Apple is unlikely to feel the effect of tariffs.\n\n\"For (Tim) Cook and co, given the tightly-woven integration between Apple and Foxconn in China, we believe there is minimal risk to this relationship in our opinion and the last thing China is going to do is tinker with the Apple machine and impact its significant billions of investments in the country and major consumer sales within China, despite fears,\" Ives said.",

                "body": "It was not immediately clear whether there were other offers for the business, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline has withdrawn from the race to buy Pfizer's consumer health-care business, the British company said on Friday, endangering an auction the U.S. drugmaker hoped would bring in as much as $20 billion.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether there were other offers for the business, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins, following this week's deadline for binding bids.\n\nGSK was seen as the frontrunner to buy the assets, after Reckitt Benckiser quit the race late on Wednesday.\n\n\"While we will continue to review opportunities that may accelerate our strategy, they must meet our criteria for returns and not compromise our priorities for capital allocation,\" GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said in a statement.\n\nGSK shares rose 3 percent, as investors' concerns about a potential dividend cut eased.\n\nSources familiar with the matter said on Thursday there might still be interest in the Pfizer business, or the U.S. firm could decide against a sale.\n\nPfizer said on Friday it continued to evaluate potential alternatives for the business, which include a spin-off, sale or other transaction, as well as retaining it.\n\n\"We have not yet made a decision, but continue to expect to make one in 2018,\" a spokesman said.\n\nPfizer is the world's fifth-largest player in consumer health with 2.5 percent of a market bolstered by aging populations and growing interest in health and wellness.\n\nThe business, which also includes Chapstick lip balm and Caltrate supplements, came to market at a bad time for both GSK and Reckitt.\n\nPfizer's hope of proceeds of around $20 billion, or about 20 times the unit's core earnings according to Bernstein analysts, contrasted with both companies' need for financial discipline.\n\nBuying the Pfizer business would have been the boldest move to date for Walmsley, who took over at GSK last April. But the wisdom of a deal split opinion among investors, with some worried about the risk to the company's dividend.\n\nAcquiring additional consumer health assets at a reasonable price could have been a fairly safe way to boost earnings, since scale is key in over-the-counter remedies, but it could have distracted from fixing GSK's core pharma division.\n\nThat is a particular headache for Walmsley - a consumer products veteran who worked for 17 years at L'Oreal -- since she has her work cut out to persuade the market she is the right person to lead Britain's top pharmaceuticals company.\n\nLast month, in a bid to reassure investors, she spelled out more clearly than before that her first priority was improving performance in prescription drugs, followed by dividend payments and only after that acquisitions.\n\nThe overhaul of the drugs business, which has produced fewer blockbuster medicines than rivals in recent years, is underway in both the commercial and research fields.\n\nGSK runs its consumer health-care business via a joint venture with Novartis, which complicates any acquisitions. Novartis has the right to sell down its 36.5 percent stake, valued at around $10 billion, from this month, although it has previously indicated it is in no rush to do so.",

Here are his reasons why.\n\n* On the S&P 500, 2,700 is the key \"resistance\" level to watch, while 2,650 is the key \"support\" level to watch.\n\n* The 2,700 mark is just points above the S&P 500's 100-day moving average. The S&P broke below 2,650 heading into the market close, trading as low as 2,641.73. It was even lower in Friday's premarket.\n\n* This break suggest we could see a retest of the S&P's 200-day moving average, at 2,584, in the coming weeks.\n\n* Examining a chart of the Dow, the blue chips have failed to trade above its 50-day moving average in over 1½ weeks; if the index closes below its lows touched on March 2, at 24,217, then the next stop is its 200-day moving average, just below 23,500.

                "title": "Why entrepreneur Tony Fernandes chose the airline sector  --  when he already had a top job in the music industry",
                "body": "If you look at entrepreneur Tony Fernandes' career history, you'll find impressive a job history from the likes of Virgin Communications, Warner Music and a U.K. soccer club.\n\nWhat Fernandes is probably best known for however, is heading up AirAsia, a low-cost Malaysian airline.\n\nBut how did he make the jump into the airline space? CNBC sat down with the entrepreneur in a \"Life Hacks Live\" episode, to find out more.\n\n\"I was in the music business, I kind of got tired of people telling me what to do from somewhere in New York, and I was against the merger of AOL and Time Warner. So I just quit,\" Fernandes told CNBC, adding that he didn't want to take someone's salary and be a hypocrite, while he complained about it.\n\nAround the turn of the millennium, Fernandes was sitting in a London bar, when he saw entrepreneur Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who is famous for creating easyJet, a low-cost airline which now flies more than 75 million passengers annually, across 31 countries.\n\n\"I thought 'What a great idea'. I've always loved planes. I've always wanted to own an airline -- it's one of those things you say right, but you don't actually believe you're going to do it. And I thought 'Wow, is this the calling?'\" the group CEO of AirAsia said.\n\n\"So I went up to Luton airport (in the U.K.) and I saw people flying from Barcelona for £8, £6 -- and I thought 'I'm going to do this.'\"\n\n\"(At the time) I thought, I'm 36. I didn't want to sit there at 55 and say 'I wish I did that'. You can't press a rewind button,\" he said.\n\nFernandes does admit however that there is a \"very fine line between brilliance and stupidity,\" so if he did end up failing, he would have to admit that it was a stupid decision. After successfully turning around the struggling low-cost airline back in the early 2000s, however, Fernandes accepts that he's \"done alright.\"\n\nToday, AirAsia is a thriving low-cost carrier, however the company itself dates back to the 1990s. Established in 1993, AirAsia went onto be picked up by Fernandes and other partners in 2001, when the airline was heavily in debt. Less than two years later however, AirAsia had turned itself around, having repaid its debt -- even with the challenging travel environment it was in at the time.\n\nNow the company has more than 200 aircrafts in service, but according to the CEO, he wouldn't have believed it was going to get this popular.\n\n\"I always believed there was a model for ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and I always believed we could be big. I was looking at 60 to 70 aircraft. If you told me I was going to have 230 aircraft, I wouldn't have believed it,\" he said.\n\nIn this year alone, the company is expecting to carry 89 million people, which is about three times the population of Malaysia. \"When I started in my first year, we carried 200,000 people,\" the CEO says in comparison, adding that with \"all the obstacles put in front of us, it is a fairy tale,\" to see how far the company has come.\n\nLife Hacks Live is a series produced by CNBC International for Facebook, where tomorrow's leaders get to ask some of the world's biggest influencers for advice.

The fourth case concerns who has a right to collect payday loans offered from tribal land.\n\nCordray was ready to sue Kansas-based National Credit Adjusters (NCA), which primarily collects debt for online lenders operating on tribal land.\n\nSuch lenders charge triple-digit interest rates prohibited in many states. The companies have argued such loans are permitted when they are originated on tribal land.\n\nThe CFPB under Cordray concluded that NCA had no right to collect on such online loans, no matter where they were made.\n\nMulvaney has dropped the matter and the case is \"dead,\" Sarah Auchterlonie, a lawyer for NCA, told Reuters this week. She noted the agency appeared to be backing off issues involving tribal sovereignty.\n\n\"(Cordray) had a theory that was really out there and I think everything related to it is being pulled back,\" Auchterlonie said.\n\nConsumers have complained that NCA threatened to have them jailed and sue family members, CFPB's public database shows.\n\nA CFPB investigation found NCA wrongly collected roughly $50 million, of which the agency's lawyers wanted to return about $45 million, sources said.\n\nPayday lending often involves low-income borrowers taking out short-term cash loans at high rates. The industry collects about $9 billion in fees annually, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nSupporters say the industry fills a need for customers lacking access to other banking products.\n\nMulvaney has said that, in general, the CFPB will go after egregious cases of consumer abuses.\n\n\"Good cases are being brought. The bad cases are not,\" he told an event in Washington this month.\n\nSome former CFPB lawyers said they worry the agency's mission is being eroded.\n\n\"The CFPB is supposed to create a level playing field for consumers,\" said Joanna Pearl, former enforcement attorney. \"I'm not sure Mulvaney sees it like that.\"\n\nMulvaney is reviewing three cases against lenders based in southern states where high-interest loans are permitted. He must eventually decide whether to sue the companies, settle with a fine or scrap the cases.\n\nLawyers working for Cordray had concluded that Security Finance, Cash Express, and Triton Management Group violated customer rights when attempting to collect, among other lapses.\n\nSpokespeople for the companies declined to comment. A spokesman for the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment. None of the sources wished to be identified because they are not authorized to speak about the cases.\n\nSecurity Finance offers loans at rates that often climb into triple-digits. Debt collectors working for Security Finance harassed borrowers at home and work, violating federal laws, and the company had faulty recordkeeping that could hurt borrowers' credit scores, the CFPB concluded.\n\nCustomers complained Cash Express used high-pressure collection tactics, the CFPB database shows. Cordray was prepared to sue the company on those grounds, sources said.\n\nCash Express also misled customers by telling them they might repair their credit with a payday loan, even though the lender does not report to credit bureaus, the CFPB concluded.\n\nThe CFPB faulted Triton Management Group for aggressive collection in 2016 and the company changed some practices, the sources said. The CFPB still was ready to seek more than a million dollars in fines and restitution.",

                "body": "China urged the United States on Friday to \"pull back from the brink\" as President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods moved the world's two largest economies closer to a trade war.\n\nThe escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington sent shivers through financial markets as investors foresaw dire consequences for the global economy if trade barriers start going up.\n\nTrump is planning to impose the tariffs over what his administration says is a misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property. A probe was launched last year under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act.\n\n\"China doesn't hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one,\" the Chinese commerce ministry responded in a statement.\n\n\"China hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.\"\n\nIn a presidential memorandum signed by Trump on Thursday, there will be a 30-day consultation period that only starts once a list of Chinese goods is published.\n\nThat effectively creates room for potential talks to address Trump's allegations on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.\n\nThough the White House has said the planned tariffs were a response to China's \"economic aggression,\" Trump said he views China as \"a friend,\" and both sides are in the midst of negotiations. A Chinese commerce ministry official said both sides were in touch, and communication channels were smooth.\n\nMeantime, China showed readiness to retaliate by declaring plans to levy additional duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports including fresh fruit, wine, and nuts in response to imports tariffs Trump announced earlier this month on steel and aluminum, which were due to go into effect on Friday.\n\nThe inevitable fall in demand from a full-blown trade war would spell trouble for all the economies supplying the United States and China.\n\nFeeling the chill, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 2.45 percent, tracking a large overnight fall in Wall Street shares, Shanghai shares shed 3.8 percent and Japan's Nikkei lost 4.5 percent, while perceived safe havens such as government bonds gained.\n\n\"The upshot is that today's (U.S.) tariffs amount to no more than a slap on the wrist for China,\" Mark Williams, Chief Asia Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. \"China won't change its ways. Worries about escalation therefore won't go away.\"\n\nWilliams estimated that the $506 billion that China exported to the United States drove around 2.5 percent of its total gross domestic product, and the $50 billion to 60 billion targeted by the U.S. tariffs contributed just around 0.25 percent.\n\nTrump, however, appears intent on fulfilling election campaign promises to reduce the record U.S. trade deficit with China. A commentary published by the official Xinhua news agency said the United States had adopted a \"Cold War mentality\", and \"panic\" over China's economic rise was driving Washington's confrontational approach.\n\nU.S. multinationals at a business gathering in Shanghai were warned by Stephen Roach, a Yale University economist, \"to prepare for the worst\" and make contingencies until calmer heads prevail.\n\nRoach said he could foresee \"the Chinese government moving to restrict, in some form or another, the financial as well as the supply chain activities of American companies operating in this country.\"\n\nAlarm over Trump's protectionist leanings mounted earlier this month after he imposed hefty import tariffs on steel and aluminum under Section 232 of the 1962 U.S. Trade Expansion Act, which allows safeguards based on \"national security.\"\n\nOn Friday, Trump gave Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea and the European Union temporary exemptions. China was not exempted even though it was a far smaller supplier than Canada or South Korea.\n\nAlso omitted from the exemption list was U.S. ally Japan, though a government spokesman said Tokyo would press to be included. And Finance Minister Taro Aso expressed empathy with Washington regarding the importance of protecting intellectual property.\n\nChina's retaliation against the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum appeared restrained.\n\nTargeting $3 billion of U.S. imports, China has drawn a list of 128 U.S. products that could be hit with tariffs if the two countries are unable to reach an agreement on trade issues, the ministry said.\n\nThe commerce ministry said China was considering implementing measures in two stages: first the 15 percent tariff on 120 products including steel pipes, dried fruit and wine worth $977 million, and later, the higher 25 percent tariff on $1.99 billion of pork and recycled aluminum.\n\nU.S. wine exports to China last year were $79 million, according to data from the U.S. Wine Institute, which represents Californian winemakers.\n\nThe fruit growers of California, Florida, Michigan, and Washington all stood to lose as China's list also included close to 80 fruit and nut products. U.S. exports of fruits, frozen juices, and nuts to China amounted to $669 million last year, and it was the top supplier of apples, cherries, walnuts ,and almonds.\n\n\"With the restrained response, China hopes Trump can realize his errors and mend his ways,\" said Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think tank.\n\n\"If we really want to counter, the strongest response would be to target soybean and automobiles,\" said Xu. \"China is 'drawing its bow but not firing. We still have some cards to play.\"",

Canada, China and Japan were downgraded from \"improving\" to \"stable\" by CFOs.\n\nStill, the United States was rated as \"improving\" for the seventh straight quarter, while the Euro zone was seen as \"improving\" for the fourth straight quarter.

More than half of major companies taking part in a CNBC quarterly survey say they need to take up the gun-control challenge.\n\nHalf of North America-based members of the CNBC Global CFO Council agree that companies like theirs have a responsibility, where possible, to take action to mitigate gun violence, according to the CNBC Global CFO Council survey. And more than half (54.5 percent) said companies are taking action now because the government won't.\n\nThe CNBC Global CFO Council represents some of the largest public and private companies in the world, collectively managing more than $4 trillion in market capitalization across a wide variety of sectors.\n\nCompanies, including Hertz, Delta Airlines and MetLife, ended relationships with the National Rifle Association last month after facing pressure on social media. Dick's Sporting Goods made headlines when it announced it was ending sales of all assault-style rifles in its stores.\n\nOn Thursday, Citigroup became the first major Wall Street bank to implement a gun-control policy since the Parkland shooting, saying it will not do business or offer banking services such as credit cards and capital raises to companies that sell guns to customers less than 21 years of age, or to those who do not pass a background check. Citigroup's policy also bars businesses that sell bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. Major asset managers, such as BlackRock, the world's largest investment company and a major holder of gun stocks, have said they are engaging gun companies in a dialogue.\n\nThree of the 22 CFOs responding to the CNBC survey said their companies have addressed the issue by ending relationships with gun makers and/or the NRA in the aftermath of the February 14 shooting. Another five say their companies took some kind of action following previous mass shootings that remains in effect today. Two CFOs said their companies took some kind of other action in the wake of the latest school shooting.\n\nStill, a significant portion of CFOs say their companies should stay out of the debate. Near-32 percent said their companies have made the decision to take no action in the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, while 27.3 percent said they don't know what action their companies have taken.\n\nMore than a third (36.4 percent) say companies should strive to remain neutral on hot-button political issues, and 31.8 percent expressed no opinion about whether companies have a responsibility to take action.\n\nCitigroup CEO Michael Corbat told The New York Times on Thursday that he was \"an avid outdoorsman and responsible gun owner,\" and he knew that \"some will find our policy too strict, while others will find it too lenient.\" A second Citigroup official told the Times that the policies are \"not centered on an ideological mission to rid the world of firearms.\"\n\nCitigroup is not a member of the CNBC Global CFO Council.\n\nComplete survey results below:\n\n(Note: Thirty-eight of the 105 current members of the CNBC Global CFO Council responded to this quarter's survey, including 22 North America-based members who were asked questions about the companies' positions on gun violence and gun rights.

But the wisdom of a deal split opinion among investors, with some worried about the risk to the company's dividend.\n\nAcquiring additional consumer health assets at a reasonable price could have been a fairly safe way to boost earnings, since scale is key in over-the-counter remedies, but it could have distracted from fixing GSK's core pharma division.\n\nThat is a particular headache for Walmsley - a consumer products veteran who worked for 17 years at L'Oreal - since she has her work cut out to persuade the market she is the right person to lead Britain's top pharmaceuticals company.\n\nLast month, in a bid to reassure investors, she spelt out more clearly than before that her first priority was improving performance in prescription drugs, followed by dividend payments and only after that acquisitions.\n\nThe overhaul of the drugs business, which has produced fewer blockbuster medicines than rivals in recent years, is underway in both the commercial and research fields.\n\nGSK runs its consumer healthcare business via a joint venture with Novartis, which complicates any acquisitions. Novartis has the right to sell down its 36.5 percent stake, valued at around $10 billion, from this month, although it has previously indicated it is in no rush to do so.",

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures also indicated a negative open for their respective markets.\n\nU.S. stock index futures pointed to a sharply lower open on Friday morning, after China responded with retaliatory measures to President Donald Trump's intensifying war on Beijing's trade practices.\n\nTrump pressed ahead with long-promised anti-China charges on Thursday. The U.S. president signed an executive memorandum that will impose tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nIn response, China's commerce ministry proposed a list of 128 U.S. products as potential retaliation targets, according to a statement on its website posted Friday morning. Beijing's ministry said it will take measures against the 128 U.S. goods in two stages if it cannot reach an agreement with Washington, adding that it could also take legal action under World Trade Organization rules.\n\nAsia stock markets took a dive on the news, with European equities then tracking overnight losses.

                "title": "Face recognition, palm-scanning and the energy efficient future of public transport",
                "body": "As all Londoners know, using public transport in the city can be a frantic and fraught experience at the best of times. For many, the morning and evening rush hours are characterized by cramped carriages, traffic jams and doing their best to avoid eye contact with fellow commuters.\n\nBut authorities are looking to find ways to make transport in the city both cutting edge and greener. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan wants the city's public transport fleet to generate zero exhaust emissions, for example. The mayor's Transport Strategy, published earlier this month, said that current analysis showed that a \"fully zero-emission fleet\" could be in place by 2037.\n\nOne area that has already undergone a radical transformation is the way Londoners pay to travel on buses and on the city's underground and over-ground rail network. Buses no longer take cash payments and passengers use their cellphones, contactless debit or credit cards and the now ubiquitous Oyster travel card for their journeys.\n\nThe business behind the Oyster cards and contactless payment systems used in London is called Cubic Transportation Systems. Its President, Matt Cole, told CNBC's \"Sustainable Energy\" that its payments systems helped to increase the efficiency of transit agencies' operations. If public transport networks become efficient and faster then people may be more likely to ditch their cars and use trains and buses instead, or so the theory goes.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is another tool that can be used to potentially good effect. \"Artificial intelligence gives us an opportunity to help educate people on the most efficient way to make a journey,\" Dave Roat, Cubic Transportation Systems' strategy manager, said. \"And if you make a journey in the most efficient way, using the scarce resources of an urban population, we should be making that journey using less energy and be more efficient.\"\n\nIn the future, camera technology could become an integral part of a new system. \"Rather than using your Oyster card or your equivalent in whatever city you live in, you could potentially use your face as your token to travel,\" Roat said. He added that camera technology could potentially be deployed in stations to facilitate the use of biometrics on public transport.\n\nAnother area being looked at is palm vein-scanning, a technology that Roat said reads the pattern of blood flow through a person's palms. He added that a palm vein-reading was unique to individuals.\n\n\"The reason that we are... interested in palm vein-scanning as opposed to potentially, say, fingerprints is you don't have to touch anything,\" Roat said. \"You're not going to go to a gate and try to get the gate to read your thumb, because that sensor gets dirty. And it's really hard to keep it clean and clean enough to accurately read your thumbprint.\"\n\nMatt Cole, Cubic Transportation Systems' president, said that the real goal was to develop a completely frictionless experience where the commuter would walk through a railway station or board a bus without having to make any physical gesture in order to pay for the journey.\n\nBluetooth and biometric ticketing were two technologies being looked at, he added, although we remain \"a long way away\" from seeing such a system due to both technology and policy issues.",

On a pre-tax basis, it was the bank's first year in the black since Thiam launched the turnaround plan in 2015.",

                "body": "In the heart of Osaka, there's a plot of land that could help make Japan's second-largest metropolitan area one of the biggest hubs for entrepreneurship in the region.\n\nA former rail depot, the \"Umekita Phase 2\" development now under construction next to Osaka Station is set to host pharmaceutical and biotech firms when it opens around 2024. It will complete a project that began with a row of multipurpose towers, called Grand Front, that's already home to a handful of start-up incubators and business accelerators.\n\n\"We want to take advantage of this superb geographical location at the center of Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe to create an environment bringing together technology from enterprises and universities to unleash new innovation,\" said Eiji Doi of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\nLong associated with older industries, Osaka has struggled to get out of the shadow of Tokyo as a start-up hub, but it has upped its game in recent years with new start-up investment funds, downtown university campuses, incubators and pitch events.\n\nLast month, Grand Front was the venue for Hack Osaka, a one-day event designed to encourage open innovation while helping start-ups from Japan and beyond. Among award winners at the event were Dot, a South Korean maker of braille watches, and Nature, a Japanese developer of connected household appliance controllers that work with Google and Amazon smart speakers. A hardware event called the Monozukuri Hardware Cup picked a quirky winner: Hachi Tama, a Japanese start-up that claims to have developed the world's first toilet for cats that is based on the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n\"There have been many legendary hardware entrepreneurs from Osaka,\" says Osaka-born Akinori Takahagi, CEO of Moff, a Japanese developer of sensor bands for entertainment and physiotherapy. \"Especially for IoT start-ups, Osaka is a good place to be because everybody respects IoT and hardware.\"\n\nMasaaki Yoshikawa, director general of Osaka Innovation Hub, which hosts Hack Osaka, estimated there are about 1,000 early-stage seed start-ups in the local area. He pointed to success stories such as Cookbiz, a company founded in 2007 that developed a job-search platform aimed at alleviating high turnover and labor shortages in the food industry.\n\nIn November last year, Cookbiz claimed some 3.4 million users, logged revenue of about 2 billion yen (around $19.4 million), up 67.7 percent from a year earlier, and began trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers, an index for emerging stocks.\n\nThe Kansai region surrounding Osaka has a population of about 21.6 million people and a gross regional product of some $823 billion. Allen Miner, CEO of local start-up fundraiser SunBridge Global Ventures, says a highly educated labor pool makes it attractive for fledgling businesses. Other entrepreneurs value the local business culture for its down-to-earth acumen and frankness.\n\n\"One of the advantages for us for starting up in Osaka is getting quicker product and customer development,\" says Philip Nguyen, co-founder of Gochiso, an Osaka start-up developing a platform that rewards users for restaurant reservations and lets them donate to charities.\n\n\"Osaka people are generally very open-minded and opinionated, which is great for getting quick and straightforward feedback,\" adds Nguyen. \"They really think about value for the money, especially in the food industry, so if you can make a product work here compared to Tokyo, it'll more likely work in the rest of Japan.\"",

                "body": "Back in 2008, Japan set an ambitious goal for its tourism industry: 20 million visitors by the year 2020.\n\nIt hit it five years early.\n\nJapan is experiencing a historic tourism boom, in the wake of that drive to draw 20 million leisure visitors, timed to coincide with the planned Olympics in Tokyo. Last year, Japan welcomed 28.7 million tourists -- up from 10.4 million in 2013.\n\nThe surge has been helped by several factors, including a relatively weak yen -- down about 10 percent against the dollar over the last five years -- and relaxed visa requirements, particularly for the all-important Chinese market.\n\nThe growth rate -- about 20 percent in 2017 versus 2016 -- is one of the highest in the world and expected to continue, said André Andonian, managing partner for Japan at consultancy firm McKinsey.\n\n\"The Olympics will be the booster to sustain growth,\" he told CNBC, listing other major events leading up to the games, such as World Cup Rugby in 2020 and the G20 meeting in 2019.\n\nAndonian noted that tourist expenditures have risen in the United Kingdom since the 2012 London games -- and that bodes well for Tokyo.\n\nIn January of this year, the number of visitors to Japan rose 9 percent versus the same period a year ago.\n\nThe newest government target is to attract 40 million tourists by 2020, as it embarks on a drive to draw more tourists from non-Asian countries. In 2017, over two-thirds of international visitors were from South Korea and Greater China.\n\nBig industries are benefiting from Japan's tourism boom.\n\nMore tourists -- including mainland Chinese tourists who have a penchant for retail therapy -- are helping to support merchants in an aging Japan.\n\nTourist spending hit a record 4.42 trillion yen ($41.7 billion) in 2017 -- in tandem with the surge in visitor numbers -- a jump of 17.8 percent from a year ago, official data show.\n\nThe boost to retail has sent shares of related stocks higher, with cosmetics maker Shiseido and discount retailer Don Quijote Holdings posting gains.\n\nShiseido's shares surged over 100 percent in the last year, Don Quijote's shares rose 60 percent in the same period. In the same period, the Nikkei 225 rose about 10 percent.\n\nBoth of those merchants' shares were fueled by tourist spending. Shiseido is planning a new factory in the country -- its first new domestic plant in four decades -- to cater to the demand for \"Made in Japan\" products.\n\nAlthough Japan is known for a relatively expensive retail scene, customers get \"price and quality, as well as specific offerings,\" said Ed Rogers, CEO of Rogers Investment Advisors.\n\nThere are simply not enough rooms in Japan, with hotels in the so-called Golden Route of Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto experiencing high occupancy around 80 percent, said McKinsey's Andonian.\n\nThe tight supply prompted the Japanese government to step up activity in the arena, financing the development of hotels in large cities by private companies. A private consortium also set up a new fund to invest in aging, traditional accommodation.\n\nMeanwhile, developers have stepped up construction, with names like Hyatt, Marriott, Nomura Real Estate Development and Mitsui Fodosan building new accommodation to house holiday revelers.\n\nLike its predecessors, the Tokyo Games will require billions in infrastructure investment -- a controversial issue that requires political support for the use of public funds.\n\nThe budget for the Olympics stands at 1.35 trillion yen ($12.7 billion) as of December 2017 -- double the 730 billion yen ($6.9 billion) projected in 2013 when the city won the games.\n\nTokyo will be upgrading existing sites and building new sites for the games that can be used after the event to help control costs, said Masa Takaya, spokesman for the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nStill, infrastructure companies involved in the investment, such Mitsubishi Estate, Mitsui Fudosan will benefit from the work. Both companies are part of a consortium that won a bid for the athletes' village.",

This is slightly below the mid-point of its initial target range of between 30 to 36 euros a share, according to a company statement released late Thursday.\n\nDeutsche Bank will sell 22.5 percent of the company, which has assets worth more than 700 billion euros under management. The IPO is expected to generate proceeds of about 1.4 billion euros for the bank.\n\nIn making its stock market debut on Friday, DWS is then reportedly expected to boast a market capitalization of around 6.5 billion euros. Deutsche Bank is thought to be holding onto approximately 80 percent of its asset management division, with Japan's Nippon Life poised to acquire 5 percent of the stake and France's Tikehau Capital set to purchase almost 4 percent of the company.\n\nDeutsche Bank is in the midst of an ongoing restructuring program and the listing of DWS marks a key milestone for CEO John Cryan. However, a string of bad news has seen the embattled lender's share price fall nearly 25 percent since last January.\n\nThe IPO of DWS marks one of Germany's biggest listings in recent years and follows hot on the heels of Siemens Healthineers' stock market debut last week.\n\nMeanwhile, several large German IPOs are pending, with SpringerNature, HSE24 and Godewind all scheduled to list over the coming weeks.",

Just this week, Alibaba announced an additional $2 billion investment in Southeast Asian online retailer Lazada.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong, he said that the e-commerce market in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is set to take off.\n\n\"Now it will be interesting because the change is coming, the wave of investments at Alibaba, Tencent, is coming in a big way, could be the tech dragons waking up the hidden tigers. From here on it could reach a tipping point where you have an explosion in the e-commerce activities,\" Sathirathai said.\n\nCurrently, e-commerce penetration in the region is still only 2 percent, he said.\n\nAside from capital injection, Sathirathai said the Chinese companies are also bringing know-how such as their tech and data analytics.\n\nThat contribution might help with two key problems in Asia: Payments and logistics.\n\nThe payment mode used in Southeast Asia is still mainly cash on delivery, which is a constraint on e-commerce growth, he said. And smart logistics systems could solve problems surrounding last-mile delivery.\n\nBut companies would need to work with the fragmented markets in Asia first, and \"localization\" will be key to that, he added.\n\n\"It's going to be very different in each market. Just because you win in one market doesn't mean you can dominate another market.\"\n\nBut one thing is for sure, he said: The region is set to see many companies fighting for a piece of the market.\n\n\"Competition is going to be gruesome, consolidation is the next phase.\"",

McMaster with policy hawk Bolton, who Sherman described as \"a man who has never seen a war he does not want to wage,\" could add more risk into the mix, especially ahead of a historic summit under consideration for Trump and Kim.\n\nIn the past, Bolton has recommended scrapping the Iran nuclear deal and justified the need for U.S. strikes against North Korea.\n\nBolton's hawkish views could encourage Trump to do what he wants on North Korea and Iran, said Sherman, who is currently a non-resident senior fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School and a senior counselor at consultancy Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\n\"There is an enormous amount at stake here and my greatest concern is that the president is dealing with each of these pieces in silos, without understanding how they all interconnect and how we have to work out a comprehensive strategy,\" she said.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis may try to ease tensions behind the scene but it's unclear how successful he may be, Sherman continued.\n\nTrump has set a mid-May deadline for European powers to meet his demands on revisions to an agreement that would place limits on Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's April visit to Washington will be \"crucial\" to the fate of the deal, Sherman said, noting that Macron appears to get along with Trump.",

One sticking point has been Washington's demand that auto exports to the U.S. contain a minimum of 50 percent U.S. content, although that requirement could have been dropped, according to recent reports.\n\nEarlier this week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated he was upbeat about working out a satisfactory deal, Reuters reported.\n\nChampagne also highlighted the significance of the U.S.-Canada relationship, adding that \"there are no two nations that are trading more.\"\n\n\"Where we are in this discussion, it's not a relation of buyers and sellers. We make things together and because of that, we have created prosperity on both sides of the border and we want to continue that,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Champagne did not directly address what Canada's plans would be should NAFTA talks break down, he said that the U.S. would \"always remain\" Canada's largest trading partner, due to the former's geographical location and size of its economy.\n\nIn the meantime, Canada has been involved in various trade agreements as the global economic power balance shifts.\n\n\"There's never been a better time to diversify ... I think Canadians understand that the center of gravity of the world economy is shifting toward Asia Pacific,\" Champagne said. As Canada is \"very much a Pacific nation,\" it had to position itself for the next few decades, he added.\n\nCanada has participated in various trade agreements of late, including last year's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Europe and this year's revamped Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.",

Helfenbein said those proposals made him \"a little bit happy,\" but he added that increased trade tariffs could hit his industry hard.\n\nAlready, China has responded to some of the White House's moves, releasing on Friday a list of 128 U.S. products that could be targeted as a reciprocal measure to Trump's previously announced broad duties on foreign aluminum and steel imports.\n\nPork, wine, fruit and steel were named among the potential targets, though the list was not exhaustive. Helfenbein said he suspected textiles could be included in the tariff hikes.\n\n\"We don't like it, we're very concerned as an industry that apparel and footwear and accessories might be on the list, and if they are on the list it really would not be good for our industry,\" he noted.\n\nU.S. agricultural products, particularly soybeans, have been flagged as another area of potential retaliation by Chinese President Xi Jinping's administration.\n\nChina imports $14.2 billion worth of soybeans annually and a move to slap tariffs on the product would have a \"big impact\" on U.S. producers, John Heisdorffer, president of the American Soybean Association, told CNBC Friday.\n\n\"China's our number one customer,\" said Heisdorffer. \"One out of every three rows of soybeans that we grow here in the U.S. goes to China, so it's a big impact.\"\n\nHe added that the only likely winners from such tariffs would be producers in other countries, particularly within South America, who would be \"more than willing to take over\" if the U.S. goods became more expensive in China.\n\nThat could seriously hurt U.S. farmers, who represent a significant proportion of Trump's voter base.\n\n\"Rural America put Mr. Trump into office so it'll be fun to watch in the next election what happens, whether they will continue to support him,\" said Heisdorffer.\n\nBoth Helfenbein and Heisdorffer said they are consulting with the White House in a bid to convince the U.S. to water down its plans.",

                "body": "Tencent's headquarters in Shenzhen, China, pictured in August 2016.\n\nChina's Tencent Holdings saw its shares down 4.51 percent at the midday trading break on Friday after the internet firm's largest shareholder, Naspers, said it would lower its stake for the first time in 17 years.\n\nThe Hong Kong-listed stock opened 7.8 percent lower at HK$405, its lowest opening price since Feb. 9, before regaining ground to HK$419.6 by noon. The benchmark Hang Seng Index was down 2.81 percent.\n\nA day earlier, the stock fell 5 percent following Tencent's late Wednesday report showing quarterly revenue missed estimates as well as expectations of margin pressure, although profit beat forecasts.\n\nFriday's decline wiped $24 billion off Tencent's market value, though at $508 billion, it is still Asia's most valuable listed company and fifth globally behind Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft.\n\nSouth African media and e-commerce group Naspers said on Thursday it planned to sell up to 190 million Tencent shares, or 2 percent of its holding, in a sale that could earn Naspers up to $11 billion. It also said it had no plans to further reduce its holding for the next three years.\n\n\"The funds will reinforce Naspers' balance sheet and be invested in classifieds, online food delivery and fintech globally,\" said CICC analyst Natalie Wu. \"We think it is a good opportunity to buy into dips given Tencent's solid fundamentals.\"\n\nJefferies analyst Karen Chan said, \"Given Naspers' largest single shareholding and board representation in Tencent, we believe its stake sale is unlikely to be a reaction to Tencent's quarterly results. Instead of a timed profit-taking move, we believe this is more to improve Naspers' own free cash flow and allow it higher flexibility in pursuing investment opportunities.\"\n\nA Tencent spokeswoman said it was informed and supportive of Naspers' decision, and that Naspers' intention to keep its remaining stake for the next three years demonstrated its confidence in Tencent.",

That all explains \"a lot of overreaction and maybe the estimation of the effect\" of the new trade regulations, he added.\n\nSpiking tariffs worldwide would hurt the countries and companies that rely heavily on exports, Peetathawatchai said, pointing out that the export proportion of the Thai economy is very high, ranging from 60 percent to 70 percent. He mentioned, however, that direct exports into the U.S. currently only account for about 10 percent of the country's total exports.\n\nTwenty years ago, Thai exports to the U.S., Europe and Japan each accounted for 20 percent, according to the SET executive, but \"that has changed abruptly during the last 10 to 20 years,\" he said.\n\n\"The effect of the exporting to the U.S. becomes less important to our country than in the past. However, I would not say it is not impacted because many countries in Southeast Asia or in China also do indirect export to the U.S.\" he pointed out.\n\nIndirect export refers to Thailand exporting goods to nations that then go on to export the goods to the U.S. That indirect economic effect can accumulate over time, the chief strategist said.\n\nCurrently, Southeast Asia is Thailand's biggest export market, followed by China, Peetathawatchai said.\n\n\"We export the most to ASEAN countries and secondly to China. So you could say that the relationship on trade for Thailand seems to be more dependent on regional economy, the Asia economy, than the U.S. trade we have at the moment,\" he said.",

                "title": "Trump pauses looming metal tariffs for close US allies",
                "body": "President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House on Tuesday, March 20, 2018 in Washington, DC.\n\nThe European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Canada and Mexico will get initial exemptions from looming steel and aluminum tariffs from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump authorized the exemptions late Thursday night.\n\nTrump is planning to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum -- trade penalties aimed at China for flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminum.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee that the exempted countries are involved in various stages of trade talks with the U.S., and that Trump decided \"to pause\" the tariffs for them.\n\nThe U.S. is in consultations with Canada and Mexico in an effort to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nTrump moved on a separate trade front earlier Thursday, paving the way for tariffs on China as punishment for what he said is the theft of American technology. He told reporters that the threat of the steel and aluminum tariffs was already having an impact.\n\n\"Many countries are calling to negotiate better trade deals because they don't want to have to pay the steel and aluminum tariffs,\" Trump said.\n\nLighthizer identified the countries initially exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs in response to a question from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who said lawmakers wanted more consultation from the administration on trade.\n\n\"There are countries with whom we're negotiating, and then the question becomes the obvious one that you think, as a matter of business, how does this work?\" Lighthizer said. \"So what he has decided to do is to pause the imposition of the tariffs with respect to those countries.\"\n\nBefore Lighthizer's congressional testimony, Germany's economy minister, Peter Altmaier, said he had found officials in Washington \"open to our arguments\" during a recent visit with the EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom.\n\nAltmaier told Germany's parliament \"it is a question of fundamental significance: whether we all stand for open and fair world markets in the future.\"\n\nTrump campaigned on promises to bring down America's trade deficit, which stood at $566 billion last year, by rewriting trade agreements and cracking down on what he called abusive commercial practices by U.S. trading partners. But Trump was slow to turn rhetoric to action. In January, he imposed tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. Then he announced the steel and aluminum tariffs, saying reliance on imported metals jeopardizes U.S. national security.\n\nLighthizer said the nation's trade deficit indicates that the global rules on trade sometimes make it hard for U.S. companies to export.\n\nThe administration \"is seeking to build a better, fairer system of global markets that will lead to higher living standards for all Americans,\" Lighthizer said.\n\nGOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee chairman, said he was \"deeply disappointed in the decision to impose global tariffs to address a problem caused by China.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said he was troubled to hear that South Korea would be initially exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\n\"I was not expecting that,\" Brown said. \"Korea has unfairly dumped steel and other products in our country.\"",

                "title": "Senate averts government shutdown with $1.3 trillion spending bill",
                "body": "President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation into law.\n\nThe Senate passed a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill in the early morning hours of Friday, sending it to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature.\n\nCongress approved the more than 2,200-page legislation swiftly with a midnight Friday government shutdown deadline looming. The plan was released only Wednesday night. The House approved the bill Thursday afternoon by a 256-167 vote with bipartisan backing.\n\nThe legislation would fund the government through the end of September. It would significantly boost military spending and increase funding for border security, infrastructure and efforts to fight the opioid epidemic, among other programs. It also includes measures meant to strengthen gun sale background checks and improve school safety.\n\nSome members criticized the rushed process to pass the proposal. They expressed concerns about the limited time to read and understand the massive legislation.\n\nThe bill now heads to Trump, who is expected to sign it into law despite misgivings about it earlier this week. Trump had concerns over such issues as the amount of money set aside for his proposed border wall, the lack of a sanctuary cities provision, and whether funding would go toward a rail tunnel connecting New Jersey and New York that he opposed.\n\nHe reportedly threatened to veto it days ago, but tweeted his support for it Wednesday night after a discussion with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nTrump tweet\n\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney reiterated Trump's support on Thursday and said he \"looks forward to signing it.\" The president will support it \"because it funds his priorities,\" Mulvaney said.\n\nLeaders from both parties touted victories in the compromise bill, but acknowledged they made concessions. Republicans like Ryan promoted the boost to military funding and border enforcement efforts.\n\n\"What this ultimately is about is giving our military the tools and the resources it needs to do its job,\" he said before the House approved the bill.\n\nBoth major parties cheered increased funding to fight the opioid crisis and improve infrastructure.\n\nDemocrats touted provisions such as higher funding for child-care subsidies and low-income housing tax credits. They also got wins from what was not included in the legislation: measures championed by conservatives to pull funding for Planned Parenthood or so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nThe bill \"is legislation that neither side sees as perfect, but which contains a host of significant victories and important achievements on behalf of the American people,\" McConnell said Thursday on the Senate floor.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also acknowledged concessions from both major parties on Thursday.\n\n\"Now, it certainly doesn't have everything Democrats want. And it contains a few things Democrats aren't thrilled about. The same is true of our Republican friends. That is true of all compromises,\" Schumer said Thursday.\n\nHere are some of the bill's notable provisions:\n\nIt would boost Department of Defense funding by nearly $80 billion, the largest increase in 15 years, according to lawmakers. That includes a 2.4 percent pay increase for the military. It would put $1.57 billion in new funding toward fencing along the border with Mexico and border security technology such as aircraft and sensors. Trump had sought billions more in funding for a physical barrier on the border after he promised to build a wall as a candidate. The legislation would allocate billions in new funding toward opioid abuse treatment, prevention and research. Overall, it would put $4 billion toward those efforts. The bill would put more than $10 billion more toward infrastructure projects to improve highways, airports, railroads and bridges. It will also put money toward high-speed broadband development. It would not directly fund a rail tunnel from New Jersey to New York that Trump opposed. But the project would be eligible for funding from programs that are getting a boost in the bill. It would include a provision to strengthen the gun sale background check system, by pushing agencies to better follow existing procedures for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The so-called Fix NICS bill had bipartisan support. The proposal would put more than $2 billion in new money toward mental health and school safety programs. The legislation would adjust an issue from the GOP tax bill passed in December that helped agricultural cooperatives relative to corporate competitors. In return, Democrats secured an expansion of the low-income housing tax credit. The bill would not include measures to shore up Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces, as some Republicans and Democrats hoped. It also would not pull funding for so-called sanctuary cities or Planned Parenthood, as some conservatives had hoped.",

But that could aggravate the world's second-largest economy, potentially triggering a greater Chinese military presence around the region.\n\nThat result became more likely after senior officials from the four democracies held discussions on upholding freedom of navigation, terrorism, connectivity and maritime security in Asia on the sidelines of a November ASEAN Summit.\n\nThe meeting, dubbed the \"Australia-India-Japan-United States consultations on the Indo-Pacific,\" was widely viewed as a resurgence of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue -- or \"Quad\" -- an\n\ninformal security forum consisting of the same four countries that launched in 2007 but eventually fell apart.\n\nThe revived Quad comes as President Donald Trump's administration centers its Asia strategy around a \"free and open Indo-Pacific,\" a term used as a replacement for the more widely used \"Asia Pacific\" label.\n\nThe consultations focused on \"issues of mutual concern, whether they be security, economic or political,\" Alex Wong, deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. State Department's East Asian and Pacific Affairs bureau, said last week in response to a question from CNBC.\n\nBeijing is the biggest shared worry among the four powers, strategists said.\n\n\"Though China is cautiously not named in any of the statements, the revival of the group is undoubtedly motivated by increasing nervousness at China's assertiveness and ambitions in the region,\" researchers at Singapore-based Nanyang Technological University said in a note.\n\nFrom building man-made islands in the contested South China Sea to increasing economic leverage over developing countries with the Belt and Road program, China's behavior has worried America's Asia Pacific allies. Beijing has also been criticized for using education, spying, and political donations to influence local decision-making in countries such as New Zealand.\n\nWhen asked whether the four-country dialogue was a means to hedge against China, Wong said unfounded fears were being appended to a single, working-level meeting: \"The strange types of intentions being ascribed to [this meeting], I think, may not be grounded in truth.\"\n\nHe said dialogue among the four nations would continue, but warned that he \"can't predict where it's going to go.\"\n\nFor now, the Quad is widely expected to remain a loose and flexible partnership based on solidarity rather than an institutionalized military alliance.\n\nMaritime security is seen as the group's core issue, but infrastructure could play a major role too.\n\n\"Australia is likely to back proposals to insert an infrastructure investment component into the Quad so it can provide an alternative -- or supplement -- to China's sprawling 65-nation Belt and Road Initiative,\" intelligence firm Stratfor said in a February note.\n\n\"The four countries discussed the proposal at the November 2017 meeting, and Australia and Japan subsequently have downplayed any potential military aspects to the Quad, perhaps out of worries over Beijing,\" it continued.\n\nSo far, Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has expressed reservations about the Quad, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying that regional cooperation should neither be \"politicized\" nor \"exclusionary.\"\n\n\"Despite frequent disavowals, the Quad redux is primarily about China,\" according to Chengxin Pan, associate professor at Deakin University. \"Rightly or wrongly, many Chinese are likely to interpret the Quad efforts and U.S. freedom of navigation operations in terms of new gunboat diplomacy,\" he said in a recent report.\n\n\"Gunboat diplomacy\" is when military actions or threats are used to support a country's foreign policy.\n\nThat could push Beijing to further strengthen its military capabilities, Pan warned: \"One can expect more 'bad things' from China should the Quad operate in full swing.\"",

                "body": "China is taking a measured approach with its proposal to slap retaliatory tariffs on just $3 billion worth of U.S. goods, according to a former U.S. official.\n\nBeijing on Friday said it had decided on a list of 128 U.S. products with an import value of only $3 billion as potential targets for retaliationin response to President Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nU.S. goods exported to China in 2016 totaled $115.6 billion, according to official data. Given the size of the two countries' trade, China's limited focus on just $3 billion of U.S. imports is \"very cautious,\" according to a former assistant U.S. Trade Representative for China Affairs.\n\n\"They want to show that they have taken note of U.S. actions and are going to be strongly resisting, but they don't want to be seen as escalating things further,\" said Timothy Stratford, who held the China post at the USTR from 2005 to 2010.\n\n\"The Chinese recognize that everyone has a lot to learn if the U.S. and China move into a trade war,\" said Stratford, who now is managing partner at law firm Covington & Burling's Beijing office.\n\nBeijing claims to be a champion of global trade, though it limits foreign companies' access to its domestic market, forces foreign companies to take on Chinese partners if they want to operate within its borders, and requires foreign companies to hand over technological know-how in exchange for market access.\n\nStill, Beijing has promoted itself as a trade globalist in an attempt to contrast itself with Trump's protectionism.\n\n\"China does not want a trade war with anyone,\" the Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement on Thursday. \"But China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war.\"\n\nTrade scholar Alex Capri, a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore, agreed that China's response is cautious but said it's likely designed to leave wiggle room for bargaining. \"This tells me they are sending signals for a potential deal down the line,\" Capri said.\n\nChina's response on Friday could mark the start of tit-for-tat trade actions, many fear.\n\n\"We're entering a dark tunnel,\" Stratford warned. \"At the end of the day, these back and forth penalties don't solve the underlying problems.\"",

                "body": "New national security adviser John Bolton speaking at Capitol Hill on November 8, 2017.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's choice of John Bolton to replace Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster as national security advisor replaces a restraining influence in the president's inner circle with a dedicated hawk.\n\nBolton is known as a colorful figure in Washington and an inveterate bureaucratic infighter. On his desk at the State Department during the administration of former Republican President George W. Bush, he kept a defused hand grenade.\n\nHis 2007 memoir is titled: \"Surrender Is Not An Option.\" His favorite targets for criticism include Iran, North Korea, the United Nations, European governments and international treaties.\n\nIn 2003, on the eve of six-nation talks over Pyongyang's nuclear program, he lambasted then North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in a speech in Seoul, calling him a \"tyrannical dictator.\"\n\nNorth Korea responded by calling Bolton \"human scum.\"\n\nLike Trump, Bolton did not serve in the Vietnam War, instead joining the Army National Guard.\n\nBolton's sometimes abrasive style got him into trouble in the Bush administration. One incident that came back to haunt him was his reported dressing-down of an intelligence analyst who questioned him over whether Cuba had an advanced chemical and biological weapons program.\n\nDuring his 2005 confirmation hearing to become U.N. ambassador, State Department intelligence chief Carl Ford called Bolton \"a serial abuser\" and \"a quintessential kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy.\"\n\nThe Senate never approved Bolton's nomination. Bush instead appointed him to the U.N. post for 17 months under a process known as a recess appointment that bypasses confirmation.\n\nIn a Fox News interview on Thursday evening, after news of his appointment broke, Bolton appeared to temper his often harsh rhetoric. \"Frankly, what I have said in private now, is behind me, at least effective April 9,\" he said, referring to the date he is scheduled to take over from McMaster.\n\nThe White House national security adviser post does not require Senate confirmation. In that job, Bolton will oversee a White House national security staff of several hundred specialists, many on loan from the Pentagon, State Department and U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nHe will be responsible for advising Trump on a dizzying array of issues, from the fight against Islamic State and al Qaeda to China's expanding economic and military power.\n\nIn Seoul, conservative lawmaker Kim Hack-yong expressed concern about Bolton's appointment in advance of a planned summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"This is worrisome news. North Korea and the United States need to have dialogue, but this only fuels worries over whether the talks will ever happen,\" Kim said. \"If Bolton takes office and talks with North Korea go haywire and yield bad results, I don't know what we'll do then.\"\n\nMark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, who advises the White House on Iran policy, said Bolton would support abrogating the Iran nuclear deal if Britain, France and Germany fail to meet Trump's demand for new limits on Tehran's program by mid-May.\n\n\"My long-standing support for a fix for the Iran deal may have just died an untimely death,\" said Dubowitz, who backs preserving the deal by closing what he argues are fatal loopholes in the pact.\n\nBolton has applauded Trump's plan to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, advocated keeping the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba open, and proposed increasing pressure on China by boosting U.S. support to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province.\n\nJudging by his Twitter feed, Bolton is more hawkish on Russia than his new boss, Trump.\n\nWhile dismissing allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with the Kremlin, Bolton has been outspoken about alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin announced new nuclear weapons on March 1, Bolton responded with trademark bellicosity.\n\n\"There needs to be a strategic response to Russia's new nuclear missiles to show our allies in Europe that we will not let #Russia push the U.S. or its allies around,\" he wrote.",

Australia, a staunch U.S. ally with no claim to the South China Sea, has long maintained its neutrality in the dispute to protect its economic relationship with China.\n\nBut bilateral relations have soured in recent months after Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said China was improperly interfering in Canberra's affairs, an accusation that triggered a rare protest from Beijing.",

                "title": "House spending bill restores funding for West Coast earthquake warning system",
                "body": "Dr. Lucy Jones, Senior Advisor for Risk Reduction, U.S. Geological Survey explains how P-waves and S-waves are created by an earthquake during a press conference in which Senator Alex Padilla announces at Caltech in Pasadena, Ca. that he is introducing legislation to create an earthquake early warning system in California on January 28, 2013.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey's West Coast earthquake warning system appears to be a winner in the House's $1.3 trillion spending bill passed Thursday. The bill restores money the Trump administration's budget cut and allows for a limited public rollout of the program.\n\nThe omnibus spending bill for the fiscal year ending in September 2018 provides $22.9 million for the early warning system known as ShakeAlert, including a $2.7 million increase over 2017 funding. It also gives the USGS a one-time $10 million investment for costs to continue building out the system with additional remote sensors on the West Coast.\n\nWhen completed, the ShakeAlert system could provide people on the West Coast with seconds or up to a minute of warning ahead of shaking to prevent injuries and loss of life. Mexico City and Japan already have earthquake early warning systems, but the U.S. has lagged behind because of the lack of stable funding for the program.\n\n\"The significant funding provided in the bill will help ensure that the West Coast has a functioning earthquake early warning system in the near future,\" Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., said in a statement. \"I will continue to be a champion for this life-saving technology that can have a significant impact when big earthquakes strike.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., another West Coast lawmaker who has fought to restore funding for the ShakeAlert program, stated: \"The system will not only help protect infrastructure and businesses, but also prevent injuries and save lives across California, Oregon and Washington.\"\n\nMore than $26 million in federal money has already been invested in the ShakeAlert program. The states of California and Oregon also have chipped in funding to support the program.\n\nWork on the system started a decade ago as a collaboration between the USGS and several universities on the West Coast that run the seismic sensor networks.\n\nToday, the ShakeAlert system remains in the testing stage, although California is in the process of launching a \"limited public roll out\" this year that will focus on utilities, health care, transportation and education. The USGS is already working with the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest district, to test ShakeAlert initially in three schools, with plans for possible expansion later.\n\nThe date of the final public rollout of the ShakeAlert system is undetermined, according to officials, and depends on several factors, including continued funding, seismic station buildout and other factors.\n\nThe system calls for about 1,700 seismic stations. As it stands now, the system is at roughly the halfway mark in terms of completion. It is estimated that a full system of sensors will cost just over $38 million to build out along the West Coast, with annual operating and maintenance costs of some $16.1 million.\n\nThe Trump administration proposed pulling funding for the earthquake early warning system in its budget request for fiscal year 2018 by $8.2 million to $10 million.\n\nThe House's action Thursday restores funding in the current fiscal year. Congress has not yet acted on a proposal for fiscal 2019, but proponents of the program remain hopeful.\n\n\"We saw a rise in funding that we didn't necessarily anticipate on this newly restored funding,\" said Leland O'Driscoll, manager of the University of Oregon's Oregon Seismic Network, one of the West Coast university groups participating in the ShakeAlert program. \"So a lot of the champions, plus a growing list, are onboard for the ask for fiscal 2019.\"\n\nOverall, President Donald Trump's administration proposed cutting $26.7 million from the USGS budget for natural hazards programs in fiscal 2019, including about $13 million less in earthquake hazards programs. The request also cut more than $10 million from the earthquake early warning system.\n\n\"I've been fighting for this funding because ShakeAlert and other early warning systems are literally lifesavers,\" said Rep. Derek Kilmer, D-Wash., in a statement. \"In the event of an earthquake or tsunami, this funding could buy a few extra minutes for teachers and their students, doctors and their patients in the middle of a surgery, or a commuter crossing a bridge.\"\n\nUSGS, which is part of the Department of the Interior, declined comment for this story. In announcing the fiscal 2019 request in February, the Interior Department said, \"the 2019 budget prioritizes funding for critical responsibilities and core mission activities.\"",

Please make a contribution of $1 to help FIGHT BACK,\" said the email.\n\nImplying that special counsel Robert Mueller would somehow \"overturn\" Trump's election represented a new line of attack for the Trump campaign, which has so far mainly attacked Democrats, the media, and undocumented immigrants in its appeals for cash.\n\nOn the rare occasion that a Trump campaign email mentioned the Russia probe, it was only to label the probe a \"witch hunt,\" or a \"phony\" narrative -- a far cry from the suggestion Thursday that Mueller could remove the president from office by overturning the results of the 2016 election, and essentially orchestrate a coup.\n\nThe more aggressive tone of Trump's latest fundraising email coincided with a similar shift that is reportedly underway among the president's legal team, towards a more combative approach to the Mueller probe.\n\nOn Thursday, John Dowd, Trump's personal attorney and his lead lawyer on the Russia inquiry, resigned. This was just days after Trump hired Joseph diGenova, a lawyer and cable news commentator who has repeatedly claimed that the special counsel's investigation is part of a vast government conspiracy against the president.\n\nThis idea that there are somehow two governments, one led by Trump, and another one plotting against Trump, was also evident in the Trump campaign email, which accused the Washington establishment of \"using our government as a weapon\" to overturn Trump's election.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a perpetual boogey-man for the GOP, was singled out in the email and accused of, \"using the Russia witch hunt as a political ploy to RAISE MONEY from her supporters.\" Which is, incidentally, the same thing that the Trump campaign was doing.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to an email from CNBC.",

                "body": "Matt Damon is best known as an actor and Academy Award-winning screenwriter. But he's also the co-founder of two nonprofits working to end the world's water crisis.\n\n\"You have a million people dying a year, just completely needlessly, because they lack access to clean water,\" says Damon, speaking to CNBC on Thursday, the 25th annual World Water Day, which serves to call attention to the problem.\n\nAnd for many more, lack of access to clean water is life-altering.\n\n\"The potential it robs people of, right?\" says Damon. \"If you are a little girl who now can't go to school because you are in charge of water collection for your family, and you are spending your entire day scavenging for water, what kind of outcome can you expect for your life? Certainly you are not going to live up to your potential.\"\n\nToday is #WorldWaterDay! Today we turn our attention to the 844M people who don't have access to safe water. Donate to @Water today so we can empower everyone everywhere with access to safe water every day.\n\nIndeed, 2.1 billion people lack access to safe, readily available water at home, according to a July 2017 report from the World Health Organization and UNICEF. That's roughly equivalent to three out of every 10 people, according to the report. Of those, 844 million people lack access to basic drinking water service. Further, 4.5 billion people around the world lack access to safely managed sanitation, according to the same report. That's roughly six in 10 people. A lack of access to clean water and sanitation is resulting in children dying from diarrhea and the transmission of diseases including cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A and typhoid.\n\nAround the world, many people have to walk long distances to find a water source and others have to wait in long lines and pay large percentages of their income to secure any water at all, explain Damon and Gary White, who, along with Damon, co-founded the non-profit organization Water.org and the non-profit impact investment fund manager WaterEquity.\n\n\"Today, 200 million hours will be spent by women and girls walking to collect water,\" says White, speaking to CNBC. \"People are paying up to 25 percent of their income just to get dubious quality water that they can bring back to their home.\"\n\nWomen and children spend 258 M hours every day collecting water, but they could be doing so much more. Less time getting water means more time for work, school, play, family and life.\n\nTo work to solve this crisis, Damon and White came together in 2009 to launch Water.org, a non-profit that works to provide access to clean drinking water in 13 countries around the world: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Asia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Brazil, Honduras and Peru. Water.org helps people gain access to clean water and sanitation by teaching, training and guiding local micro-finance institutions to make loans for providing access to clean water and sanitation.\n\n\"Gary kind of had this insight years ago,\" says Damon to CNBC.\n\nThis #WorldWaterDay donate to @Water and give families water and time for joy, hope, opportunity and life.\n\n\"The municipality is piping water underneath their feet, they are just not connected to it.... So if you could front them the money for a connection to the system that exists, you are buying their time back. They can work at a job they will get all those hours back that they are waiting in line or all that income back that they are wasting that the middle class wouldn't have to pay comes back into that household. And so it was this idea he had to apply the concepts of microfinance to the water space and it just was a brilliant idea. These loans pay back between 97 and 99 percent,\" says Damon.\n\nIn 2016, Damon and White launched an impact investment fund to provide capital to these microfinance institutions they were educating with Water.org. In 2017, the impact investment management arm of Water.org became a separate nonprofit, WaterEquity. Currently, WaterEquity is raising money for a $50 million fund, seeded by companies, institutional investors, foundations and wealthy individuals.\n\nThe goal of the investment fund is to get a 3 to 3.5 percent return (plus principal) to investors -- \"so that's better than a municipal, it is better than treasuries,\" Anne Finucane, a vice chairman at Bank of America, which made a $5 million zero interest loan to WaterEquity's fund, told CNBC Thursday.\n\nFor millions of low-income Indonesian families, water connections are unaffordable without financing. With small loans, women are empowered to give their families water at home. Less time getting water means more time for work. Donate to @Water and give time. #WorldWaterDay\n\nThe funds take the money, invest it through these local microfinance organizations and then return the fund with the interest to the lender.\n\n\"We take those funds and invest them in enterprises that serve the poor in terms of their water and sanitation needs,\" says White. \"The basic math on it is that every million that comes into the fund, over the seven-year life, 100,000 people get access to water or sanitation.... It is a truly sustainable and scalable way to connect impact investors all the way down to poor women at the household level so that they can solve this problem.\"\n\nTaken together, Water.org and WaterEquity have given access to clean water or sanitation to more than 10 million individuals around the globe.\n\nGiven a chance, people are able to take the access to water and really turn their lives around, benefiting themselves and their families. White uses a woman named Mama Florence from Uganda as an example.\n\n\"She took out a water credit loan and has a pump and water tank to store water in now, and she took that opportunity and starting selling water to her neighbors,\" explains White. \"She wanted to send her grandkids to school -- that was the impetus behind all this.\n\n\"And then she went from doing that to growing some vegetables, and then she would feed some to some pigs that she had purchased to raise, and then she used the water to start making bricks and selling those. And then she built some small rooms where people could come and rent. So She just used water and this loan as a way to really develop her own life and get her grandkids into school.\"\n\n-- Video by Mary Stevens\n\nSee also:\n\nHow Charity: Water's founder went from hard-partying NYC club promoter to helping 8 million people around the world\n\nWhy this Harvard grad has spent a decade making maxi pads out of banana fibers\n\nThe US wastes 62 million tons of food a year -- this Howard Buffett-backed start-up has a solution\n\nLike this story?

                "body": "On the worst day for markets since Feb. 8, CNBC's Jim Cramer took callers' questions in a sell-off strategy session to help them navigate the madness.\n\n\"This is a sell-off based on a slowdown, slowdown from technology, slowdown from a belief that tariffs are going to hurt the economy,\" the \"Mad Money\" host explained on Thursday.\n\n\"What you do when you have a slowdown is you go for the highest-growth stocks, so when things settle down, it's going to be the FANG names that are going to start doing better fast,\" he recommended.\n\nCramer also suggested that investors wait to hear more details about President Donald Trump's announced tariffs before buying.\n\n\"When we do, ... we'll be able to take advantage of it and buy the stocks that have come down too much,\" Cramer said.\n\nAfter the Dow Jones industrial average's 700-point plunge on Thursday, Cramer knew he had to determine the causes of the sell-off for investors.\n\nThe main issue seemed to be President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs on Chinese goods, which spooked companies that do business in the People's Republic.\n\nOne potential target could be the technology sector, which accounts for 26 percent of the S&P 500, Cramer said. Chinese consumers buy a lot of U.S. technology, including but not limited to Apple products.\n\n\"People are becoming disenchanted with tech, particularly something they loved until recently, ... artificial intelligence,\" Cramer said.\n\nAs the major averages dropped, Cramer argued that the moves had little to do with Wednesday's rate hike by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"As long as the 1 percent believes in free trade at any cost, it's going to weigh on the stock market when the president goes in the opposite direction,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nThe wealthiest people in the United States, many of whom own stock in leading global companies, have long benefited from free trade, or the unrestricted exchange of goods and services, Cramer explained.\n\nU.S. presidents and business leaders have also long supported free trade, making deals with other countries to expand global trade.\n\n\"President Trump does not share that orthodoxy and it's starting to dawn on the business community that the free ride may be over,\" Cramer said.\n\nIn a tough environment for retail, Cramer wanted to revisit some of the sector's best performers: Home Depot and Lowe's, two top home improvement chains.\n\n\"In recent years, Home Depot had pulled ahead of Lowe's in a major way, and while it's always been the superior operator, I think it's worth asking why,\" Cramer said. \"After all, both stocks have been slammed here.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that Home Depot's stock is down 7.5 percent for the year and Lowe's stock is down 7.8 percent, but \"unlike so many other names, they haven't bounced nearly at all.\"\n\n\"At these levels, it pays to wonder which one is a better buy,\" he said on Thursday.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Washington Prime Group CEO Louis Conforti argued that his company's stock is undervalued in an interview with Cramer.\n\n\"I think ultimately what has happened is we've been faced with a couple of binary paths, ... so you're physical space or you're e-commerce,\" Conforti said. \"And we operate under the assumption that only one is going to win.\"\n\nConforti, whose real estate investment trust operates shopping centers across the country, said that the way to push back against that assumption is for malls to diversify their offerings.\n\nOn the local, regional and national levels, the CEO said Washington Prime Group has focused on \"providing real-time incentives for our leasing professionals to work on that diversification.\"\n\n\"Realistically, if we don't, we're actually doing a disservice not only to our guests but to our tenants, those tenants that are evolving and embracing this new world order,\" Conforti said.\n\nIn Cramer's lightning round, he zoomed through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:\n\nFifth Third Bancorp: \"You can hold that. Fifth Third is a very, very good bank. I don't think rates are going to continue to go down as they did today. I'm not troubled. I also like [Huntington Bancshares], I think HBAN's good, and I like First Horizon. That's a three-fer.\"\n\nAmerican Electric Power Co.: \"Look, it yields under 4 [percent] now. I would buy more if it went above 4, which, of course, does mean therefore that the stock is going lower. That's where I would buy it.\"\n\nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple.\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

                "title": "Cramer pits Home Depot against Lowe's and picks the better stock",
                "body": "Shares of both Home Depot and Lowe's have been declining of late, creating potential buying opportunities.\n\nIn a tough environment for retail, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to revisit some of the sector's best performers: Home Depot and Lowe's, two top home improvement chains.\n\n\"In recent years, Home Depot had pulled ahead of Lowe's in a major way, and while it's always been the superior operator, I think it's worth asking why,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said on Thursday. \"After all, both stocks have been slammed here.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that Home Depot's stock is down 7.5 percent for the year and Lowe's stock is down 7.8 percent, but \"unlike so many other names, they haven't bounced nearly at all.\"\n\n\"At these levels, it pays to wonder which one is a better buy,\" he said.\n\nCramer admitted that over the years, he has preferred Home Depot over Lowe's because of its generally better earnings results, same-store sales and growth.\n\nHe also likes Home Depot because of the investments it has made in technology; in 2010, the company gave its salespeople smartphones designed to handle in-store communications, manage inventory, search for products and process customer checkouts.\n\nIn 2015, Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff talked about how his customer relationship management company was working with Home Depot on its customer service model, eventually rolling out a Home Depot app designed to help customers schedule appointments and get quotes for products.\n\n\"They were doing buy online, pick up in the store before BOPUS was ever even an acronym,\" Cramer said. \"The whole setup is optimized for the customers, especially the big-ticket professional contractors. And that, by the way, is where the real money is.\"\n\nThe \"Mad Money\" host acknowledged that Lowe's has also been investing in technology, but at a slower rate. Lowe's started moving its software to the cloud in September, long after Home Depot made the push.\n\nAnd while Lowe's has its own apps, some of which have been critically acclaimed, Cramer argued that they are still behind on technology that improves the customer experience.\n\n\"Do not get me wrong: Lowe's obviously recognizes that it has a lot of catching up to do on the tech front and they've gotten aggressive about it,\" he said. \"But it still seems to me that Home Depot has more of a focus on its bigger ticket customers, and ... winning them over is everything.\"\n\nBut the rivalry doesn't all fall to technological capabilities, Cramer said, positing another, simpler theory: that Lowe's fell behind while integrating RONA, the Canadian retailer it acquired in 2016.\n\nWhen it comes to investing, Cramer noted that Lowe's was a lot cheaper, trading at 14 times next year's earnings estimates compared to Home Depot's 17 times price-to-earnings multiple.\n\nBut he argued that Lowe's discount was deserved because investing in the company is slightly riskier than buying shares of Home Depot.\n\n\"Bottom line? With Lowe's and Home Depot down big from their highs, I think the latter is a better buy than the former, perhaps because of its technology or because Lowe's may have been distracted by its relatively recent acquisition of RONA,\" Cramer said. \"Either way, Home Depot has the better numbers, and while I think both stocks will work here after this clobbering, HD is the one I like most. When the market settles down, this domestic retailer with no trade exposure will be the one to buy.\"\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

                "body": "J.P. Morgan told clients that the Federal Reserve's reluctance to forecast four rate hikes in 2018 should spur a \"goldilocks\" rally in stocks.\n\n\"There was no significant change in inflation expectations and the growth outlook, alleviating recent equity markets concerns,\" quantitative strategist Marko Kolanovic wrote Wednesday. \"This outcome is a positive and indicates that equity investors could expect a near-term goldilocks environment.\"\n\nKolanovic said the central bank quelled overblown inflation concerns by leaving its so-called dot plot unchanged for 2018. The dot plot chart, which maps anonymous entries from each Fed official on the course of interest rate hikes, likely signals that the central bank expects prices to grow steadily and not accelerate beyond a comfortable pace.\n\nThe Fed's latest move in monetary policy, however, appears to have left markets \"confused.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average hit session highs immediately following the release but reversed course multiple times as ChairmanJerome Powell took questions, ultimately ending the day lower. Bond yields, too, couldn't seem to make up their mind, with the rate on the 10-year Treasury note climbing to highs above 2.93 percent before ending the day unchanged.\n\nBut Kolanovic's bullish view on equities is nothing new. The J.P. Morgan strategist wrote to clients earlier in the month to assure them that worries over a potential trade war would prove unfounded.\n\n\"The most recent bear narrative is trade wars. We argue below that this risk is also very low, and if we take the 2015 turmoil as a template for flows from systematic and fundamental investors, markets are likely to reach all-time highs soon,\" Kolanovic wrote last Thursday.\n\nIn fact, Kolanovic told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" on Thursday that any movement in the market caused by trade war fears is minimal, likely a single digit basis point at best.\n\n\"There are a lot of fear stories,\" Kolanovic said, including Fed rate hikes and the Facebook scandal that caused market watchers to panic.\n\n\"Some come and go, and a new one comes, and clearly sentiment is bad,\" he said.\n\nStill, Kolanovic said even if there is a trade war, he does not think it will have adverse effects, such as destabilizing the economy.\n\n\"It's a bit of noise that will pass,\" he said.\n\nDespite the optimistic calls from J.P. Morgan, the market took a nosedive Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 724.42 points, closing at 23,957.89 -- a 2.9 percent decline. The S&P 500 was also down 2.5 percent to 2,643.69. And the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.3 percent to close at 7,166.68.\n\n\"It was an ugly day. It was a disappointing day,\" said Kolanovic, who said he was expecting the market to go up after the Fed's announcement on Wednesday. \"We saw it as a positive for equities.\"\n\nBut while the analyst said Thursday's mass sell-offs were \"certainly not a positive development,\" he maintained that fundamentals and global growth are still strong and he expects the market to recover with a positive earnings season this April.\n\nAccelerated sell-offs at the close of Thursday's trading session were \"entirely technical,\" he said.\n\n\"We maintain our positive near-term view on U.S. equities,\" Kolanovic reiterated in the note. \"The path of recovery is likely to mimic the August 2015 selloff that was also driven by systematic selling, as market volatility subsides, continuation of strong buyback demand, and focus shifting to a strong upcoming earnings season.\"",

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 724.42 points to close at 23,957.89. The 2.9 percent decline was the worst since Feb. 8.\n\nTrump called the tariffs the \"first of many\" trade actions. The new measures are designed to penalize China for trade practices that the Trump administration says involve stealing American companies' intellectual property.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Thursday he doesn't think there will be a trade war with China resulting from the latest tariffs.\n\n\"There will be some ultimate retaliation [from the Chinese] but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth,\" he said on \"Power Lunch.\"\n\nMatt Gold, former deputy assistant U.S. Trade Representative for North America under President Barack Obama, said China may adopt a wait-and-see attitude.\n\nBecause Trump's memo gives the U.S. trade representative an option to pursue the World Trade Organization's procedures, China will step back and see if the U.S. follows the proper rules, he explained.\n\nThat would \"definitely quiet down the rhetoric,\" Gold told \"Closing Bell.\"\n\n-- CNBC's Fred Imbert and Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.",

                "body": "Cramer argues that people are growing wary of artificial intelligence.\n\nAfter the Dow Jones industrial average's 700-point plunge on Thursday, CNBC's Jim Cramer knew he had to determine the causes of the sell-off for investors.\n\nThe main issue seemed to be President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs on Chinese goods, which spooked companies that do business in the People's Republic.\n\nWhile the \"Mad Money\" host was relieved that the tariffs only targeted China and not other U.S. trading partners, he acknowledged the chief worry among investors.\n\n\"The problem is we don't know where the Chinese are going to hit back,\" he said Thursday, noting the broad spectrum of consumer- and business-facing companies operating in China.\n\nOne potential target could be the technology sector, which accounts for 26 percent of the S&P 500, Cramer said. Chinese consumers buy a lot of U.S. technology, including but not limited to Apple products.\n\n\"Every tech company in the world ... covets China, the market, so the fears of number cuts are way too palpable for anyone to step up to the plate and buy today,\" Cramer said. \"And China's not like the U.S.; their system has few checks and balances. If President Xi wants to outright ban the sale of iPhones, he can do it.\"\n\nBut tariffs aren't the only problem plaguing the tech sector at the moment. Facebook executives have been making the rounds on television to apologize for a data scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a firm that reportedly harvested data from 50 million Facebook users without their permission.\n\nAs a result, \"people are becoming disenchanted with tech, particularly something they loved until recently, ... artificial intelligence,\" Cramer said. \"What Facebook did was basically allow bad guys to data mine and make judgments about people using artificial intelligence.\"\n\nThat sentiment was made worse by news of a fatal accident in which an Uber-operated self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, the \"Mad Money\" host argued.\n\n\"Countless tech companies are trying to get a piece of the autonomous driving market -- it's a huge opportunity,\" he said. \"But the roadside fatality we got earlier this week has slammed the brakes on the whole industry. There's going to be a lot of missed quarters here because of that accident.\"\n\nAs people start to grow wary about sharing their information with big corporations, Cramer predicted continued weakness for companies on the front lines of consumer-facing big data and artificial intelligence.\n\n\"When you have Facebook saying, 'Please regulate me,' people start to worry about these things,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"The bottom line? In the end, if you give us nothing to buy, we will sell. The controversies are finally coming home to roost and the sellers ... are coming right along with them. And that's how you get a hideous day like today.\"\n\nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple and Facebook.\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

                "body": "Cramer says that major global companies are feeling the heat when it comes to trade with China.\n\nAs the major averages dropped on Thursday, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that the moves had little to do with Wednesday's rate hike by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"As long as the 1 percent believes in free trade at any cost, it's going to weigh on the stock market when the president goes in the opposite direction,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nThe wealthiest people in the United States, many of whom own stock in leading global companies, have long benefited from free trade, or the unrestricted exchange of goods and services, Cramer explained.\n\nU.S. presidents and business leaders have also long supported free trade, making deals with other countries to expand global trade.\n\n\"President Trump does not share that orthodoxy and it's starting to dawn on the business community that the free ride may be over,\" Cramer said.\n\nTop international companies like Apple, FedEx and Starbucks have also grown their businesses on the back of free trade, Cramer said. And, initially, many of Trump's moves benefited them.\n\n\"The combination of corporate tax cuts and repatriation were huge boosts to all the bottom lines of companies, not just the domestic ones,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"You could sense how much confidence there was when Congress passed the tax bill.\"\n\nBut then came the tariffs, an anti-free-trade move that shocked much of the U.S. elite, even as Cramer thought some restrictions were justified.\n\nHe said that every year in China, millions of the country's 1.3 billion people become wealthy enough to buy iPhones or travel on Boeing airplanes.\n\n\"Sure, the Chinese may steal our trade secrets. Yes, they take our manufacturing jobs, but boy, oh boy, do our companies make money there. Starbucks is huge in China. FedEx is the shipping company of choice for their exports,\" Cramer said.\n\nCompanies like FedEx now feel threatened that the president, determined to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, has potentially thrown their China operations into jeopardy, Cramer explained.\n\n\"The idea of a $1 tariff on Starbucks coffee, something I asked CEO Kevin Johnson about, seemed fanciful 18 months ago. Now it seems plausible,\" he continued. \"FedEx planes may be made to sit on the tarmac while Chinese shippers roll on.\"\n\nSo now, after years of Washington and Wall Street favoring free trade, fears of a legitimate trade war are now trickling into the market narrative, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\n\"Of course the stock market gets crushed, because nearly everyone with money in this country thinks this policy is lunacy, so they're freaking out and turning seller,\" Cramer said. \"That's what today's breakdown was about.\"\n\nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple.\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Morgan Chase is reportedly working on a spin-off of its main blockchain project in part to get a wider audience for it.\n\nThe report, by the Financial Times, said the bank developed its blockchain technology called Quorum two years ago for clearing and settling derivatives and cross-border payments.\n\nA spin-off of Quorum would highlight the difficulties Wall Street firms often have after developing new technologies for the industry but failing to get much outside adoption as an in-house application.\n\nThe FT says rival banks might have been reluctant to use Quorum because it was so closely associated with J. P. Morgan.\n\nBlockchain is a distributed ledger technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin but banks have tested its use for payments and other activities. A spokesman told the FT the bank wasn't going to comment on the speculation, but \"Quorum has become an extremely successful enterprise platform even beyond financial services and we're excited about its potential.\"",

Most recently, Sandberg appeared on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to reiterate her commitment to protecting users.\n\n\"We know this is an issue of trust.

                "body": "Traders work in the S&P 500 options pit at Cboe Global Markets Inc. in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nFears of a trade war slammed stocks Thursday and could keep investors sidelined Friday, as the market looks set on a course to retest the February lows.\n\n\"I guess I wouldn't buy here. I want to understand more about what's going on, but for long term equity holders I would not use this as a reason to sell,\" said Jack Ablin, CIO at Cresset Wealth Advisors.\n\nAblin and others said the market could be first heading to test the 200-day moving average, which it did not break in the February selloff. On the S&P 500, that is currently 2,584, about 60 points from Thursday's close. The February low was another 50 points below that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would put tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods, and trade officials have recommended 10 high tech industries be specifically targeted.\n\nThe sell off also follows the Fed's latest rate hike Wednesday and new forecasts for more hikes next year and the following year.\n\n\"That's the current trend, but it doesn't take away from the fact that monetary policy is tightening and that typically doesn't end well,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Bleakley Financial Group. \"Overall the headwinds grow, the deeper we get into monetary tightening.\" He also said the S&P could test the 200-day moving average sometime this quarter.\n\nU.S. industries vulnerable to potential Chinese countermeasures were hit hard, as investors reacted to concerns the tariffs could lead to a trade war that would hurt corporate profits and the global economy.\n\nIndustrial stocks, for instance were down 3.3 percent, while Boeing was down more than 5 percent. Caterpillar was down 5.7 percent, in its worst decline since Brexit, when the British voted to leave the European Union.\n\nTech, weaker with Facebook, could also vulnerable to trade issues, and it lost 2.7 percent.\n\nThe Dow closed down 724 points, or nearly 3 percent at 23,957, and the S&P 500 lost 2.5 percent to 2,643. Nasdaq tumbled 2.4 percent to 7,166.\n\n\"I think at some point, either it's they reach some kind of deal or back away from it. It's hard to really know,\" said Ablin. \"This isn't something we can measure fundamentally. The good news is it's self-inflicted. It's a contrived crisis. It's not a meteor coming from outer space. We can fix it just as easily as we broke it.\"\n\nAs stocks plunged, investors sought safety in Treasurys, and yields, which move opposite price, fell with the 10-year yield falling as low as 2.80 percent.\n\n\"There was $2.1 billion to sell on the bell. That's what took you to the lows. I would say 80 percent of this is the trade war, and then you add all the other incidentals, like the lawyer resigning,\" said Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS.\n\nStocks took a leg down around midday when headlines crossed that John Dowd, Trump's lead lawyer on the Russia investigation, had resigned.\n\n\"People are definitely losing faith in Trump. They're losing faith in him getting more done just in general,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Redler said he expects the market could bounce Friday, but it may not end up higher as investors watch for more price discovery.\n\n\"People were hoping he would lighten up. Instead of $50 billion, he could have made it $30 billion or $40 billion, but he said it could even be more,\" said Redler.\n\nDan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas, said the dollar impact of the tariffs would obviously be smaller than the $50 billion in goods they are targeting.\n\n\"From a dollar amount even if China responded proportionately, it's $30 billion in the global economy,\" he said. Clifton said the move could be typical of Trump, dramatic at first but then later softened as a negotiating tactic.\n\n\"Everything he does, he throws out a big thing and over time it gets watered down. He's trying to bring China to the negotiating table,\" said Clifton.\n\nBut the market is spooked, and the weakness of February has returned but with then market leader, tech, weakened by the Facebook data scandal.\n\n\"We had a 12 percent move off the highs going into those Feb. 9 lows with better leadership fro technology. Now the market feels worse, and we're still above [the lows.] Why wouldn't we test it?\" said Redler.",

Greg Walden, R-Ore., told CNBC on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Walden, along with Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., called on Zuckerberg to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The panel plans to send a formal letter in the coming days.\n\n\"The buck stops with him,\" Walden said on \"Closing Bell.\"\n\n\"He's the right one to come lay out for the American people and for the world, frankly, what happened, what didn't, what should and shouldn't happen and then we can decide as policymakers the best course.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica, which worked on Facebook ads for the Trump campaign, is accused of improperly gaining access to 50 million profiles before the 2016 election. Cambridge Analytica has called the allegations \"false\" and on Tuesday the board suspended CEO Alexander Nix.\n\nZuckerberg, who broke his silence on the scandal in a Facebook post Wednesday, has expressed a willingness to testify.\n\n\"What we try to do is send the person at Facebook who will have the most knowledge,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. \"If that's me, then I am happy to go.\"\n\nIn his initial statement, the CEO said the company will take measures to ensure user privacy, including investigating all apps with access to Facebook data. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" Zuckerberg wrote in the post.\n\nWalden said his committee has already spoken to Facebook representatives, but he said there are still unanswered questions.\n\n\"Is this one incident the only one? Did it happen in prior campaigns? We've got to get to the bottom of it,\" he said, noting that as the founder, Zuckerberg knows \"everything about the company.\"\n\nHowever, Walden isn't necessarily championing tough regulation of Facebook and the industry.\n\n\"I'm into light-touch regulation, not heavy-handed government,\" he said. \"We want to look into it and say 'are America's laws keeping pace? Can it self-regulate? Is more needed?' I don't think we have the answer to that question yet, that's why we need to start at the top.\"\n\nFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg told \"Closing Bell\" on Thursday that the company was open to regulation.\n\n\"Mark [Zuckerberg] has said, 'It's not a question of if regulation, it's a question of what type,'\" Sandberg said.\n\n-- CNBC's Sara Salinas and Jillian D'Onfro contributed to this report.",

                "title": "Italy's ruling Democratic Party rules out alliance with other parties following inconclusive elections",
                "body": "With Italian politics still in a stalemate following elections in early March, one lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Party (PD) has ruled out the possibility of his party making alliances with its main rivals.\n\nThe country's parliament is convening for its first session since the March 4 elections on Friday. Lawmakers will be meeting to elect the speakers of the Senate and the Lower House and many market participants will be looking for clues on potential deals struck within the three main political blocs: the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), the center-right alliance, and the incumbent party Democratic Party (PD).\n\nAs none of the parties were able to achieve an absolute majority at the elections, the selection for the speakers could provide some clues as to what discussions have been going on behind closed doors.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, PD lawmaker Stefano Ceccanti ruled out any possible alliance with another party saying that \"the PD is not available to form a government with either the Lega or the Five Star Movement because they are against the EU. We are in favor of the European Union.\"\n\nEarlier this week the center-right alliance (formed of Lega, Forza Italia and the Brothers of Italy) invited other parties for preliminary discussions. PD and the Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, opted out of attending.\n\nThe Senate speaker of the house is elected through a voting process that requires a simple majority in a run-off ballot. As such, it is likely that the center-right candidate from Forza Italia, Paolo Romani, is elected due to the alliance gaining more voters than the Five Star Movement back on the March 4 vote.\n\nThis leaves the position of speaker of the Lower House. The voting process in that parliamentary chamber is less straightforward, requiring a two-thirds majority in the early stages of the vote before an absolute majority in the final stages of the vote.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, Ceccanti confirmed that the process will be more arduous saying \"I think the speaker of the Senate will be elected on Saturday, when the two most voted candidates will face each other. For the speaker of the lower chamber, it could take several days of the next week. Our parliament is divided into three minorities and it will be very difficult to find some sort of agreement between them. A government will be formed in April, if the president of the Republic indicates a solution.\"\n\nHe added that the PD party is planning on submitting blank votes.\n\nWith the Five Star Movement only garnering around 230 seats in the lower chamber, short of the 316 majority threshold, it is thus imperative that Di Maio finds partners during the process. According to Wolfango Piccoli, from analysis firm Teneo Intelligence, the Five Star leader faces a dilemma: partner up with Lega and risk alienating his own party due to conflicting platforms, or run the risk of holding multiple inconclusive voting rounds and not end up with a speaker in the House.\n\nThe tail-risk scenario remains one in which Lega and M5S form an alliance. However, Piccoli thinks this option remains unlikely: \"Despite some common ground, there are significant differences between them ... A deal would entail significant risks for both Di Maio and (Lega leader Matteo) Salvini, including possible defections and a loss of popularity.\"\n\nFurthermore, Di Maio from M5S has already professed his lack of support for Senate candidate Paolo Romani.\n\nOnce the speakers are selected, a consultation process with President Sergio Matarella can begin. One option, cited by Italian newspaper La Republicca, is where the main two parties Lega and M5S agree to allow for an interim technocratic government that would modify the electoral law and pass the budget, with the view to return to elections back in October.\n\nInvestors should have a better idea of each parties' various stances by early next week.",
