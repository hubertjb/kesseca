                "body": "U.S. and European officials said Saturday that President Trump is close to expelling 20 or more Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.\n\nThe move, which could prompt a new wave of retaliatory expulsions of U.S. diplomats in Russia, may come as early as Monday. But U.S. officials are still seeking clarity on how major European powers are responding to the nerve-agent attack, which critically injured a former spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the United States is considering a \"range of options to respond to Russia's outrageous actions in the UK, both to demonstrate our solidarity with our ally and to hold Russia accountable for its clear breach of international norms and agreements.\"\n\nShe declined to say what those options could be or when they might come into force.\n\nThe leaked proposal to expel Russian diplomats, first reported by CNN, raised questions about whether officials the U.S. government disclosed the pending action to force the president's hand in taking tough action against Moscow. The proposal was advanced by the president's advisers during meetings on Wednesday and Friday, the officials said.\n\n[What a brave Russian scientist told me about Novichok, the nerve agent identified in the spy attack]\n\nA senior European diplomat said the United States has been considering the expulsion of 20 or more Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain. The decision rests with the White House, the official said, but close allies have urged the Trump administration to take the symbolic but dramatic step as a signal that the assassination attempt was a test of Western resolve that must be answered, the diplomat said.\n\nOfficials, including two senior White House officials, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive decision that hasn't been finalized.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have pressed the White House to move more aggressively against Russia in wake of its alleged interference in the 2016 election. In August, lawmakers passed legislation limiting the president's ability to lift sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nSince coming to power, the Trump administration has taken forceful action against Moscow, closing its consulate in San Francisco and approving lethal aid to Ukraine in its battle with pro-Russian separatists, a move the Obama administration opposed.\n\nTrump, however, has refrained from criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin, including in a phone call last week after Russia's disputed presidential elections.\n\nIn advance of the call, the president's staff included a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE\" and recommending that he raise the poisoning of the former Russian spy. The president chose to congratulate Putin and did not raise the poisoning incident, U.S. officials confirmed.\n\nA number of European countries -- close to 20 -- are expected to expel Russian officials as well as take other measures as early as Monday. They include the Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as well as Sweden, Poland, Denmark, the Czech Republic, France and the Netherlands.\n\n\"It's a big test for the U.K., especially in the post-Brexit context, to see how many real allies they have,\" said a European official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nOn Saturday, White House spokesman Raj Shah said the United States \"stands firmly with the United Kingdom in condemning Russia's outrageous action. The President is always considering options to hold Russia accountable in response to its malign activities.\"\n\nCarol Morello and Anne Gearan contributed to this report.",

                "title": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump on trade, Islamic State, vets, Clinton",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump isn't always bringing genuine statistics to the fight as he goes after China on trade.\n\nTrump stretched credulity on a variety of subjects over the past week, trade among them. He mangled comments from 2016 presidential rival Hillary Clinton, inflated expectations of an overhaul in health services for veterans and gave his administration too much credit for defeating the Islamic State. Here's a look at some of his recent statements.\n\nTRUMP: \"Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China. We can't let that happen.\" -- comments at the White House on Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That didn't happen. Last year, Americans bought about $506 billion in goods from China. That's not \"lost\" money but purchases of products that Americans wanted. And it's only part of the equation. China bought more than $130 billion in goods from the U.S. So the actual trade deficit in goods was $375 billion.\n\nFactor in trade in services and the actual U.S trade deficit with China was $337 billion.\n\nTRUMP: \"On terrorism, in Iraq and Syria, we've taken back almost 100 percent, in a very short period of time, of the land that they took. And it all took place since our election. We've taken back close to 100 percent.\" -- National Republican Congressional Committee dinner Tuesday. Comments Friday: \"We've gotten just about 100 percent of our land back from ISIS.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: It's not true that progress against the Islamic State group \"all took place\" since the election. The Obama administration said IS had lost more than 40 percent of its territory by the time the last president left office.\n\nIS was pushed to the point of collapse in Mosul, its main Iraqi stronghold, before Trump took office. In 2016, Iraqi military forces, supported by the U.S.-led coalition, waged successful battles to oust IS from Fallujah, Ramadi, eastern Mosul and a number of smaller towns along the Tigris River. They also established logistical hubs for the push that began in February 2017 to retake western Mosul.\n\nIt's true that advances since then have decimated IS as a territorial force. Those advances came on many fronts from multiple foes of the Islamic State, including U.S.-backed Iraqi forces and fighters of Syrian President Bashar Assad, supported by Russia. The assertion that \"we've taken back close to 100 percent\" is only supportable if \"we\" means the various groups, often hostile to one another, that have been battling IS.\n\nTRUMP, on Clinton: \"I would say her last statement about women -- they have to get approval from their husbands, their sons, and their male bosses to vote for Trump. That was not a good statement. Not good.\" -- Republican dinner Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's not what she said. In remarks this month in India, Clinton advanced the theory that a slim majority of white women voted for Trump because of \"ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should.\" She did not say women felt they needed approval from men to vote for Trump -- but rather that they faced pressure from them to side with Trump instead of her.\n\nTRUMP: \"Republicans also repealed one of the nation's cruelest and most unfair taxes ever: the Obamacare individual mandate. And the mandate is gone forever. And that's a beauty. You pay a lot of money not to have to pay and not to get health care. So you're paying not to have health care. I mean, that wasn't so good. But we got rid of it.\" -- Republican dinner Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The mandate is not gone. Fines for going without health insurance coverage are still in effect this year. They disappear next year under the repeal law he signed.\n\nTRUMP on a marketing campaign against opioid abuse: \"That's the least expensive thing we can do, where you scare them from ending up like the people in the commercials. And we'll make them very, very bad commercials. We'll make them pretty unsavory situations.\" -- speech in New Hampshire on Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: This \"scared straight\" advertising was neither inexpensive nor particularly effective the last time it was tried and researched. There is some evidence, though, that anti-drug messages focused on teenagers' need for independence can help discourage drug use.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2004, the U.S. government spent nearly $1 billion on a national campaign to persuade young people to avoid illegal drugs, particularly marijuana. A 2008 follow-up study funded by the National Institutes of Health found the campaign \"had no favorable effects on youths' behavior\" and may actually have prompted some to experiment with drugs -- an unintended \"boomerang\" effect.\n\nTRUMP: \"Choice is coming. Choice -- where the veterans can actually, instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks, they can actually go and see a doctor and have it taken care of, and we pay. And that's going to be the big one.\" -- Republican dinner Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: A long-term plan along these lines doesn't appear to be coming any time soon. It's stalled in Congress and delays experienced in the program so far mean it won't be fully implemented until 2019 or later.\n\nA choice program was put in place after a 2014 wait-time scandal that was discovered at the Phoenix VA hospital and elsewhere throughout the country. It allows veterans to go to private doctors if they endure long waits for VA appointments. According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress' investigative arm, people using the program suffer wait times potentially as long as 81 days. Last summer, an unexpected budget shortfall in the program forced VA to limit outside referrals, leading to additional delays in medical care.\n\nVA Secretary David Shulkin said last month VA care is \"often 40 percent better in terms of wait times\" compared with the private sector.\n\nHe hoped a long-term overhaul would be approved by Congress in December, but proposals have stalled due to disagreements over cost and how much access veterans should have to private doctors.\n\nDEMOCRATIC SEN. PATTY MURRAY, questioning VA Secretary David Shulkin: \"I was really concerned to see your budget asks for a large decrease in the Office of Inspector General ... . I want to know why this budget doesn't provide the OIG with the full funding that they need.\" -- Senate hearing Wednesday on VA budget.\n\nSHULKIN: \"We are supportive of the role of the OIG as well. And in fact this budget actually does provide them the resources. ...They do have the staffing they need.\" -- Senate hearing Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Neither is entirely correct.\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed budget would provide $172 million to VA's internal watchdog office for the budget year beginning Oct. 1. That's technically an increase from the administration's $159 million budget level in 2018, but a decline from the office's actual spending of roughly $174 million due to increased demands to investigate problems at VA. The inspector general's office used leftover money from previous years to fill the gap, cash that is now largely gone.\n\nTo maintain current staffing levels, the IG's office is seeking $181 million for the next budget year, or $9 million above what the Trump administration is proposing. Without that money, it says it will have to cut the equivalent of 30 full-time staff positions, most of them directly involved with the IG's core criminal investigations, auditing and health inspections work.\n\nThe IG office, with about 850 full-time staff, is charged with keeping watch over the government's second largest department, whose 360,000 employees provide medical care and other benefits to 9 million military veterans. In recent months, the watchdog has put out blistering reports concluding that Shulkin violated ethics rules during an 11-day trip to Europe and that systemic leadership problems at VA put patients at risk. Shulkin is now being investigated over allegations that he used his security detail to run personal errands for him; he has denied wrongdoing.\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Perrone, Bradley Klapper and Christopher Rugaber in Washington and Carla K.

In Kuala Lumpur, darkness fell on the Petronas Towers.\n\nIt lasts for just an hour and its power is purely symbolic. But in countries around the world, at 8:30 p.m. local time, people were switching off the lights Saturday for Earth Hour, a global call for international unity on the importance of climate change.\n\nSince beginning in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour has spread to more than 180 countries, with tens of millions of people joining in, from turning off the porch lights to letting the Opera House go dark.\n\nThose 60 minutes are \"an opportunity to adopt a shifting of the consumption culture, and behavior change towards sustainability,\" Indian Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said in a statement.\n\nMany people, of course, barely notice. Around India Gate, New Delhi's monument to the Indian dead in World War I, thousands of people continued Saturday with the city's nightly warm-weather ritual. They bought ice cream and cheap plastic trinkets. They flirted. Young children rode in electric carts that their parents rented for a few minutes at a stretch.\n\nCOMBINATION PHOTO - In this two photo combination picture, the landmark India Gate monument is seen lit, top, and then the same location in darkness when the lights are turned out for one hour to mark Earth Hour, in New Delhi, India, Saturday, March 24, 2018.

                "body": "John Bolton. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nMany humans have reacted with alarm and terror at the notion that President Trump has named John Bolton as his national security adviser. They say that Bolton is dangerous. That he will suggest engaging the full military might of the United States in a questionable and potentially endless war as a remedy in situations where this does not even remotely make sense (cure for the hiccups, alternative to brunch, fun activity for a rainy Tuesday).\n\nTo them I say: Hissssssssss!\n\nI am not frightened. Nothing about John Bolton could possibly frighten me. Not his past positions. Not his current positions. Not even his mustache, although sometimes I think that it is moving on its own when I glimpse it out of the corner of my large compound eye.\n\nThere is nothing to be alarmed at in the notion of a national security adviser who advocated preemptive war with North Korea. Why not have a preemptive war with North Korea? What harm would it do?\n\nThe prospect of a security adviser plucked suddenly from a position of making alarming suggestions on the TV to a position of making alarming suggestions into the president's ear is soothing. The fact that Congress might not confirm him if they had any say in it is nothing -- when has Congress ever been right? Conventional wisdom is often wrong. Sometimes I will hear that there are good snacks available in an area and when I arrive the whole place is already swarming and all the good bites are gone.\n\nBolton has been described as being \"too competent\" by Joe Biden, on the grounds that his ideas are bad and he is able to implement them. I think he is just competent enough. It is good that he understands the system to a point that he can get his agenda through. And that agenda is my agenda!\n\nBesides, Joe Biden killed my brother in a motel.\n\nI just don't see any way that this can go wrong. There may be a risk of a fiery, devastating conflict, but what is there to be startled by in that? We are safe here. I am coated with a protective layer of wax.\n\nKnowing that Bolton is at the helm fills me with a warm sense of general well-being. He is going to provide the president a wide array of options: war (with Iran), war (with North Korea), war (spread diffusely throughout the land). The thought that he will be there to help guide Donald Trump and shape his impulses is a relaxing one. It makes my mouth parts twist into something like a smile. He just clicks in this Cabinet, as I do, sometimes, in the cabinet beneath which I reside.\n\nIt is time, I think, that we had more hawks. What is the worst that can happen? Nothing, really. Certainly nothing that will affect me. I hear you saying, \"If the worst happens, you will miss your supply of skin flakes, bread and paper!\" and I certainly will, but I can survive on bits of leather, dead insects and that tasty starch in book bindings. Mm, starch. Mm, cellulose just in general.\n\nWhen I look at the team the president has assembled around him, I rest calmly on my sturdy legs, at least until someone turns on a light and causes me to scuttle back into the wainscoting.\n\nEstablishment types would tell you that they are scared. That Vladimir Putin should be scared. That human beings alive on the Earth should be scared. That anyone who lacks a strong exoskeleton should be scared. Well, I am not scared.\n\nBut then again, I am a cockroach.",

                "title": "Lights dim on Bangkok's nightlife as military tries to salvage legacy",
                "body": "BANGKOK -- Thailand's military government is crushing the spirit of Bangkok's nightlife amid an intensifying crackdown that is forcing many bars and clubs to close early or indefinitely. With an election tentatively set for February 2019, the campaign appears to be a last-ditch attempt by the embattled government to impose social order and salvage its legacy.\n\nSince the army swept to power in a bloodless coup in 2014, it has intermittently enforced curfews and arcane regulations to rein in the city's rambunctious nature, but in the past year its efforts appear to have gained vigor.\n\nBar owners say military officials are barging into their premises demanding to see licenses they have long operated without or didn't even know existed. In the raucous coastal city of Pattaya recently, expats and tourists were incredulous when authorities went into bars asking to see a license for those with dartboards.\n\nThe government maintains it is simply enforcing regulations that existed long before it came to power. Officially, all bars and clubs must close by 2 a.m., according to 2004 regulations, a rule long ignored by police -- often in return for bribes.\n\nThe crackdown has had the biggest impact on after-hours venues and fledgling businesses already grappling with high taxes on imported food and alcohol.\n\nAs part of a broad campaign to beautify Bangkok, Thailand's government is cracking down on street vendors. Thousands have been evicted or relocated since 2014, raising questions about what the city will look like without its famously chaotic streets. (Maher Sattar/for The Washington Post)\n\n[A self-described sex expert says she will spill information on Trump and Russia to get out of a Thai jail]\n\nLast year, Dark Bar, a bastion of underground music in Bangkok, was forced to close after authorities imposed a midnight curfew, and Swing, which got going after 4 a.m., closed after drug raids.\n\nWong's Place, a rickety old drinking den where revelers can smoke inside and drink till dawn, was recently ordered to start closing at 2 a.m.\n\n\"It is the first time in 40 years something like this has happened,\" said bar owner Sam Wong, referring to the closing time and to a recent raid by army officers to check whether he has a license to play music.\n\nWong, who would leverage his ties with local police for leeway on the rules, says the military isn't budging.\n\nAnders Svensson, a DJ and founder of an electronic music events company called 52Hz Bangkok, said the military's campaign risks putting the brakes on a thriving underground music scene.\n\n[Limited booze, no strip clubs: The party is on hold in Thailand after the king's death.]\n\n\"Bangkok has become a much less spontaneous city, and in many ways a more boring city than it was five years ago,\" he said.\n\nDeputy government spokesman Werachon Sukondhapatipak said the military set itself the task of forcing businesses to comply with the law and holding Thailand's youth to higher moral standards.\n\nHe said disorderly young Thais, staying out late, had provoked the new measures.\n\nA palpable cleanup of the city began after the death of Thailand's revered monarch Bhumibol Adulyadej in October 2016, with street activity subdued in the year of mourning that followed.\n\nIn many bustling tourist spots, street-food sellers were moved from main roads into side streets or to new parts of the city, and many roadside alcohol sellers who would appear after midnight also disappeared. The government said the moves are to create a cleaner city.\n\nYet a campaign to hem in Thailand's freewheeling society is nothing new. Fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, loathed by the military and ultraconservative political establishment, launched a similar offensive in the early 2000s, setting bar and club closing times at 2 a.m. and attempting to curb underage drinking.\n\n\"The difference is that you could push back against Thaksin's social order without fear of military repression,\" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.\n\n[Photos from the 'Running of the Brides' race in Thailand]\n\nBut the military appears in no mood to back down as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha seemingly makes a tacit bid to remain prime minister after the election.\n\nUpon seizing power, the military boasted it would cure the recklessness and rot it claims had infested the Shinawatra governments.\n\nBut with the former prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, out of the political picture after she was sentenced in absentia last year for negligence over her government's loss-ridden rice subsidy program, the military has lost its primary justification for holding onto power.\n\nFrustrated civilians are still waiting for an election they were promised would take place in 2015.\n\nAccording to nationwide polls by the Bangkok University Research Center, the government's popularity has declined from an approval rating of 62 percent after its first six months in office to 56 percent in February this year.\n\n\"The military government is on the back foot because its three main coup aims are unfulfilled. National reconciliation after a decade of conflict remains elusive, political reform and the new constitution are crooked and biased toward military interests, and graft remains widespread, including the generals' own undertakings,\" Thitinan said.\n\nThe government has also faced a barrage of criticism over its suppression of free speech, its plans to buy expensive submarines from China, and most recently its handling of a scandal involving Deputy Prime Minister General Prawit Wongsuwan and his supposed vast collection of undeclared luxury watches.\n\nMaking a show of imposing social order, by moving against bars, is simply a distraction, political analysts say.\n\n\"They haven't addressed the underlying issues, they've merely tidied up,\" said David Streckfuss, author of \"Truth on Trial in Thailand: Defamation, Treason, and Lèse-Majesté\".\n\nBar owners say they are losing tourists to cheaper destinations such as Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nJenjira Prasertsin, owner of the Madrid bar in Patpong, Bangkok's original red-light district, said she's keen for regulations to be imposed but businesses need time to adjust.\n\nUntil then, the city's spirit is too defiant to be snuffed out just yet.\n\n\"People still party, just it happens increasingly behind closed doors,\" Svensson said.\n\nRead more:\n\nToday's coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",

                "body": "In a quest to be the record holder for the world's tallest waterslide, investigators say, Schlitterbahn Waterpark of Kansas City rushed to build a dangerous and structurally complicated ride, ignored glaring safety red flags and replaced mathematical calculations with \"crude trial-and-error methods.\"\n\nThe string of negligence, according to a recently unsealed indictment, resulted in the 2016 death of a 10-year-old boy and more than a dozen injuries. Caleb Schwab, son Kansas state Rep. Scott Schwab, was decapitated while riding the nearly 170-foot-tall Verrückt, a German word that means \"crazy\" or \"insane.\" On Friday, a year and a half after the boy's death, the Kansas Attorney General's Office announced criminal charges against the company and one of its former employees.\n\nSchlitterbahn and Tyler Austin Miles, former director of operations, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter and several counts of aggravated battery, aggravated endangering a child and interference with law enforcement. Investigators say the company knew the waterslide was unsafe and could result in injuries and deaths, but still rushed to open it to the public. Perhaps more disturbing is the allegation that several injuries, from neck pain to concussion, had already occurred before Caleb's death. Still, investigators allege, Schlitterbahn and Miles kept the ride open to the public -- and even hid reports of those injuries and other alarming safety problems from law-enforcement officers who were investigating the boy's death.\n\nSpokeswoman Winter Prosapio denied that the company and Miles withheld or altered evidence. Caleb's death, she said, was the result of an accident and not of a crime.\n\n\"The indictment uses quoted statements from a reality TV show that was scripted for dramatic effect that in no way reflects the design and construction of the ride,\" Prosapio said. \"The safety of our Schlitterbahn guests and employees has been at the forefront of our culture throughout our 40 years of operation. Many of us rode Verrückt regularly, as did our children and grandchildren.\n\n[ Family of 10-year-old boy killed in horrific water slide accident settles with park's owner ]\n\n\"We have faith in the justice system and are confident that when we finally have an opportunity to defend ourselves, it will be clear that this was an accident. We stand by our team and will fight these charges,\" she added.\n\nMiles's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday, but Prosapio said Miles, who left the company in September, \"demonstrated the highest dedication to safety, from the training of our lifeguards and ride operators, to ensuring all rides have operated in accordance with our strict protocols.\"\n\nTyler Austin Miles. (Wyandotte County Detention Center via AP)\n\nThe 47-page indictment, which details evidence obtained from emails, memos, blueprints, videos, photos and eyewitness accounts, paints a starkly different -- and disturbing -- image of a company that disregarded people's safety, all in the pursuit of breaking a world record.\n\nThe Verrückt, a hybrid roller-coaster and waterslide ride, was the brainchild of Jeff Henry, who co-owns the company with his siblings. Investigators say Henry decided to build the ride in a \"spur-of-the-moment bid to impress producers of Travel Channel's Xtreme Waterparks series.\" He and a longtime friend and business partner, John Schooley, were in charge of designing the ride and making the necessary calculations, even though neither of them had any credentials in mathematics, physics or engineering, the indictment says.\n\nThe entire slide is covered with a net suspended by metal hoops. The ride begins with a nearly vertical drop. Rafts carrying riders then ascend about 50 feet above the ground. But instead of sliding back down, the rafts go airborne -- a major design flaw that investigators say the company had known about, tried to fix unsuccessfully, and eventually ignored.\n\nFrom the ride's grand opening on July 10, 2014, to Caleb's death on Aug. 7, 2016, 13 people were injured largely because the rafts went airborne, causing some riders to hit the net and the suspended metal hoops enclosing the slide. Investigators say Caleb was decapitated after the raft collided with the hoops. Two women suffered bone fractures and laceration that day.\n\n\"The presence of the overhead netting and support hoops speaks volumes about the designers' extreme disregard for the value of human life,\" the indictment says, adding that it violates American Society for Testing and Materials' rules prohibiting any obstruction in the riders' path.\n\n\"Henry and Schooley did the opposite; they installed metal bars directly across the known flight path,\" the indictment says.\n\n[ 'Insane' tragedy: Kansas boy dies on world's tallest waterslide ]\n\nThe indictment also cites comments from Henry suggesting he was well aware of the ride's dangers.\n\n[Verrückt] could hurt me, it could kill me, it is a seriously dangerous piece of equipment today because there are things that we don't know about it,\" Henry said, according to the indictment. \"Every day we learn more. I've seen what this one has done to the crash dummies and to the boats we sent down it ... It's complex, it's fast, it's mean. If we mess up, it could be the end. I could die going down this ride.\"\n\nStill, investigators say, Henry pushed for the entire project -- from design, construction and testing -- to be done in just seven months. For a ride as ambitious as Verrückt, a team of engineers would've needed three to six months just to create a prototype. But investigators say engineers were never directly involved, and Henry and his team completed a prototype within 36 days.\n\nInvestigators also say Henry and Schooley hired an engineering firm to conduct tests a week before grand opening. But the test results, which showed that rafts carrying a weight of 400 to 550 pounds would likely go airborne, were likely ignored.\n\nDesigners also had initially agreed to impose an age limit of 14, but that restriction was thrown out the window on the eve of the grand opening, investigators say.\n\nSchlitterbahn is a family-owned company based in New Braunfels, Tex. It has locations in three other Texas cities, as well as Kansas City, Kan. In 2014, Guinness World Records named Verrückt the tallest waterslide.\n\nMiles turned himself in to the Wyandotte County Sheriff's Office on Friday. He was released on the same day after posting a $50,000 bond, the Kansas City Star reported. The newspaper reported last year that Caleb's family had reached a settlement with Schlitterbahn, though the terms were not disclosed.\n\nRead more:\n\nAustin bombing suspect Mark Conditt dies after blowing himself up as officers approached, police say\n\nSurveillance footage, cellphone data led to takedown of Austin bomber, officials say\n\nHe was known as Malaysia's 'snake whisperer' -- until a cobra fatally bit him",

Turkish and Syrian opposition flags were flying in the area.\n\nCivilians, including women and children, were out and about in central Afrin.

                "body": "Shane Gersich meets General Manager Brian MacLellan after being drafted in the fifth round by the Washington Capitals at the 2014 NHL draft. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\n\nMONTREAL -- Just two days ago, Shane Gersich was in a classroom on the University of North Dakota campus. On Saturday, he was on the ice with Alex Ovechkin at the Bell Center.\n\n\"It was crazy,\" Gersich said. \"It's a dream come true, that's for sure. I know it was just morning skate, but it was really cool.\"\n\nThe Washington Capitals signed Gersich, their 2014 fifth-round pick, to a two-year entry-level contract worth $925,000 on Friday morning. He was at dinner with his new teammates by Friday night, and on Saturday, he joined them for a morning skate before a game against the Montreal Canadiens. Gersich played three years at North Dakota, scoring 13 goals with 16 assists in 40 games this past campaign, and to help him transition from the college level to the professional one, the Capitals want him around the team now to learn from their veterans. As for if or when he'll make his NHL debut, that might have to wait until Washington officially clinches a playoff berth, though there are just eight games left in the regular season.\n\n[ Capitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov returns to the lineup after missing three games with injury ]\n\n\"Anybody coming from college, you want them to be around good pros,\" Coach Barry Trotz said. \"It's a real important time of the year for us, and I think he's going to be a real important prospect for us. Just to watch and learn, he gets to come to some pretty outstanding buildings right off the bat here in Montreal and then going to [Madison Square Garden on Monday]. I think just getting over the excitement, but also giving him a little bit of foreshadow of where we want to see him be. And we'll go through systematically of what we're doing. ...\n\n\"My first priority is, 'Let's get in the playoffs.' And then I'll have a better chance to answer [if he'll play] when we get an 'x' or an 'o' -- whatever they put beside your name in the standings. Then we'll decide where he's at.\"\n\nWith a deep, talented team the past few years that won back-to-back regular-season titles, the Capitals have had very few prospects go straight to the NHL level, draftees typically having to bide their time in the American Hockey League first. But Washington has had four rookies in its lineup for the majority of the season, and Gersich's addition helps the team's forward depth down the stretch. His speed could be an asset, especially as the Capitals have occasionally struggled against quick teams in past postseasons. Gersich said being able to join the big club right away is why he signed now rather than returning to school for another year.\n\n\"Obviously, you give it a little bit of thought and you weigh your options,\" Gersich said. \"But at the end of the day, I wanted to be a pro hockey player -- that was my dream when I went to North Dakota -- so I thought I'd take that opportunity.\"\n\n\"Even looking out there today, first day for him skating with us, he looked like he was at home on the ice,\" forward T.J. Oshie said.\n\n[ NHL players are finishing their degrees -- despite the homework and parking tickets ]\n\nGersich has a built-in mentor in Oshie, who played three seasons at North Dakota before turning pro 10 years ago. He invited Gersich to dinner on Friday night, mindful that his hardest part of the transition from college hockey to the NHL was off the ice rather than on it.\n\n\"When you're in school, I don't know how all of the other schools operate, but at North Dakota, you're with the guys night and day,\" Oshie said. \"And it's usually not one or two of them -- you're with five, 10, 12 guys eating every meal. I think they eat almost every meal together. So, except when you're on the road, when you're at home [in the NHL], a lot of guys are older, a lot of guys have families, a lot of guys have a lot of things they have to do away from the rink. When you're a young guy coming from college, that was the biggest shock to me, that you have so much downtime, so much time where you're either to yourself or you're just with one younger guy, and you've got to find things to do to fill that time.\n\n\"That's where becoming a good pro comes in, taking care of your body and eating right -- doing all of that stuff away from the rink that in college, it's all kind of handed to you. The food is right there. I mean, when you get older, you have your house, but you're not making the best meals. Usually for me, it was throwing a pizza in the oven or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or something like that. ... I had so many influential people to me when I was a young guy, and I'm happy and I'm excited to be in that other role where I can try to pass down some knowledge and take him under my wing a little and show him what it's like or how you should carry yourself, when to have fun, when to be serious. For me, it makes it that much more special having him come from North Dakota.\"\n\nMore on the Capitals:\n\nAlex Ovechkin, John Carlson are finishing off stellar seasons.

The archdiocese of Newark said Friday that officials \"continue to believe that the law is unjust\" but will not appeal the ruling by Monday's deadline.\n\nThe law stemmed from a 2013 expansion of the archdiocese's inscription rights program, the proceeds of which were used to care for cemeteries. Under the program, the church offered the option for a headstone but retained ownership of it in perpetuity. The idea was that a bereaved family could write an inscription on a headstone but the church would care for the headstone going forward.\n\nThe Monument Builders Association of New Jersey sued, arguing the church had an unfair advantage due to its tax-exempt status and relationship with parishioners. The group lost in court, but the state's Democrat-led Legislature then enacted legislation, signed by Republican Gov. Chris Christie in 2015, that effectively outlawed the practice.\n\nShipp wrote that the archdiocese hadn't demonstrated a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, part of the 14th Amendment, and the state had a legitimate interest in protecting consumers \"who must venture into the potentially exploitative market for funeral services.\"\n\nThe Virginia-based Institute for Justice, which represented the archdiocese, said headstone sales don't raise \"valid consumer protection concerns\" and the law is really intended to protect \"the private financial interests of the headstone and funeral director industries.\" The archdiocese said in a statement that the law \"punishes both the church for seeking to exercise its ministry to parishioners, and parishioners for seeking to exercise their freedom of choice to select a memorial provider.\"\n\nBut the archdiocese said it was ceasing efforts to challenge the law after evaluating the matter \"including the time and energy required to seek an ultimate resolution of the issue through a lengthy appeal process.\" More than 800 parishioners who already purchased inscription rights for monuments within archdiocese cemeteries are unaffected by the decision and \"Catholic cemeteries of the archdiocese will honor those commitments at their proper time,\" officials said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Analysis | The opening act was tumultuous. Phase two of Trump's presidency could be even more so",
                "body": "Phase one of the Trump presidency is ending. However unpredictable and unnerving it has been, the coming phase could be even more so.\n\nThe opening phase came to a close in a week in which the president displayed the same characteristics that got him to the White House in the first place: a reliance on gut and guile, disregard for the experts and a flair for the dramatic. Expect more of the same, perhaps much more.\n\nTrump seemingly has decided to fly solo. Advice may come his way, but at this point, after 14 months in charge of the White House, he is making clear that he will operate independently. He is surrounding himself with advisers more likely to reinforce his own instincts rather than those who would attempt to nudge him gently in directions he prefers not to go. He will still bend at times, but will feel freer to trust himself more than others.\n\nThe opening phase of the administration began in the days after Trump won the election, with a transition that went off the rails almost immediately, one that resulted in a series of personnel and organizational decisions that plagued the new administration and that, in retrospect, clearly left the president feeling uncomfortable. The events of the past week, coming after an unprecedented series of personnel changes and policy fits and starts, underscored Trump's apparent determination to bust out of all that.\n\nThe week brought the abrupt (though not unexpected) removal of national security adviser H.R. McMaster, replaced by John Bolton, the hawkish former ambassador to the United Nations. Following the humiliating firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the elevation of CIA Director Mike Pompeo to the State Department, the changes could fundamentally change the character of Trump's national security team at a time of momentous decisions looming on North Korea and Iran.\n\nTrump, with Vice President Pence by his side, speaks to the media on Friday at the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n[Bolton is an experienced operator in the \"swamp\"]\n\nThe week saw the imposition of new tariffs on $60 billion in Chinese-made goods, along with tariffs on steel and aluminum from other countries. The actions sparked fears of a new trade war, which contributed to the Dow Jones industrial average declining by more than 1,100 points in two days.\n\nFor all the talk of Trump as a politician with no fixed ideology and no coherent views on issues, the one constant has been his insistence that the United States has been snookered on one trade deal after another and his resolve to take action.\n\nProtectionists inside his administration have risen, and the loudest voice in opposition, Gary Cohn, is heading back to New York. Cohn will be replaced by CNBC's Larry Kudlow, who also opposed the tariffs. Whether he pushes to temper the policy remains an open question.\n\nThere was also the departure of John Dowd, the lawyer leading the team dealing Russia investigation headed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and the apparent hiring of former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova. As telling, however, was the decision by Theodore Olsen, the former solicitor general, not to join up as part of the president's defense team.\n\nAll of this came during as, for the first time, Trump went after Mueller by name, an escalation in tactics that illustrated anew the president's efforts to discredit whatever findings emerge, or perhaps to try to fire Mueller outright, despite claims by those around the president that no such thing is under consideration. But how reliable are such assurances, given the way the president suddenly shifts directions.\n\n[Was the spending bill the last act of Congress this year?]\n\nTrump walks across the South Lawn to board a Marine helicopter as he departs Washington on Friday to spend the weekend in Florida. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nJust before Trump flew off to his Florida estate for the weekend, he put everyone through one more roller coaster moment by tweeting on Friday morning that he was considering a veto of the just-passed $1.3 trillion spending bill. The bill is something of a mess, as its congressional critics voiced during the debate before passage, but White House advisers were involved in the negotiations that produced it.\n\nThe president's threats generated a fire alarm among his advisers until the president relented. Hours after his tweet, he announced that he would sign the measure, but with dismissive words about the process and the package and a declaration that he would never again sign such a bill. It should be noted that such threats from the president often prove empty.\n\nAll of it adds up to a president cutting the cord, freeing himself from the constraints that were built up around him. He will run the White House as he wishes. He will populate his inner circle as he sees fit. He will act like a loyal Republican when he sees his own self-interest involved but will walk away from congressional Republicans when that serves his interests and his politics. He hasn't managed to drain the swamp -- far from it. But he will continue to take actions that signal to his supporters he's still determined to do so.\n\nThe coming phase of Trump's presidency will last through the November elections. Between then and now, Congress will take no significant action, or so go the predictions. The 115th Congress, with Republican majorities in both chambers, has produced two budget-busting pieces of legislation, a huge tax cut and now a $1.3 trillion spending measure. The party of fiscal discipline has been shown to have no clothes.\n\nFor the near-term, the president has a foreign policy agenda of enormous consequence. He has expressed his willingness to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, perhaps in May, although the virtual silence from North Korea since Trump unexpectedly said he would take such a meeting, leaves in doubt exactly when or if such a gathering will occur.\n\nIn that same time frame, the president will be asked once again to decide whether to certify Iran's compliance with the nuclear agreement negotiated by the Obama administration or pull out of the deal. The president's views are known -- he thinks it's a terrible agreement -- but he was prevented from acting on that by the combined pressure of Tillerson, McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Bolton and Pompeo will not offer that kind of resistance.\n\nPotentially as momentous will be the product of the Mueller team. No one knows the timetable under which the lawyers are working, so to suggest that everything will be wrapped up before the elections is to pretend to know the unknowable. Trump's lawyers have been negotiating with Mueller over the terms of an interview with the president, an event of high drama and potentially grave consequences for Trump.\n\nAnd then there are the various lawsuits from adult film star Stormy Daniels, former Playboy model Karen McDougal -- both of whom have said they had affairs with Trump a decade ago -- and Summer Zervos, a contestant on \"The Apprentice\" who accuses him of sexual misconduct while he was on the reality TV show. All are suing for the right to tell their stories. They present threats of another type that will play out in the months ahead.\n\nThere is no New Trump emerging here as this next phase begins to unfold. If anything, it is the reemergence of the old Trump, the pre-presidential Trump, who plays by his own rules and tries to rewrite the old ones he doesn't like. This is what made him rich as a business executive and won him the White House. Will history repeat, or will his instincts prove faulty in the environment in which he now operates?",

(Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle, via AP)\n\nThe woman that recorded the last moments of Danny Ray Thomas's life thought it would end differently.\n\n\"He about to get Tased,\" a woman says in the video, laughing. A police SUV's lights flash near an apparent altercation involving Thomas and another man on a Houston street.\n\nThomas is in white, his pants around his ankles. He heads to the right of the camera frame, and the Harris County sheriff's deputy comes into view. His gun is drawn. the deputy backpedals. A passing truck obscures the picture for a moment.\n\nThen, the gunshot comes, a single round that pierces Thomas's chest.\n\nThe woman behind the camera is not laughing any longer. Her video is a chaotic, tumbling stream of images as she tries to regain composure. \"Why he shot him? Why he shot that man?\" she shrieks. The woman eventually reframes the scene, with the deputy crouching over Thomas. He was pronounced dead at Houston Northwest Medical Center, authorities said.\n\n#BREAKING Video obtained by the @HoustonChron shows the death of Danny Ray Thomas after he was shot by a Harris County deputy Thursday. No weapon was recovered at the scene, officials said. #hounews #breakingnews\n\nWatch the full video: https://t.co/wqh4BKPRZo pic.twitter.com/jdoj0gc3hv -- Robert Downen (@RobDownenChron)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nAuthorities indicated Thomas, a 34 year-old black man, had \"some object\" in his hand, but Harris County Sheriff's Office spokesman Jason Spencer told the Houston Chronicle \"we have not recovered a weapon at this point.\" It's not clear from the video if Thomas has anything in his hands.\n\nHe does not appear to raise his arms in a manner that would appear threatening before the passing truck blocks the camera's view. About three seconds pass between the truck obscuring the frame and the gunshot ringing out.\n\nMarketa Thomas, the victim's sister, told reporters Thursday that they both struggled with mental illness and relied on each together, saying there is \"no justification\" for the deputy involved.\n\n\"Knowing that he was okay when I woke up every day made me fine,\" she told reporters at the scene, according to a Chronicle video. \"And knowing that my brother is no longer here -- you think I'm going to be fine? I'm not going to be fine. That's my brother.\"\n\nThomas spoke through tears. \"That's my flesh and my blood. ... He had my back through everything. And he promised me he wouldn't leave me, and he didn't leave me. Somebody took him from me.\"\n\n[ 'Our city is hurting': Protesters swarm downtown Sacramento following deadly police shooting ]\n\nFamily members said Thomas has been hit hard by the deaths of his two children, who were allegedly drowned in a home bathtub by their mother, Sheborah Thomas in 2016, when they were 5 and 7 years old. She is awaiting trial for capital murder, the Chronicle reported.\n\nTensions flared at a nearby gas station where media and members of the public gathered, including apparent witnesses who said Thomas appeared compliant. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez met the crowd face to face after the incident.\n\n\"But he threw his hands up,\" a woman asked, in a moment captured by CBS affiliate KHOU. \"But what if he threw his hands up?\"\n\nGonzalez rebuffed the assertion. \"We don't know that. That's why we're out here to investigate. We'll get to the bottom of it,\" Gonzalez told the crowd of mostly black citizens.\n\nThursday's killing occurred in the jurisdiction of the Houston Police Department, which will take the lead in the investigation. The sheriff's office and Harris County District Attorney will also conduct probes.\n\nAuthorities released a brief summary of the incident on Friday.\n\n\"According to witnesses, Thomas was walking in the middle of the intersection of Imperial Valley and Greens Rd. with his pants around his ankles, talking to himself and hitting vehicles as they passed by,\" the Houston Police Department said in a statement. Thomas struck a white vehicle, and a physical altercation ensued. A passing deputy stopped to disrupt the disturbance, the police said.\n\n\"The deputy gave Thomas verbal commands to stop, which he ignored and continued to advance toward the deputy. Fearing for his safety, the deputy discharged his duty weapon, striking Thomas once in the chest,\" the department stated.\n\n[ The Post's 2018 database of officer-involved killings ]\n\n\"Obviously they're someone's loved one. These situations are always difficult and so the main thing we can do is to make sure that we get the facts and that we're thorough and transparent,\" Gonzalez told reporters at the scene Thursday.\n\nThe shooting serves as a \"a reminder of how things could escalate in these situations,\" Gonzalez added. \"Our deputies work in a very difficult environment where they have to make split-second decisions to protect their lives as well.\"\n\nHouston officer Kim Jones at the department's crime center told The Washington Post on Saturday there was no information on whether the deputy was carrying a Taser or other less-than-lethal weapons. The sheriff's office did not immediately answer an inquiry requesting information on the typical configuration of less-than-lethal weapons for deputies on patrol.\n\nThe Houston killing occurred just days after two Sacramento police officers shot and killed Stephon Clark in his own backyard after a foot pursuit on Sunday night. The police believed Clark raised a gun at them. Only a white iPhone was found near his body. He died at the scene after the officers shot 20 rounds at him.\n\nThat incident sparked waves of protests in the following days, with chants of \"Phones up, don't shoot\" -- a reference to the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. He was also unarmed when he was killed by police.\n\nAn analysis by The Washington Post found that 987 people were killed by police last year -- 68 of them unarmed. Of those unarmed victims, 30 were white, 20 were black and 13 were Hispanic, showing an overrepresentation of African Americans compared to their percentage of the U.S. population. Five of the remaining fatalities were of unknown or other race.\n\nAt least 230 people have been killed by police this year, according to The Post's database on fatal force.\n\nRead more:\n\nOfficer charged with murder in shooting death of unarmed woman in Minneapolis alley\n\nAmerican family of four found dead while on vacation in Mexico, police say",

                "body": "As they've stepped out of the hallways of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and into the national spotlight, the Parkland, Fla., teenagers have become Twitter influencers, TV news show mainstays and the stoic-faced subjects of a Time magazine cover.\n\nBut they've also increasingly become targets: Their most prominent critics are people who see them less as survivors of a tragedy and more as pawns in a larger effort to influence gun policy.\n\nThe latest attack came from Colion Noir, a host on NRA TV who took to the airwaves on the eve of the Parkland teens-led March on Washington, telling them: \"No one would know your names\" if a student gunman hadn't stormed into their school and killed three staff members and 14 students.\n\n\"To all the kids from Parkland getting ready to use your First Amendment to attack everyone else's Second Amendment at your march on Saturday, I wish a hero like Blaine Gaskill had been at Marjory Douglas High School last month because your classmates would still be alive and no one would know your names, because the media would have completely and utterly ignored your story, the way they ignored his,\" Noir said.\n\n[ School resource officer Blaine Gaskill rushed to stop gunman at Maryland high school ]\n\nColion Noir is a pseudonym for Collins Iyare Idehen Jr., a lawyer and gun rights activist from Houston who has nearly 650,000 subscribers on YouTube. The man he references, St. Mary's County Sheriff's Deputy Blaine Gaskill, is the 34-year-old SWAT-trained officer who engaged a teenager who opened fire at Great Mills High School in Southern Maryland. Noir and others have said Gaskill's intervention illustrates that the solution to school gun violence is more \"good guys with guns.\"\n\nNoir did not return messages from The Washington Post seeking comment.\n\nNoir is the latest of a growing number of people who've criticized the teens. An aide to a Florida legislator was fired after he called the school shooting survivors crisis actors who travel from tragic place to tragic place making impassioned but bogus political pleas to take away gun rights. Donald Trump Jr. liked a tweet saying one of the most vocal students had been coached by his FBI-agent father to peddle \"anti-Trump rhetoric and anti-gun legislation.\"\n\nAlex Wind, left, and Emma González, of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, speak with Dan Rather. (Larry French/Getty Images/SiriusXM)\n\nAnd several people have criticized the teens for smiling on the set of CBS's morning news show, saying the students were \"posing for the photos like they are partying rock stars.\"\n\nBut Noir accuses the teens of being downright un-American in creating a march he says is designed to promote stripping others of their Second Amendment rights.\n\n[ Live coverage: March for Our Lives ]\n\n\"They're running Season 5 of their gun-control reality show, featuring the freshest cast of characters yet in their modern march on Washington -- except this time for less freedom,\" he said. \"These kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structure.\"\n\nIn the video, he also inaccurately claims that American media has ignored Gaskill's hero story, and other stories that run counter to the gun-control narrative.\n\nGaskill's story has been featured on several mainstream media outlets. CNN called it \"an example of what a school resource officer is supposed to do in such a circumstance.\" The New York Post ran a story with the headline \"This is the officer who stopped the Maryland school shooter.\"\n\nAs The Post's Steve Hendrix and Theresa Vargas reported:\n\nIn any case, Gaskill's rapid response was hailed for short-circuiting the attack before it became another school massacre. St. Mary's County Sheriff Timothy K. Cameron said there was \"no question\" that the officer's quick arrival at the scene and immediate engagement with the shooter had prevented more injuries. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) praised Gaskill as \"a tough guy\" and promised to push for a $125 million package that includes more funding for school resource officers.\n\nProponents of increased school security immediately embraced Gaskill as a real-world example of what a well-trained \"good guy with a gun\" can do when a school is under fire. Many contrasted Gaskill's actions with those of the uniformed resource officer shown on videotape waiting outside Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during a February shooting that left 17 people dead.\n\nThe Parkland activists haven't responded to Noir's comments directly, though they have gone on the offensive against people who've peddled conspiracy theories and otherwise tried to discredit them.\n\n\"I just think it's a testament to the sick immaturity and broken state of our government when these people feel the need to peddle conspiracy theories about people that were in a school shooting where 17 people died, and it just makes me sick,\" David Hogg told BuzzFeed News. \"It's immature, rude and inhuman for these people to destroy the people trying to prevent the death of the future of America because they won't.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nActivists call for tech companies to drop NRA's digital TV channel\n\n'Grannies for gun control': These grandmothers are taking to the streets for the March for Our Lives\n\nA mom's tweet connected D.C. families with students who need a place to stay during March for Our Lives\n\n'March for Our Lives' gun-control rally bumped from Mall by 'talent show'\n\nMarch for Our Lives gets permits for anti-gun-violence rally along D.C. streets, parks",

This time, it's his left knee.\n\nCurry came back and scored 29 points before spraining his knee in the second half, and the banged-up, undermanned Golden State Warriors held off the Atlanta Hawks 106-94 on Friday night.\n\nCurry sprained his medial collateral ligament and was scheduled for an MRI on Saturday, the Warriors said.\n\n\"Kind of a strange, cruel twist of fate,\" coach Steve Kerr said. \"He rehabs his ankle for the last couple weeks, he gets that strong and then the knee goes. So we'll see what happens and we'll keep our fingers crossed.\"\n\nCurry grimaced as he hopped around and made it to the bench on a tender left side with 3:09 left in the third quarter after JaVale McGee fell over and the center's right elbow appeared to pound into Curry's left knee.\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30) dribbles against Atlanta Hawks guard Dennis Schroeder during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Oakland, Calif., Friday, March 23, 2018. (Jeff Chiu/Associated Press)\n\n\"I was just trying to block a shot and I ran into him,\" McGee said.\n\nThe two-time MVP immediately sat in a chair and put his head down before going into the locker room.\n\nNick Young scored 24 points with six 3-pointers for the defending champions, who were already missing their other All-Stars -- Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.\n\n\"Getting close to postseason, you don't want to see nothing like that,\" Young said.\n\nYoung, Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell and Zaza Pachulia joined Curry in the starting lineup. Pachulia had nine rebounds, while Bell scored 12 points.\n\nMcCaw went down hard and headed to the locker room at the 10:24 mark of the first quarter. He returned to start the second, playing with a bruised lower back. Young went to the locker room late in the first half with a right knee injury but was OK.\n\nCurry overcame a slow start in his return, shooting 10 for 18. He had rolled the ankle at Atlanta on March 2 but initially kept playing before re-injuring it again.\n\nThe Warriors have dealt with a rash of injuries to all their superstars.\n\n\"It's a little somber in there. Everybody feels for Steph,\" Kerr said. \"He's in good spirits. I did talk to him. He's disappointed. That's part of it.\"\n\nCurry began 1 for 6 and missed his first four 3s before connecting 62 seconds into the third. His 3 at 5:53 in the third pulled the Warriors within 60-56 then he converted a go-ahead four-point play with 3:03 left in the third. Soon after, his night was done.\n\nDurant missed his fourth straight game with a broken rib while Thompson sat out a fifth in a row with a fractured right thumb. Green has a pelvic contusion.\n\nThe teams combined to miss their first 16 3-pointers -- the Hawks 0 for 9 and Golden State 0 of 7 -- before Atlanta's Taurean Prince made the first shot from deep at the 9:21 mark of second quarter. Young hit the Warriors' first 3 with 4:24 before halftime.\n\nQuinn Cook contributed 13 points, eight rebounds and six assists off the bench on his 25th birthday, helping the Warriors to a seventh straight win over the Hawks and 12th in 13 games.\n\nPrince led Atlanta with 20 points. Dennis Schroder, who rested Thursday night in a loss at Sacramento, was back for Atlanta and scored 16 points. He briefly went to the locker room with 11:23 remaining before returning for the Hawks, who have lost eight of nine.\n\nHe missed two key free throws with less than five minutes to play and his team down four. Coach Mike Budenholzer said after the game that Schroder sprained an ankle, but didn't make it sound too serious.\n\nGolden State began 9 for 35 and fell behind 33-20 before trailing 51-43 at halftime.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHawks: The Hawks lost their sixth straight on Golden State's home floor. They haven't won at Oracle Arena since Feb. 25, 2011. ... G Kent Bazemore missed his sixth straight game with a bruised bone in his right knee.\n\nWarriors: Omri Casspi missed a third consecutive game with a sprained right ankle. ... Golden State improved to 16-2 following a loss this season and 47-9 since 2014-15. The Warriors have only lost back-to-back games eight times during that span. ... Local students were recognized at halftime by the Bay Area All-Star Scholarship Team, a collaborative effort by the Bay Area professional sports teams to provide scholarships for youth striving to continue their educations.\n\nMARCH FOR OUR LIVES\n\nKerr plans to participate in the Oakland \"March For Our Lives\" walk Saturday with his family to offer his support in the movement to end gun violence and mass shootings in the U.S.\n\nEarlier this month, Kerr took part in a town hall at Newark Memorial High School and challenged students to vote and make their voices heard. He shared how his father Malcolm, president of the American University of Beirut, was murdered in Beirut when Kerr was 18 and a freshman at the University of Arizona.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHawks: Visit the Houston Rockets on Sunday.\n\nWarriors: Host the Utah Jazz on Sunday.\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Babitzke is a PhD candidate in history at Boston University.\n\nOne of Mike Laymon's AR-15s pictured at Boulder Rifle and Pistol Club in Boulder City, Nev. on March 14, 2018. (Photo by Bridget Bennett for The Washington Post)\n\n\"They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars,\" said Parkland High School student Emma González. \"We call BS. They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us kids don't know what we're talking about, that we're too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.\"\n\nGonzalez's speech at a rally in Fort Lauderdale re-energized a decades-long debate over the availability of firearms such as the popular AR-15 -- commonly referred to by gun enthusiasts as \"black rifles\" -- to the general public. Gonzalez and her fellow survivors rightly point out that one doesn't need to be able to gunsplain to have an informed opinion about the political inertia that allows mass shootings such as Parkland to occur time and again.\n\n[ The extraordinary number of kids who have endured school shootings since Columbine ]\n\nBut -- and this is a very big but -- technical details matter. Over the past three decades, gun manufacturers and enthusiasts have relied on technical details and the aftermarket adaptability of black rifles to skirt federal efforts at regulation and boost business. Today, any regulatory option with actual teeth would need to focus on the one trait all civilian-market black rifles share: their semiautomatic reloading capability. Should the federal government decide to ban all semiautomatic weapons, far more small arms than just the black rifle might be off the market.\n\nFiguring out how to regulate these weapons requires first untangling a bit of history: How did the AR-15 become a civilian gun in the first place and how did it become so popular with gun owners?\n\nThe development of a new style of rifle crafted from modern industrial materials began as a side project at the ArmaLite Division of Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation. At the height of the Cold War, Eugene Stoner, ArmaLite's chief engineer and creator of the AR-15, envisioned his weapon as an American answer to the Soviet-developed AK-47. In 1958, the Army tested the AR-15 as a possible replacement for its M-14 rifle, but did not commit to adopting the firearm at that time. By 1959, financial trouble convinced ArmaLite to sell its AR project to Colt Industries.\n\nIn 1962, the Army purchased its first run of 8,500 AR-15s for testing. Colt modified the weapon for fully automatic and semiautomatic selective fire and renamed it the M16. Though not always the most reliable weapon under combat conditions in the early years of the Vietnam War -- maintenance- and ammunition-related issues cropped up during its introductory period -- it became standard issue for service members in the conflict.\n\nTo address the battlefield problems, Colt made modifications to the M16. By 1967, American armed forces had a keen ally in the field: the M16A1 made of steel, aluminum alloy and composite plastic. It was a cutting-edge, lightweight weapon capable of firing up to 30 rounds at distances up to 800 meters (almost nine football fields), with small-caliber bullets moving nearly three times the speed of sound, capable of creating devastating wounds.\n\nFollowing the success of its military contracts, Colt began marketing the AR-15 to civilians. Available to the shooting public only in semiautomatic configuration as an alternative to wooden stock hunting rifles, the weapon initially met mixed reviews. But by the late 1980s, with law enforcement agencies buying the weapon in increasing quantities, its rising popularity on film and television and in nascent survivalist and militia movements, the AR-15 and its small- caliber, high-velocity cousins began making inroads with enthusiasts. Over the next three decades, it would become \"America's Rifle.\"\n\nOn Jan. 17, 1989, Patrick Purdy walked onto his childhood schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., and opened fire with a semiautomatic AK-47. In a scant few minutes, Purdy killed five children and left 32 others wounded before committing suicide. In the wake of the shooting, Colt suspended sales of its AR-15 out of concern that its domestic production might be included in the 1989 ban on semiautomatic rifle imports such as the Uzi and AK-47. But by 1990, the manufacturer reversed course, slightly modifying the weapon for the civilian market in an effort to keep ahead of a possible full ban on all \"assault rifles.\"\n\nPurdy's was but one of the earliest shootings in an ever-growing list: Luby's Cafeteria in October 1991, 101 California Street in July 1993. Such violence intensified efforts at the federal level to address public concern about mass shootings committed by men with too-easy access to semiautomatic weapons and large-capacity magazines, ultimately resulting in the inclusion of the federal assault weapons ban in the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.\n\nBut even with this legislation, thousands of black rifles and large-capacity ammunition magazines still made their way onto the market in the early 1990s as manufacturers doubled and tripled production before the provisions took hold. Because the ban included exemptions, exclusions and loopholes, it was still relatively easy for an individual to purchase a weapon or magazine purportedly banned by law. And after the law went into effect, manufacturers made cosmetic changes to the weapons whose sale was meant to be regulated by the law.\n\nIn short, the ban was largely toothless. Even so, since it expired on Sept. 13, 2004, efforts to renew or replace it have been unsuccessful -- as the list of shootings continues to grow.\n\nEven with a decade of regulation under the ban, sales of black rifles exploded over the past 30 years for myriad reasons. Threats of a ban only intensified demand. The rising popularity of first-person-shooter video games and Hollywood's affinity for black rifles have increased their familiarity and visibility to the American public. Manufacturers of rifles and accessories also rely on \"tacti-cool,\" selling black rifles using military and law enforcement imagery to veterans of the forces and non-service members of the public. Finally, a subset of civilians increasingly concerned about the potential for governmental tyranny, regulation of black rifles and accessories or \"SHTF events\" -- doomsday disasters -- have been especially reliable consumers for firearms manufacturers from the turn of the 21st century to the present.\n\nToday, black rifles come in multiple calibers and can be personalized into nearly infinite varieties: Very few owners shoot these weapons as sold \"off the shelf.\" Gun enthusiasts even have the option to purchase an 80 percent complete AR-15-style lower receiver -- without a serial number -- (or even 3D-print a lower) and use an aftermarket jig to mill the parts to build a black rifle at home. And because the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not classify the incomplete lower as a gun, federal firearms licensed (FFL) dealers aren't required to run background checks on the purchaser of these parts. In fact, the buyer can choose to skip the storefront FFL dealer and purchase a new lower from an unlicensed seller at a gun show or on the Web.\n\nIn short, those with Internet access, a modicum of mechanical skill and a few tools have the potential to effectively bypass the entire regulatory system for firearms purchases.\n\nCustomizable and accessorizable to the nth degree, black rifles have become like Barbies for gun owners: Each owner can modify the rifle to suit his shooting style and tastes. These technical variations complicate efforts to regulate the weapons. The public may \"know one when they see one.\" But firearms manufacturers, organizations and black-rifle enthusiasts have and continue to rely on the minutiae of technicalities to effectively stymie efforts toward regulation.\n\nAnd if the goal for gun-control advocates is a blanket ban on all black rifles, the regulation would need to be so broad to address the technical variety in this class of guns that it might sweep up all semiautomatic firearms -- rifles and handguns, imported and domestic -- into its provisions. Should the young people of the United States maintain the regulatory momentum they seek, responsible firearms owners who wish to keep their access to semiautomatic weapons would be well served to find a spirit of compromise on universal background checks or age restrictions instead.",

This is just my mind-set living in this country now, but this is why we need to march.\"\n\nCallie Stone, 18, was walking down Pennsylvania Avenue wearing a denim jacket emblazoned with \"Nasty Woman,\" a term President Trump used against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and that progressive women adopted as a moniker.\n\nWith Stone was her mother, whom Stone had told the previous day that she wasn't sure she wanted to raise children in a world where students fear going to school. \"But I said, 'Look at you, at your generation -- you all are bringing us hope,'\" said Kelly Stone, 54.\n\nKelly Stone was a middle school student in Canada in 1975 when a gunman killed two people and himself at Brampton Centennial Secondary School, which she went on to attend. She said that incident has cast a long shadow over her life and that of her daughter.\n\nNearly 200 people have died in school shootings since the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, which left 13 dead and inaugurated a relentless two-decade stretch of campus gun violence. During that period, more than 187,000 students attending at least 193 primary or secondary schools have experienced a shooting on campus during school hours, according to a Washington Post analysis.\n\n\"We've grown up knowing this could happen to us,\" Stone said.\n\n[The extraordinary number of kids who have endured school shootings since Columbine]\n\nJust on Tuesday, 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey was fatally shot at Great Mills High School in Southern Maryland by a 17-year-old ex-boyfriend, who died as well. One other boy was injured in the gunfire. Willey was taken off life support two days ago.\n\nFor the roughly 100 students, alumni and parents from Great Mills who emerged from the escalator at the L'Enfant Plaza Metro station on Saturday, the march had a raw immediacy.\n\n\"We are!\" Emerson Schaeffer, 20, shouted into a megaphone.\n\n\"Great Mills!\" cheered the crowd, decked out in their school colors, forest green and gold.\n\nSchaeffer said he and friends had been thinking about attending the march even before the shooting. \"Then this happened,\" he said, \"and we said, 'Yep, we're going.' \"\n\nThe White House issued a statement Saturday praising the participants in the marches, though they are calling for tougher gun-control measures than President Trump supports.\n\n\"We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in the statement, in which she added that \"keeping our children safe is a stop priority of the President's.\"\n\nThe president himself was in Florida at Trump International Golf Club, located about 35 miles from Parkland.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, working with D.C. police and the mayor's office, has set up a system to notify demonstrators of warnings or detours. (Text \"March 24\" to 888-777 to sign up.) Those entering the main march area have to pass through security check points.\n\n[The March for Our Lives is today.

Water is being made available to protesters, organizers said, and food trucks would be nearby.\n\n\"As the young men and women from Parkland, Florida, have been preparing for Saturday's event, the District has been preparing to keep them safe here in Washington,\" Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said this week.\n\nBowser and other city officials held a pre-march rally at Folger Park on Saturday morning, intended to highlight the effects of gun violence on children in the District.\n\nAmong the hundreds pouring into the park ahead of time were three students at National Collegiate Preparatory Public Charter High School in Southeast Washington who lamented that gun violence in the poorest and mostly African American neighborhoods of the nation's capital doesn't command the same national publicity as that in Florida.\n\n\"As soon as stuff happened in Florida, everyone wanted to do something,\" said Nevaeh Williams, a 16-year-old sophomore who lives in Anacostia. \"But every week someone gets shot in D.C.\" Williams's cousin was shot four years ago. A classmate, Zoruan Harris, the quarterback for the football team, was fatally shot in 2016.\n\n[Demonstration expected to pack streets in D.C. Here's how to get around.]\n\nAlthough America's most famous school massacres have happened at mostly white schools in suburbs or small towns, children of color are at far greater risk of gun violence at school, the Post analysis found. Hispanic students are twice as likely as white students to experience a school shooting, and black students three times as likely.\n\n\"When it happens in a school in a nice neighborhood, it's shown nationwide. But we don't get that attention,\" said Danielle Perkins, a 16-year-old junior whose stepbrother and friend's older brother were shot in recent months.\n\nMore than 800 events were scheduled to take place around the world Saturday, according to March for Our Lives organizers. Beyond major cities, they will include demonstrations in Las Vegas, where a gunman killed 58 people at a country music festival last year; in Parkland, Fla., home to Stoneman Douglas; and in Jonesboro, Ark., where the community is marking the 20th anniversary of a middle school shooting that left four students and a teacher dead.\n\nSurvivors or relatives of those killed in other mass shootings are also expected to attend the march in Washington, including some from Columbine; Sandy Hook Elementary School, where 20 first-graders and six adults were shot dead in 2012; and Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington state, where four were fatally shot in 2014.\n\nBrandon Wolf, a survivor of the 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, said he is attending the march as a representative of the Pulse victims, including his friend Christopher \"Drew\" Leinonen and Leinonen's boyfriend, Juan Guerrero.\n\n\"I don't think this conversation is just about schools,\" Wolf said. \"It's about: The current generation is fed up with lawmakers who have done nothing on this issue, regardless of which community has been affected. Students, LGBT people, people of color. This issue is intersectional.\"\n\nMarches and rallies that force survivors to relive those horrible moments can trigger strong emotional reactions, Wolf said. Several organizations will be available to assist survivors of violent crimes and rally participants who need support.\n\n\"It's so important to remember that while these teenagers are giving us hope and inspiring us and we want to rest everything we have on their shoulders, they're also kids who have been through something horrific,\" Wolf said. \"Something they will never forget.\"\n\nCounterprotests by gun rights supporters are also expected in cities including Boston, Boise, Salt Lake City and Valparaiso, Ind.",

The Pakistan Super League final will be held amid heavy security at a newly renovated National Stadium in Karachi.\n\nMore than 8,000 security personnel have been deployed for the Twenty20 final between Islamabad United and last year's champions, Peshawar Zalmi.\n\nPresidential-like security has been put in place on routes from the hotel to the stadium. For practice on Saturday, the team vans were surrounded by a fleet of security vehicles carrying armed guards.\n\n\"It's been really good. All the logistical works have been done behind the scenes, and we've been brought here pretty safely,\" Islamabad United stand-in captain JP Duminy said.\n\n\"It's obviously going to be an exciting occasion to be part of PSL final and more specifically being in Karachi.\"\n\nIslamabad United's regular captain, Misbah-ul-Haq, has not fully recovered from a hand injury.\n\nThe last major game with international players in Karachi was in February 2009, a Pakistan-Sri Lanka test.\n\nOn the same tour, terrorists attacked the Sri Lanka team convoy at Lahore that March. Six Pakistan policemen and two civilians were killed, and six members of the Sri Lanka team were injured.\n\nThat resulted in an end to international cricket in the country, and the Pakistan Cricket Board moved its home matches to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe PCB has gradually convinced international players to return, and Lahore hosted the first PSL final last year, and there were Twenty20s organized against a World XI (three matches) and Sri Lanka (one).\n\nA reluctance from some international PSL players to play in Pakistan remains. The preliminary matches were played at Dubai and Sharjah in the UAE.\n\nAustralian Shane Watson (Quetta Gladiators) and Englishmen Eoin Morgan (Karachi) and Kevin Pietersen (Quetta) refused to accompany their teams to Lahore this week for two PSL eliminators.\n\nThe absence of the top stars hurt both franchises and drew an angry response from Gladiators coach and former Pakistan captain Moin Khan.\n\n\"We, in the coming season, should only pick players who have the consent to visit Pakistan,\" Moin said after losing the first eliminator against Zalmi.\n\n\"We do not need to push for individuality as our league has now become a bigger brand ... we don't need to get these players who don't want to come to Pakistan. In fact, this is hurting Pakistan as it is sending a negative signal and affects our country's image as well.\"\n\nOther internationals playing in the final include Peshawar Zalmi's Darren Sammy of West Indies and Chris Jordan of England, and for Islamabad United, JP Duminy of South Africa and Luke Ronchi of New Zealand.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "President Trump speaks about the opioid crisis during a visit to Manchester Community College in Manchester, N.H., on March 19. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nLike its competitors in Beltway journalism, Politico makes pricey investments in newsgathering. All those editors and reporters and trips to shadow politicians cost millions upon millions of dollars. Also, like its competitors, Politico has gotten resourceful in seeking the money to support all that activity. Native ads -- those sneaky rascals that promote stuff while resembling genuine, fully vetted editorial work -- are part of the formula.\n\nOne of those ads just became famous, per coverage in the Guardian about the work that Cambridge Analytica, a firm that represents clients seeking to \"change audience behaviour,\" did for the Trump presidential campaign in 2016. The firm zoomed into the news last week, when it emerged that it had acquired data from 50 million-plus Facebook users.\n\nIn explaining how Cambridge Analytica assisted the Trump campaign, the Guardian interviewed former firm employee Brittany Kaiser. The story included these three paragraphs:\n\nOne of the most effective ads, according to Kaiser, was a piece of native advertising , which was also profiled in the presentation. The interactive graphic, which looked like a piece of journalism and purported to list \"10 inconvenient truths about the Clinton Foundation\", appeared for several weeks to people from a list of key swing states when they visited the site. It was produced by the in-house Politico team that creates sponsored content.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica presentation dedicates an entire slide to the ad, which is described as having achieved \"an average engagement time of four minutes\". Kaiser described the ad as \"the most successful thing we pushed out\".\n\nPolitico said editorial journalists were not involved in the campaign, and similar ads were purchased by the Bernie Sanders and Clinton campaigns.\n\nHere's a look at how the ad presents itself on the Politico site:\n\nTo any experienced reader of Politico, that look raises eyebrows. First off, Politico stories commonly have newsy headlines and distinctive digital folderol:\n\nAnd in case the reader was inclined to view the piece as original Politico journalism, there's a warning right at the top of the presentation signaling that it's \"SPONSOR-GENERATED CONTENT,\" as well as a \"paid advertisement\" by \"Donald J. Trump for President.\" Those banners comply with industry best practices requiring that publishers refrain from hoodwinking their readers into disguising ads as journalism. \"POLITICO is proud of the award winning work our Focus team produces on behalf of our many clients across a wide spectrum of industries. We're proud that clients recognize the effectiveness of their ad placements,\" notes Politico spokesman Brad Dayspring in a statement to the Erik Wemple Blog.\n\nCraig Minassian, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, has a less complimentary view:\n\nWe expect political critics to mislead people about the Clinton Foundation. We didn't, and shouldn't, expect it from @Politico's in-house ad team. News organizations creating native ads should ask: would these ads pass editorial standards on the news side? https://t.co/HcC26tqBsl pic.twitter.com/RMcbwDvjiq -- Craig Minassian (@MinassianMedia)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nIn this contentious context, definitions matter.\n\n\"Creating,\" says Politico's Dayspring, doesn't describe how the company handles these hot-potato ads. \"As it relates specifically to the category of political campaign advertising, POLITICO and it's Focus Brand Studio have a strict policy of not authoring or creating any content for political campaigns. For these specific types of ads, we provide creative services by developing pages with the assets we are given by the client and optimizing audience targeting, as we would any ad. In all cases, native advertising run on POLITICO is clearly labeled as 'Sponsored Content' with the advertiser clearly identified, as was the case in both the Trump and Sanders campaign pieces,\" writes Dayspring, who says that the Trump and Bernie Sanders's ads had \"very different messaging objectives and strategies, which was their choice.\" So, Politico's in-house sponsored-content gurus assist with presentation and dissemination, not with formulation.\n\nEven so, Minassian bridles at the presentation: \"I'm guessing that the reason they went to a place like Politico is they wanted to make it look like a Politico story.\"\n\nThe Clinton Foundation sent the Erik Wemple Blog a factual patdown of the Politico sponsored-content ad, including this pushback:\n\nASSERTION: \"Several major Clinton foundation donations came from companies lobbying the Federal Government\"\n\nFACTS: The Wall Street Journal piece specifically said there was no evidence of any connection between these donations (from major companies that give significantly to charities) and any actions by Secretary Clinton. This was omitted from the Politico piece: \"Corporate donations to politically connected charities aren't illegal so long as they aren't in exchange for favors. There is no evidence of that with the Clinton Foundation.\"\n\nOf course, the targets of political ads invariably have factual, conceptual and interpretive objections to them. \"The content of the Trump ad was sourced from major news organizations, just like any political ad you would see on television,\" notes Dayspring. \"You can see the links to the articles when you click on the tiles at the bottom of the sponsored content.\"\n\nOver the 2016 campaign, the Clinton Foundation attempted to beat back attacks on its institutional integrity. That said, officials there never spotted this particular one. \"We clearly weren't the audience for it,\" says Minassian, who adds: \"Suffice it to say we were not aware of this ad at the time.\" Careful placement and targeting, no doubt, explains the dynamic. As the Guardian reported, it \"appeared for several weeks to people from a list of key swing states when they visited the site.\" Chalk one up for the compartmentalization of the Internet.\n\nIt would be a mistake to view the Clinton Foundation as a clueless outlier in this sponsored-content moment. The existence of this slick and luscious ad was news to a few Politico journalists consulted by the Erik Wemple Blog.\n\nNative advertising and sponsored content -- the latter is an offshoot of the former, according to the experts -- have been controversial over their long history in American media. They represent efforts by publishers to tiptoe along a line that gets redrawn with every money-making ad package. Wrote Jack Shafer about the tensions: A \"publisher's credibility suffers when it looks like it's shilling for advertisers, and an advertiser's reputation is at peril when readers begin to believe that the advertiser is somehow responsible for the site's controversial editorial content.\"\n\nOne principle, however, remains pretty well fixed: Sponsored content for political campaigns is far more controversial than it is for, say, Dell computers or Ford. That's why some media outlets simply won't go there.\n\nThe New York Times: \"T Brand Studio, The New York Times Company's in-house marketing agency, does not create branded content on behalf of political candidates, political parties, political campaigns and/or related entities such as PACs,\" writes New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha. The Washington Post's brand studio does not \"create content for candidates or PACs,\" says a spokeswoman. The Atlantic has \"not done native for partisan political campaigns and don't plan to,\" says a spokeswoman for Atlantic Media.\n\nBuzzFeed, says a spokesman, has published \"a small amount of sponsored content from political advocacy groups.\"\n\nDayspring: \"We feel this policy strikes the proper balance between being non-partisan, transparent about about who is behind these messages, and ensuring that we do not blur any lines or contribute to any campaign messaging, while still providing the advertising revenue that supports our world class journalism.\"",

                "body": "Loyola Chicago and guard Marques Townes will try to continue their surprising run. (David Goldman/Associated Press)\n\nFollow our coverage of the Florida State-Michigan regional final here.\n\n***\n\nATLANTA -- When Porter Moser arrived as Loyola Chicago's men's basketball coach in 2011, the roster wasn't exactly dotted with players destined for the NBA, but he sensed a potential breakthrough with the right additions.\n\nHe began recruiting players from the Chicago area, and it eventually paid off with the current roster, which includes a handful of players who have contributed to the Ramblers' improbable march to Sunday's South Region final against Kansas State.\n\nLoyola has five players from within 40 miles of the Chicago campus, a target demographic for Moser, a native of the Chicago area. They helped the Ramblers secured their first bid to the NCAA tournament since 1985 by winning the Missouri Valley Conference tournament. In another satisfying turn, that 65-49 victory was over Illinois State, the program that fired Moser in 2011 after consecutive losing seasons.\n\n[ Porter Moser has led Loyola Chicago to new heights after hitting a career low ]\n\nThis past season, Moser was voted MVC coach of the year and is on the verge of becoming the first coach since Shaka Smart in 2011 to lead a No. 11 seed to the Final Four.\n\nIn 2006, Jim Larranaga also pulled off an unexpected run when he directed George Mason to the Final Four.\n\nBoth Smart and Larranaga wound up taking jobs at high major schools after their memorable jaunts through the NCAA tournament.\n\n[ Loyola Chicago's Sister Jean continues to steal the show at NCAA tournament ]\n\n\"You know, like you know from being there in Chicago, it was a grass-roots rebuild,\" Moser said. \"But the dynamics changed when you jump to the Missouri Valley, when we jumped. The first year we took a step back, and then that second year in the Valley, we won 24 games, and we won the CBI tournament.\n\n\"And we've just kind of been building and getting our arrow going up. And I think -- I hope we're an example of, you know, it takes time. I get it. I've been there. Fans, administrations, they want it so fast, and it's tough.\"\n\nSchedule: Loyola (31-5) and Kansas State (25-11) will tip off at 6:09 p.m. Saturday on TBS.\n\nHow Loyola got here:\n\nThe Ramblers knocked off No. 6 seed Miami in a first-round thriller, 64-62, inching ahead when Donte Ingram connected on a long three-pointer as time was running out. It was their first NCAA tournament game (and win) since a 1985 trip that ended against Patrick Ewing and Georgetown in the Sweet 16. And it made Sister Jean into a national sensation. More late-game dramatics against No. 3 Tennessee: Clayton Custer hit the go-ahead basket with less than four seconds left in a 63-62 win. That victory gave the Ramblers their 30th win, breaking the school record set by the 1963 NCAA championship team. And it put a focus on the Chicago school's oddball charm. Another game, another big shot: Marques Townes hit a backbreaking three-pointer with less than seven seconds left to help clinch a 69-68 win over No. 7 seed Nevada. That made it three tournament wins by a total of four points. And the Ramblers' uber-efficient offense means they won't need divine intervention to reach the Final Four.\n\nHow Kansas State got here:\n\nThe Wildcats led No. 8 Creighton from start to finish in a 69-59 win, despite playing without leading scorer Dean Wade, out with a stress fracture suffered in the Big 12 conference tournament. The win clinched Kansas State's first trip to the round of 32 since 2012. Playing the unexpected role of heavy favorites, the Wildcats knocked off tournament darlings UMBC, 50-43. UMBC had been the first No. 16 seed ever to beat a No. 1 seed. Barry Brown had 18 points as Kansas State advanced to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2010. Back in the underdog role, the Wildcats downed eight-time national champion and fifth-seeded Kentucky, 61-58. (Don't ask about the postgame handshakes.) Kansas State, which hasn't made a Final Four since 1964, beat Kentucky despite attempting 15 fewer free throws and being out-rebounded, 38-29. And the win set up the first matchup between a No. 9 and a No. 11 seed in NCAA tournament history.\n\nRegular season results:\n\nLoyola easily won the Missouri Valley regular season title, finishing 15-3 in league games (and 25-5 overall), four games clear of anyone else. Guard Clayton Custer was the league's player of the year; three of the Ramblers' five losses came when he was out with an injured ankle. Loyola added its first-ever Missouri Valley tournament title, getting a No. 11 seed in the NCAA tournament. Ben Richardson earned the Valley\"s defensive player of the year award, Cameron Krutwig was the freshman of the year, and Moser was the coach of the year.\n\nKansas State finished fourth in the surging Big 12 conference, with a 21-10 overall record and a 10-8 mark in league games. The Wildcats were 10-4 against league opponents other than Texas Tech and Kansas, which both join Kansas State in the Elite Eight. The Wildcats suffered another loss to Kansas in the Big 12 tournament semifinals -- playing without star forward Dean Wade -- and earned a No. 9 seed in the NCAA tournament. Wade, a 6-foot-10 junior, averaged 16.7 points and 6.4 rebounds in the regular season and became the first Kansas State player to make first-team all-Big 12 in five years. He's barely played in this event, though.\n\nMore NCAA tournament coverage:\n\nLoyola Chicago, Kansas State and Florida State pull off upsets; Michigan's title hopes soar\n\nLoyola Chicago doesn't need divine intervention to reach the Final Four\n\n'I got shivers down my whole body': Michigan walk-on hits the shot of his life\n\nNCAA broadcasts feed on the tears of young children, and critics have had enough\n\nJenkins: The secret to buzzer-beaters?

                "body": "Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman and Michigan have a path to the national title game. (Harry How/Getty Images)\n\nFollow our coverage of the Kansas State-Loyola regional final here.\n\n***\n\nFlorida State, with its three national championships and three Heisman Trophy winners, is known as one of the great college football programs in the country.\n\nJust don't tell that to the school's basketball coach.\n\nWhen Leonard Hamilton was asked about the potential advantages that come with working at a traditional football school, the easygoing 69-year-old was clearly agitated to answer before the question could even finish being asked.\n\nAnd, once he got started answering, it quickly became clear he had a lot to say.\n\n\"I think that's one of the most ridiculous phrases that I've heard, football school, basketball school,\" Hamilton said Friday afternoon, the day before his ninth-seeded Seminoles face No. 3 seed Michigan for the right to advance to the Final Four next weekend in San Antonio. \"I mean, gosh, [Michigan has] been to the Final Four on a consistent basis. I think they're a good academic school, and they have great sports.\n\n\"The basketball world that I know of, that I live in, never identified them as a football school. As a matter of fact, I don't know if I've ever really heard anybody use that phrase, other than maybe coming from a reporter. I feel that at every school several sports have maybe had more success than others. Our baseball team has probably had as much success at Florida State as anyone, but nobody would call us a baseball school. Our soccer team does an outstanding job. Our volleyball team is good.\"\n\n\"I just think that's a cliche and that's a phrase that we need to eliminate.\"\n\n[ March Madness 2018: Game recaps and news from the Sweet 16 ]\n\nIt's a cliche Hamilton has plenty of experience with. Throughout his three decades of experience as a collegiate head coach -- with one year at the helm of the Washington Wizards in the middle -- he's been at three places that would traditionally fit that bill: Oklahoma State, Miami and, for the past 16 seasons, at Florida State.\n\nThough he might not like the term \"football school,\" he admitted the big weekend celebrations that come with Saturday afternoons at Power Five schools with football tradition such as Michigan and Florida State have some added benefits for a college basketball coach.\n\n\"I kind of enjoy those football weekends myself,\" he said with a smile. \"It's good for recruiting.\"\n\n[ 'I got shivers down my whole body': Michigan walk-on hits the shot of his life ]\n\nIt was just one of many moments of candor from Hamilton during a lengthy and jovial meeting with the press Friday. He took great pleasure in explaining how he came up with the term \"junkyard defense\" for his players to emulate, describing in great detail what junkyards in the South are like. He was equally pleased to take the time to describe his team's philosophy of playing at least 10 players heavy minutes every game, extolling the virtues of several of his players who openly asked for their teammates to remain in the game instead of them because they were playing well.\n\nWhen asked if he knows any other languages, because of his penchant for recruiting internationally over the years, he quipped, \"I'm still working on English, and I'm struggling with that a lot of the time.\"\n\n[ '18 strong': Seminoles will send waves of players at Wolverines in Elite Eight ]\n\nBut Hamilton turned poignant when it came to the final answer of his news conference, in response to what it would mean to him, in his 30th season as a collegiate head coach, to reach the Final Four for the first time as a head coach.\n\n\"Someone asked me that last night, and I hadn't had a chance to really think about it, about what it meant to me,\" Hamilton said. \"I've been fortunate in my career to have been, as an assistant, to go to three Final Fours [and win] and I don't know how many conference championships. I'm more thinking about how important it would be for our student-athletes to enjoy that experience.\n\n\"I'm not selfish enough to feel that that's a cure-all for me that's going to make my life any more important or successful. But I realize that these are memories that our young people will have that they will cherish for the remainder of their lives. I want so much for them to enjoy that experience, because I know how much it's going to mean to them.\n\n\"I'm more excited about when they graduate and get their degrees, when I get a chance to go through their weddings and be the godfather to their kids. When I see them grow from being young adults to -- I mean, from teenagers to young adults, those are the things that are important to me.\n\n\"Me personally, I hope that my reward would be to see the smiles on their face and hear their tone of voice and the excitement in it if we can win this game tomorrow.\"\n\nThen Hamilton smiled.\n\n\"So my job is to try to get them to be mentally and emotionally poised, connected, and energized and not pressured because they're trying to satisfy something for the coach,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nAnd, with that, he got up from the dais.\n\nSchedule: Florida State (23-11) and Michigan (31-7) will tip off at 8:49 Saturday on TBS.\n\nHow Florida State got here:\n\nThe Seminoles wore down No. 8 seed Missouri in a 67-54 first round victory, winning their fourth straight NCAA tournament opener. They then rallied from 12 points down to stun top-seeded Xavier in the second round, 75-70. They recorded another upset in the Sweet 16, knocking off No. 4 seed Gonzaga, 75-60, to clinch the school's third Elite Eight berth, and first since 1993. Florida State's size, length and athleticism bothered Gonzaga from start to finish, with Gonzaga Coach Mark Few calling the Seminoles \"probably easily the most physically imposing and athletically gifted team we've faced maybe in the 20 years I've been head coach.\"\n\nHow Michigan got here:\n\nThe Wolverines trailed No. 14 seed Montana 10-0 before surging ahead for a 61-47 win. Their second-round game offered one of the tournament's most dramatic endings, when freshman Jordan Poole bombed in a long three-pointer as time expired to clinch a 64-63 win over No. 6 seed Houston. That seemed to ignite the Wolverines, who dominated seventh-seeded Texas A&M in a 99-72 laugher. That makes three Elite Eight appearances in six years for Michigan. The Wolverines set an NCAA tournament record with eight players making at least one three-pointer in that game. Included in that group was freshman walk-on C.J. Baird, who had more fun than anyone in the win. Michigan is on the fashion vanguard, too, with some of the shortest shorts in this event.\n\nRegular season results:\n\nFlorida State finished the regular season 20-10, with a 9-9 ACC record, earning the eighth seed in the conference tournament. The Seminoles dropped their ACC tournament opener to Louisville, and earned a No. 9 seed in the NCAA tournament. Florida State didn't have any players on the all-ACC first, second or third teams; Terance Mann finished ninth in honorable mention.\n\nMichigan finished the regular season 24-7, with a 13-5 Big Ten mark, good for the fifth seed. But the Wolverines raced through that event, winning four games in four days to claim a second straight tournament title. That earned them a No. 3 seed. German forward Moe Wagner was second-team all-Big Ten, while fifth-year senior Duncan Robinson was the conference's sixth man of the year.\n\nMore NCAA tournament coverage:\n\nPorter Moser has led Loyola Chicago to new heights after hitting a career low\n\nLoyola Chicago doesn't need divine intervention to reach the Final Four\n\nKentucky Gentlemen?

                "body": "This March 14, 2018, file photo shows students sitting in silence as they rally in front of the White House in Washington. Students walked out of school to protest gun violence in the biggest demonstration yet of the student activism that has emerged in response to last month's massacre of 17 people at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nIt's been a common refrain for years that young people are not engaged in the political process -- and that a big part of the reason is that schools have failed to teach them civic education.\n\nNow that we seem to have entered a new era of protest -- started by student survivors of a mass school shooting in Florida -- it would appear that a lot of kids are learning in school to be active citizens by thinking creatively about how to solve problems and taking action to reach their goals.\n\nLast week, many thousands of students around the country walked out of class for a 17-minute protest to mark the one-month anniversary of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting deaths of 17 people -- and in some cases, students were punished for doing so. On Saturday, student-led protests across the country are calling on adults to take action to make kids safer.\n\nThis post, by law professor Shelley Dunck, explores a different way to look at what those students did: use the lessons they have learned in school to promote a civic goal.\n\nDunck is the director of the Business Law Clinic at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and a Public Voices Fellow with The OpEd Project, an effort to expand the range of voices speaking out in the public square on critical issues.\n\nBy Shelley Dunck\n\nSome school officials were not happy when kids walked out of class this month to participate in a national protest against gun violence -- and they punished the students for it. But instead of viewing the young people primarily as rule-breakers, they could have chosen to applaud the students for putting into practice class lessons on civic engagement and problem-solving.\n\nIn response to the student walkouts last week on the one-month anniversary of the Feb. 14 killings of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., some high school administrators gave students detention, marked the kids truant or otherwise punished students who elected to participate in these peaceful protests. Some students were paddled for their actions.\n\nWhat these school officials fail to recognize is that the motive of these students was not to waste time or disrespect school authority, but, rather, to challenge assumptions and engage in what educators would describe as experiential learning. The actions of these students can be seen as applied learning successes.\n\nThe average high school student studies history and government, prepares and delivers presentations on various topics to their fellow classmates, performs analytical arguments, writes persuasive papers and completes research projects in the school setting.\n\nBy organizing meaningful protests, these students are actively practicing the application of this knowledge in a truth-to-power fashion. They are engaging in critical reflection, deliberation, and individual and coordinated communication. The result is a well-organized public display of what can accurately be described as enhanced problem-solving activities.\n\nIsn't this what parents, educators and everybody else in this country want from our children and young adults?\n\nCertainly schools cannot allow student demonstrations and protests to disrupt the school schedule every day. And there will always be questions about what issues rise to the level of importance to permit such disruption. But the fact that it is hard to draw a line does not take away from the fact that there are certain historic instances where well-organized and meaningful protest in high schools should be respected by school administrators and recognized by all as the educational opportunities they represent. The goal of high school is to prepare young people for adulthood.\n\nThe reaction of principals and administrators to punish the behavior of the students who walked out to protest gun violence contradicts the mission of our secondary-level learning institutions: to prepare young adults to think and advocate for themselves so that they may be productive future contributors both individually and for the collective good of our country.\n\nUnderstanding this, many school districts have been supportive of these student efforts, acknowledging the students' right to peacefully protest and emphasizing the \"teachable moment.\"\n\nEarlier this month, for example, high school students at John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri rallied to defend an openly gay athlete and classmate targeted by anti LBGTQ rally organized by the Westboro Baptist Church. The headmaster was supportive, allowing students to gather for a 40-minute display of support, followed by a unity walk and a music filled assembly.\n\nThe coordinated and well-communicated efforts of students at the school are clearly taken from the playbook of high school students across the country who are organizing coordinated peaceful protests of gun violence to send a message to lawmakers to enact gun control laws.\n\nAs a clinical professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law, where I oversee a clinic where students deal with real clients, I witness experiential learning every day. Our students work with for-profit and non-profit start-ups, and these opportunities are often the first opportunity in law school that they have to experience actual interaction with a client. In these moments, students truly understand how their classroom knowledge can be applied in a meaningful way. The experience is always transformative.\n\nNow students in Parkland -- along with others around the country -- are advocating for their personal safety and on behalf of classmates who were among the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a 19-year-old with an AR-15 magazine-fed semi-automatic rifle. Their actions are already creating change -- the Florida legislature has already passed gun control restrictions (though it did not pass an automatic weapons ban sought by Parkland students).\n\nBy organizing and participating in peaceful protest around issues of safety, fairness and respect, these high school students are problem-solving by translating and actively applying skills that they have learned and practiced in the classroom to problems they see in the world around them. The opportunity to organize and communicate one's views to the outside world is valuable, empowering and in line with these educational goals.\n\nTo view this in any other way is a disservice to our students.",

The officer who offered to be swapped for a female hostage was identified as Col. Arnaud Beltrame. (Ouest France via AP)\n\nArnaud Beltrame, a French police officer who willingly took the place of a hostage during a standoff with a rampaging gunman Friday in France, died from injuries sustained in the incident on early Saturday. His bravery earned him recognition as a hero in a country that has been deeply shaken by a number of terrorist attacks over recent years.\n\nBeltrame, 45, was a lieutenant colonel in the gendarmerie, a part of the French military that focuses on domestic policing. He had previously been decorated for his bravery during operations in Iraq and spent four years in the early 2000s in France's Republican Guard, protecting the Elysee Palace in Paris.\n\nLe lieutenant-colonel A. Beltrame est tombé en héros pour mettre un terme à l'équipée meurtrière d'un terroriste djihadiste.

He was later chosen to join the gendarmerie's elite GSIGN in 2003, and he was deployed to Iraq in 2005. He was married but had no children.\n\nIt was only last year that he had been named deputy chief of the gendarmerie in France's Aude department. The French president's office noted that his understanding of counterterrorism had won him appreciation in this position.\n\nOn Friday, 25-year-old gunman Radouane Lakdim had hijacked a car near the town of Carcassonne in Aude, killing a passenger and wounding the driver, before shooting at a group of police officers on their morning jog and wounding one of them. In the nearby town of Trèbes, the gunman then stormed into a supermarket and took hostages.\n\nBeltrame was one of the first officers to respond. As police negotiated with Lakdim to release the hostages, Beltrame offered himself in place of the final hostage. Inside the supermarket, Beltrame tried to negotiate with Lakdim. He left his cellphone active on a table to allow authorities outside to listen in. When police heard gunshots, they stormed the building and shot Lakdim, killing him.\n\nIn an address to the nation on Friday, Macron commended Beltrame, who was in a critical condition at the time. \"He saved lives. He is fighting for his life,\" the French president said.\n\nThree other people were killed and several others were injured during Lakdim's rampage.\n\nFrance has suffered a number of terrorist attacks in recent years -- in January 2015 and on the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in Paris left four people were killed.\n\nIn an interview with the local Depeche du Midi newspaper in December, Beltrame described being trained to counter a terrorist attack on a supermarket. \"A mass killing took place in a supermarket. This is the only information that was given to the police,\" he told the newspaper, according to a translation from Reuters. \"We want to be closer to real conditions, so there is no pre-established scenario.\"\n\nIn an interview with RTL radio, Beltrame's mother said she was not surprised he would give himself up for a hostage. \"He has always been like that -- someone who, since he was born, was doing everything for his country,\" said his mother, whose name was not disclosed. \"He would say to me: 'I'm doing my job, mom. That's all.\"\n\nOn RTL's website, a poll shows overwhelming support for organizing a national tribute to Beltrame. On Twitter, the French gendarmerie said that flags would fly at half-mast in honor of the slain officer.\n\nL'ensemble des drapeaux et étendards de la gendarmerie sera mis en berne aujourd'hui.

                "title": "Perspective | As Purdue reached the end of its NCAA tournament run, Isaac Haas could only watch",
                "body": "BOSTON -- At one end of the dingy hallway that circles the TD Garden playing floor, the post-midnight music and noise coming from the Texas Tech locker room was so loud you wondered if people living in the nearby North End neighborhood might find themselves waking up wondering what all the racket was about.\n\nPerhaps 50-feet down the hall, inside the Purdue locker room, there was near silence. Coach Matt Painter sat on a chair in the tiny, narrow entrance area, staring at a stat sheet as if it might reveal some way to change what he had just witnessed, a 78-65 loss to Texas Tech in the East Regional semifinals -- a sad and decisive ending to a 30-7 season.\n\nInside, players sat around the room, quietly going through their postgame media paces. Toward the back of the room, Isaac Haas, dressed in a black Purdue pullover with \"empathy\" written across it, patiently answered every question he was asked even though it was clear he was in a lot of pain -- most of it emotional.\n\n\"You have to give them the credit,\" he said in his soft Alabama accent. \"They're very good. They're athletic and they made tough shots when they had to. I honestly thought we had what it takes to beat them in this room. I still believe that.\"\n\n[And then there were eight: Duke, Kansas, Texas Tech, Villanova fill remaining March Madness field]\n\nHaas might not have been wrong, but neither he nor anyone else will ever know for certain. Because, even though he was in the locker room and on the bench, he never set foot on the floor all night, except during warm-ups when he stood near midcourt, exchanging fist bumps and hand-slaps with his teammates as they went by -- all with his left hand.\n\nHis right arm hung limply at his side, a large bandage evident under the warm-up. In the first round of the tournament, Purdue, the No. 2 seed in the East, was cruising to a 74-48 win over Cal-State Fullerton when Haas got tangled with 6-foot-7 Dominic Heinzl and fell awkwardly to the floor, banging his right elbow.\n\n\"It hurt a lot but I didn't think that much about it,\" he said. \"I just figured I'd banged it.\"\n\nHaas is 7-foot-1 and weighs 290 pounds. Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo describes him as \"the world's biggest human.\" When he came to the bench, his teammates asked if he or the floor had gotten the worst of the collision.\n\n\"Probably the floor,\" Haas said with a laugh.\n\nThe laughter didn't last long. Haas went to the locker room to have the elbow examined. \"'I kept saying, 'It's okay, right, doc?'\" he said. \"He was feeling around and then he looked up and said, 'I heard something click. We're going to need an X-ray.' That's when I started to get worried.\"\n\nBecause they were in an NBA building -- Detroit's Little Caesar's Arena -- they went to a nearby X-ray room. The scan revealed a fracture. Even though some Purdue engineering students came up with s special brace that might have allowed Hass to try to play, both he and Painter both knew his playing career at Purdue was over.\n\n[Texas Tech breaks through against Purdue to reach Elite Eight for first time ]\n\nWhich was both sad and unfair.\n\nHaas has come a long way since he arrived at Purdue four years ago as the classic big man project. For two years, he backed up A.J. Hammons at center, averaging 7.6 points and 4.1 rebounds as a freshman and 9.8 and 3.7 as a sophomore.\n\nHe began to blossom as a junior, playing next to Big Ten player-of-the-year Caleb Swanigan, helping lead Purdue to the regular season Big Ten title for the first time since 1996 and reaching the Sweet 16 before being blown out by Kansas.\n\n\"I think we all thought we could go a long way in this tournament,\" Haas said, referring to the four seniors whose college careers ended early Friday morning. \"I was proud of all the guys and the way we battled. We never stopped battling.\"\n\nHe had to pause frequently as he spoke because he kept choking up as he tried to speak. His eyes glistened throughout. He was too polite, though, to turn down and questioners. At one point he stopped in mid-sentence and said, \"I'm sorry, I'm having a little trouble with my voice.\"\n\nHe didn't hang his head, he looked everyone in the eye and only bristled -- slightly -- once, when he was asked when it hit him that the season and his career were over.\n\n\"When the clock went to zero,\" he said, sitting up a little straighter. \"I never gave up hope.\"\n\nHe didn't sit on the end of the bench during the game, he sat right in the middle of his teammates, trying to coach up his teammates every chance he got -- most notably 7-3 redshirt freshman Matt Haarms, who tried gamely to replace Haas but simply didn't have the strength or the finesse to make the plays Haas can make.\n\nPainter, who never once brought up Haas's name or his absence in his postgame news conference, wasn't going to use the injury as an excuse. His team had managed to beat Butler in the second round to get here and he had hoped they could ride the emotion of that win to an Elite Eight matchup with Villanova on Sunday.\n\n\"He's a very hard guard for other teams,\" Painter said, still sitting in the hallway waiting to be taken to the interview room. \"Even if he doesn't score when he gets the ball, he opens things up around the floor for us because trying to guard him with one guy in the post is so difficult.\"\n\nHaas averaged 14.7 points and 5.7 rebounds a game and was a defensive presence inside. His presence Friday certainly would have made a difference but there was no doubting that Texas Tech was the better team. Purdue never led the last 25 minutes of the game.\n\n\"Honestly, it's heartbreaking,\" Haas said, his voice cracking again. \"To have to sit there and not be able to do anything sucks. For us to come this far as a class and then go out like this ...\" He paused for a moment and then added, \"It really does suck.\"\n\nHaas did everything he could to try to coach Haarms throughout the game, often stopping him as he came to the bench to whisper in his ear. \"I was just sort of translating for the coaches,\" he said. \"Coming from a player, I thought it could help, at least a little.\"\n\nWhen the clock did hit zero and there was nothing more to be done, Haas retreated to the back of the handshake line and draped his left arm around P.J. Thompson, his 5-foot-10-inch classmate, and the two took a moment to console one another. Then he congratulated all the Red Raiders, using his left hand to exchange handshakes. When Tech Coach Chris Beard got to him, he spent several seconds telling him how sorry he was that he hadn't played.\n\n\"I hate it when a really good player gets hurt like that,\" Beard said. \"I especially hate it this time of year.\"\n\nWhile the Texas Tech players celebrated into the night -- or early morning -- Haas and his teammates got ready to head home, where it is supposed to snow -- again -- this weekend.\n\nIn each locker room, the NCAA places name tags identifying each player by name and number over their designated space. There's an NCAA logo -- naturally -- on each one along with the school's logo. As he sat and talked, the one for Haas's locker was nowhere to be found.\n\n\"I took it,\" he said, forcing a smile. \"I wanted something to remind me that we did get here. No one can take that away from us.\"\n\nAnd no one was more entitled to take home one final memento than Haas.",

                "body": "Nearly two years after launching a presidential campaign that frequently attracted criticism for comments about Latinos, President Trump is still trying to convince the demographic group that the GOP is the party for them.\n\nAt a Friday press conference for the signing of the $1.3 trillion spending bill, Trump used the moment to convince the nearly eight in 10 Latinos that voted against him in the 2016 election that his party supports them more than anyone else.\n\n\"I can tell you this, and I say this to DACA recipients, that the Republicans are with you. They want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats fought us,\" Trump said. \"But I do want the Hispanic community to know and DACA recipients to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats who are using you for their own purposes.\"\n\nTrump threatened to veto the bill earlier in Friday because he said young undocumented immigrants known as \"dreamers\" were \"totally abandoned\" in the bill.\n\nWhether Latino voters believe the GOP is on their side, they at least don't approve of the president's job performance.\n\nAccording to the most recent Gallup poll, only one in five Hispanic voters approve of the job that Trump is doing.\n\nBut even beyond job performance, the overwhelming majority of Hispanic voters have concerns about Trump's character. According to the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, three-quarters of Hispanics say Trump is a racist.\n\nMany conservatives -- including Latinos -- reject the idea that the Democratic Party provides a better alternative for Latinos than the GOP. Steve Cortes, president of the Trump Hispanic Advisory Council, previously wrote for Fox News:\n\n\"For far too long, the Democratic Party has shamelessly exploited race and ethnicity to create predictable voting blocks. But, despite big promises at election cycles, those same politicians have consistently failed to deliver tangible solutions to communities of color, as recent years see both a widening economic inequality vs. white households and a marked recent upturn in violent urban crime, which disproportionately afflicts blacks and Hispanics.\n\nIn contrast, in just nine months in office President Trump has already delivered real results for Hispanics in three key areas ... with much more promise ahead!\"\n\nBut other political strategists aren't sure that many Latino voters will be able to get past the messages they have heard from Trump and some GOP leaders related to DACA, misleading stats about MS-13-related gang violence and other issues.\n\n\"A whole generation of minority voters is essentially hearing the GOP tell them, 'We don't like you,' \" Doug Heye, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee, previously told the Post. \"That might not have sunk the GOP against a flawed candidate like Hillary Clinton, but the demographics are moving into a direction where this will be political suicide.\"\n\nUnless things change significantly -- as in the president and Congress proposing policies that Latino voters consider important -- the GOP could continue to push voters away.",

The largest marches outside of Washington are expected in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Demonstrations are also taking place in Parkland, Fla., where a shooting that killed 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School became the catalyst for the marches, and in Las Vegas, where a gunman killed 58 people at a country music festival last year.\n\nA march is also planned in Jonesboro, Ark., on the 20th anniversary of a shooting at a middle school there that killed four students and a teacher.\n\nIn Parkland, Anishka Milleret pushed a wheelchair through the grass and up-and-down the small hill locks at Pine Trail Park to make sure her children were present at the city's rally.\n\nHer daughters, Dianna and Deanna Milleret, are 16-year-old twins, both sophomores at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. Deanna's cerebral palsy requires her to be in a wheelchair much of the time. It was rough going on the park's bumpy turf Saturday morning , but that didn't stop them.\n\n\"They both have memories of that day, and they're both dealing with it in their own ways,\" Milleret said.\n\nAlong with the trauma of being in school during the shooting, the Millerets had the added anxiety of not being able to locate Deanna for hours afterward. She was evacuated along with hundreds of other students to a nearby hotel, but it took her mother hours to get to her.\n\n\"I'm hoping things can get back to normal at some point,\" Milleret said. \" I think they will. I hope so.\"\n\n[March for Our Lives: The nation's capital has been preparing for weeks. Today, the voices will rise. ]\n\nProtests against gun violence are taking place worldwide, some with just a handful of people and others comprised of large crowds. Groups gathered outside the U.S. Embassies in Copenhagen, London and Stockholm; in London they shouted \"gun control now.\" In Tokyo, people gathered at Shibuya Crossing, holding signs with the names of people killed in mass shootings. In Frankfurt, a group walked down a street shouting, \"no guns in our schools.\" In Sydney, a group of children held posters.\n\nSupporters of stricter gun control hold placards during a solidarity rally with 'March For Our Lives' outside the U.S. Embassy in London on Saturday. The movement March For Our Lives held global protests in order for people worldwide to show solidarity with victims and survivors of U.S. gun violence.

But she still planned to march.\n\n\"She's with friends from school, and they're going to march on Saturday down the streets of Prague,\" her mother, Audrey Diaz, said.\n\nCounterprotests by gun-rights supporters are also expected in places including Boston, Boise, Salt Lake City and Valparaiso, Ind.\n\nIn Utah, the organizers of the pro-gun March Before Our Lives wrote on Facebook: \"We march in support of the rights, lives, safety, and security of our children. We shall defend ourselves, our families, and those that cannot, or will not defend themselves, utilizing any means at our disposal, including our rights under the 2nd Amendment.\"\n\n[Warm coats, dress shoes and messages to lawmakers: Parkland students head to D.C. for gun-control march ]\n\nIn New York, a relatively small group compared to January's Women's March gathered near Central Park, where the stage was set for speakers.\n\nProtesters raise signs during a \"March For Our Lives\" demonstration demanding gun control in New York City on Saturday. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nProtesters were enthusiastic, with fewer signs and no chants like other marches.\n\nDr. Steve Auerbach, a pediatrician, arrived early with a coalition of physicians from multiple doctors' groups representing the city's big hospitals to get a place front and center in front of the stage.\n\n\"I used to do ER work in Los Angeles and Atlanta and saw pediatric gun violence on a daily basis,\" Dr. Auerbach said. \"As a pediatrician and a father I find it appalling, the ease of access to guns.\"\n\n[Tenacious new gun researchers are determined to break cycle of mass shootings ]\n\nIn Columbus, Ga., about a dozen organizers set up a stage in the city's downtown, curious how many people would attend an anti-gun rally in the conservative city.\n\nSix-year old Vivian Anderson was ready to wave her hand-drawn sign -- after she gets out of ballet class.\n\n\"This is a family thing,\" her mother, Alexa Johnson-Anderson, said. \"The fact that my kids are having to do lockdown drills.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The White House on Saturday issued a statement praising youths participating in demonstrations against gun violence in Washington and around the country, where many participants are calling for tougher gun-control measures than President Trump supports.\n\n\"We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in the statement, in which she added that \"keeping our children safe is a top priority of the President's.\"\n\nMany of those participating in the demonstrations, dubbed the March for Our Lives,\" are advocating far more aggressive steps than Trump has endorsed, such as a ban on assault weapons.\n\n[ March for Our Lives: The nation's capital has been preparing for weeks. Today, the voices will rise. ]\n\nThe protests are expected to draw hundreds of thousands of protesters to the nation's capital and sister rallies around the country. The events were organized by by students who survived the mass shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nThe White House's statement was issued as Trump spent time at Trump International Golf Club here, located about 35 miles from Parkland.\n\nEarlier this month, the White House vowed to help provide \"rigorous firearms training\" to some teachers and formally endorsed a bill to tighten the federal background-checks system. That legislation was included in the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress this week.\n\nBut the White House backed off Trump's earlier call to raise the minimum age to purchase some guns to 21 years old from 18 years old.\n\nOn Friday, at Trump's direction, Attorney General Jeff Sessions also announced that the Justice Department is proposing a regulation to define bump stocks, a device that makes a semiautomatic weapon fire like an automatic one, as machine guns under federal law, effectively banning the device used by a gunman in Las Vegas last fall that killed 58 people.",

                "body": "One by one, the teenagers tearfully shared their stories: a South Florida high school student with a relative who accidentally shot himself; her classmate, who calls herself part of the \"post-Columbine generation\"; a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High student with green streaks in her hair, who recalled leaving campus \"not knowing if you were going to make it out alive.\"\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) sat at the head of the long table in his wood-paneled office as the teens -- four students from Stoneman Douglas and four from South Broward High, in Hollywood, Fla. -- explained Friday why they had traveled to Washington to lobby for better gun control. They spoke about how they feared they would live in a country where mass shootings -- like the one that shattered their community -- would become more common.\n\n\"I don't really now how to put into words what it felt like,\" said Madelynn Dittman, an 18-year-old senior at Stoneman Douglas, describing the day a gunman killed 14 of her classmates and three adults. Her voice cracked. \"But it's a feeling no one should have to go through.\"\n\nSaturday, these students are joining thousands of other young people to rally for greater gun restrictions, an event certain to be boisterous and loud. But on Friday, they quietly shared their grief and pain with lawmakers in Congress behind closed doors.\n\nThe students were part of a group of 200 young people who arrived in D.C. from South Florida to meet with lawmakers and share their experiences with gun violence and to attend the March for Our Lives. The trip was organized by Giffords, the gun-control group founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot at a constituent event in 2011 in Tucson. The organization also arranged for students from several other cities to come to the District, including Tucson.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School students Totu Seitieva, 18, and Madelynn Dittman, 18, listen to Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) during a meeting on gun violence Friday. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nFriday's event came less than 12 hours after Jaelynn Willey, a 16-year-old shot by a classmate at her school in Southern Maryland, was taken off life support, succumbing to her injuries just before midnight. She marked the third school shooting fatality since the massacre at Stoneman Douglas.\n\n[Teenager shot by fellow student at Maryland high school dies]\n\nThe day started off with a news conference in front of the U.S. Capitol, where a bevy of students stood behind lawmakers. Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) credited teen activists for encouraging Congress to confront the issue of school shootings. Wednesday night, as part of a spending bill, it allocated $50 million for school security improvements and approved money to bolster the background check system used to screen potential gun buyers. It also lifted a provision that barred the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from studying gun violence.\n\n\"The Stoneman Douglas students have energized the nation. High school students, college students from around the country will be marching here in Washington and in more than 800 cities all across this country and across the globe,\" Deutch said.\n\nStudents from Stoneman Douglas and from Chicago and Minneapolis spoke Friday, urging members of Congress to take action to stop gun violence.\n\n\"We students have become victims of our government's glaring inaction,\" said Demetri Hoth, a Stoneman Douglas senior. \"But never again. We have come here today to hold accountable politicians and their disturbing inaction. Never again will our voices -- student voices -- be shunned into silence.\"\n\n[Thousands of U.S. children who endure school shootings are never the same]\n\nIn the crowd with them was Lori Alhadeff of Coral Springs, Fla., wearing a thin sweater despite the brisk winter-like weather. She hugged a framed portrait of her 14-year-old daughter Alyssa, who was one of the 17 people killed at Stoneman Douglas. As she listened to the words of young people whose lives were undone by gun violence, she stroked the frame as if caressing Alyssa. Shestruggled not to cry.\n\nShe carried a backpack in bubblegum pink, a bulletproof model she purchased for herself and her other children after Alyssa's death.\n\nHad Alyssa survived, Alhadeff said, she would have been in the District alongside her classmates advocating for greater gun control. Alyssa, a natural leader and captain of her soccer team, once famously left behind instructions for her soccer coach when she could not make a game.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Alhadeff said. \"She would be the loudest one. She was the smallest one with the biggest voice.\"\n\n[My daughter died at Parkland. It's now my job to be her voice.]\n\nIn the private meeting, Kaine told the students what other Democratic lawmakers had said all day: They had already made a difference, advancing efforts to keep people safe from gun violence.\n\n\"You have started something that is in­cred­ibly powerful,\" Kaine said. \"I just say, just keep it up, please.\"\n\nHe compared them to African American children who marched in Birmingham to protest segregation in 1963. The images of police officers setting fire hoses and dogs on their small bodies and the news of their arrests marked a turning point in the Civil Rights movement.\n\n[Children have changed America before, braving fire hoses and police dogs for civil rights]\n\nAt the meeting's close, Dittman asked Kaine for a favor: \"Can you pass a message on to your colleagues from me?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" he said, \"tell me.\"\n\n\"So obviously, not all of you agree on gun control. Obviously, it's controversial,\" Dittman said. \"But I just wanted to say that when you really think about it, it's not a political issue.\"\n\n\"It's a human issue. It's a life or death issue.\"",

A school of color?' \" said Imani Romney, a junior at Richard Wright Public Charter School. \"I told her I don't know. But that doesn't mean we should stop fighting. And that doesn't mean we should sit back and watch and let more of these things happen.\"\n\nThey spoke to hundreds holding signs with the faces of D.C. teenagers who were fatally shot. Volunteers passed out free coffee and Dunkin Donuts, while the Board of Elections staffed a table with materials for people to register to vote ahead of the June 19 primary.\n\nThe \"Rally for D.C. Lives\" was organized by the local chapter of Moms Demand Action, a grass-roots arm of the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety. But it also gave an opportunity for the city's elected officials to rally against a Republican-controlled federal government.\n\nMayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) urged national action on gun control, pointing out that the District has some of toughest gun restrictions in the country.\n\n\"Our laws doesn't help us if Virginia doesn't pass common-sense gun laws, if Maryland doesn't pass common-sense gun laws, and we have illegal guns coming into our city,\" Bowser said. \"That is why we need federal action, so we have gun laws that affect every state.\"\n\nMuch of the anger was directed not at the National Rifle Association or President Trump, but at Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R), who has proposed a bill eliminating the District's gun laws.\n\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the city's non-voting representative in the U.S. House, called him the \"ultimate villain.\"\n\n\"Special shame on Marco Rubio, who has just lost 17 precious lives in Florida,\" Norton said.\n\nElected officials said the student-led movement was the best hope for finally changing gun laws nationally. \"The adults have failed. It's time for something new and different,\" said D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), flanked by six of his colleagues. \"We want to hear from the students.\"\n\nAs the rally wrapped up around 10 a.m., attendees walked toward the national March for Our Lives, shouting \"free D.C.\" as they passed the U.S. Capitol.",

It is hard for anyone -- even a hardened candidate -- to unseat a congressman in a primary.\n\nBut there are harsher explanations, as well -- ones that carry meaning for liberals as they try to broaden their influence in this year's midterms and beyond.\n\nNewman, who described Lipinski as a \"Trump Democrat\" with \"hate in his heart,\" was no doubt echoing the anger felt by many on the left -- but in doing so may have alienated many of the voters she needed to inspire to her side.\n\n\"It certainly was not the way I recommend a race be [run],\" said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus and one of five Democrats to back Newman over their colleague. \"People want to actually like the person they are going to vote for.\"\n\nNewman campaigned as though she saw left-wing suburban politics as the future -- and she counted on voters seeing it that way. In speeches and interviews, she said she was \"running with the district,\" and referred to polling -- not every candidate does that -- to prove that her issues were popular. On Saturday, millions are expected to march in gun-control protests, an issue that Newman had worked on as a spokeswoman for Moms Demand Action.\n\nBut the Newman race showed some Democrats that their base did not necessarily want to replace incumbent Democrats with candidates who hit the ideological mark.\n\nThe tumult that ousted Republicans during the Obama years and drove Republicans to the right on immigration and environmental issue is not being repeated on the left. Lipinski, who proudly touted his \"F\" rating from the National Rifle Association, offered just enough Democrats a trustworthy brand and some coherence on their issues.\n\n\"Newman was trying to galvanize the progressive vote in the district, and I think her judgment was that stridency was the way to affect that,\" said David Axelrod, the Chicago-based strategist for Obama's campaigns. \"I wouldn't make that a template moving forward.\"\n\nWhose template was it? Newman did not run against Lipinski as a superior legislator. She ran as an avatar for a new suburban politics: pro-abortion rights, pro-gay rights, pro-immigration and, above all, for government investment in social welfare. Her biggest early boost came when three chapters of Indivisible, the liberal lobbying group founded after President Trump's win, officially endorsed her.\n\nThe focus on a race outside of Chicago's urban center, in an upscale, heavily white congressional district, represented a quantum leap of sorts for many on the left. Sociologists Lara Putnam and Theda Skocpol, writing in the liberal journal Democracy, have identified the leftward trend in the suburbs, saying it is growing \"farthest and fastest outside of the metropolitan cores where local Democratic Party patronage structures still persist.\"\n\nThe activist surge has surprised some state Democratic organizations, those with sturdy machines and those that had petered out. But the activists, brimming with idealism, have sometimes let it work against them. Newman's friendlier critics say that that happened in her race, days before the vote. With early voting underway, and with Lipinski fighting off her primary challenge, Newman's campaign staff formed a union.\n\n\"My co-workers and I are coming together to assert our power,\" said Eric Holmberg, Newman's field organizer, on March 9. \"This campaign is all about living up to progressive values. We formed a union to enact those values in our own workplace.\"\n\nPublicly, Newman's political endorsers said nothing. Privately, they questioned the timing. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who had broken with her party to endorse Newman, mobilized her own campaign team -- she faced no primary in her safe North Shore district -- and vans full of canvassers sped down Interstate 90 to help out.\n\nTogether with Newman's own team, they nearly pulled it off. Newman fell just 2,124 votes short of beating Lipinski, according to the most recent Associated Press vote count. From election night on, her supporters described the defeat as a temporary setback, a reprieve for a center-right Democrat who had no right to represent a safe seat. Schakowsky described it as a setup for wins to come.\n\n\"People thought for a long time that the machine in that district was invincible,\" Schakowsky said. \"What we absolutely showed was that it is not. I think that sends a strong message about 2020.\"\n\nLipinski won precincts in the city of Chicago by a landslide, a victory for that rattled but resilient Democratic Party machine. But Newman won the suburbs, in a race her supporters were happy to describe as the party's past against its ideological future. He had the municipal trade unions; she had teachers, nurses and service employees. He had antiabortion activists knocking on doors; she had NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood Votes and Our Revolution, the grass-roots group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nLipinski was a natural target because his district seemed impossible to lose. Republicans had abandoned their own candidate in the race, a white supremacist denounced by the party. Trump had won just 39.9 percent of the vote in the district and had grown less popular since then.\n\nWhen Lipinski bemoaned the \"tea party of the left,\" Newman's supporters asked what the problem was; the tea party movement had won. In a January fundraising email for Newman, NARAL president Ilyse Hogue described the Lipinski district as safely blue, implying Democrats had to police their ranks just as Republicans had policed and purged theirs.\n\n\"With the GOP becoming more and more ideologically extreme in its opposition to abortion rights,\" she wrote, \"we simply can't afford to let anti-choice Democrats off the hook.\"\n\nBut Lipinski got off the hook. One reason, according to campaign veterans and endorsers, was that the party's voters are more heterodox than their party.\n\nQuade Gallagher, an organizer with the Newman-backing group Reclaim Chicago, said that canvassers had long conversations with voters, sounding them out and trying to sell Newman's candidacy based on the issues they cared about. To their surprise, some Democratic voters remained personally conservative and apparently responsive to attacks that Newman was not supportive of religion.\n\n\"At one door, we heard that Marie Newman wanted to jail nuns,\" said Gallagher. \"That was obviously a fabrication.\"\n\nNewman's supporters said that her toughest opponent had been time. Some national groups backed her early, but most local Democrats assumed she could not win. Emily's List, which exists to elect women who support abortion rights, did not endorse Newman until six weeks before the primary. (It made its first endorsement of the 2018 cycle in June 2017, for a candidate who will not face a primary until this summer.) Lipinski had done nothing to anger municipal labor unions, so they never took a look at his opponent.\n\n\"Look, this was a Democratic primary, and critical forces in the labor movement stayed with the incumbent,\" said Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), who endorsed Newman. \"The labor movement needs to have a conversation between members who are making $40, $50 an hour going up against members who are making less than minimum wage.\"\n\nIn the wake of Newman's defeat, liberals are still poring over goals for 2018 and targets for 2020. Just three House Democrats voted for a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy when Republicans introduced it this year. Just two -- Lipinski and Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.) -- represent districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn an interview, Cuellar dismissed the groups that backed Newman as hobbyists who had \"no clue\" about what voters wanted in districts like his. He had won his seat by beating a more liberal Democrat and held that same Democrat off in a rematch.\n\n\"They came after me twice, and I beat 'em,\" said Cuellar. \"LBJ used to say: What's the difference between a cannibal and a liberal Democrat? Cannibals don't eat their own.\"\n\nMark Guarino and Sean Sullivan contributed reporting.",

                "title": "How the nerve agent in the spy attack and other toxins cause widespread contamination",
                "body": "The recent attempted poisoning in Britain of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter has led to warnings about the spread of the toxic chemical used in the attack. Hundreds of people who visited the restaurant where the attack is thought to have taken place have been told to wash their clothes to avoid any chance of contamination with the suspected Novichok nerve agent.\n\nThe danger to the public is thankfully thought to be minimal, with only a small risk coming from prolonged, repeated exposure to the tiny amounts of the chemical.\n\nBut how do experts know what the danger really is in a situation like this? To assess the situation, they need to consider how much of the chemical was released, how it came into contact with people, and how it spreads and degrades in the environment.\n\nWe can be exposed to chemicals through our skin, by breathing them in, eating them or injecting them into our blood. And the exact route can make a huge difference, just as breathing in oxygen keeps us alive but injecting it can kill us.\n\nThe most toxic compounds are lethal even in tiny doses. For example, the botulinum toxins, the most toxic substances ever discovered, can kill with just a few nanograms per kilogram of body weight if injected into veins or muscles. If inhaled, the lethal dose is in the tens of nanograms per kilogram of body weight.\n\nMany of the best-known lethal substances, such as cyanide and arsenic, must be ingested to take effect. But other deadly compounds can be absorbed simply by touching them. This was what happened in the case of Katrin Wetterhahn, a Dartmouth College professor in analytical chemistry who accidentally dropped a small amount of dimethylmercury onto her latex-gloved hand. As this compound easily diffused through latex, it was taken up by her body through the skin. She died of mercury poisoning five months later.\n\nSergei Skripal was poisoned with one of a class of nerve agents known as Novichok agents and chemically described as organophosphorus compounds. They act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which means that they disrupt the central nervous system. These compounds can come in solid, liquid or gas form, and we know that nerve agents work when ingested or inhaled. But it's not yet clear what specific chemical compound was used in this case and how it was administered. Because of this, we don't know how much of the agent was needed or how the victims were exposed.\n\nHow dangerous a chemical can be also depends on how easily it can spread and contaminate the environment. The physicochemistry of a substance plays an important role here. Arsenic has a melting point of over 600 degrees Celsius (about 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit), so if it were sprinkled into food, it would be unlikely to travel far from the plate because it is solid at room temperature.\n\nBut lethal compounds dispersed as gases, as in the alleged use of chlorine gas in the Syrian civil war, can result in the instant spread of the chemical across a wide area. This means the compounds can affect many more people, although as they become more widely dispersed they become less harmful to individuals because the doses received are lower. Similarly, poisons in liquid or aerosol form as well as radioactive solutions can be easily transferred from one surface to another.\n\nOnce they've entered the environment, chemicals often begin to change or break down, rendering them less harmful over time. For example, when chlorine gas comes into contact with an oxidizable material, such as wood or clothing, it changes into a harmless, inert chloride compound.\n\nRadioactive materials\n\nIn the case of radioactive material, how long the substance is dangerous depends on how quickly its atoms lose energy, a process known as radioactive decay and measured by what's called a half-life. When another former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, was assassinated in Britain in 2006, the murder weapon was radioactive polonium-210 put into his cup of tea. Polonium-210 has a half-life of 139 days, meaning after this time half of its atoms have emitted an alpha particle and decayed into polonium-206 atoms.\n\nThis alpha radiation emitted inside his body after he had drunk the poisoned tea was what made Litvinenko ill and killed him a month later. But those who came into close contact with him, such as his nurses, would have been much less exposed to the radiation. Alpha particles do not travel a long way and are stopped by even minor obstacles such as a piece of paper or human skin.\n\nOrganophosphorus nerve agents including Novichok and sarin, which was used in the 1995 Tokyo subway attack that resulted in 13 deaths, are unstable and break down gradually over time or when exposed to water. This is why washing your clothes after being exposed to such a compound could be enough to get rid of it. In fact, organophosphorus-based nerve agents are so unstable that they are often stored as two or more separate compounds and then combined when needed.\n\nThe ability to react easily with other substances is what makes lethal chemicals so dangerous, to both their intended victims and innocent bystanders. As a result, these aggressive substances do not typically linger for long. But if they encounter something that holds them on its surface until it releases them again, this can extend their potentially damaging lifetime. Metallic door handles are a good example for the transfer of material from one person to another.\n\nFor those cleaning up a contaminated site, all these factors are vital to understanding what they are facing and how they can prevent anyone else falling victim to a deadly chemical.\n\nThoss is a lecturer in sustainable chemistry at Bangor University in Wales.

So we've gathered some recipes from our archives that we hope will encourage you to spend less time in line at TJ's and more time in the comfort of your kitchen.\n\nMinty Carrot Chicken, above. There are more onions and carrots than meat in this recipe, and we appreciate that emphasis on plants -- but if you were to add more meat (cooking in batches as necessary), you could easily stretch this to feed six to eight hungry people. The big chunks of carrots become earthy and bright thanks to ground turmeric and ginger-garlic paste, and a not insignificant amount of fresh mint stirred in at the end makes this dish extraordinary. A tip: If you can't find ginger-garlic paste, you can mince/mash a few more cloves of garlic with about a one-inch piece of peeled, fresh ginger to get the same effect.\n\n[ Dinner in Minutes: One-pan chicken with a saucy, Middle Eastern accent ]\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nButter Chicken. Yep, you can make the restaurant classic, often referred to as murgh makhani, at home. It's as simple as smothering some cooked chicken a rich, spiced sauce. (Preferably you'll use home-cooked Tandoori Chicken, but the butter chicken recipe includes simple instructions if you're without.) In between bites, read the story of the family that invented both of these iconic dishes.\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nPaneer and Pea Curry With Sweet Potato Hash. This is a simplified version of the dish matar paneer -- with garam masala replacing a longer list of spices and a sweet potato hash taking the place of basmati rice. Fresh or frozen peas add a pop of green, while canned tomatoes deliver a hit of acidity.\n\n(Goran Kosanovic for The Washington Post)\n\nRice Vermicelli With Dill and Green Chiles. Here's a quick side dish to add to your rotation. The vibrant combination of dried rice noodles, green chile, fresh ginger, turmeric and dill is quite versatile -- serve it with fish, roast chicken or eggs, for example.\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nSpiced Spring Vegetables and Coconut Polenta. Now that you've mastered polenta, give yourself a fluffy upgrade by adding some unsweetened coconut (either dried or grated fresh or frozen). We're very on board with the mix of spring vegetables suggested here, but those are adaptable to what you've got on hand. As to the chana dal (skinned, split black chickpeas), urad dal (split black lentils) and curry leaves -- the first two add a nice textured crunch and nuttiness; the latter a lovely fragrance. You can make the dish without them, says Chitra Agrawal, the author of the recipe; but if you do get them, you'll find plenty of ways to use them up -- start with the suggestions listed here.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nHummus is great, but these simple chickpea recipes might be better\n\nSpicy candy is going to be big this year.

                "title": "Can Facebook restore public trust after privacy scandal?",
                "body": "CHICAGO -- It's a scandal of privacy, politics and an essential ingredient of business success -- public trust.\n\nFacebook is confronting a costly, embarrassing public relations debacle after revelations that Cambridge Analytica may have misused data from some 50 million users to try to influence elections. Among its marquee clients: President Donald Trump's general election campaign.\n\nNow a company known as much for reminders of a long-lost friend's birthday and documentation of acquaintances' every whim is grappling with outrage -- and the possible loss of confidence -- from users around the globe that have made the social media site a part of their daily routine.\n\n\"I trust somebody until they give me a reason not to trust them,\" said Joseph Holt, who teaches business ethics at the University of Notre Dame. \"And Facebook has increasingly given me reasons not to trust them.\"\n\nLosing that would be a disaster, not just for Facebook, but for any Silicon Valley company that relies on users to open up their private lives.\n\nThe amount of trust placed in technology has soared. Cars sync with cell phones. Refrigerators know when there's no more milk and reorder it. Virtual assistants field answers to nearly any inane question.\n\nAnd with each turn of the steering wheel, sip of milk or request for dinner reservations, a trail of digital crumbs is left for companies to collect, analyze and profit off.\n\nThe public has largely been willing to accept the trade-off, knowing in exchange for giving up some data, Netflix will offer spot-on show suggestions, Amazon will prompt a diaper order and Google will figure out what to search before a user finishes typing it.\n\nNot everyone understands the darker side of data brokers in an always-connected society.\n\nEvery time a person shops online or at a store, loyalty cards linked to phone numbers or email addresses can be linked to other databases that may have location data, home addresses and more. Voting records, job history, credit scores (remember the Equifax hack?) are constantly mixed, matched and traded by companies in ways regulators haven't caught up with.\n\nWhile Facebook let slip data profiles on millions of people, \"it's much more than that,\" says James Grimmelmann, a professor at Cornell Law School. \"Trying to pin down any one breach as being the source of all the privacy harms out there is futile.\"\n\nFor Facebook, whose power and value are built on being so ever-present in people's lives, the impact has been immediate -- its share price is down nearly 14 percent since the scandal broke March 16.\n\nInvestors fear that Facebook users will start to think twice before posting the latest snapshots of their puppy, or clicking \"like\" on a news story or movie trailer.\n\n\"It's something that's going to remain in people's memory,\" says Mike Chapple, a University of Notre Dame professor with expertise in cybersecurity. \"I think it's changed people's perceptions.\"\n\nAfter the scandal broke, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized, admitted his company's mistakes and said security needs to be enhanced to protect users' data. He noted that this is a major trust issue for the public.\n\nIt follows closely on the heels of the company acknowledging it helped spread fake news and propaganda from Russian-linked trolls disrupting the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhile some disenchanted Facebook users have deactivated their accounts, others point out that breaking up can be hard to do. If a credit card company or an airline's data is breached, it's easy enough to switch allegiances. But for most of Facebook's 2 billion users there's no real substitute, says Aaron Gordon, a partner at Schwartz Media Strategies, a Miami-based public relations and crisis management firm.\n\n\"It's a lot harder to just up and leave,\" he says. \"So you go to Twitter or Instagram? It's not the same.\"\n\n(Besides, Instagram is owned by Facebook.)\n\nHolt, the business ethics professor, loved Facebook, but with all that's come out, he feels like he's in an abusive relationship. He estimates he cut his usage from about 30 minutes daily to about 10 minutes every other day and would happily flee altogether if a viable alternative emerged that more zealously protected data.\n\n\"I haven't left it yet, but I go less often and I feel less good about it,\" he says.\n\nFacebook is not the only company to deal with misuse of private information that has weakened public confidence. Equifax, the credit reporting agency, and Target, the retail giant, both suffered massive data breaches affecting tens of millions of people. Wells Fargo faced stiff government fines for a fake accounts scandal.\n\nThe public tends to get numb to this steady drumbeat of bad news, says brand strategist Rachel Brand.\n\n\"People pick their battles and daily outrage,\" she says. \"Facebook messed up royally, but most people are on a daily outrage roller-coaster and aren't sure if this is the hill worth dying on.\"\n\nMatt Sedensky reported from New York.

                "title": "Mindfulness meditation is huge, but science isn't sure how, or whether, it works",
                "body": "Meditation: It's celebrated as a therapeutic tool to help ease stress, anxiety, depression, addiction and chronic pain. It's come into vogue as a way to enhance human performance, finding its way into classrooms, businesses, locker rooms and smartphones through apps such as Headspace and Calm. Various forms of meditation are now routinely offered to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nIn particular, mindfulness meditation, which focuses one's attention on the present moment, is wildly popular and has ballooned into a billion-dollar business, according to the market research firm IBISWorld.\n\nBut for all its popularity, researchers don't know exactly what the mindfulness version of meditation -- or any other kind of meditation -- does to the brain, how it influences health and to what extent it helps physical and mental challenges. People have practiced meditation for thousands of years, but psychologists and neuroscientists have studied its effects on humans for only a few decades. And many of those studies have used only small numbers of subjects, lacked follow-up and generally been less scientifically rigorous than other medical research.\n\n\"There is a common misperception in public and government domains that compelling clinical evidence exists for the broad and strong efficacy of mindfulness as a therapeutic intervention,\" wrote a group of 15 scholars in \"Mind the Hype, \" an article that appeared in January in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science. Yet the reality is that mindfulness-based therapies have shown \"a mixture of only moderate, low or no efficacy, depending on the disorder being treated,\" the scholars added, citing a 2014 meta-analysis commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\nMuch more research is needed before scientists can say what mental and physical disorders, and which individuals, can be effectively treated with mindfulness meditation, they conclude.\n\nStill, some studies do suggest that meditation that promotes mindfulness can help people relax, manage chronic stress and even reduce reliance on pain medication. Psychologist David Creswell, who directs the Health and Human Performance Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, thinks that sitting still and focusing one's attention on the mere act of breathing, the core of many mindfulness meditation practices, can help.\n\nCreswell first became interested in mindfulness meditation when he took courses on psychology and Buddhism in high school. Later, he began studying meditation in connection with reducing stress and improving overall health.\n\n\"As a scientist, I'm never convinced. I've been trained to be skeptical,\" he says. \"Nonetheless, I do think that there were a number of experiences I had while on meditation retreats that really struck me as very foundational.\"\n\nIn a 2017 review of the scientific studies involving mindfulness, Creswell cites, for example, a 2003 study showing a correlation between practicing mindfulness and a number of indicators of well-being, such as self-esteem and life satisfaction\n\nSome of the most impressive studies to date involve a treatment called mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, which combines meditation with psychotherapy to help patients deal with thoughts that lead to depression. Randomized controlled trials have shown that the approach significantly reduces the risk of depression relapse in individuals who have previously had three or more major depressive episodes.\n\nResearch bears out that people spend most or all of their day being anything but mindful. They skip from one thought to another. They daydream. They ruminate about the past. They worry about the future. They self-analyze and self-criticize.\n\nIn a 2010 study, Harvard researchers asked 2,250 adults about their thoughts and actions at random moments throughout their day via an iPhone app. People's minds wandered 47 percent of the time, and mind-wandering often triggered unhappiness, the scientists reported.\n\nFrom breathing to the lab\n\nSo alongside clinical work, neuroscientists now want to know how, if at all, mindfulness meditation might change what actually happens inside the brain. Does it make certain regions more active than others, or more robustly connect one region to another? Does it result in new neurons, actually changing brain structure? Some studies suggest the answer is yes.\n\nNeuroscientists have studied the physical effects of meditation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other techniques for about 20 years. During this period, there has also been growing appreciation that the human brain can change throughout adulthood, even into old age -- forming new connections and neurons when someone learns a new skill, challenges themselves mentally or even just exercises.\n\nThe emerging view of a brain that can be continually shaped through experience, dubbed neuroplasticity, replaced the long-held idea that after the first few decades of life, the brain's physiological trajectory was basically one of decline. A number of brain studies suggest that mindfulness meditation may spark neuroplastic renovations in the brain's function and structure.\n\nLooking under the hood with fMRI, scientists have found that mindfulness meditation may spark renovations in the brain's function and structure. It appears to activate a network of brain regions that includes the insula (associated with compassion, empathy and self-awareness), the putamen (learning) and portions of the anterior cingulate cortex (regulating blood pressure, heart rate and other autonomic functions) and the prefrontal cortex (the hub of higher-order thinking skills such as planning, decision-making and moderating social behavior).\n\nSome studies suggest that mindfulness meditation may increase gray matter density in the hippocampus, a brain region essential to memory. But what that means for real life is unclear. \"We need to understand the benefits that the changes in the brain have on behavior and well-being,\" says Britta Hölzel of the Technical University of Munich, co-author of a study that found evidence of an increase in gray matter density. \" 'Changing the brain' sounds very impressive, but we don't understand what it actually means.\"\n\nIt's uncertain, too, whether such changes in brain activity can be sustained when the individual is not actively meditating, and if so, how much people would need to meditate for that to happen.\n\n\"Most of the data has only looked at changes over the course of two months of [meditation] practice. . . . Most people feel that [meditation] continues to change and get deeper with extended practice. So we need to conduct studies that follow people for much longer time points,\" said one of Hölzel's co-authors, Sara Lazar, of Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nA buffer against stress\n\nBased on their own work, Creswell and his colleagues have proposed that mindfulness acts as a buffer against stress. It does this by increasing activity in regions of the prefrontal cortex that are important for \"top-down stress regulation\" while reducing activity and functional connectivity in regions associated with the brain's fight-or-flight stress response -- in particular, the amygdala.\n\nTwo studies by Creswell and his colleagues on small groups of unemployed adults experiencing stress show some initial findings that seem to support their view. Both examined the effects of three days of intensive mindfulness meditation training. One report found reduced functional connectivity between the right amygdala and a brain region that plays a role in modulating emotions.\n\nAnother reported increased connectivity between regions engaged when the brain is at rest and parts of the prefrontal cortex involved in regulating stress. That study also found that mindfulness meditation led to reduced levels of interleukin-6, a biomarker in the blood for systemic inflammation that's elevated in high-stress populations.\n\nPTSD, anxiety and pain\n\nSimilarly promising results were presented in a 2016 study of 23 combat veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq with PTSD. Brain scans before and after 16 weeks of mindfulness-based group therapy revealed increased connectivity between a network in the brain that allows people to control their attention and other parts of the brain involved in rumination and spontaneous thought. The level of connectivity was significantly correlated with a reported improvement in PTSD symptoms, including emotional avoidance and hyperarousal.\n\nThis particular connectivity has been seen in healthy people, as well as in people who have meditated for long periods, says study co-author Anthony King, a clinical psychologist at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"What's important about our study . . . is that people with PTSD can also have this change in brain connectivity patterns when they do mindfulness practice,\" King says.

It really is not,\" he says.\n\nStill, people who use mindfulness meditation to ease daily stress say they're convinced the practice improves their lives. One day, scientists hope to link that experience to what's physically happening in the meditating mind.\n\nThis article appeared in longer form in Knowable Magazine.\n\nRead more\n\nAll those small daily stresses are bad for you.

                "body": "John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, speaks during the American Conservative Union's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Md., on March 3, 2016. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nPresident Trump's appointment of John Bolton as his new national security adviser has created a stir among foreign policy experts. He is known for expressing extreme skepticism about international institutions (including the United Nations, where he served as U.S. ambassador in the George W. Bush administration). He has advocated a preemptive strike against North Korea. And he has also repeatedly proposed \"regime change\" (meaning \"war\") in Tehran.\n\nSince the latter issue is one of the trickiest facing the Trump administration, it's worth taking a closer look.\n\nBolton's hawkish views on Iran mirror those of Israel, Saudi Arabia and one of his key ideological partners, the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK).\n\nToday the MEK bears little resemblance to the highly organized, influential and militant opposition force that it was in Iran while seeking to topple the shah during the 1979 revolution. Initially it worked in cooperation with the clerical government. In fact, children of several top officials in the Islamic Republic joined the MEK.\n\nWhen it became clear that the MEK could no longer coexist with the ruling Islamic Republic Party, some MEK members withdrew from the group, while others were imprisoned. They either recanted and returned to society or were executed.\n\nThose who were left fled to Iraq, where Saddam Hussein, who invaded Iran in 1980, gave them a haven. Many took up arms and fought against their Iranian countrymen, earning the group the unofficial nickname monafegheen, or the \"hypocrites.\" That title has stuck, and most Iranians inside the country, regardless of their political tendencies, refer to them as such.\n\nThe group is loathed by most Iranians, mainly for the traitorous act of fighting alongside the enemy.\n\nBut it is the group's activities in the decades since that have cemented its reputation as a deranged cult. For decades its command center was a compound in Iraq's Diyala province, where more than 3,000 members lived in virtual captivity. The few who were able to escape told of being cut off from their loved ones, forced into arranged marriages, brainwashed, sexually abused and tortured.\n\nAll this was carried out under the supervision of the group's leaders, Massoud and Maryam Rajavi, the husband and wife at the top of the organization's pyramid. He has been missing since the U.S. invasion in 2003 and is presumed dead. She now runs the group and makes regular public appearances with her powerful friends from the West -- such as Bolton.\n\nThe group was long a fixture on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations for having killed American citizens. Bolton and others successfully lobbied to have the designation removed in 2012. That did little to change how average Iranians think of the organization.\n\nIn the seven years I lived in Iran, many people expressed criticism of the ruling establishment -- at great potential risk to themselves. Some hoped for regime change by military force, others dreamed of a return of the monarchy and many more wanted to see a peaceful transition to a secular alternative to clerical rule. In all that time, though, I never met a person who thought the MEK should, or could, present a viable alternative.\n\nBut apparently that doesn't matter to its supporters in Washington.\n\nOf course they were paid for their loyalty. \"Very few former U.S. government officials shilled pro bono for the MEK,\" said a former State Department official who worked on Iran. Among the long bipartisan list of people who have taken money from the group in exchange for speaking at its events are former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean. Bolton, the former official told me, was also paid.\n\nTheir many efforts failed to the block the nuclear deal with Iran. Despite the long list of nefarious acts still carried out by Tehran, the biggest threat that Iran posed to international security -- the issue that our allies and other world powers all agreed needed to be resolved -- has been resolved.\n\nBased on U.S. assessments and those of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran appears to be complying with the nuclear deal.\n\nTo those who claim that the nuclear deal isn't working, regime change remains the only solution. For the MEK, and Bolton, if his words are to be taken at face value, the only path to that could be war. The group has long been prepared to do whatever it takes to see that happen, including presenting fake intelligence about Iran's nuclear program.\n\nA dividend of our protracted negotiations with Iran is the increased knowledge we now have about the Islamic Republic and the population it rules over. It's a luxury we didn't enjoy in 2003, when exiled figures like Ahmad Chalabi were able to convince the Bush administration they could help transition Iraq into a thriving democracy.\n\nWe know enough about Iran that we can't fool ourselves into thinking that the MEK could ever provide a viable alternative to the current regime.\n\nThe MEK is the type of fringe group that sets up camp across the street from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and hands out fliers filled with unsubstantiated claims. This is America -- we let crazy people talk. That's their right, and I would never suggest that they be prohibited from doing that. But giving the MEK a voice in the White House is a terrible idea.\n\nIn John Bolton they have someone who will do it for them.",

                "body": "OTTAWA -- In a scene more common in Canada's neighbor to the south, a shootout at a Toronto bowling alley last weekend left a suspected gang member dead. A 29-year-old woman was caught in the crossfire and later died at a hospital.\n\nFor a country proud of its largely peaceful streets and much lower levels of gun violence than in the United States, a recent rash of gang-related shootouts has captured public attention and reignited calls for stricter gun controls.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is heeding those calls, announcing this week a proposed law that would require more detailed background checks for gun owners and force retailers to maintain records of gun sales for at least 20 years.\n\nThe move comes as the United States is grappling with the fallout from the school shooting last month at Parkland, Fla., that left 17 dead and prompted a renewed wave of legislative efforts to tighten gun laws. It also sparked the March for Our Lives, which is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of teens and adults at protests against gun violence in Washington, D.C., and cities across the country Saturday. Similar marches are also planned for cities in Canada.\n\n[The one number that shows America's problem with school shootings is unique]\n\nThe Canadian-made Enfield rifle is seen at a gun store in Vancouver, B.C. Gun retailers in Canada would be required to keep records of firearms inventory and sales for at least 20 years under government legislation introduced Tuesday. (Jonathan Hayward/AP)\n\nCanadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who proposed the gun-control legislation this week, has pointed out, using official government statistics, that gun-related homicides in Canada are \"up by two-thirds\" since 2013. He recently convened a special guns and gangs summit in Ottawa to map out possible actions to counter the trend.\n\n(The minister's claim of sharply higher gun crime has since been challenged by criminologists and statisticians, who argue that 2013 was a year with the lowest homicide rate in almost 50 years and that the overall rate of firearm homicides is up but not dramatically so.)\n\nFirearms are already much harder to acquire legally in Canada than in the United States, and the frequency of gun-related violence is markedly lower. But there is a long tradition of hunting and firearm ownership, particularly in rural parts of the country.\n\nThe previous Conservative government successfully courted the pro-gun constituency and in 2012 dismantled the decade-old firearms registry for rifles and shotguns, which was criticized by opponents as a waste of money and an intrusion into their right to hunt and shoot. Mandatory registry of handguns and other \"restricted\" and \"prohibited\" weapons remained in effect.\n\nThe Trudeau government's proposal would force all firearms vendors to maintain records and inventories of transactions and keep those records for 20 years. The records would be accessible to police only if they first obtain a warrant.\n\nGoodale said the government did not intend to revive the scrapped firearms registry and is proposing a system similar to the record-keeping required of gun sellers in the United States. But Sheldon Clare, president of the National Firearms Association, the most outspoken of Canada's gun-owner groups, called the move the start of a process of \"civil disarmament\" and a backdoor path to a new government registry system.\n\n\"It's another unnecessary set of firearms-control regulations and a regime that will have nothing whatsoever to do with preventing any crimes,\" Clare told a radio station in Vancouver.\n\n[Everyone knows Americans own more guns than residents of any other country. But why?]\n\nThe legislation would also require the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which issues firearms licenses, to examine a person's entire life for potential problems, including criminal convictions. The current requirement mandates a five-year background search.\n\nThe new law would tighten rules on transporting restricted weapons, making it necessary to obtain authorization each time owners wished to take their guns anywhere other than a shooting range or club.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, a government agency, there were 223 firearm-related homicides in Canada in 2016, 44 more than the previous year. In Toronto alone, there were 51 firearm-related deaths in 2016, almost double the 27 reported a year earlier. The United States, which has roughly 10 times the population of Canada, reported 11,004 firearm homicides in 2016.\n\nYet criminologists note that Canada's homicide rate has been in decline for more than 20 years and even the rate of gun-related homicides is virtually unchanged over the past decade. It's only by being selective in the years being compared that it looks as if there has been a surge, they say.\n\nWendy Cukier, president of the Coalition for Gun Control, said she was pleased that the Trudeau government was following through with its 2015 election promises to tighten gun control but she wasn't convinced that the changes were significant.\n\nShe noted that the supply of restricted and prohibited firearms has more than doubled in Canada over the past decade and she was concerned that a firearm like the AR-15 could still be sold as a restricted weapon.\n\nA.J. Somerset, an author and gun owner from London, Ontario, who has studied gun culture in Canada and the United States, said that legal acquisition of a firearm remains much more difficult in Canada than in most parts of the United States. Before buying a gun, an individual has to take a mandatory one-day safety course (two days if it's a restricted weapon), go through a detailed background check and a mandatory 28-day waiting period. The whole process takes at least 45 days, Somerset said.\n\nIn the case of restricted weapons, like the AR-15, there are strict rules for storage and transportation of the firearm. \"You can only shoot it at an approved range and you need a permit to transport it to an approved place,\" Somerset said. \"You can't just throw it into the trunk of your car and drive around with it.\"\n\nSomerset said that the two major gun problems facing Canada are the large number of suicides with firearms, which are usually legally acquired, and the surge in gang-related shooting incidents. Many of the weapons used by gangs are firearms smuggled into Canada from the United States. \"We have a very porous border,\" he said.\n\nRead more\n\nHow the NRA has shaped the world's gun laws\n\nMass shootings: How U.S. gun culture compares with the rest of the world\n\nTrump supports arming some teachers in the U.S. Other countries have different ideas.\n\nToday's coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",

                "body": "Both Giancarlo Stanton and the Yankees could make home run history this season. (Lynne Sladky/AP)\n\nHome runs are being hit out of major league ballparks at a historic rate. Players hit 6,105 home runs last season, an all-time high and more than 400 more than the previous record set in 2000. Many factors contribute to the surge -- warmer weather, smaller ballparks, emphasis on launch angles and perhaps a change in the baseball itself -- yet there are no signs of it slowing down any time soon.\n\nIn fact, we may see the team home run record, established by the Seattle Mariners in 1997 with 264 home runs that season, fall not once but twice in 2018.\n\n[ MLB tried to debunk 'juiced balls' theory amid historic home run spike. Pitchers remain skeptical. ]\n\nThe most likely candidate to establish a new home run mark is the New York Yankees. The Bronx Bombers acquired Giancarlo Stanton, the reigning National League MVP and one of the best right-handed power hitters in the game, from the Miami Marlins this winter, giving them both of the league's leading home run hitters from 2017: Stanton, who hit 59 home runs last season -- the most in MLB since 2001, when Sammy Sosa hit 64 and Barry Bonds set the single-season record with 73 -- and AL rookie of the year Aaron Judge, who hit 52. They will join Gary Sanchez (33 home runs in 122 games in 2017), Didi Gregorius (25 home runs in 136 games) and Brett Gardner (21 home runs in 151 games), giving the Yankees one of the more potent run-producing lineups in the majors this summer.\n\nAccording to 2018 projections, the Yankees are estimated to hit 279 home runs, 15 more than the Mariners in their record-setting season. Stanton's forecast calls for 58 home runs, the most in the majors, with Judge contributing 42, tied for second most with Joey Gallo of the Texas Rangers. Sanchez and Greg Bird are expected to hit 31 home runs each, Gregorius is penciled in for 21, and four other players in pinstripes -- Gardner, Neil Walker, Aaron Hicks and Brandon Drury -- are projected to hit 12 or more in 2018.\n\nIf healthy, Stanton should not only lead the league but could make a play at 62 home runs or more. According to Baseball Prospectus's park factors, Marlins Park was the seventh-most-difficult home run-hitting park for right-handed batters in 2017. Yankee Stadium, meanwhile, was tied as the second-most favorable park in baseball for right-handed home run hitters. Based on his 2018 projections, Stanton has an 11 percent chance to hit 62 or more home runs next season based on 600 plate appearances and a slight chance (1 percent) to hit 70 or more. Judge's outlook is less optimistic but still robust: He has almost a 50/50 chance to hit 40 or more home runs over 600 plate appearances and a 5 percent chance at 50 or more.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles also have a chance to become the all-time home run kings. Manny Machado and Chris Davis are each expected to hit 34 home runs in 2018 with Jonathan Schoop expected to add 31 of his own. Five other players -- Mark Trumbo (29), Adam Jones (28), Trey Mancini (25), Colby Rasmus (22) and Tim Beckham (22) -- have forecasts calling for more than 20. As a result, Baltimore is estimated to finish the season with 269 home runs overall, five more than Seattle hit in 1997.\n\nSo how likely are we to witness history in 2018? Using the projections from FanGraphs, the Yankees have a 75 percent chance at breaking the record while the Orioles have a 52 percent chance. Skeptical? Even if you cut those chances in half they are still high enough to potentially make the 2018 season one for the ages.\n\nRead more:\n\nNo tanking here: By signing Alex Cobb, Orioles make one last push to contend in the Machado era\n\nBrewers' tribute to 'The Sandlot' puts a funny spin on a beloved movie (with a twist)\n\nShohei Ohtani's spring struggles underscore the difficult path to two-way success in MLB\n\nAaron Judge warned of tampering after recruiting Orioles' Manny Machado to Yankees\n\nAfter bold, bland and cool, the Nationals' new manager says, let's have fun",

                "title": "Modified Pap smears provide early detection for two deadly gynecologic cancers",
                "body": "The Pap test has already reduced the incidence of cervical cancer by more than 60 percent. Now it may help in the early detection of two other gynecologic malignancies -- ovarian and endometrial cancers -- that have been notorious killers because they're typically caught so late.\n\nA new study has found that by genetically analyzing the harvest of cells from a Pap smear, doctors could identify 81 percent of endometrial cancers and 33 percent of ovarian cancers. Some of those cancers were in their earliest stages, when they're more likely to respond to treatment.\n\nWhen the Johns Hopkins University researchers tested an alternative means of collecting cells -- a longer brush that sweeps cells from the lining of the uterus -- they positively identified endometrial cancer in 93 percent of cases and ovarian cancer in 45 percent of cases.\n\nAnd when they added a blood test to the ovarian cancer screening regimen, they were able to detect that deadly cancer in 63 percent of patients who had it.\n\n\"Having the possibility to detect these cancers earlier is very exciting,\" said Nickolas Papadopoulos, a co-author of the study, which was published last week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nIt's the latest example of how scientists hope to detect cancer earlier and with greater precision by looking in blood and other easily accessible fluids for cells that bear the telltale genetic mutations of cancer.\n\nWhile such \"liquid biopsies\" have not yet made their way into widespread use, they hold the promise of revolutionizing cancer screening.\n\nIn January, the same research team presented promising findings in the journal Science on a blood test -- called CancerSEEK -- that's capable of detecting malignancies of the liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colon, lung and breast. Also last week, they published findings in the journal eLife on a urine test to detect cancers of the urothelial tract or urinary bladder.\n\nAs a screening test for cervical cancer, the Pap smear has been a staple of gynecologic checkups for more than six decades. It's named for George Papanicolaou, the physician who first showed that cancerous cells of the cervix could be detected by microscopic inspection.\n\nThe Pap test has dramatically driven down deaths from cervical cancer, which used to be one of the most common cancers in women. However, the test does a poor job of detecting endometrial or ovarian cancer, which together kill about 25,000 women in the United States each year.\n\nWomen thought to be at high risk of those cancers are sometimes screened with a blood test that detects an immune system biomarker called CA-125, or with a transvaginal ultrasound that looks for telltale thickening of the uterus's endometrial wall. But those tests fail to detect many cancers and they send up a lot of false alarms, so they're frequently not used until a woman complains of symptoms.\n\nThe result is often a diagnosis at an advanced stage, when treatments are more invasive and less likely to be successful.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers measured the accuracy of their PapSEEK test on 1,658 women. They already knew that 1,002 of the women were free of either cancer and that 656 of them had either ovarian or endometrial cancer.\n\nResearchers collected cervical fluid samples with a Pap smear brush and a slightly longer tool called a Tao brush, which reaches beyond the cervix and into the uterus, nearer to where ovarian and endometrial cancers take hold. Then they used the PapSEEK test to sequence the samples, focusing on 18 genes that tend to develop mutations in those cancers. The test also checked the samples for aneuploidy, the presence of abnormal numbers of chromosomes in cells.\n\nWhen the researchers used the Tao brush, they were able to detect endometrial cancer in all but 7 percent of the women who had the disease and in close to half of those with the ovarian cancers. Combined with the fact that these tests were performed with a mere swipe of the uterine wall, these measures of sensitivity -- the ability to detect cancers that are actually there -- represent a major improvement over the screening tests currently available.\n\nWhen they supplemented the analysis of Pap and Tao brush samples with a hunt for mutated cells in the women's blood, they were able to detect ovarian cancer in well over half of those who had it.\n\nWhen endometrial and ovarian cancers are especially aggressive and when they have progressed to advanced stages, they are easier to find with existing screening methods. But an important measure of a test's usefulness is whether it can detect the most aggressive types of cancer before they have metastasized.\n\nBy that measure too, the PapSeek test looked promising. When it was used to scan the Tao brush samples, it identified 89 percent of the high-grade endometrial cancers in patients while their malignancy was still confined to the endometrium. It was also able to identify 80 percent of those with high-grade ovarian cancers before they had spread.\n\nThe tests were remarkably good at avoiding false-positive signals, which needlessly alarm women and lead to riskier and more-invasive tests to confirm a diagnosis. For both types of cancer, the PapSEEK test's \"specificity\" -- its ability to accurately recognize the absence of disease -- approached 100 percent.",

                "title": "Analysis | Five questions for Stormy Daniels in her '60 Minutes' interview",
                "body": "Porn star Stormy Daniels's highly anticipated interview about her alleged affair with President Trump airs Sunday on CBS's \"60 Minutes.\" There are many questions for her to address, but here are five to watch for:\n\nWhen exactly during a 2006 golf tournament did they have sex, according to Daniels?\n\nThe stated timeline matters, as viewers judge whether Daniels is telling the truth. According to a 2011 interview with In Touch magazine, published for the first time in January, Daniels met Trump and had sex with him at the 2006 American Century Celebrity Golf Tournament in Lake Tahoe. Contemporary news accounts put Trump at the event for at least six days from July 11 to 16.\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told In Touch that she had dinner and sex with Trump one night during the tournament. Former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also claims to have had an affair with Trump, told CNN on Thursday that she too was with the future president at the golf tournament.\n\n\"My first thought is how could [Daniels] have been with him when I was with him?\" McDougal said. \"The only time we weren't together on that particular trip was when I -- he was on the golf course golfing. I didn't go, clearly, but I went to every event, every after-thing, parties, daytime things. I was there. That's why I can't understand.\n\n\"Now, I do remember him saying -- he came in one day and said, 'Oh, there are a bunch of porn stars out there. They were wanting pictures of me.' And I'm like, 'Oh, that's funny.' You know, 'That's cute.' Whatever. I do remember him saying that, but I can't imagine when he found the time, except for maybe the day I left.\"\n\nOne extramarital affair is not a great alibi to deny another. But, as McDougal said, there were evening social events during the tournament -- a John Mellencamp concert, for example -- where Trump might have been seen in public. Daniels's credibility would take a hit if she were to claim to have spent the evening with Trump on a night when other people say he was somewhere else.\n\nOne thing to remember during Daniels's segment: It was taped before McDougal's Thursday interview, so whatever she says isn't expected to be in response to McDougal's claims on CNN.\n\nDoes Daniels have photographs or text messages that indicate a relationship with Trump?\n\nA lawsuit Daniels filed on March 6 to extract herself from a nondisclosure agreement refers to \"certain still images and/or text messages which were authored by or relate to\" Trump. The nondisclosure agreement required Daniels to turn over all such documents and destroy her own copies, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, has suggested that she might have retained evidence of a relationship.\n\n\"Does she still have photos, images, text messages, documents that verify this claim?\" NBC's Savannah Guthrie asked Avenatti on March 7.\n\n\"That's a question that Ms. Daniels will ultimately have to answer,\" Avenatti replied. He added: \"I do know the answer, and I'm not at liberty to disclose it this morning.\"\n\nAvenatti posted another tease on Twitter on Thursday night.\n\nIf \"a picture is worth a thousand words,\" how many words is this worth?????#60minutes #pleasedenyit #basta pic.twitter.com/eCkU0JBZaR -- Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nWho threatened Daniels? How? When?\n\n\"My client was physically threatened to stay silent about what she knew about Donald Trump,\" Avenatti said on CNN last week. \"The details surrounding that she's going to discuss, I'm sure, on the '60 Minutes' interview.\"\n\nThe details are important for a couple reasons. If Daniels can demonstrate that she was threatened before signing the nondisclosure agreement in October 2016, then she might have a better shot at voiding the contract.\n\nAnd the source of the alleged threat, regardless of timing, will dictate how profusely Trump should be concerned. Are we talking about someone connected to the president or a bunch of online trolls who read the first, thinly-sourced reports of an affair, from 2011, and tried to scare Daniels into silence?\n\nWhat's the story behind the $130,000 payoff?\n\nTrump attorney Michael Cohen says he used his own funds to pay Daniels to sign the nondisclosure agreement. The White House has declined to say whether Trump reimbursed Cohen -- or even knew about the payment.\n\nAvenatti said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" last week, without offering evidence, that Trump did know about the payment.\n\n\"Fair to say that your belief that the president directed this payment is based on more than a hunch?\" Willie Geist asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Avenatti replied.\n\nWill Daniels back up the claim on \"60 Minutes\"? And where did the $130,000 figure come from?\n\n\"I think once my client is permitted the opportunity to provide her story that it's going to become apparent as to how that number was arrived at,\" Avenatti told Mika Brzezinski on \"Morning Joe.\" \"I agree with you -- it's a very low number, and I think it flies in the face of accusations by people that somehow she was trying to shake down then-presidential candidate Trump.\"\n\nWhat is Daniels's endgame?\n\nIt is not clear why Daniels has chosen to speak publicly or what she hopes to accomplish. In court documents and in the seven-year-old interview with In Touch, she describes a consensual affair. She emphasized on Twitter on Wednesday that she has \"never claimed to be a victim\" and said she is not being paid to tell her story.\n\nIt is possible that Cohen's pre-election payment for Daniels's silence broke campaign finance law, but exposing such a violation would seem like an insufficient reason to subject herself to such scrutiny.\n\nThe closest thing to a stated motive is in Daniels's lawsuit, which notes that after The Washington Post published the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape in October 2016, \"several women came forward publicly to tell their personal stories about their sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. Around this time, Ms. Clifford likewise sought to share details surrounding her relationship and encounters with Mr. Trump with various media outlets.\"\n\nDaniels ultimately signed the nondisclosure agreement, instead, but the deal did not remain secret. The Wall Street Journal reported its existence in January, prompting In Touch to unearth the 2011 interview it had buried.\n\nAssuming Daniels was not a confidential source for the Journal, it could be that she didn't really choose to speak publicly but felt compelled to talk, since a version of her story was in the open, anyway.",

                "title": "When Daryl Hannah, Neil Young and the son of Willie Nelson made a Netflix movie in three days",
                "body": "Daryl Hannah's directorial debut, \"Paradox,\" was influenced by her environmental activism. (Netflix)\n\nAUSTIN -- On the big screen, Daryl Hannah stands out for her roles in \"Splash,\" \"Wall Street\" and the \"Kill Bill\" movies. But it has been more than a decade since audiences last watched the striking 5-foot-10 blonde strut across the screen in a formidable role. Perhaps that was because she rebuffed Harvey Weinstein in a harrowing encounter that likely cost her many future opportunities, as she revealed to the New Yorker in October.\n\nAlthough admittedly shy, Hannah didn't shrink away from public view entirely. While continuing to work, with bit parts in small movies, the actress became fiercely involved with environmental causes, eventually meeting Neil Young, as the two shared a long history of activism and attended the same rallies -- and now share a romantic relationship. She was even arrested in the District during a sit-in protest of an oil pipeline.\n\nHannah didn't stray too far away from acting, however. She eventually made her way to Netflix, first through the Wachowski sisters' \"Sense8\" series in 2015 and now in her directorial debut, \"Paradox,\" which premiered Friday on the streaming service, and which she filmed very quickly in Colorado before a concert there by Young and the band Promise of the Real. \"We had three days of downtime where we said, 'Wait a minute: Everyone's gotta be hanging around to adjust to the altitude, so let's make a movie!' \"\n\nHannah attends the \"Paradox\" premiere at the South by Southwest festival in Austin. (Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images For Netflix)\n\nIn early March, in a hotel suite overlooking Austin's riverside before the film's premiere at South by Southwest, two of the actors -- Micah Nelson (son of Willie Nelson) and his girlfriend, Alex Dascalu -- joined Hannah to talk about \"Paradox.\" They recalled how the costumes and props were sourced from local vintage stores, thrift stores or Hannah's closet. \"We had no crew, no budget,\" Hannah said. \"We just did it ourselves.\"\n\n\"The teepees are mine; I used to live in one of them,\" she added. \"The tent we rented, so that they [the band] could rehearse and learn a couple of Neil's new songs.\"\n\nHannah, who also wrote the film, created a loose musical journey that follows a pack of musicians -- including Young -- in steampunk and western attire, traipsing through gorgeous strips of the American West in a post-apocalyptic future. The troubadours are played by the band, while Young plays the ominous \"man in the black hat.\" Willie Nelson shows up later in the film for a delightful cameo at his ranch, known as \"Luck, Texas.\"\n\n\"When they're walking into the tent, that's the first time they've ever played that song with Neil,\" Hannah said. She's proud when she says it, knowing well that she caught something special on camera. \"That was the only obligation they had, that they had to play an hour for two days.\" Since the band needed to rehearse for their upcoming show, Hannah worked that into the story line of her movie.\n\nIn spirit, \"Paradox\" is not unlike Joss Whedon's \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" for which he gathered his friends in a house in Santa Monica, Calif., and quickly made a movie. Hannah's film, however, was not full of professional actors. Just a band and their friends. \"I had to be hands-on, because there wasn't anybody else,\" Hannah said. \"It was also improvisational, because we made stuff up as we went along.\"\n\nHannah had to be resourceful. She reused her main cast again as extras, pointing to Nelson and Dascalu as examples. \"When we shot the scene in Luck with Willie, these guys were the townsfolks. And then, Micah also painted the seedbank set. Everybody has to do everything.\" Hannah ordered everyone to \"keep hold of your props, keep track of your costume, drag your own furniture.\"\n\nThe hands-on coaching proved useful. \"I don't act,\" Dascalu said. \"This isn't a thing I do, but it was so easy with Daryl. I knew exactly what she wanted and not wanted me to do.\"\n\nMicah Nelson enjoyed a similar experience. \"We didn't think too much about things,\" he remembered. \"That was Daryl's job. The rest of us were just kind of playing cartoon versions of ourselves.\"\n\n\"It's pretty mind-boggling to watch that movie,\" he said. \"It's just Daryl with her camera yelling, 'Okay, let's all go over here! Okay, no, turn that around!' \"\n\n\"That was the hardest thing, watching the dailies,\" Hannah said. \"I'm yelling all the time. I hated that!\"\n\nMicah assured her, \"That's not an easy thing to do, to have anything other than creativity, a camera and a bunch of weirdos.\"\n\nIn the same way that activism brought Hannah and Young together, the band met Young while performing at Farm Aid and other environmental protests. It was only natural that the group's shared passions for causes made it into the movie.\n\n\"She kind of makes films like Neil makes records,\" Nelson said. \"We just go into the studio, and we'll learn the song as it's being recorded. He loves the life in it.\"\n\nRecording live without a second take means Hannah must work around a scene's mistakes. \"There's something kind of beautiful and inspiring about follies,\" she said. \"It doesn't mean they're worthless because they're a folly.\"\n\nHannah picked up a number of directing tips while working with Lana Wachowski on \"Sense8,\" in which she plays a mother figure to the show's main characters, a group of eight psychics.\n\n\"We had a cameraman on 'Sense8' who operated the steadicam and shot everything,\" Hannah said. \"Lana would just attach herself to him and use and move him around. That's sort of what I ended up doing with C.K. [Adam Vollick, the film's cinematographer] when he was shooting.\"\n\nHannah also learned from Wachowski that calling out directions in the middle of the scene meant she could get more in-the-moment responses from the actors. \"I've never seen a director do that before. She just tells you to do this or look that way. So, I started doing that, which caused me a lot of problems because I don't have the technical crew that she had to clean her stuff up,\" she said and laughed. Maybe next time around.\n\n\"I'd like to make a real narrative film,\" Hannah said. \"Doesn't mean that I won't continue to make guerrilla, homespun projects, which I think I'll always do, because who likes to ask for permission?\"\n\nHannah has seen the difficulty of trying to do her own projects in Hollywood. She said women need \"financing! Backing! I mean, everything, opportunity!\" She pauses. \"Patriarchy is strong, it's fighting. It's not going down easy.\"\n\nAs Dascalu added, sitting beside her, \"At least someone pushed that rock and now it's rolling.\"",

                "body": "Freshman guard M.J. Walker is one of 10 Florida State players averaging at least 10 minutes per game this season. (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\n\nLOS ANGELES -- During the slate of news conferences that take place on days off during the NCAA men's basketball tournament, typically each school will be represented by its head coach, along with two or three players sitting next to him.\n\nBut when Florida State's delegation arrived on stage here at Staples Center on Friday afternoon, Coach Leonard Hamilton was flanked by six players -- so many that they didn't fit at the table.\n\nIt was an unorthodox approach. But for a Seminoles team that's taken the equally unorthodox approach of playing a deep rotation in each of its three tournament wins thus far, it was a fitting one.\n\n\"Well, one of the phrases that we use to represent who we are, we're 18 strong,\" Hamilton said. \"We win games by committee. We might have five guys to start, but they may not be the same five that finish.\n\n\"We believe in that philosophy. That's who we are, that's what it represents, and this represents who we are, the type of program we have, and how much these guys trust each other and trust our system that they feel like they all are important. It doesn't really seem to matter with them who is playing as long as we are winning. This is a bunch of guys that are connected together. They cheer for one another.\"\n\n[ March Madness 2018: Game recaps and news from the Sweet 16 ]\n\nThe conventional wisdom at all levels of the sport is that, as the season progresses and the games take on more meaning, teams shorten their bench and rely more heavily on their star players.\n\nHamilton, though, has disregarded that line of thinking in leading the ninth-seeded Seminoles (23-11) to the West Region final here on Saturday night, where they will play No. 3 Michigan (31-7). No Florida State player averaged 30 minutes per game this season; 10 averaged at least 10 minutes. But rather than shrink his rotation during the NCAA tournament, he has stuck with it. Nine Seminoles played at least nine minutes in their opening win against Missouri, a team that had only eight available players; nine played at least 11 minutes in a second-round upset of No. 1 Xavier; 10 played at least 10 minutes in Thursday's 75-60 upset of No. 4 Gonzaga.\n\nAnd not only is Florida State playing a lot of guys, it's getting production from all of them -- a fact reinforced by more than 60 percent of its scoring coming from its bench this tournament.\n\nFlorida State may not have the same level of future NBA talent it had the past two years, when Jonathan Isaac and Malik Beasley were first-round picks and Dwayne Bacon was taken in the second round. But what it does have is waves of long, athletic players it can throw at the competition -- which is precisely how it wore down Gonzaga.\n\nBefore facing the Seminoles, Gonzaga Coach Mark Few called Florida State one of the most athletic teams he'd seen in his two decades in Spokane. The way Thursday's game played out reinforced that notion.\n\n\"Watching them on tape, the more I watched them, I got a bad feeling in my stomach,\" Few said.\n\nThat feeling proved prescient. Florida State swarmed Gonzaga from start to finish, dominating in points in the paint (38-22) while collecting nine blocks and eight steals. The Bulldogs never looked comfortable, and once Florida State pulled ahead with an 8-0 run to close the first half, Gonzaga was never able to make it a one-possession game again.\n\nMuch of that can be attributed not only to Florida State's depth, but the playing style that comes with it. That's particularly true at the defensive end, where Florida State pressures teams the length of the court and wears them out -- a philosophy the program labels \"junkyard defense.\"\n\n\"Just really getting after it,\" forward Phil Cofer said. \"Just picking up the ball early, and playing hard to exhaustion.\"\n\nHamilton had a slightly more colorful way to describe it.\n\n\"Are you from the Northeast?\" he asked. \"You all have junkyards where you're from? Well, in the South where we're raised, a junkyard is where a lot of broke-down cars are in a big old fence, and they have these ferocious dogs that guard the junkyard so that people won't climb over the fence to go and take parts from cars and try to go and build cars up.\n\n\"So they have these junkyard dogs that just run around all the time, and they're ferocious and they get after you, and they're mean and they're ornery and they're tough. So we adopted the junkyard dog principle because that's the way we want to play. We want to be consistent. We want to be like junkyard dogs that really want to protect their yard.\"\n\nThen he smiled.\n\n\"It doesn't always work, now,\" he said with a laugh. \"Sometimes we run into some junkyard lions, or elephants.\"\n\nIn this tournament, however, it has worked quite well. And if Florida State can use its depth here Saturday night to do to Michigan what it's already done to Missouri, Xavier and Gonzaga, Hamilton and his Seminoles will find themselves in a place program has only been once before, and not in more than a half-century: the Final Four.\n\n\"We are family,\" guard Braian Angola said. \"We're 18 strong ... we go in the game, and we don't care who scores, as long as we win.\n\n\"That's our motto. Just 18 strong, from the last guy on the scout team to the starters. We don't care who plays, or who scores the basket, as long as everybody's happy.\n\n\"We buy into the system, and that's what we're doing right now.\"\n\nMore NCAA tournament coverage:\n\nPorter Moser has led Loyola Chicago to new heights after hitting a career low\n\nLoyola Chicago doesn't need divine intervention to reach the Final Four\n\n'I got shivers down my whole body': Michigan walk-on hits the shot of his life\n\nKentucky Gentlemen?

                "title": "Analysis | The last major act of an anti-spending Congress: A $1.3 billion budget-busting bill",
                "body": "Is a budget-busting bill boosting just about every federal agency really the last big act of Congress before the November midterms?\n\nThis is, after all, a Congress controlled by a party that swept into power eight years ago on an anti-spending, anti-big-government wave.\n\n\"You know, there are a lot of discussions about the fact that maybe the Republican Party has lost its soul,\" Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who is retiring, said in a floor speech hours before the early Friday morning vote.\n\nThere is no rule that says they can't do more this year. But this week's $1.3 trillion spending bill is probably their last major achievement, as Congress observes what has become a tradition in these hyper-partisan times, settling into gridlock and girding for the midterm elections.\n\nThe more than 2,200-page spending bill passed -- and not veoted -- gave the Pentagon its biggest spending increase in 15 years, a top GOP priority. But it also included full funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, despite President Trump's initial proposal to slash their funds from $465 million down to $15 million.\n\nRep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), who also opposed the bill, pointed to the Federal Reserve's hike of a key interest rate this week. He warned that the benefits from the additional spending will hit taxpayers with larger debt and the financing of the more than $20 trillion debt.\n\n\"You're going to eat that up in an interest payment in seconds given the nature of where the rates are going,\" Reed said.\n\nPlenty of Republicans disagreed with that sentiment. More than 60 percent of Republicans in the House and Senate voted for the legislation, a sign that the GOP might be returning to its big-spending ways of early last decade.\n\nBack then, amid a major ramp up in defense spending at the launch of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, Republicans accepted big increases in domestic spending as well and created a new entitlement within Medicare. GOP leaders at the time exploded the earmark system, allowing even the lowliest rank-and-file lawmaker to direct millions and millions of dollars to pet projects in their districts. Republicans believed the big spending helped shore up their incumbents' standing back home.\n\nBy 2006, however, several lawmakers got caught up in FBI corruption probes involving earmarks-for-favors allegations, one of several factors that helped Democrats win the congressional majorities in the midterms that year.\n\nRepublicans changed their stance when Barack Obama won the presidency, disavowing these pet projects and fully embracing the issue of slashing the debt. After winning the House majority in the 2010 midterms, GOP lawmakers forced a major fiscal showdown with Obama that ended with the Budget Control Act of 2011. That law was supposed cut federal spending by nearly $1 trillion through a decade of spending caps to federal agency budgets.\n\nNow, the Republican-led decision to bust those caps for the next two years raises the specter that the tough talk on deficits applied only when Democrats held the White House.\n\n\"Had the 2016 election gone a different way and we had a Democratic president, and we controlled the House and Senate, I can't imagine us being in a situation where we would vote tonight or tomorrow for a bill that's going to add $2 trillion in debt,\" Corker said.\n\nHere's what Congress is stuffing into its $1.3 trillion spending bill\n\nThis time, though, most Republicans embraced the big spending, with one invoking Trump's name as the main reason for his support: \"House Passes President Trump's America First Government Funding Bill.\"\n\nThat was the news release headline from the office of Rep. Tom Graves of Georgia, a staunch conservative whose appointment to the Appropriations Committee earlier this decade seemed to signal that the days of big spending were coming to an end.\n\nRepublican after Republican issued news releases touting victories worth millions, sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds to local projects. Graves, for instance, praised the $103 million directed toward a new project at a Georgia air base and $50 million to help the expansion of the Savannah port.\n\nThe political question going forward is whether this spending can help Republicans in the fall as they face an angry electorate. They're the sorts of projects that might help with middle-of-the-road voters who want to see the government function.\n\nBut the conservative base has spent more than a decade railing against big government spending. While Trump begrudgingly signed the legislation, citing the military spending, he voiced deep reservations about some of the soaring agency funds.\n\nIf those right-wing activists sit out the election, Republicans could be in deep trouble.\n\nOf course, the debt-and-deficit issue has plummeted as a top issue for voters in the past five years.\n\nWhy did the GOP vote for a budget-busting spending bill? Because voters don't seem to care\n\nEven budget hawks like Corker and Reed voted in December for the massive tax-cut plan that would add $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade. Reed explained that he believes the tax cuts will lead to more economic growth and that will make up for the lost revenue.\n\n\"Growth is a part of this solution. What's disappointing is, the spending is a different kind of impact on the deficit. That's a direct bean-counting effect,\" Reed said.\n\nCorker had initially objected to the tax-cut legislation, because of its estimated impact on the debt. Later, just before the final vote in December, he changed his mind and supported the plan.\n\nBy Thursday night, as the debate unfolded on the massive spending bill, Corker returned to his roots as a deficit hawk, stunned by how many Republicans were willing to support such a pork-filled bill.\n\n\"I could not be more discouraged about where we are today with our adult leadership here in Congress and at the White House,\" he said. \"This is one of the most grotesque pieces of legislation I can remember.\"\n\nRead more from Paul Kane's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.",

                "body": "Students sit in silence as they rally March 14 in front of the White House in Washington. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nTens of thousands of people are expected to gather in the nation's capital today for the March for Our Lives, an anti-gun-violence rally organized by survivors of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.\n\nMarch organizers say the event will be a peaceful gathering, \"created by, inspired by and led by students who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings.\"\n\nAnd it is likely to be a big one. Rally organizers have obtained a permit for 500,000 people to rally along Washington's iconic Pennsylvania Avenue NW. City officials have said they anticipate as many or more participants. As of Friday, hundreds of charter buses had been booked to drive students, their friends and relatives to Washington from cities in the Northeast and beyond. More than 300 buses have registered to park at RFK Stadium, according to officials at Events DC.\n\nIf turnout is as projected, this could be one of the largest marches in recent memory in Washington and a near-record-setting event for the region's transportation system. Metro last year had more than one million trips on the day of a historic Women's March on Washington, the transit agency's second-busiest day after another historic event: the first inauguration of President Barack Obama. The Jan. 20, 2009, Inauguration Day registered more than 1.1 million trips.\n\nCity officials said they are prepared to deploy officers to guide pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Security is expected to remain tight on the city's streets and transit network. And the National Guard will be ready to help if needed to help direct and control traffic, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said.\n\n\"Our teams are preparing for hundreds of thousands of people and we are going to be ready for everybody who comes,\" Bowser said earlier in the week.\n\nNot sure how to get to #MarchForOurLives in DC tmrw? Public transportation might be the way to go. Here's everything you need to know if you're taking a bus, train, or the Metro: https://t.co/OXIFhtQ2YY pic.twitter.com/PzK5Bvy61m -- March For Our Lives (@AMarch4OurLives)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nThe rally\n\nDemonstrators will gather on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, from Third Street to 12th Street NW. Organizers said there will be no march because of the large number of people expected to attend.\n\nAccess points to the event are at Pennsylvania Avenue and 12th Street NW, Constitution Avenue and Seventh Street NW, and Indiana Avenue and Seventh Street NW. The program will be broadcast on 20 Jumbotrons along Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThe rally begins at noon, although organizers expect that participants will start arriving hours earlier. The three-hour program will feature celebrities including Jennifer Hudson, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Miley Cyrus, Vic Mensa and Ariana Grande.\n\nStreet closures\n\nNumerous streets will be closed Saturday. The perimeter for the closures extends for several blocks and is bounded by E Street NW on the north, Independence Avenue SW on the south, 14th Street on the west and First Street NW on the east. Parking all along the event perimeter is prohibited.\n\nA full list of street closures can be found here. This map provides an overview of the road restrictions.\n\nParking\n\nMetro has about 60,000 parking spaces at stations throughout the region. Parking costs $2 on Saturdays. But, remember, parking garages near the end of the subway lines fill in early. Officials recommend having a backup plan for parking. There is no parking for buses at the Metro stations.\n\n[ Taking Metro to the March for Our Lives? Here are 4 tips to avoid delays. ]\n\nIf you are planning to park downtown, several parking lots are within walking distance of the gathering location. Use a parking site such as Spothero or Parking Panda to book parking.\n\nIf you arrive on one of the hundreds of charter buses expected to park at RFK Stadium, you can board a train at the Stadium-Armory station to the event or take the shuttle service that will be provided on DC Circulator buses to the event area.\n\nMetrorail\n\nThe rail system opens at 7 a.m., and more trains are running to accommodate the crowds going to the rally.\n\n[ Avoiding rookie mistakes on Metro ]\n\nThe Federal Triangle station will be closed Saturday because of its proximity to the event, Metro said. But all other stations are expected to be open, and there are no plans for track work during the day. The closest Metro stations to the event stage are Archives on the Yellow and Green lines. Other stations close to the rally entry points are Metro Center and Gallery Place. Riders can also use the Judiciary Square and Union Station exits and walk to Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nRiders are encouraged to purchase SmarTrip cards in advance to avoid the crush at fare machines. Each rider age 5 or older needs their own card to enter the system. Metro officials also recommend that you plan your trip so that you don't have to transfer between lines: Each line has a station near Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nMetrobus\n\nThe bus system is running regular Saturday service. But several routes that serve Pennsylvania Avenue will be detoured and delayed. For your trip, consult Metro's Trip Planner (www.wmata.com/schedules/trip-planner). The regular Metrobus fare is $2 using a SmarTrip card or cash.\n\nDC Circulator\n\nThe Circulator has suspended service on its Mall route for the event. But all other routes, including Georgetown-Union Station (which stops a short walk away from Pennsylvania Avenue) will operate normal weekend hours. The Circulator fare is $1 using a SmarTrip card or cash.\n\nBiking\n\nIf you want to ride your bike, there are bike racks throughout the downtown and mall areas. But no bikes are allowed into the rally area. There is a long list of prohibited items here.\n\nCapital Bikeshare stations are nearby. If you plan to use Capital Bikeshare, check its website and app before your trip to see which stations are available. The system will offer a \"corral\" to provide extra parking during the March for Our Lives. The corral will be at Seventh and F streets NW from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nRide services\n\nStreet closures may impact access via taxi and ride hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. Lyft said it is offering up to $1.5 million in free rides to march participants, but they need to provide a promo code when they book their ride. Details can be found here.\n\nA drop-off point for people with disabilities is at 7th Street and Maryland Avenue SW.\n\nRead more:\n\n'Grannies for gun control': These grandmothers are taking to the streets for the March for Our Lives\n\nParkland, D.C. students make plea for tougher gun laws ahead of March for Our Lives\n\nA mom's tweet connected D.C. families with students who need a place to stay during March for Our Lives",

Many of the city's systems were taken offline as a precaution, and Rackley said she couldn't give a definitive timeline for when she expected things to return to normal.\n\nThe airport shut down its Wi-Fi network and the systems that provide flight information and security checkpoint wait times on its website \"out of an abundance of caution,\" spokesman Reese McCranie said in a phone interview Friday.\n\nThe city is working with federal agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as private sector partners, to fix the problem, Bottoms said.\n\nMark Ray, a former FBI cybersecurity investigator who's now managing director and head of digital investigations for Nardello & Co., said the agency's primary goals are to stop an attack and find out who's responsible.\n\nThe agency's first step would be to give practical advice such as isolating the affected systems, preserving and protecting unaffected systems by taking them offline, as well as making sure backups are preserved and secure. Next, the FBI would want to get a sample of the ransomware because it may already have intelligence on that particular malware that could help stop it or it may have a decryption key from a previous attack.\n\nWhen asked whether the city would pay the ransom demanded, the mayor said the city would seek guidance from federal authorities on the best course of action.\n\nThe FBI will never advocate paying ransom, Ray said. There are a variety of reasons for that, including: There's no guarantee the ransomware owner will actually provide decryption after being paid, an organization's willingness to pay can make it a target for future attacks, and sometimes payment results in the unlocking of part of a system but then more money is demanded to unlock more of the system.\n\nBut if an organization chooses not to pay ransom and if there is no available decryption key, \"the alternative is, literally, to slash and burn the environments that have been infected,\" Ray said. \"That's where good backups are critical.\"\n\nRansomware exploits known software vulnerabilities, and often organizations that fall victim to such attacks haven't done a thorough job of patching systems regularly, he said.\n\nMunicipalities often struggle with basic software updates and patching because they are frequently short on resources, said Ryan Kalember, senior vice president of cybersecurity strategy at the security company Proofpoint.\n\nThe Atlanta attack bears the hallmarks of the SamSam ransomware, and what the city's information security team likely saw was something trying to log on from outside the organization, he said.\n\nUnlike most ransomware, which accesses a network when someone clicks on link in a phishing email, SamSam indiscriminately searches the internet for vulnerable servers, Kalember said. Once it finds a foothold -- often by exploiting a weak password or one that doesn't get changed often -- it gets inside a system and starts to spread.\n\nIf it is SamSam, there may be a bit of good news because it typically encrypts the information in place and demands a ransom to restore access to it rather than stealing the information, Kalember said.\n\n\"It's a wakeup call and it's not ultimately that harmful so there's a clear silver lining for municipalities\" because it could motivate the city to put resources and political will behind making its networks more secure, he said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "Statistician Yifan Zhang is part of a search project called LongSHOT that aims to answer some the central questions about gun violence. (Christie Hemm Klok/For The Washington Post)\n\nYifan Zhang was finishing her PhD in biostatistics at Harvard five years ago when news broke of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\n\nAs a graduate student from China, specializing in highly technical design of clinical drug trials, she had little connection to America's long-running debate over gun violence. But even now, she said, the anguished faces of those parents she saw on TV remain seared in her memory.\n\nSo when she heard about a gun-violence research project at Stanford University that could use the statistical skills she had honed on pharmaceuticals, she jumped at the chance.\n\n\"I have a son who just turned one,\" said Zhang, 31. \"When I think about what I will need to teach him about protecting himself, I think about that school shooting.\"\n\nAfter a two-decade recruiting drought, gun researchers say they are suddenly seeing a wave of young scientists entering their field -- an unforeseen consequence of recent mass shootings.\n\nUnlike past generations, the new scientists appear undeterred by the field's lack of funding, dearth of data and hostile political climate. The new contingent has brought energy and fresh approaches to a beleaguered, in­trac­table domain, longtime experts say.\n\nTheir work coincides with a resurgence of gun control activism -- now led by the teenage Parkland student survivors who are mounting this weekend's March for Our Lives -- as well as with increased interest from private foundations and state-level governments in funding such research. And on Wednesday, congressional leaders took baby steps toward lifting what has amounted to a ban on federally funded gun research by issuing clarifying language -- but no new money -- supporting such research.\n\nTogether, the infusion of talent and momentum represents a tantalizing opportunity to finally answer questions that have long plagued the U.S. gun debate: questions about the causes of gun violence, its effects on society and -- most crucial -- the best ways to prevent this brand of violence.\n\nGaren Wintemute, holding a study he conducted on gun shows, at his office at the University of California Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\n\"I've been doing this work for 35 years, and this is different than anything before,\" said Garen Wintemute, one of the country's leading gun-violence researchers. \"You're seeing smart -- mostly young, but also midcareer -- researchers deciding to dive in into this area, which is no easy thing. It's not just the death threats or controversy. There's so little funding that there's often no guarantee you'll even have a job two or three years out. That takes major commitment.\"\n\nFor decades, Wintemute was the University of California at Davis's only senior researcher on gun violence. Then came the San Bernardino massacre in 2016.\n\nIn its wake, the California legislature made a nationally unprecedented decision to fund the kind of gun research that the federal government has long refused to support. That -- combined with new money from his own university and private foundations -- allowed Wintemute to begin hiring, establishing a gun-violence center at Davis with nine new researchers.\n\nAn increase in academic papers published nationwide on gun violence echoes the surge in interest. An analysis published last year in the JAMA Internal Medicine shows that the number of papers hit a plateau from 1999 (when federal funding dried up) to 2012. But beginning in 2013, after a particularly horrific stretch of mass shootings, the numbers rose sharply.\n\n\"When Obama came out after Sandy Hook and said we need to stop these shootings and we need research to do it, that woke a lot of people up,\" said Phil Cook, a 71-year-old who published his first paper on firearms in 1975.\n\nA makeshift memorial created after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nMore than 33,000 people in the United States die by gunfire each year, the highest gun mortality rate among industrialized countries.\n\nIt is one of the country's leading causes of death but receives little research funding.\n\nAs many people die from guns, for example, as from sepsis infection, yet funding for gun research is less than 1 percent of that for sepsis, a 2017 analysi s found.\n\nThe lack of money can be traced to a 1996 rule known as the Dickey Amendment, which was passed by Congress under pressure from gun lobbyists. Technically, the amendment forbids the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's funding from being used to advocate for gun control. But the rule had a chilling effect, choking off grant money at federal agencies and essential data-gathering on gun violence.\n\nMark Rosenberg, who was heading CDC's research on firearm violence in 1996 when the Dickey Amendment passed, said he believed the work his staff was doing could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nBut it all came to a halt when, along with passing the Dickey Amendment, Congress took away $2.6 million from the CDC -- the exact amount previously allocated to Rosenberg's firearms research. A clear message had been sent to other federal agencies and to the researchers who depend on their funding.\n\nThose limitations slowed the research to a crawl. The few studies conducted have been limited in scope and often cobbled together with minor grants or university support.\n\nWintemute started chipping in his own money 10 years ago from personal savings and a family inheritance just to keep his work afloat. He works a second job as an emergency doctor and sticks to an ascetic lifestyle -- old car, low rent and almost no vacations -- to save his money and time for the research. He has poured $2.1 million into it so far.\n\nCraig Bedgood helps set up the Springfield Armory booth before the start of the 146th NRA Annual Meetings & Exhibits on April 27, 2017, in Atlanta. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, criminologists were the main researchers studying gun violence, and they were followed by a wave of public health experts in the 1990s.\n\nThe new generation, however, is coming in from all sorts of disciplines -- economics, statistics, medicine, law and epidemiology. These new researchers had previously focused on other topics.\n\nThat diversity has yielded innovative approaches.\n\nOne study -- published in December by two Wellesley College economists -- used data from Google searches, background checks for gun sales and death records to suggest that the intense debate over gun laws after the Sandy Hook shootings led to increased gun sales, which then led to a sharp increase in accidental gun deaths.\n\nNeither economist had worked on gun issues before. \"We just saw a chart in the newspaper about the rise in gun sales after Sandy Hook, and it brought up so many questions,\" said co-author Phillip Levine.\n\nAnother study -- published three weeks ago by a Harvard physician and an economics PhD student -- found a 20 percent nationwide drop in injuries from firearms whenever thousands of gun owners gathered for National Rifle Association meetings.\n\nStanford's David Studdert and his team want to find out whether owning a gun makes someone more or less safe. (Christie Hemm Klok/For The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the most promising studies underway is a joint venture between seasoned researcher Wintemute and David Studdert -- a midcareer researcher at Stanford, new to gun violence research, who focused previously on medical injuries and car accidents.\n\nTogether, they have hatched an ambitious plan to tackle the central question in gun research: Are you more or less likely to die if you own a firearm?\n\nThe risk-benefit question is, in many ways, what has driven the U.S. gun debate for decades. It is at the crux of President Trump's recent push to arm schoolteachers.\n\nGun rights advocates argue that firearms make people safer, reduce crime and protect families. Gun control advocates say possessing a firearm does more harm than good, increasing risk of accidental death, violence and suicide.\n\nThe risk-benefit question, however, has been extremely difficult to study. One main hurdle is that there is no national registry of gun ownership.\n\nStuddert's group is using a data set unique to California because of the state's strict gun laws. Every time a gun is sold in California, a background check logs the purchase and purchaser with California authorities, who also have been unique in their willingness to share such politically fraught data with academic researchers.\n\nUsing a sample of 25 million people (taken from California's voter registration records), Studdert's team plans to identify handgun owners with the firearm sales records, then compare that against state death records.\n\nThe resulting data in theory will help them determine the relationship -- whether good or bad -- between gun ownership and death.\n\nThey call the project LongSHOT, a nod to the project's scale and ambition.\n\nIn the past two years, Studdert and Wintemute have enlisted the help of seven other researchers on the project -- a mixture of old guard, midcareer transfers and young new scientists like Yifan Zhang.\n\nStuddert has also cobbled together roughly half a million dollars in funding, including a grant from a new consortium of philanthropies that banded together to fund this kind of research.\n\nStuddert and Zhang review gun data at Stanford. (Christie Hemm Klok/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe LongSHOT team hopes to reach its initial results by end of summer this year. Older researchers have told the newer team members to prepare themselves and their families for backlash.\n\n\"There is a nastiness that you have to be prepared for when you publish in this arena,\" said Stanford law professor John Donohue, who pulled Studdert aside to warn him. \"There's a level of implicit threat when you reach conclusions the gun interests don't like.\"\n\nDonohue said he has been accused of treason, sent plaques pronouncing him a traitor and had his address posted online.\n\n\"It worries my family, especially my wife,\" he said. The best protection for researchers is to be vigilantly meticulous in their work. \"Know that everything is going to come under scrutiny. When you make mistakes, admit to them. Otherwise, this arena is going to chew you up.\"\n\nRose Kagawa, 33, said the political fervor intimates her. One of the newly hired researchers at UC Davis, Kagawa said she became an epidemiologist in part because she is introverted.\n\n\"My training is in biostatistics and study design. I have zero experience with politics. So all of this is personally a stretch,\" she said. \"But I look at how car safety research gave us seat belts, how cigarette research saved lives.\"\n\nMaybe it's naive, she said. \"But I really think the research we're doing now could change things in the real world. So I'm going to keep going at it until that proves otherwise.\"\n\nwilliam.wan@washpost.com\n\nRead more:\n\nScarred by school shootings\n\nStudents take the lead, but politicians will be out in force for the March for Our Lives\n\nThe young voices that feel excluded from the March for Our Lives",

                "title": "The hawkish views of Bolton and Pompeo could mark a turning point for Trump",
                "body": "President Trump has been one of the most rhetorically bellicose commanders in chief in modern American history. He's bragged about the size of his \"nuclear button,\" repeatedly threatened military action and used playground taunts to demean America's adversaries.\n\nBut in the first 15 months of his presidency, Trump has been cautious when it comes to actually using military power and putting U.S. forces in harm's way.\n\nThe last two weeks could mark a major turning point in his presidency. In selecting John Bolton as his new national security adviser and Mike Pompeo as his secretary of state, Trump has elevated two of the most consistently hawkish Republicans in Washington.\n\nNow, the question is how these two Trump advisers will change a president with few, if any, fixed views on foreign policy.\n\nBolton, a Fox News commentator and prolific writer, brings a coherent and unusually controversial foreign policy philosophy to the White House. He has been a fervent advocate for using American military power to prevent rogue regimes, such as Iran and North Korea, from acquiring and proliferating nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.\n\n\"He is unabashed about this,\" said Mark Groombridge, a former top adviser to Bolton at the State Department and United Nations. \"He has no problems with the doctrine of preemption and feels the greatest threat that the United States faces is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\n[The return of John Bolton sparks concern around the world]\n\nPompeo has described Iran as \"a thuggish police state\" and a \"despotic theocracy.\" Both men have described the landmark Iran nuclear deal as \"disastrous.\"\n\nTrump was initially drawn to Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who he dismissed Thursday as national security adviser, for his reputation as a warrior in Iraq and Afghanistan. But McMaster's methodical and academic style grated on the president, who often complained that he couldn't stand being around him.\n\nBolton and Pompeo are much more of a stylistic match. \"Trump likes the pugnacious, tough-guy style, and they reinforce it,\" said Eliot Cohen, a former Bush administration official and Trump critic.\n\nThey are also far more savvy bureaucratic operators than McMaster, who had never served in Washington and often tried to wear Trump down rather than woo him.\n\nThe challenge for Bolton and Pompeo will be convincing Trump to support their aggressive plans.\n\nMcMaster pressed the Pentagon for military options to strike targets in Iran. But his entreaties were routinely rebuffed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said U.S. officials.\n\n\"Mattis has been daggers drawn with H.R. on everything,\" said a person close to both men.\n\nIn most of these disputes Trump either backed Mattis or did not weigh in with his feuding advisers.\n\n[Trump's favorite general: Can Mattis check an impulsive president and still retain his trust?]\n\nIn Afghanistan, McMaster took a similarly tough line, pressing Trump to agree, against his own instincts, to double the size of U.S. forces to 15,000 troops and back a strategy that relies heavily on America's ability to improve Afghanistan's inefficient and corrupt government. But Trump never seemed to buy into the new strategy and resented McMaster for pushing it on him, U.S. officials said. Pentagon officials have said that they feel under intense pressure to show progress on the battlefield this year before Trump pulls the plug.\n\nNeither Bolton nor Pompeo share McMaster's belief that U.S. power can or should be used to reshape the world or spread democracy. \"Bolton is almost entirely focused on U.S. national security,\" said David Bosco, an international relations professor at Indiana University who has interviewed Bolton for his work. \"He has very little patience for the idea that the U.S. should be spending blood and treasure to improve other countries.\"\n\nIn that way, both Bolton and Pompeo are much more of an ideological match with Trump. Their biggest impact in the immediate term could be on Trump's planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, scheduled to take place by the end of May.\n\nIn approaching North Korea, Bolton has suggested that Trump should demand that the Kim Jong Un denuclearize and allow international arms inspectors unfettered access to the country -- an outcome most Korea experts say is highly unlikely.\n\nAbsent a total North Korean capitulation, Bolton is likely to press Trump to reject lesser concessions such as a freeze of North Korea's nuclear program, said those who have worked with him.\n\n\"John hates the word 'freeze,' \" Groombridge said. \"Hates it.\"\n\nBolton and Pompeo also share Trump's intense frustration with the nuclear agreement that the United States and five other world powers reached with Tehran during the Obama administration. They will play key roles in advising Trump next month on whether to amend it or drop it entirely.\n\nBolton and Pompeo will likely make their biggest impact on the daily operations of the Trump administration. For much of the last six months, if not longer, McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were widely viewed as weak and wounded players inside the administration.\n\nAs CIA director, Pompeo has spent more time at the White House than previous directors, cultivating a relationship with Trump. He's likely to try to forge deeper ties at the State Department than Tillerson, who often ignored the diplomatic corps.\n\n\"Pompeo has shown that he's committed to working with the team that's given to him,\" said Danielle Pletka, a senior vice president at the American Enterprise Institute. \"At State, he'll hear very different things than what the president wants him to hear.\"\n\nAt the White House, Bolton is likely to reinforce Trump's \"America First\" view of the world. Both the president and his new top adviser share a long-standing animus to any treaties, international laws or alliances that limit America's freedom to act on the world stage.\n\nBolton has also shown that he knows how to influence Trump. Even when he was frozen out of a White House job at the start of the administration, Bolton managed to gain access to the president.\n\nFor a brief period after White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly took over, Bolton was even completely blocked from the Oval Office. But the ban didn't last for long. Bolton won back his contact by drafting a plan to help Trump get out of the Iran deal at the same time that the president's advisers were encouraging him to stay in it.\n\nAs national security adviser, Bolton's former colleagues said he would make access to Trump his top priority. His model: Henry Kissinger.\n\n\"John always said that he admired Kissinger,\" Groombridge recalled. \"His model is very much an imperial-style National Security Council.\"",

                "body": "Just the thought of Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge in the same lineup sent fans into a frenzy. Come opening day, all of baseball will see which teams really have the muscle.\n\nA season of haves and have-nots begins March 29 with Derek Jeter's pared-down Marlins playing the pumped-up Cubs. Later that day, the New York Yankees unleash their most potent pair of sluggers since Mantle & Maris.\n\nMVP Jose Altuve and the World Series champion Houston Astros added ace Gerrit Cole to a rotation with Dallas Keuchel and Justin Verlander. The Dodgers and Indians are still poised after coming within one win of that elusive crown. The Nationals hired a new manager to help free agent-to-be Bryce Harper, Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg reach the top. And the Red Sox got the bopper they needed.\n\nWhere does that leave the Reds, Pirates, Tigers, Rays and A's? Well, better luck next year. Or the year after that.\n\nMajor League Baseball is in a hurry these days, with record home runs and strikeouts the new norm. But please, get that last out in under three hours.\n\nA season that will include games in Mexico and Puerto Rico is set to start. And, if all goes as planned, the final game will come in October.\n\nHere's an early best-of-seven:\n\nWELCOME\n\nSlugger J.D. Martinez moves to Boston, which hit the fewest homers in the American League. Andrew McCutchen and Evan Longoria go to the retooling Giants, Jake Arrieta joins the rebuilding Phillies, Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain become part of the Brewers' outfield, Marcell Ozuna provides pop in St. Louis and Yu Darvish is now pitching for the Cubs. Also, six new managers: Alex Cora (Red Sox), Aaron Boone (Yankees), Dave Martinez (Nationals), Mickey Callaway (Mets) and Gabe Kapler (Phillies) try for the first time, and Ron Gardenhire (Tigers) returns after a four-year absence.\n\nWORTH WATCHING\n\nBabe Ruth or bust? We'll see whether newcomer Shohei Ohtani becomes the most successful two-way player in the bigs since the Bambino. The 23-year-old Japanese star struggled at the plate and on the mound this spring, but it's early. Tampa Ray reliever Jonny Venters has been out of the majors since 2012 while having three Tommy John surgeries. Alex Rodriguez, meanwhile, keeps getting more popular in retirement as he moves into the ESPN booth for Sunday night telecasts.\n\nHIYA\n\nIn a game of numbers, make way for some new letters to go along with ERA, OPS and WAR: MVs. Mound visits will be posted on scoreboards, tracking how many times catchers, infielders, managers and coaches go talk with a pitcher. It's part of MLB's new pace-of-play rules, designed to cut down the incessant back-and-forth between batteries. Teams are allowed six trips without making a change. After that, every visit requires a new pitcher. For sure, this will take a few weeks to sort out. And no shenanigans -- what if a shortstop thinks a reliever is out of gas, and trots to the mound on his own to force a switch?\n\nOUCH!\n\nGiants ace Madison Bumgarner is among several banged-up stars who will miss opening day. Dodgers catalyst Justin Turner, Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, Orioles closer Zach Britton, Milwaukee starter Jimmy Nelson and Blue Jays shortstop Troy Tulowitzki are out, Nationals second baseman Daniel Murphy is doubtful. Mariners ace Felix Hernandez is recovering from being hit by a line drive in spring training, which is how Bumgarner broke a bone in his pitching hand. Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel is healing from hand surgery, then will serve a five-game suspension for making an offensive gesture toward Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish during the World Series. Twins shortstop Jorge Polanco begins an 80-game drug ban, and will be ineligible if Minnesota makes the playoffs.\n\nYUMMY\n\nThe plate will be tasty -- at concession stands. In Texas, the Dilly Dog is a dill pickle, hollowed out and stuffed with a hot dog, served up battered and fried. PNC Park presents Greens and Grains that includes kale, quinoa, sunflower seeds and other healthy items. Fenway Park provides dessert, a creme brulee French toast topped with Vermont maple syrup. Want a bolder option? Try the Rocky Mountain Po'Boy at Coors Field. That's Rocky Mountain oysters, topped with guacamole, pico de gallo and more, on a roll (um, Rocky Mountain oysters aren't really seafood. In Colorado, that's what they call cattle testicles).\n\nFAN-TASTIC\n\nAll 30 teams will have expanded netting to protect fans, reaching at least to the far end of the dugouts. ... At Camden Yards, the Orioles will offer free tickets in the upper deck to kids 9 and under for the first month of the season. ... At the Coliseum, the A's are opening a garden beyond the outfield seats, growing produce and flowers in redwood planters. ... At Dodger Stadium, there will be bar stools behind the plate, plus a painted blue seat in right field to mark where Kirk Gibson's home run landed to win the 1988 World Series opener.\n\nTHE EX FACTOR\n\nFrom Triple-A Pawtucket down to rookie Pioneer League Idaho Falls, extra innings will have a different look in the minors. Every half-inning will start with a runner on second base. They say it'll shorten games and help preserve the arms of pitching prospects. They do this in the World Baseball Classic, international baseball and -- heck -- even Central Park softball. Purists, note: Commissioner Rob Manfred has stated this idea isn't being considered for any major league games that count. For real, right?\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "In new memoir, a top Clinton aide says campaign was 'foolish' not to address email issue more forcefully",
                "body": "Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was \"foolish\" not to mount a louder and longer defense of her government email troubles in its last weeks, when the FBI had suddenly reopened the issue and Donald Trump was using it to thrash Clinton daily, a top Clinton aide concludes in a new memoir.\n\nClinton herself had a gut feeling that she should be addressing the issue more forcefully in those closing days in 2016, but her campaign staff urged a strategy that would show her tackling policy questions that would matter if she won the White House, campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote.\n\n\"It was a mistake, although at the time it was hard to accept that telling Hillary to keep bringing up the emails herself could possibly be the right advice,\" Palmieri wrote. \"But I should have seen that, as unappealing as addressing the issue was, it was what voters needed to hear from Hillary at that moment. She got that.\"\n\nPalmieri's memoir, \"Dear Madam President,\" is a campaign postmortem wrapped in an open letter to the woman who will one day become what Clinton did not -- the country's first female president. It is also a compendium of advice for working women now and in the future, and at times a diatribe against Trump and the campaign he ran. She calls Trump a misogynist and a race-baiter, for starters.\n\n[Trump suggests Comey prematurely exonerated Clinton over emails]\n\nThe email issue that dogged Clinton from the first moments of the campaign runs through Palmieri's book as an annoyance, an enigma, and a cautionary tale about the different standards applied to a woman seeking power. Palmieri maintains, as Clinton does, that Clinton's use of a private email system for her government work as secretary of state was a mistake, but that criticism of it was overblown.\n\n\"One thing our campaign was never able to move beyond was the vexing issue of Hillary's emails,\" Palmieri wrote. \"I think it was the unease people felt about Hillary's motivation as a woman seeking power that made it impossible for use to very fully put this matter to bed. I have weathered a lot of political crises, but never encountered one quite like this. It was a box we could never get out of.\"\n\nThe press and the public kept moving the goalposts for addressing the email issue, Palmieri wrote. She came to believe that whatever Clinton said about it would never be enough, because the matter had become a stand-in for a wider unease about Clinton herself and a woman presidential candidate more generally. Palmieri does not fault Clinton, as many did during the campaign, for a reaction that could appear grudging or defensive.\n\n\"It's not on the level,\" Palmieri said in an interview. \"I would push people about emails, like, 'what is it, why is this so troubling?' and eventually there was not an answer, not a rational answer.\"\n\nNot an answer for why the whole issue was such a roadblock, and also not an answer that would resolve the matter, she said.\n\n\"I realized, there is no right answer\" Clinton could give, Palmieri said.\n\n[Clinton used private email instead of a government address as secretary of state]\n\nThe email system, which was not disclosed during Clinton's time at the State Department, led to an FBI inquiry into whether classified information was put at risk. Then-FBI director James B. Comey shuttered the investigation in July 2016 but did so with a public dressing-down of Clinton that Palmieri notes, gimlet-eyed, was not the usual way to end an FBI investigation.\n\nComey's surprise announcement in October, just 11 days before the election, that he was reopening the inquiry was among the campaign's darkest hours, Palmieri wrote. But Clinton seemed to almost expect it, telling her staff, \"you knew we weren't done,\" Palmieri quotes Clinton as saying, when Palmieri told her the news aboard the campaign plane.\n\nClinton \"knew we weren't going to make it all the way to Election Day without a major new plot twist, and here it was,\" Palmieri wrote.\n\nPalmieri defends Clinton throughout the short book as a woman who faced unimaginable odds over four decades of public life, and who, in Palmieri's telling, understood better than her campaign team how disconcerting a figure she was to many people and how difficult the election would be.\n\n\"Madam President, I believe this to my very core: If it weren't her emails, it would have been something else,\" Palmieri wrote. \"Another issue equally trivial and irrelevant for which Hillary would have been tortured. Because underneath all the questions abut wiping servers and deleting emails lay the fundamental truth that what all of this was really about was there was something about Hillary Clinton folks just didn't trust. And that something was an intelligent, capable, ambitious woman in a position of power.\"\n\nPalmieri gave that unease, that sense of not \"liking\" Hillary Clinton, a name during the campaign, and in the book: TSAHIJDL -- There's Something About Her I Just Don't Like. Clinton has faced TSAHIJDL at least since Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, \"and that was before everything,\" Palmieri said in the interview. Before Whitewater, health care, Monica Lewinsky, Benghazi, or emails.\n\n\"Get to know it,\" Palmieri advised her unknown correspondent in the book, because she said a version of TSAHIJDL will hover around that woman's candidacy and presidency, too.\n\nPalmieri writes that women she respects questioned her decision to \"go back over everything that happened with Hillary in the 2016 campaign,\" on the theory that the account would be seen as complaining about Clinton's treatment. Palmieri writes that she might have agreed, but for the front-row seat she had to what she calls the unfair expectations the public and the press set for her candidate.\n\n\"We need to understand what happened. We need to make the path easier for all women working to succeed in whatever role they choose,\" Palmieri wrote. \"The unease we felt toward Hillary could hold any woman back anywhere.\"\n\nClinton herself has already addressed \"what happened\" in a campaign memoir by that title, which was published last year. It is a more candid and raw book than her previous memoirs, and apportions blame to herself as well as to the same forces Palmieri identifies.\n\nPalmieri wrote that she was among the \"hand-wringers\" who worried that Clinton's memoir would backfire, and only lead to more criticism.\n\n\"Whenever she has set out to explain herself in the past, whatever she had to say has been processed through some weird reverb and ended up distorted,\" Palmieri wrote, adding that to her surprise, \"this time she was heard.\"\n\n[Clinton concession speech: This is painful and will be for a long time]\n\nPalmieri has some standard workplace advice for women -- own your place in the room where it happens, speak up, stop doubting whether you were meant to be there -- and less conventional suggestions, such as to ditch the Botox and go ahead and cry at work.\n\n\"I hope you will see fit to let us see some of your tears, as other presidents have done in recent years,\" Palmieri wrote to the future female commander in chief.\n\nAsked why she chose the letter format, Palmieri said it allowed an assessment of the campaign that also reckoned with the political power that she believes the failure of that campaign has helped to marshal.\n\n\"I chose to not just make it a book about advice around politics or even the workplace, but life lessons as well, because I think what happened on Nov. 8, 2016, was something bigger than a political loss,\" Palmieri said.\n\nIt may be an end to the political rubric that a successful female candidate has to be \"a facsimile\" of a successful male candidate, Palmieri said. That denied Clinton a part of her own humanity, and probably accounts for some of the criticism that she wasn't \"authentic\" enough, Palmieri said.\n\n\"It might not have been a glass ceiling that shattered that night, but something sure did. The way I have experienced it, the fourth wall of the matrix fell,\" she said. \"I realized we -- women, we, me -- we have been thinking about leadership all wrong.\"",

                "body": "Students, teachers, parents and survivors of mass shootings have been streaming into the Washington area ahead of the March for Our Lives, an anti-gun-violence demonstration that could draw hundreds of thousands of protesters Saturday.\n\nThey're arriving in buses, planes and their own cars.\n\nAnd on Friday, they participated in potluck dinners, tailgate parties, sign-making events and live concerts throughout the city on what District officials have described as one of the busiest weekends the city will see this year -- thanks, as well, to the National Cherry Blossom Festival, which begins Sunday.\n\nThe march, billed as a youth-led movement spearheaded by student survivors of school shootings, has galvanized many area families, businesses and organizations to lend their support. Families have opened their homes to visitors. Solidarity \"sibling marches\" have been planned throughout the region and across the nation.\n\nThe main March for Our Lives demonstration is scheduled from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, and due to the expected crowd size, organizers warned, the protest might be less of a march down Pennsylvania Avenue and more of a standing-room-only rally.\n\nThe stage for the March for Our Lives rally, at Third Street NW along Pennsylvania Ave NW. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\n[The extraordinary number of kids who have endured school shootings since Columbine]\n\nMusical performances by Ariana Grande, Common, Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Hudson, Vic Mensa and Broadway performers Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ben Platt will be projected onto 20 giant video screens along the protest route.\n\nIn between, rally-goers will hear from about 20 speakers -- all of whom are under 18.\n\nDeena Katz, president of March for Our Lives, declined to specify who will be speaking, citing safety concerns. Several of the speakers will be students from Washington-area schools who have been affected by gun violence.\n\nBecause the march could draw hundreds of thousands of students, many of them also under 18, officials said they have taken extra care to ensure the safety of protesters.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, working with D.C. police and the mayor's office, set up a system to notify attendees of any security issues, warnings or detours. (Text \"March 24\" to 888-777 to sign up.)\n\nMedical tents staffed by volunteers will line the protest route, doubling as emergency reunification points should groups get separated. Water will be available to protesters and food trucks will be allowed to line up nearby.\n\n\"As the young men and women from Parkland, Florida, have been preparing for Saturday's event, the District has been preparing to keep them safe here in Washington,\" Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said this week.\n\n[Bowser -- the 'mayor who hates guns' -- champions March for Our Lives and steps into national spotlight]\n\nThe event will be held along Pennsylvania Avenue NW from 12th Street to Third Street, where the main stage will be. Participants will be subject to security, including bag checks, before entering the rally area.\n\nD.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham asked for patience from participants.\n\nHe advised visitors to avoid driving, noting that Metro will begin running at 7 a.m. with frequent trains akin to a rush-hour schedule.\n\n\"Be prepared for road closures, increased traffic and parking restrictions,\" he said. \"It is safe to say that generally getting around in our city, starting in the early-morning hours of Saturday, March 24, will likely be more challenging than most other Saturdays here in the District.\"\n\nSeveral groups have designated rallying points where they will meet before heading downtown.\n\nAmong those is Mobilizing MSD Alumni, an organization of former students who banded together in the wake of the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla.\n\nThe school never had an alumni association, with most former students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High staying connected through social media.\n\nThen the shooting happened.\n\n\"When it became clear that the students were organizing and speaking out, our mission became to support them and what they're doing,\" said group founder Judith Danovitch, 39, a Class of 1996 graduate. \"And that's meant helping them with this march -- helping with logistics and money and making sure that any Stoneman Douglas student who wants to go to Washington is able to go.\"\n\nAs of Friday, the group had raised more than $100,000 to bring about 575 students and chaperons to the District.\n\nOrganizers said Delta Air Lines donated two planes for Stoneman Douglas students and teachers who will arrive in the District early Saturday and return to Florida that night, so unchaperoned students will not need to worry about a place to stay.\n\nThe graduates are participating in more than just the march. Some attended an alumni-only happy hour or a show called \"Stay Amped: A Concert to End Gun Violence\" at a concert hall in Southwest Washington.\n\n\"I think for so much of us, to be this involved has been really meaningful,\" Danovitch said. \"We're not just alumni in mourning. From the very beginning, we wanted to do something for our school, for these students.\"\n\n[The March for Our Lives is Saturday. Here's what you need to know.]\n\nBowser and other city officials will host a pre-event rally at 9 a.m. at Folger Park on Capitol Hill. Survivors of other mass shootings are also expected to attend.\n\nBrandon Wolf, a survivor of the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, said he will attend the march as a representative of the Pulse victims, including his friend Christopher \"Drew\" Leinonen and Leinonen's boyfriend, Juan Guerrero.\n\n\"I don't think this conversation is just about schools,\" Wolf said. \"It's about: The current generation is fed up with lawmakers who have done nothing on this issue regardless of which community has been affected. Students, LGBT people, people of color. This issue is intersectional.\"\n\nMarches and rallies that force survivors to relive those horrible moments can trigger strong emotional reactions, Wolf said. Several organizations will be available to assist survivors of violent crimes and rally participants who need support.\n\n\"It's so important to remember that while these teenagers are giving us hope and inspiring us and we want to rest everything we have on their shoulders, they're also kids who have been through something horrific,\" Wolf said. \"Something they will never forget.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nA mom's tweet connected D.C. families with students who need a place to stay during March for Our Lives\n\n'March for Our Lives' gun-control rally bumped from Mall by 'talent show'\n\nMarch for Our Lives gets permits for anti-gun-violence rally along D.C. streets, parks",

This week, amid a period of relative calm on the oft-tense Korean Peninsula, Russian representatives traveled to North Korea to discuss an idea: They should open another bridge.\n\nThough the planning appears to be at a preliminary stage, it may show that Russia and North Korea are looking toward a trading future beyond sanctions and military tensions.\n\nThe two nations have long suggested a crossing that would allow vehicles to go between them without a lengthy detour through China. And Wednesday, the Ministry for the Development of the Russian Far East announced in a statement that the two sides would create a working group on a new crossing.\n\n\"There are 23 automobile checkpoints between [North Korea] and China, and not one with Russia,\" the ministry quoted Ro Tu Chol, a North Korean minister, as saying during the meeting. \"Currently, when importing goods from [Russia's far east], they do not come across the border with Russia, but through China. This greatly extends the path.\"\n\nRo suggested expanding the existing bridge, according to the statement. The Russian representative at the meeting, Alexander Galushka, the minister for the development of the Russia's far east, suggested building a semi-permanent bridge of pontoons.\n\nThe Russia-North Korea summit caught the attention of NK News, which reported that the two nations would \"push ahead\" with the new border crossing. Anthony Rinna, an analyst on Russian foreign policy in East Asia for Sino-NK, told the North Korea-watching publication that the new border crossing could be used to \"alleviate any unforeseen problems, such as logistical or technical glitches that may undermine North Korea's rail links.\"\n\nThe proposed bridge may be more noteworthy for its symbolic value than economic worth, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, an associate scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and co-editor of North Korean Economy Watch.\n\nTrade between Russia and North Korea is insignificant, Katzeff Silberstein added, largely because of multilateral sanctions imposed by the United Nations, but \"there also seems to be a belief that in the longer run, trade will pick back up again.\"\n\nRussia and North Korea certainly have a trading history. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was easily North Korea's most important financial ally, accounting for as much as half of North Korea's foreign trade during the 1970s and 1980s. It was only after the end of communism that Moscow and Pyongyang drifted apart, with Russia's new president, Boris Yeltsin, seeking a closer relationship with Seoul.\n\nThings improved when Russian President Vladimir Putin took power: He visited Pyongyang in 2000 and received adulating praise in North Korean state media. However, the economic links between the two nations did not increase by much: In 2013, Russia amounted to just 1 percent of North Korea's foreign trade, according to one study, far below China.\n\nThough both sides have expressed hope for better economic ties, one detail -- North Korea's international pariah status because of its pursuit of nuclear weapons -- has stood in the way. Russia has supported a number of U.N. votes on sanctions against North Korea; in late December, new multilateral sanctions limited the number of North Koreans who can work in Russia and other countries, arguably the two nations' most important economic link.\n\nArtyom Lukin, a professor of international politics at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, Russia, said it was clear that trade between Russia's far east and North Korea has been hit considerably in the past two years. He said that the railway bridge had once been important for transporting Siberian coal to the North Korean port of Rajin in the city of Rason, where Moscow owns a terminal.\n\nNorth Korean coal piles up in November on a dockside at the port in Rason. (Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"From this terminal, the coal is sent for export to Asian countries, mostly China,\" Lukin wrote in an email. \"At least, this was the case prior to introduction of tough sanctions on [North Korea] in the latter part of 2017.\"\n\nOccasionally, foreign tourists cross the Russian border on trains from North Korea. It happens so infrequently, according to one traveler, that border guards seem confused by it.\n\nFor the time being, Lukin said, it's hard to imagine Russian backers investing in a bridge. \"The North Koreans will expect Russia to provide the funding,\" he said. \"However, no Russian investor, private or state-owned, will commit to the project unless the political risks related to North Korea subside considerably.\"\n\nIf those risks subside, there are obvious benefits for Russia to invest in North Korea. While it is thought to be losing money, the terminal at Rajin port could provide Russia with an important regional foothold if sanctions were lifted. There are also hopes of eventually connecting to South Korea via rail -- a move that could open up a freight route to and from Europe through Russia -- or of a trans-Korean pipeline to provide Russian natural gas to both nations.\n\nAnd so Russia appears to be keeping its economic options open in North Korea. Last year, a Russian firm gave North Korea a new Internet connection, apparently running fiber-optic lines over the railway bridge. Now the Russian state is planning a new bridge. \"Sooner or later North Korea should come out of isolation,\" Lukin said. \"Then the bridge will be in high demand.\"\n\nMore on WorldViews\n\nNorth Korea appears to have a new Internet connection -- thanks to the help of a state-owned Russian firm",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration announced criminal charges and sanctions Friday against Iranians accused in a hacking scheme to pilfer sensitive information from hundreds of universities, private companies and American government agencies.\n\nThe nine defendants, accused of working at the behest of the Iranian government-tied Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, hacked the computer systems of about 320 universities in the United States and abroad to steal expensive science and engineering research that was then used by the government or sold for profit, prosecutors said.\n\nThe hackers also are accused of breaking into the networks of government organizations, such as the Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the United Nations, and private sector entities including technology companies and law and consulting firms.\n\nThe Justice Department said the hackers were affiliated with an Iranian company called the Mabna Institute, which prosecutors say contracted with the Iranian government to steal scientific research from other countries. The institute was founded by two of the defendants.\n\n\"By bringing these criminal charges, we reinforce the norm that most of the civilized world accepts: nation-states should not steal intellectual property for the purpose of giving domestic industries an advantage,\" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in announcing the charges.\n\nThis image released by the FBI is the wanted posted for 9 Iranians that took part in a government-sponsored hacking scheme that pilfered sensitive information from hundreds of universities, private companies and government agencies. (FBI via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nAlso Friday, the Treasury Department targeted the Mabna Institute and 10 Iranians -- the nine defendants and one charged in a separate case last year -- for sanctions that officials say will make it harder for them to do business outside Iran.\n\nThe defendants are unlikely to ever be prosecuted in an American courtroom since there's no extradition treaty with Iran. But the grand jury indictment, filed in federal court in Manhattan, is part of the government's \"name and shame\" strategy to publicly identify foreign hackers, block them from traveling without risk of arrest and put their countries on notice.\n\nIn Tehran, Bahram Ghasemi spokesman of the Foreign Ministry condemned the move and called it \"provocative, illegal and without justification.\"\n\nGhasemi said the charges are \"another sign of hostility of the U.S. government towards Iranian nation.\" He said the U.S will not take any benefit from the move aimed at \"thwarting\" scientific growth of Iran.\n\nThe approach has been employed with past indictments accusing Iranian hackers of a digital break-in of a New York dam, Chinese military officials of large-scale hacks at energy corporations and Russians of a massive breach of Yahoo user accounts.\n\n\"People travel. They take vacations, they make plans with their families,\" said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \"Having your name, face and description on a 'Wanted' poster makes moving freely much more difficult.\"\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Iranians broke into universities through relatively simple but common means -- tricking professors to click on compromised links.\n\nThe spear-phishing emails purported to be from professors at one university to those at another and contained what appeared to be authentic article links. But once clicked on, the links steered the professors to a malicious Internet domain that led them to believe they'd been logged out of their systems and that asked them to enter their log-in credentials.\n\nThose credentials were logged and stolen by the hackers, prosecutors say.\n\nThe Justice Department says the hackers stole roughly 31 terabytes of academic research and intellectual property that was then sent to servers outside the United States for profit. The information that was stolen, which was sold through two websites to customers in Iran, cost U.S. universities about $3.4 billion to procure and access.\n\nMore than 100,000 professors worldwide were targeted with spear-phishing emails. The affected professors and their universities were not identified.\n\n\"Just in case you're wondering, they're not admiring our work,\" Bowdich said. \"They're stealing it, and they're taking credit for it, and they're selling it to others.\"\n\n__\n\nFollow Eric Tucker on http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nTODAY'S DAILY DIGIT\n\nA somewhat subjective rating of the day's weather, on a scale of 0 to 10.\n\n8/10: Compared to much of the week, it's a nice day. Temperatures are near or above 50, the sun is warm, and winds are light.\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Mostly to partly sunny. Highs: Near 50 to mid-50s.\n\nTonight: Mostly cloudy. Lows: Upper 20s to mid-30s.\n\nTomorrow: Partly sunny. Shower? Highs: Mid-40s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nToday's probably still on the cool side of typical for the date, as normal highs are now tickling 60 degrees. But compared to the snow and blustery conditions we've seen throughout much of the week, it should feel like a bit of a breather. It also helps all sorts of local activities go off without a hitch. There's really not much to worry about into early next week.\n\nListen to the latest forecast:\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Saturday): It's an excellent day to march. Or whatever else you might end up doing. I certainly wouldn't call it warm, but it's not as cold as it has been. That sun is strong, too. (Camden says: Remember the sunscreen!) I think most spots head to and past 50. In the city, mid-50s isn't impossible. Sunshine dominates, although high clouds should tend to roll in later in the day. With a relatively docile wind blowing around 5 to 10 mph, we can almost forget that winter just won't go away. Confidence: High\n\nTonight: That storm we've been watching wants to slide to our south and does what it looked like it would do. We don't get snow here from it, but we do see clouds continue to stream by through the night. They may be mostly high level, and there are probably peeks of clearer stuff at times as well. Lows are in the upper 20s to mid-30s. Confidence: High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend ...\n\nTomorrow (Sunday): The wedge (cold air banked up against the mountains) is back on Sunday. Behind that storm system, we drag something of a cold front through the region and well to the south. If we see sun, we may still climb into the 40s and even toward 50. Definitely still some uncertainty here, but let's go with mid-40s for now. This is due to the expectation of partly sunny skies, and perhaps even a rain or snow shower during the midday or afternoon. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Skies remain at least partly cloudy. We'll need to see if a marine layer tries to develop over the area, as they tend to do during wedge setups. This one is a little on the dry side, so it's not certain. Lows are in the 30s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSeasoned local weather watchers know the wedge doesn't give in without a fight. That means Monday is likely to see more cool-air domination. However, we're getting deeper into the almost-warm-season, so this air mass is slightly milder thanks to it becoming stale. Highs should run to 50 or even above, as we see skies turn rather sunny with time. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nBy Tuesday we should be breaking out of that cool air wedge even further, but the pattern is kind of stuck, so I wouldn't guarantee it. The main reason for any change is a cold front advancing this way from the west. We'll see more clouds, but probably also a bit of a surge of air from more of a southerly direction. This helps boost afternoon highs to the near 50 to mid-50s zone. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nSNOW POTENTIAL INDEX\n\nA daily assessment of the potential for at least 1 inch of snow in the next week, on a 0-10 scale.\n\n1/10 (↓): Saturday night storm likely passes well south. We're quickly running out of time for more.",

He received his PhD from Northwestern University.\n\nA silent vigil on the front steps of the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 15, 1969, the day of the widespread Moratorium protests against the Vietnam War. (AP)\n\nOn Oct. 15, 1969, in 10,000 high schools across the United States, students skipped classes to demand a halt to the Vietnam War. The mass demonstration, dubbed the Moratorium, was \"a march against death.\" Protesting a war that seemed all but lost, yet still cost more than $2 billion each month, activists called for a nationwide general strike to stop \"business as usual.\"\n\nStreets filled with rallies and prayer vigils. Church bells tolled and workers struck. Municipal buildings were draped in black crepe, and American flags flew at half-staff. The best estimate was that 2 million Americans demonstrated that day. Life magazine judged the protest \"the largest expression of public dissent ever seen in this country.\"\n\nThe memory of the Moratorium -- its breadth and its limits -- strikingly echoes the strident efforts of high school protesters today. The survivors of the Feb. 14 massacre at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., have taken the vanguard to insist on not just \"common sense\" but thoughtful and significant gun reform. And like antiwar dissenters' general demands for peace, the #NeverAgain movement has called more often for systemic change rather than a specific plank of reforms. The Moratorium experience reveals that beginning a process of reform takes time, but persistence may eventually pay off -- both in ways seen at the time and ones not visible for years to come.\n\nThe key to the Moratorium was its multiplicity and creative force. The Vietnam Moratorium Committee was headed mostly by young veterans of Eugene McCarthy's 1968 campaign for the presidency. They aimed to channel the nation's discontent surrounding the war into mass protest, following the example set by civil rights leaders. Their message was simple: End the war.\n\nThese members of the \"Clean for Gene\" McCarthy crowd wanted to re-brand the antiwar effort as a peaceful cause and divorce their movement from the rioting at the Democratic National Convention the previous year and the growing strength of the radical student faction known as the Weathermen.\n\nIn short, the Moratorium committee was determined to stay mainstream and to work within the system for political change. By collecting endorsements from groups big and small -- from the United Auto Workers to the National Council of Churches, and even corporations such as Midas Inc. -- the organizers brought women and men of all ages and from all walks of life into the student movement. Their goal: to win the rhetorical battle and transform public perceptions of the Vietnam War from a \"noble cause\" to an \"immoral war.\"\n\nOn the day of the demonstration, protesters wore black armbands to mourn the war's dead. And just as \"We Shall Overcome\" had been the hymn of the civil rights movement, they sang John Lennon's new hit, \"Give Peace a Chance,\" as the day's anthem.\n\nA hundred thousand gathered in the Boston Common to hear Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.) speak as a skywriter sketched out the peace sign above them. Another 100,000 converged on Bryant Park in New York, where New York Republican Sens. Charles Goodell and Jacob Javits and Mayor John Lindsay participated. In the nation's capital, Coretta Scott King greeted 50,000 protesters in front of the Washington Monument as hundreds of thousands more converged to fill the Mall to capacity. The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, the successor to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led a march in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd the Moratorium did not stop at the edge of the metropolises. In East Meadow, Long Island, the longtime ambassador and statesman W. Averell Harriman spoke to a crowd of 15,000. Six inches of snow could not deter 3,000 in Denver. The tally was 11,000 in rural Iowa. Nuclear scientists at the Brookhaven National Laboratory halted their atomic research. And across the pond, in London's Grosvenor Park, just steps from the U.S. Embassy, Bill Clinton, then a Rhodes Scholar, gathered hundreds to dissent.\n\nThe organizers had labored to shore up political support to demonstrate the breadth of their movement. The evening before the Moratorium, 23 members of Congress convened under the Capitol dome for a night's worth of speeches against the war -- the longest stretch of antiwar congressional speechmaking to that point.\n\nThere was a mighty backlash from Vietnam War supporters, and a lot of name-calling. The fierce-tongued Vice President Spiro Agnew taunted the demonstrators as an \"effete corps of impudent snobs.\" He doubted their purpose was anything more than \"a spirit of national masochism.\" And he credited their cause to \"the young ... overwhelm[ing] themselves with drugs and artificial stimulants.\"\n\nSen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) denounced the Moratorium for being anti-American and \"playing into the hands of people whose business it is to kill American fighting men.\" In defiance, 15 Republican congressmen assembled to demand an intensification of the war effort, and conservative counterprotesters marched with signs that read \"America, Love It Or Leave IT.\"\n\nThe Moratorium did not immediately stop the conflict, and data simply does not exist to indicate whether the protest changed hearts or minds. The Moratorium organizers clashed among themselves over money and dates and messaging for future demonstrations. Exhaustion and frustration led to more infighting. The coalition between anti-Vietnam War liberals and radical (at points militant) pacifists dissolved. A withdrawal from Vietnam was not negotiated for three more years; a full withdrawal not for another six.\n\nBut while President Richard Nixon refused to comment publicly on the demonstrations, letting \"it be known that he was watching sports on TV in the White House\" that day, we now know that the president was privately spooked by the Moratorium and its reprise, dubbed \"the Mobilization,\" a month later in Washington. These protests hamstrung his ability to negotiate with the North Vietnamese, and maybe most importantly forced Nixon to cancel plans to expand the war with an offensive of aerial bombing, harbor mining, even an invasion of North Vietnam. As Henry Kissinger, years later, would remark, \"we finally rejected the military option because we did not think we could sustain public support.\"\n\nThe 2 million-man march demonstrated the sheer numbers in dissent. The unity of action firmly established that the antiwar movement had a constituency that could be mobilized.\n\nAnd much like today's swath of protests -- Black Lives Matter, Women's March, #MeToo, gun control -- the antiwar activists spanned and overlapped different social movements. Their ranks included moderates and radicals, labor unionists, civil rights groups, women's rights groups, free-speech activists, clergy, socialists, communists, pacifists, militants and counterculture hippies. The great achievement of the Moratorium was to bring a large swath of Americans together in dissent, establishing that their antiwar cause was not fueled by a dangerous fringe that Nixon could, with a few dirty tricks, stamp out or discredit.\n\nThe march also provides another lesson that has been learned by activists for causes as disparate as civil rights, the fight against AIDS and Mothers Against Drunk Driving: Great change is not won in a day's showing. Even as great as was the 2 million-man Moratorium of Oct. 15, 1969, it took years more to accomplish its goal. For it takes a generation.",

Osweiler went 0-4 as the Broncos' starter last season and has 25 career starts in six NFL seasons.\n\nWith the Dolphins he replaces Matt Moore, a free agent after seven years as their backup quarterback. Despite adding Osweiler, the Dolphins will consider drafting a quarterback next month.\n\nTannehill is expected to return after missing all of the 2017 season, but he has twice had surgery since his most recent game.\n\nThe Dolphins made two other moves to upgrade their offense. Five-time Pro Bowl running back Frank Gore finalized a deal with his hometown team after agreeing to terms Thursday. Tackle Sam Young agreed to terms on a one-year contract to remain with the Dolphins, two people familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nGore, who turns 35 next month, has rushed for 14,026 yards to rank fifth on the all-time list. He spent the past three seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, and ran for 961 yards last season.\n\nYoung, an eight-year NFL veteran, started six games at right tackle for the Dolphins last year after Ja'Wuan James was hurt. He's expected to be James' backup again this season.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

John Dowd. Andrew McCabe. Rex Tillerson. Gary Cohn. Hope Hicks.\n\nThat's the list of senior-level government officials who have resigned, gotten pushed out or been fired by President Trump -- just in the past month.\n\nTrump's lightning-speed rate of turnover in his inner-circle and other top-tier ranks of the federal government is unusual, and it raises some questions.\n\nWhen will the president finally settle on his A-team? What does it mean that he hasn't?\n\nAnd why does Trump run his White House like \"The Apprentice\"?\n\nThose are the issues we explore in this week's episode of \"Can He Do That?\" -- a podcast about the powers and limitations of the American presidency.\n\n[ Andrew McCabe: Not in my worst nightmares did I dream my FBI career would end this way ]\n\nIn this episode, we talk to Washington Post senior editor Marc Fisher, who co-authored \"Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money, and Power.\" There's nothing surprising about Trump's recent slew of public, and humiliating, firings, Fisher said. The president thrives off chaos and uncertainty.\n\n\"That is the kind of drama that Donald Trump loves to stage,\" Fisher said. \"And when he was doing 'The Apprentice' and when he was appearing on 'The Howard Stern Show,' ... all of these previous chapters of his showbiz career, he was thinking of ways to heighten the drama. And so these firings are very much a part of that. It's the idea that he's showing who's boss.\"\n\nWe interview Kathryn Dunn Tenpas of the Brookings Institution, who has compiled extensive data on how Trump's turnover rate within his administration compares to previous presidents'.\n\n\"The level of Trump turnover on what I call the 'A-team' on the most senior level of staff ... it's not just high, it's extraordinarily high,\" Tenpas said.\n\n[ On TV, Trump loved to say 'You're fired.' In real life, he leaves the dirty work to others. ]\n\nAnd we talk about the limits of Trump's ability to target those in the government he doesn't like. Is there anyone he can't fire?\n\n\"If he were to fire Robert Mueller, I think there'd be a lot more movement towards people saying, well, this is obstruction of justice,\" said Matt Zapotosky, who covers the Department of Justice for The Post's national security team. \"It would just be so politically damaging.\"\n\nListen to the full episode here.\n\nEach week, \"Can He Do That?\" explores critical questions about what today's news means for our nation and its highest office.

                "body": "CAIRO -- In a surreal scene from the 2001 film \"Vanilla Sky,\" Tom Cruise runs through a deserted Times Square before screaming in despair. In a satirical version widely shared in Egypt, the square is filled with campaign billboards for President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\n\nOpen your eyes anywhere in Egypt these days, and you'll see billboards, banners and posters hailing the general-turned-president, who will stand for re-election next week against a little-known politician who has made no effort to challenge him.\n\nThe outcome of the election is a foregone conclusion, so the advertising blitz appears aimed at encouraging turnout to try and bolster the vote's legitimacy.\n\nIn the meantime, the displays have provoked a wave of grim satire on social media, one of the last remaining avenues for dissent amid a sweeping crackdown that has escalated in the lead-up to the March 26-28 vote.\n\nA still photo cropped from the 1997 blockbuster \"Titanic\" shows Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet seated on the doomed ship's deck with an el-Sissi banner in the background. Another shows the stars of \"Friends\" gathered at their favorite cafe, with a sign outside saying: \"Gunther and the rest of the staff at Central Perk support Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\"\n\nThe real banners are paid for by individuals and entities from all walks of life, from private businesses and loyal political groups to lawmakers, trade unions and state-owned companies. Even a small tea house or grocery store might hang a banner out front.\n\n\"You alone are our beloved,\" swoons one banner, sponsored by a private company in the Sinai Peninsula. Another, with the image of a child, says \"Mohammed Ahmed Mustafa supports Grandpa el-Sissi.\"\n\nAutocratic rulers across the Middle East have enjoyed similar displays of public adulation for decades. Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi stared down from ubiquitous signs and billboards -- until joyous crowds tore them down when the longtime dictators were overthrown.\n\nDuring Egypt's 2011 uprising, crowds tore down portraits of Hosni Mubarak and changed the name of a central metro station from Mubarak to Martyrs. When they took over Cairo's Tahrir Square they transformed it into a sprawling gallery of opposition banners, artwork and revolutionary graffiti.\n\nEgypt's first freely elected president, the Islamist Mohammed Morsi, was widely mocked, both online and off, during his divisive year in power, before being overthrown by the military on el-Sissi's orders. Since then, the government has silenced its critics, arresting thousands of Islamists as well as prominent secular activists, and blocking hundreds of independent and critical websites.\n\nImad Hussein, the pro-government editor of the independent Al-Shorouk daily, says the proliferation of banners in support of el-Sissi is part of Egyptian culture.\n\n\"It's like a traditional Egyptian wedding when the guests try to outdo each other with how much money they give the newly-wed couple to help them start their life together,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nOthers see the banners, and the election itself, as the latest evidence of Egypt's slide back into authoritarianism. A string of potentially serious candidates withdrew from the race under pressure or were arrested, and the resulting vote strongly resembles the one-man referendums held by Arab autocrats going back to the 1950s.\n\n\"Most of these banners are made by people as a means of self-preservation or as part of their pursuit of personal gain,\" said Ibrahim Awad, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo. \"The satire and sarcasm on social media show that a large segment of the population, especially activists, is not taking the elections seriously.\"\n\nA collage posted online has an elderly man waking up in his bed, shocked at the sight of an el-Sissi banner smiling down at him. Another has a statue of a nude Aphrodite with an el-Sissi sticker pasted on it. With her hand on her chest, she seems to plead with a passing museum visitor, saying: \"Enough with the posters already.\"\n\n\"The master of darkness and all death eaters support Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi,\" declares a banner hung over a scene from a \"Harry Potter\" movie with the staff and students of Hogwarts seated around a conference table.\n\nThe banners have inspired other jokes that are circulating the old-fashioned way, by word of mouth. There's the one about the voter who can't decide between the two candidates -- el-Sissi looking to his left or el-Sissi looking to his right.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Arnaud Beltrame was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday. His death, announced by French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, raises the toll to four. The gunman was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.\n\nThe gunman first hijacked a car and opened fire on police, then took hostages inside a supermarket. Baltrame volunteered to take the place of a female hostage and surreptitiously left on his cellphone so police outside could hear what was happening inside the store.\n\nOfficials said the decision was made to storm the building when they heard shots fired.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a vehicle and a building in central Carcassonne.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called \"Fiche S\" list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nA woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He did not identify her.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury was not serious, Lefebvre said.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.\n\nHe shouted \"Allahu akbar! (God is great)\" and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Thomas Adamson, Samuel Petrequin, Sylvie Corbet, Angela Charlton and Jerome Pugmire in Paris contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "BOSTON -- It was well after midnight when Texas Tech finally beat Purdue, 78-65, in the East Region semifinals at TD Arena, but a large band of Red Raiders fans were still standing and cheering in a half-empty arena. They needed to see this breakthrough. It had been 13 years since the program had made it to the Sweet 16. It had never been to the Elite Eight.\n\nThat drought is over. The Red Raiders overwhelmed the Boilermakers, who were looking to make their first Elite Eight since 2000.\n\nTexas Tech advanced to Sunday's East Region final against No. 1 seed Villanova, which beat fifth-seeded West Virginia in the earlier East Region semifinal on Friday night.\n\n[Feinstein: In a slugfest, Villanova shows it can take a punch]\n\nTexas Tech received 16 points from Keenan Evans and 14 from Zach Smith. It posted four players in double-figure scoring and outscored Purdue 33-6 in bench points.\n\nThe Boilermakers received 30 points from sophomore guard Carsen Edwards, but committed 17 turnovers against just eight assists as senior center Isaac Haas sat and watched from the bench. Haas did not play on Friday, nursing a broken elbow suffered in the first round, and backup center Matt Harrms finished with just four points and three rebounds.\n\nSenior forward Vincent Edwards added 12 points and 14 rebounds for the Boilermakers, who received three points on 1-for-7 shooting from senior guard Dakota Mathias.\n\nTexas Tech, which led 30-25 at half, took a 50-41 lead on a wide-open dunk by Niem Stevenson with 11:09 remaining. But Purdue chipped away and stayed in position to potentially win thanks in large part to Carsen Edwards, who pulled his team within 54-51 with a layup with 7:22 left. But Texas Tech was also resilient with the lead, and on the ensuing possession, Evans hit a jumper to keep cushion at five points.\n\nPurdue again pulled within three on a layup by Vincent Edwards with 5:44 left, but that was as close as it would get. Evans responded with a pair of free throws followed by a three-pointer that made it 63-55 with 4:24 left.\n\nMore NCAA tournament coverage:\n\nKansas tops Clemson despite late letdown to reach Elite Eight\n\nRound-by-round odds: Villanova becomes the title favorite over Duke]\n\nPorter Moser has led Loyola Chicago to new heights after hitting a career low\n\nLoyola Chicago doesn't need divine intervention to reach the Final Four\n\nKentucky Gentlemen?

                "title": "Joint Chiefs chair sees signs of progress in Afghan war",
                "body": "TACTICAL BASE GAMBERI, Afghanistan -- In fits and starts, for nearly a decade, the U.S. has talked about and struggled to make progress on building an Afghan military that can take control of its own nation's security and lay the groundwork for a stable government.\n\nThis time, they think they have it right.\n\nAfter five days criss-crossing Afghanistan, meeting with everyone from the Afghan president to the new American trainers on the ground, Gen. Joseph Dunford headed home Friday with a palpable sense of optimism.\n\nJust months after the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan declared the war against the Taliban and other insurgents a stalemate, Dunford -- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- said he can see the makings of a shift.\n\n\"What we're already starting to see is, I think, momentum is going to favor the Afghan forces,\" Dunford told the small group of reporters traveling with him, adding that the deployment of 800 new Army trainers \"will serve as an accelerant to the Afghans being able to achieve momentum.\"\n\nOne thing that gave him hope was a recent Afghan military operation in the east, where the Taliban have long been strong. It delivered, in his words, a \"eureka\" moment.\n\nDubbed Saleb 1-23, the Afghan military operation was launched in mid-February in a move to oust the Taliban from a critical 10-kilometer stretch of valley in Laghman Province. Taliban fighters have used that area as a transit route across the border with Pakistan, where they enjoy safe havens.\n\nU.S. Army Maj. Marc Pfrogner, the operations adviser for the Afghans' 201st Corps, said the complex mission took 50 days to plan. He said it lasted until March 9, and got fiercer as the Afghans moved up Sangar Valley. Four Afghan forces died in the fight, and 30 Taliban were killed.\n\nBut what impressed the Americans was the coordinated battle the Afghans waged, using their own intelligence, gathered in part from the Scan Eagle drone they got last September.\n\nWith guidance from their American advisers, Afghan commandos launched the initial assaults, supported by Afghan aircraft. The Afghan National Army forces followed, clearing the area, and National Police units moved in to hold the ground, enabling local political leaders to retake the government.\n\nU.S. surveillance and strike aircraft provided support, but American military commanders said much of that was invisible to the local people, who saw the Afghan forces as their liberators.\n\nThe coordination between the intelligence collection, the fighting forces and the police, said Dunford, is what the U.S. has been waiting to see.\n\n\"If you want to talk about what right looks like -- from the Afghan security force and the government rolling in behind it -- that operation was about textbook,\" said Dunford. \"I'm trying to restrain my enthusiasm here, but I'm having trouble, because that is the most positive observation that I've had over the last two days. You're kinda like, eureka!\"\n\nTempering that optimism, however, are the steep challenges ahead -- from government corruption and political infighting to regional diplomatic tensions and struggles to build a consistent, enduring military. Too often in recent years, U.S. officials have seized on a glimmer of hope, only to watch the Taliban regroup and surge again, taking back territory and fueling its fight with the profitable poppy harvest.\n\nThat is all compounded by the persistent turmoil with Pakistan, which U.S. officials complain has still not done enough to eliminate Taliban safe havens and control the traffic of militants back and forth across the border.\n\nMilitary leaders and commanders know well the risks of a backslide, so the next several months will be critical as they watch for the progress they believe is possible. And they know that success will depend on more than battlefield victories.\n\n\"The military effort is necessary but not sufficient to get us to reconciliation,\" said Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, referring to the renewed campaign to get Taliban fighters to the peace table. \"There's a significant political component and diplomatic component.\"\n\nHe and others agree, however, that battlefield wins are key ways to pressure insurgents to surrender. And he said the influx in recent months of several thousand U.S. troops and trainers, additional strike aircraft and drones is helping the Afghans go on the offensive.\n\nOther U.S. commanders said the renewed American commitment to the war, driven by the strategy rolled out by President Donald Trump last August, has helped embolden Afghan forces.\n\nDown at Camp Leatherneck in the Taliban heartland of Helmand Province, Marines said the Afghan soldiers still struggle with logistics and maintenance issues, but they are seeing some progress.\n\n\"It's different now because they understand now it's their responsibility,\" said Marine Lt. Col. Ryan Benson, an adviser for the Afghan army. \"Before there was the understanding that they were in the lead, but there was always that crutch\" of coalition forces they could fall back on.\n\nAs the summer fighting season looms, Dunford said he will gauge success based on specific benchmarks. He said he wants the number of Afghan casualties to go down, and the percentage of the population living in secure, government controlled areas to go up. Currently, he said, about 68 percent of the population is living in secure areas, and the goal is 80 percent.\n\nHe also wants to see more Taliban abandon the fight and ease back into society through a formal Afghan reintegration program. And he said he'll be watching the Taliban's reaction when fighters increasingly see they're being targeted by Afghan aircraft and the number of Afghan commandos -- who have been their toughest enemy -- has doubled.\n\n\"This is not another year of the same thing we've been doing for 17 years,\" Dunford said. \"All of this should bring pressure to bear on the Taliban. ... They are not going to win on the battlefield, they have to be convinced of that.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                "body": "OMAHA -- Duke, which had looked swift and giddy in churning out 176 points in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament, found less enjoyment Friday night in the notorious fog of the Syracuse zone. Fun looked scarce, and that was just on those umpteen times when possessions fizzled around the perimeter until Grayson Allen had to resort to audacious three-pointers.\n\nStill, Duke remained Duke, more than gifted and shrewd enough to wriggle out of a tub of goo. It will head to the 15th Elite Eight of Mike Krzyzewski's 38-year tenure because it had just enough lobs to Marvin Bagley III, just enough times when it could shoot before Syracuse got set, and just enough of Syracuse's generous buffet of turnovers to prevail, 69-65, as things kept getting somewhat hairy but not quite all-the-way hairy.\n\nIt also meant that in a tournament chockablock with glorious nonsense, the Midwest Regional wound up filling the end of its bracket with chalk: a No. 1 seed, Kansas, to play a No. 2 seed, Duke, come Sunday. By tipoff, that antithesis of chalk, Syracuse, long since will have departed town and the tournament into which it squeezed barely, then upended utterly.\n\n[Kansas tops Clemson despite late letdown to reach Elite Eight]\n\nAll along through a second half that began with Duke's lead at seven, then saw it go to nine, then saw it shrink to three, rise back to eight and then narrow to two with seven seconds left, it never did seem the Blue Devils (29-7) would topple. They did shoot only 39 percent, and they did clang up the threes at 5-for-26 (19 percent), with Allen going 3-for-14, but they did have a strong list of answers, including Allen's eight assists, Wendell Carter Jr.'s 12 rebounds, and Bagley's 22 points.\n\nSyracuse never did seem to have the scoring prowess to make Duke's troubles hurt -- it shot 4 for 13 from three-point range -- and the Orange kept fumbling rebounds and losing 50-50 balls on its way to 16 turnovers.\n\nFinally, when the late-game dance of fouls and foul shots reached its end, there came a flicker of suspense with Duke leading 67-64. With 12 seconds left, Syracuse sent the senior Allen to the line, where he had just buried two free throws coolly nine seconds earlier. Yet he pushed his opportunity off the front rim, and Syracuse came down, down three. Allen quickly fouled Tyus Battle, and Battle made one of two free throws before Gary Trent Jr. sealed matters with two free throws with 5.9 seconds left.\n\nMore NCAA tournament coverage:\n\nSister Jean continues to steal the show at NCAA tournament\n\n'I got shivers down my whole body': Michigan walk-on hits the shot of his life\n\nKentucky Gentlemen?

                "body": "BOSTON -- Villanova Coach Jay Wright doesn't like to call a time out when he knows the next whistle will bring a break for TV. But with 11:04 left Friday night at TD Garden, he felt he had no choice.\n\nWest Virginia, Villanova's former rival in the old Big East, had just gone on an 18-7 run to take a 60-54 lead in an old-fashioned Big East brawl of a basketball game.\n\n\"I had to call the timeout,\" Wright said after his team had come back to win, 90-78, and advance to Sunday's East Region final. \"They were on a run, and it could have gotten out of control. When they came to the bench, I looked in their eyes, and I didn't see any fear. If I'd seen fear, I might have gone crazy, but I could see they were all right. I really didn't have to say much.\"\n\nWhatever he did say clearly worked. Spurred by an odd four-point play by Jalen Brunson -- made free throw, missed free throw, WVU losing the rebound, Brunson drive, made free throw -- Villanova went on a 19-4 run for a 73-64 lead with 6:46 left that never dipped below seven points the rest of the way.\n\n\"We gave up that four-point play, and the margin got back to two pretty quickly,\" West Virginia Coach Bob Huggins said. \"They made open shots, we didn't make open shots. I tell our guys right from the start, when you get to this time of year, you have to make wide-open shots. We got more shots than they did [70-54], more rebounds [39-36], and just didn't make shots. That was the difference.\"\n\n[March Madness 2018: News, updates and schedules from the Sweet 16]\n\nMuch will be made of Villanova's three-point shooting -- 13 of 24; 7 of 11 in the second half -- with good reason. Much will also be made of Brunson's virtuoso performance, his 27 points and four assists, two of them critical during the Villanova burst that gave it control of the game.\n\nBut the reason the Wildcats will play in the Elite Eight here Sunday boiled down to one word: grit. Villanova was able to dig in and get down and dirty against a team that has made down and dirty an art form.\n\n\"What a college basketball game that was,\" Wright said, shaking his head, clearly drained. \"Give West Virginia all the credit in the world. They're so relentless. That's why I'm so proud of the way we handled all that and found a way to win.\"\n\nHow good, as Wright pointed out, was this game? At the first TV timeout, Villanova was 6 for 6 from the field, two of the shots three-pointers. It led, 14-8. Then, the Wildcats cooled a little, and shortly after the second TV timeout, the score was tied at 22. That was pretty much how the game went, each team taking its turn imposing its will on the other.\n\nThere were moments when Brunson was unstoppable, finding the seams in West Virginia's traps, clearing space and feathering jump shots that barely touched the net going through. By halftime, he had 16 points.\n\nWest Virginia's hard-nosed point guard, Jevon Carter, got called for his first foul 58 seconds into the game. He got his second with 7:25 left, shortly after he had made a three-point shot to give WVU it's first lead of the game at 25-24. Both fouls were called as Carter tried to reach in while trapping the ball. They were both NCAA fouls -- the kind that really don't affect the play but officials have been ordered to call.\n\nThe three officials were the most dominant team on the floor most of the night. They called 21 fouls by halftime and 48 for the game. Then, in the first six minutes of the second half they called six -- all on West Virginia, which to that point had outscored Villanova 10-3. Villanova was in the double-bonus with 10:58 left in the game.\n\n\"This was like an old Big East game,\" Wright said, smiling. \"Except in the old Big East there would have been no fouls called.\"\n\n[Round-by-round odds: Villanova becomes the title favorite over Duke]\n\nEven with the fouls mounting -- notably a fourth on Daxter Miles Jr., Carter's backcourt partner, the rough Mountaineers continued to give Villanova a rough time. Down 47-42 after an Eric Paschall three-pointer to open the second half, the Mountaineers began to give Villanova trouble with their press, leading to the 60-54 lead and the Wright timeout.\n\nCalm as he might have been, Wright's message clearly got through to his team. During the game's last 11 minutes, they outscored the Mountaineers 36-18.\n\nHuggins called a timeout after the initial 11-0 run, but the momentum had changed. Villanova was dug in on defense, taking away the inside from West Virginia, and, as Huggins pointed out, his team couldn't buy a three-point basket, hitting only 3 of 14 in the second half. That, as it turned out, was the difference.\n\nThe end was emotional for the two West Virginia seniors, Carter and Miles, who had trouble talking when they met with members of the media after leaving the court.\n\nFor Villanova, it was another step, its second trip to the Elite Eight in three years. Last time the Wildcats went this far, they ended up as national champions.\n\n\"This kind of game will help us Sunday,\" Wright said. \"You don't want that first moment where you're down six against a very good team in the second half to come in the Elite Eight.\"\n\nIt came, instead in the Sweet 16. Villanova proved, as smooth and pretty as it may look, it can take a punch. That's why the Wildcats are still playing.\n\nFor more by John Feinstein, visit washingtonpost.com/feinstein.\n\nMore NCAA tournament coverage:\n\nKansas tops Clemson despite late letdown to reach Elite Eight\n\nPorter Moser has led Loyola Chicago to new heights after hitting a career low\n\nLoyola Chicago doesn't need divine intervention to reach the Final Four\n\nKentucky Gentlemen?

                "body": "KARACHI, Pakistan -- Pakistan's biggest city will witness a high-profile cricket match for the first time in nine years on Sunday when the Pakistan Super League final is staged amid heavy security at a newly renovated National Stadium in Karachi.\n\nMore than 8,000 security personnel have been deployed for the Twenty20 final between Islamabad United and last year's champions Peshawar Zalmi.\n\nKarachi, now with a population of 15 million, last saw a major game with international players in February 2009 -- Sri Lanka vs. Pakistan in a test match.\n\nOn the same tour, terrorists attacked the Sri Lanka team bus at Lahore. On March 3, 2009, the bus carrying the visiting cricketers, part of a large convoy, was fired upon by 12 gunmen near Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. They were on their way to play the third day of the second test against Pakistan, and six Pakistan policemen and two civilians were killed, and six members of the Sri Lanka team were injured.\n\nThat resulted in an end to international cricket in the country, and the Pakistan Cricket Board was left with no choice but to choose United Arab Emirates as its \"home\" turf to host international teams.\n\nHowever, the PCB continued in its efforts to convince foreign nations to begin touring Pakistan. Lahore first hosted the PSL final last year, and there were Twenty20 international matches organized against a World XI (three matches) and Sri Lanka (one).\n\nBut a reluctance from some international PSL players to play in Pakistan remains. The preliminary PSL matches were played at Dubai and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates\n\nAustralian Shane Watson (Quetta Gladiators) and Englishmen Eoin Morgan (Karachi) and Kevin Pietersen (Quetta) all refused to accompany their respective franchises to Lahore earlier this week for two PSL eliminators.\n\nThe absence of the top stars hurt both franchises and drew an angry response from Gladiators coach and former Pakistan captain Moin Khan.\n\n\"We, in the coming season, should only pick players who have the consent to visit Pakistan,\" Moin said after losing the first eliminator against Zalmi.\n\n\"We do not need to push for individuality as our league has now become a bigger brand ... we don't need to get these players who don't want to come to Pakistan. In fact, this is hurting Pakistan as it is sending a negative signal and affects our country's image as well.\"\n\nThe provincial administration in Karachi has put up in place stringent security arrangements for Sunday's final. Spectators might have to wait in long queues hours before the evening final and will get into the stadium only after going through at least three security checkpoints.\n\nBut the city is giving a festive look to welcome foreign players like Peshawar Zalmi's Darren Sammy of West Indies and Chris Jordan of England, and South African J.P. Duminy and New Zealand's Luke Ronchi of Islamabad United.\n\nBillboards and player cut-outs have been displayed on the sides of main streets to celebrate an international-standard game for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nSammy has become a household name in Pakistan -- especially the way he has carried Zalmi to the final after playing four successive matches with a leg injury.\n\n\"Yes Karachi we're coming,\" Sammy said in a video message. \"I want you all to come and support Peshawar Zalmi. I want everybody to wear the yellow shirt, it's a yellow storm, we're coming.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Thousands are gathering in Washington Saturday for a protest that organizers claim will be a defining moment in the long-simmering national debate over gun-control legislation.\n\nOrganizers of the March for Our Lives rally are hoping to draw 500,000 protesters; that would match last year's women's march and make this one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam era. It would also bolster claims that the nation is ready to enact sweeping changes to its gun control laws. More than 800 marches are planned in cities across America and dozens of locations overseas to be held at roughly the same time.\n\nWashington is generally nonchalant about protests, but Saturday's gathering has prompted more attention and speculation than usual. Washington officials say they are prepared to handle the crowds -- more prepared than they were for the women's march, which far exceeded the organizers' official predictions of 300,000.\n\nThe protesters, many of them high school students, claim that the youth leadership of this initiative is what will set it apart from previous attempts to enact stronger gun-control legislation.\n\nIn the wake of the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the students have tapped into a powerful current of pro-gun control sentiment that has been building for years. They have also partnered with well-funded liberal groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control advocacy group founded by former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg.\n\nPolls indicate that public opinion nationwide may indeed be shifting on an issue that has simmered for generations, and through dozens of mass shootings. A new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the United States should be tightened. That's up from 61 percent who said the same in October of 2016 and 55 percent when the AP first asked the question in October of 2013. Overall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun control laws.\n\nBut even with claims of historic social momentum on the issue of gun control, the AP poll also found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action. Among the questions facing march organizers and participants will be how to translate this one-day event, regardless of turnout, into meaningful legislative change.\n\nOne way is by channeling the current energy into mid-term congressional elections this fall. Students in Florida have focused on youth voter registration and there will be a registration booth at the Saturday rally.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                "title": "Villanova feels the pressure, then gets cooking to beat West Virginia in Sweet 16",
                "body": "BOSTON -- Villanova Coach Jay Wright is rarely flustered, yet nobody would have blamed him had he lost his cool during the second half of Friday night's East Region semifinal against West Virginia. His veteran team looked rattled and trailed by six. His assistants were screaming instructions on how to break the Mountaineers' relentless full-court pressure. And TD Garden had become a cauldron of discontent, with fans of both proud programs perpetually booing their lungs out over a tightly officiated game.\n\nSo Wright did something he doesn't usually do. He burned one of his precious timeouts even though the game was seconds away from a television stoppage. He wanted to look at the faces of his veterans -- Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges and Phil Booth -- and check for fear. There was none. \"I could just see it in their eyes -- we were good,\" Wright said after the Wildcats' 90-78 win.\n\nWhat appeared to be chaos to that point quickly returned to order. Villanova went on an 11-0 run to take control of the game and reach Sunday's East Region final, where it will meet the winner of Friday's nightcap between Purdue and Texas Tech.\n\n[]\n\nThat game between the Boilermakers and Red Raiders was pushed back by nearly a half-hour Friday night because of the exhausting, chippy marathon between the Wildcats and Mountaineers, who combined for 27 fouls in the second half alone. For more than two hours, it appeared as if West Virginia's full-court pressure -- spearheaded by senior point guard Jevon Carter, considered by many the best defensive player in the country -- would wreak enough havoc to end Villanova's season.\n\n\"That was the most physical, physically demanding, mentally demanding 40 minutes we've played in a long time,\" Wright said.\n\nThe Wildcats had averaged 10 turnovers this season; they had nine in the first half alone. After Carter recorded a steal and a layup with just over 11 minutes remaining to put West Virginia up by six, Wright called a timeout to remind his players why they had made it this far.\n\nFrom that point on, the Wildcats not only showed why they have the most efficient offense in the country -- they hit half of their 54 shots Friday, including 13 made three-pointers, and recorded 16 assists -- but also the mettle of a team with six redshirts who had witnessed the program's high of winning the national championship in 2016 and bowing out in the second round in 2017. Brunson, who finished with 27 points against his childhood rival Carter, came out of that timeout and scored four quick points, then assisted on a three-pointer by Bridges two possessions later. But it was a string of crucial plays down the stretch from the frontcourt duo of Eric Paschall (14 points) and freshman Omari Spellman (18 points) that ensured Villanova's rally.\n\n\"I was just having a shoot-em'-up, battle-in-the-streets mentality,\" Spellman said.\n\nVillanova hit 15 of its 29 first-half shots, including six of its 13 three-point attempts, and yet it still looked out of sorts offensively. As expected, Brunson was hounded by Carter and West Virginia's full-court pressure; the Wildcats toggled among three inbounders in the first half. And for a second straight game it encountered heavy foul trouble early, including Bridges, who sat for 11 minutes in the first half after picking up two fouls.\n\n[Kansas tops Clemson despite late letdown to reach Elite Eight]\n\nBrunson scored 16 points in the first half, but Villanova still couldn't take control of the game, even after Carter picked up his second foul of the game with 7:25 left before halftime. After a quick breather, West Virginia Coach Bob Huggins didn't hesitate to put Carter back in a few minutes later. That move changed the complexion of the game; Carter helped ignite an 8-0 run that included a pair of steals off the press and another turnover when Carter stripped Brunson on a drive in the lane. And even though Villanova walked back to the locker room with a 44-42 lead at the break, its players looked frustrated that they weren't up more.\n\nMidway through the second half, that frustration could have become desperation -- the Wildcats appeared to be fighting to keep their season alive. At one point, the Wildcats hit just 1 of 10 from the field and had a nine-minute stretch in which it made just one field goal. Then came Wright's timeout.\n\n\"It's just confidence that we have in each other,\" Brunson said.\n\nBridges had fallen victim to a vicious two-handed block by West Virginia's Sagaba Konate earlier in the second half, but Spellman returned the favor on the ensuing possession, batting away a layup attempt to start another transition opportunity. Spellman then ran the length of the floor and finished a putback dunk to cap the 11-0 run that gave Villanova a 65-60 lead. Spellman added another three-pointer and Paschall a dunk to give their team a nine-point lead, and Brunson nailed his team's 12th three of the game with 5:37 remaining to make it 76-66.\n\nKonate and Spellman traded words at one point, too, picking up double-technical fouls as the momentum of the game shifted. It felt like an old school Big East game in a Big East town, a reminder of what these two teams used to do to each other before West Virginia parted for the Big 12. It seemed only fitting that Villanova survived Friday night.\n\n\"What a game, man,\" Wright said. \"What a college basketball game.\"\n\nMore NCAA tournament coverage:\n\nSister Jean continues to steal the show at NCAA tournament\n\n'I got shivers down my whole body': Michigan walk-on hits the shot of his life\n\nKentucky Gentlemen?

They both work in public safety and make a LOT of money doing what they do -- so much so, that they travel frequently (four to five times per year).\n\nTheir trips aren't short jaunts to local haunts, but rather all-inclusive, weeks-long trips to faraway foreign lands, and each trip is documented online from the moment they make the reservations until the minute they return (\"So exhausted! So glad to be home! So blessed!\").\n\nWith the advent of social media, it's become second nature for people to share everything they do online, but when is enough enough? How do I let them know that I'm happy for their financial success and good fortune, but tired of their constant bragging?\n\nCease following them on social media.\n\nDear Miss Manners: I recently learned (via social media, of course) that a classmate I'd been to school with from kindergarten through senior year passed away, far too young.\n\nWe were not intimate friends, and I hadn't seen her in years, but I remember her vividly and happily, and was sad to hear of her passing. I sent a sympathy card to her mother, essentially saying the above, and mentioning one specific happy memory I had.\n\nHer mother responded with a kind note, surprised to hear from me, but thanking me for expressing my sympathies.\n\nShould I respond to her? It seems awkward not to respond, but is this a conversation that might be considered \"closed\"?\n\nThat the exchange was conducted by postal mail gives me a bit of time to figure out the correct response. Had I been closer to my classmate, it would be an easier question, but she was really just a very nice person I spent all of my childhood and adolescence with, and whose death saddened me.\n\nYour schoolmate's mother's thanking you was gracious, whether she also meant to end the conversation, but it does not necessitate any further communication. She was simply responding in kind. You may, with Miss Manners' blessing, consider the interaction closed.\n\nDear Miss Manners: There's a man in my water aerobics class who always has dried nasal secretions hanging from one or both nostrils. He has lived an interesting life and I enjoy speaking with him, but I can't stand looking at his face.\n\nIf he had a handkerchief or washcloth and wiped his nose once in a while the problem would be solved. Is there any way that I can handle this that is both polite and kind?\n\n\"Oh dear, these pools are so drying. Let us both go change and clean up before we continue our conversation.\"\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

                "title": "Perspective | Ask Amy: Cat has first dibs on the buffet",
                "body": "Dear Amy: My husband and I are friends with a couple -- \"Rose and Jack,\" who enjoy entertaining in their home.\n\nHere is the problem: Jack and Rose have a beloved cat that has the run of the house, including tables and countertops, as well as the kitchen sink. This has always made my husband and me uncomfortable, but it does seem to be typical cat behavior, so we try not to think about it.\n\nDuring a recent buffet gathering, the cat jumped up on the dining room table several times, licking and nibbling the food until someone noticed. Then Jack scooped up the cat while Rose draped foil over the food in an attempt to deter the cat. Neither the \"nibbled\" food nor the cat were removed.\n\nWe are dreading the next invitation. My husband has declared that he can no longer eat there. I (reluctantly) feel the same. We do invite Rose and Jack to our home, but they rarely go out.\n\nClearly they adore the cat and are not bothered by it.\n\nDo I dare say something to them? They are very sweet and generous people, and we value their friendship.\n\nNot Hungry\n\nNot Hungry: Pet owners often lose perspective about how intrusive their animal companions can be; when I was a child my mother jokingly said she would someday write a cookbook called: \"After the Cat Has Licked It.\"\n\nHaving an animal walking around on the table where food for people is being served is gross and unhealthful.\n\nYour discomfort is perfectly understandable, but your hosts aren't telepathic, so you are going to have to say something. Before the next gathering, tell them: \"We would love to come, but is there a way to keep Tuffy away from the food? We aren't as used to her as you are, and it makes us uncomfortable when she's up on the table.\"\n\nIf they really are great hosts, Jack and Rose will see to their human guests' needs first, and find a compassionate and low-impact way to deal with their animal companion while there are other humans in the house.\n\nDear Amy: One of my mother's guests at her home over the holidays was a bishop in our church. He made a derogatory comment to my mother about my husband.\n\nLater my mother repeated the comment to me. According to her, he said, \"Your daughter is so beautiful and talented, what is she doing with a loser like that?\"\n\nMom made me promise not to tell my husband. I am miffed at the man's comment, and I'm wondering what you think of my mother's decision to repeat it to me.\n\nMiffed\n\nMiffed: When someone repeats an unkind comment, the best response (in the moment) is a simple one: \"Why did you repeat that to me?\"\n\nYou are right; both parties have acted badly here. This guest shouldn't have said anything about your husband to your mother, and your mother shouldn't have repeated it to you -- or sworn you to secrecy. That's unfair, childish and manipulative. Worst of all, you are still thinking about it, many moons later.\n\nIn this case, the best thing for everyone (especially you) is to let it go. If your mother brings up the remark again, or repeats this behavior, be firm but polite and tell her you don't want to discuss it, and you think her decision to tell you this piece of bad gossip was a poor one. Otherwise, chalk this up to a holiday party faux-pas, and move on.\n\nDear Amy: \"Rosalind\" was upset by an older man who stopped her in a public place and loudly offered her unsolicited advice about how to handle a health matter.\n\nYour advice was to make eye contact and say, \"Hi, friend. Thank you! I'll take it from here.\"\n\nWhy? Why, why, why?\n\nWhen are we as a society going to stop telling women they need to respond in a \"friendly\" way to men who stop them in public and loudly offer advice, opinions, etc.? When?\n\nWhy should she thank this complete stranger for interfering in her personal life, loudly, in public?\n\nWhy?\n\nMargaret\n\nMargaret: The person offering this \"advice\" was elderly. He repeated himself several times. I saw this as a respectful way of dismissing an elderly person who did not seem to be well.\n\nMy advice would have been the same if both parties were men, although, speaking to your point, perhaps men don't do this to other men.\n\n© 2018 by Amy Dickinson distributed by Tribune Content Agency",

Outdoor glass cleaner is a simple formula. This is so cheap to make:\n\nMix 16 ounces water with ½ cup white or apple-cider vinegar and ¼ cup rubbing alcohol.\n\nYou're going to need an attachment for your garden hose that will power-spray on this formula.

                "title": "Perspective | Carolyn Hax: How to RSVP to an invite to a secret wedding you don't approve of",
                "body": "Adapted from a recent online discussion.\n\nDear Carolyn: My 22-year-old niece just told me she and her 35-year-old boyfriend are eloping next week. This is a relationship that has been deeply opposed by my niece's parents for years; they object to the age difference and many other aspects they view as unsavory.\n\nMy niece told me they are inviting only the people who have been \"supportive\" of the relationship, which is how I came to be invited. The problem is that while I haven't been vocally opposed to the relationship (it doesn't seem like my place), my attitude is far from one of support. I actually hoped and assumed the relationship would run its course, that the nightmare would end for my sister, and that my niece would finish school and then start dating age-appropriate people.\n\nSo now I am not sure what to do. The most pressing problem is that I am now keeping a huge secret from my sister, with whom I have always been very close. The second problem is that I don't know whether to attend the secret wedding. I'm also not sure whether it's wrong to refrain from telling my niece that I, too, am worried about her choice. Any advice?\n\n-- Burdened by a Secret\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nBurdened by a Secret: She's 22! She's an adult. What's \"unsavory\" about her marrying a man of 35?\n\nI get it, they've been together for \"years,\" but if she was 18 when they got together, then that's concerning, but she was still an adult who was free to make this choice. If there's more to it that's genuinely \"unsavory,\" then please fill me in, but otherwise I'm rooting for them.\n\nAs for the secrecy, that's an issue -- one you can dispense with in a very straightforward way. \"I'm touched to be included in your wedding. However, I will not keep such an enormous secret from my sister.\" Tell your niece you will give her a two-day grace period in which she can tell her mother of the wedding herself, if she chooses, but after that you will not refrain from discussing it.\n\nIf your niece bounces you from the guest list for that, then her immaturity solves your do-I-go? problem, even as it no doubt creates others. Ones that are hers to worry about now.\n\nBut, really, unless you're holding back something huge, two adults are getting married. Period. Just stop.\n\nRe: Niece: About \"telling my niece that I too am worried\": It wouldn't do any good. Your niece already knows a lot of people don't like the idea, and it hasn't stopped her from planning to elope. Go or don't go, but come to grips with the fact that people live their own lives and make their own mistakes.\n\n-- Anonymous\n\nRe: Niece: You can tell your niece something similar to what I told my brother when he moved in with his girlfriend and told me not to tell our mom: If you are mature enough to do this, then you should be mature enough to tell your parents you're doing it.\n\n-- Sibling\n\nSibling: Simple and elegant, thanks.\n\nWrite to Carolyn Hax at tellme@washpost.com.

                "title": "A.J. Cole will be the Nats' fifth starter, but Jeremy Hellickson looks good in his debut",
                "body": "A.J. Cole is the Nationals fifth starter. For now. (John Bazemore/Associated Press)\n\nJUPITER, Fla. -- While most of the Nationals' stars and their rookie manager stayed in West Palm Beach, Mike Rizzo took the drive to Jupiter, where he endured a chilly night in the stands in shorts to see his newest acquisition, starter Jeremy Hellickson, pitch his first game of the spring.\n\nA few hours earlier, Manager Dave Martinez had declared what had been implied before and after the Nationals signed Hellickson last week: right-hander A.J. Cole will open the season as the Nationals' fifth starter. As Hellickson threw four strong innings in his debut, Cole made his final start of the spring a few miles south, in West Palm Beach. He struggled. At one point, he walked the bases loaded. All told, the 26-year-old allowed three runs on five hits in four innings.\n\nNothing about what Martinez said will change because Cole had a bad day. He'll get his chance in the rotation. Cole finished the spring with a 4.85 ERA in 13 innings.\n\n[ Dave Martinez batted pitcher eighth. Will it become a habit? ]\n\nBut what happened a few miles north was hard to ignore. Hellickson looked strong in his four innings. Scheduled to throw 60 pitches, he threw nearly 70. The 30-year-old and former AL Rookie of the Year was never much of a power pitcher, but struggled last season when the gap between his fastball and change-up velocity shrank. Friday, Hellickson's fastball sat from 89 to 91 while his change-up dipped was anywhere from 78 to 83.\n\n\"I saw a whole lot of 90s up there, and I wasn't expecting that. I was thinking 87, 88,\" said pitching coach Derek Lilliquist, who also made the trip. \"He sinks it, rides it, cuts it, changes it, curves it -- it was a good mix. Good command.\"\n\nHellickson threw 69 pitches over four innings, 47 for strikes -- a favorable ratio for any pitcher, particularly a guy who had been throwing at Scott Boras's complex in California until last week, and threw only one bleary-eyed bullpen before seeing big league hitters.\n\n\"You can't really simulate the intensity of a game,\" Hellickson said. \" ... It was a lot different, but it felt really good.\"\n\nHellickson said he wasn't sure of what his next step will be, though with Cole starting the season as the fifth starter, there isn't a huge amount of urgency. Before Friday, the team's plan was to keep Hellickson in West Palm Beach until he could throw enough innings in minor league games to handle a big league start. At that point, he could take a turn in the majors and challenge Cole for the fifth spot if needed. That plan could change if Hellickson struggles to recover from Friday's start, though he has no reason to believe that will be the case.\n\n[ Nationals cut ties with chef Mike Isabella in wake of allegations ]\n\nThe righty's delivery is not particularly taxing. He is not a power pitcher, and appears to have more of a throwing motion than power pitching delivery, staying upright throughout and finishing tall. His stuff has never been overpowering. He relies almost entirely on finesse, on taking a little on his fastball, on making things move. Hellickson would, in that way, be a different type of pitcher than any of his fellow veterans in the Nationals rotation. If he commands his pitches like he did Friday, he could provide a nice change of pace.\n\nBut any decisions on his status will wait until he is back in regular season shape. His fellow starters moved from 60 pitches to 75 pitches to 90 and 100, meaning Hellickson could be as few as three starts away from ready, or as many as five. The Nationals structured his contract with this in mind. Instead of an early-season opt out, his first one comes May 1, by which time he will have had the chance to audition. Meanwhile, he will wait while Cole gets his chance. If Cole pitches well, Hellickson will wait. If he doesn't, Hellickson will be soon be ready to take his turn.",

                "body": "BEIJING -- China's newly-appointed economic czar told U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Saturday that Beijing is ready to defend its interests after President Donald Trump announced plans to slap tariffs on nearly $50 billion Chinese imports.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He told Mnuchin in a phone call the order Trump signed Thursday violates international trade rules, the official Xinhua News Agency said.\n\nThe White House says the planned tariffs are aimed at punishing Beijing for allegedly stealing American technology and pressuring U.S. companies to hand it over.\n\nXinhua cited Liu as saying that China is \"ready and capable of defending its national interest and hopes both sides will remain rational.\"\n\nOn Friday, China said it plans to raise tariffs on a $3 billion list of U.S. goods including pork, apples and steel pipes in response to the steel and aluminum duties earlier announced by Trump.\n\nThe Chinese move appeared to be warning shot aimed at increasing domestic U.S. pressure on Trump by making clear which exporters, including farm areas that voted for the president in 2016, might be hurt.\n\nOn Friday, American farmers from hog producers in Iowa to apple growers in Washington state and winemakers in California expressed deep disappointment over being put in the middle of a potential trade war with China by the president many of them helped elect.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said Friday Beijing was considering a tariff increase of 25 percent on pork and aluminum scrap, mirroring Trump's 25 percent charge on steel. A second list of goods including wine, apples, ethanol and stainless steel pipe would be charged 15 percent, mirroring Trump's tariff hike on aluminum.\n\nOverall, the nation's farmers shipped nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. The American pork industry sent $1.1 billion in products, making China the No. 3 market for U.S. pork.\n\n\"No one wins in these tit-for-tat trade disputes, least of all the farmers and the consumers,\" said National Pork Producers Council President Jim Heimerl, a pig farmer from Johnstown, Ohio.\n\nThe U.S. has complained for years about China's sharp-elbowed trading practices, accusing it of pirating trade secrets, manipulating its currency, forcing foreign companies to hand over technology, and flooding world markets with cheap steel and aluminum that drive down prices and put U.S. manufacturers out of business.\n\nThe spiraling trade dispute between the world's two-largest economies has spurred concerns among companies and investors that global commerce could be depressed.\n\nThis story corrects Liu He's title.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "In their pursuit of home-court advantage, the Washington Wizards are plummeting.\n\nAlthough the Wizards entered Friday's home game fully aware that only a win over the Denver Nuggets could stem the tide that's pulling them into the deep waters of the Eastern Conference, their play hardly matched the situation.\n\nThe defense made Denver's backcourt look like an all-star tandem, and when the Nuggets' starting center performed like a point guard, Washington bowed to his will. Even more troubling, the offensive end featured lethargic sets until a big deficit demanded urgency.\n\nThe result was a 108-100 loss that dropped the Wizards (40-32) into sixth place in the East, 1½ games from the fourth seed and the right to host their first-round playoff series.\n\nThe lure of home court advantage appears to have little effect on the Wizards' play.\n\n\"We have to play with more urgency,\" Coach Scott Brooks said. \"We can't just go out there like it's another game. It's a valuable game for us. We're building our habits going into the playoffs and these are moments where we need to take advantage because it's playoff implications in every game.\n\n\"We didn't come out with the urgency that we needed to offensively, which surprises me,\" Brooks continued. \"We didn't play with any pace in that first quarter. In the second quarter, they got hot and we couldn't stop them.\"\n\nBefore the game, Bradley Beal dramatically talked up the Wizards' playoff objectives: \"We got to have it. We can't keep talking about it . . . . We got to do whatever it takes to do that and realize that we're kind of in control of our own destiny.\"\n\nBy the time the final horn sounded, however, Beal walked off the floor without a word, stripping off his headband that he had intended as a nod to the past on the night of Phil Chenier's jersey was retired. Instead, the fashion choice served as his final display of frustration. Beal scored 24 points on 9-of-18 shooting with six three-pointers but couldn't complete a pair of plays with the Wizards trailing by two points late in the final quarter.\n\nWashington trailed for much of the game, digging an early hole after scoring just 16 points in the opening quarter.\n\nDenver point guard Jamal Murray had 25 points on 8-of-20 shooting and five three-pointers and shooting guard Will Barton matched Murray with five makes from the deep range, closing out the Wizards with a triple that extended Denver's lead to five points with 1:22 remaining in the game. The shot silenced Washington's comeback from being 14 points down in the third quarter.\n\nBesides Murray and Barton pairing for 48 points. Washington let 6-foot-10 center Nikola Jokic (25 points) bang whenever he wanted to with Marcin Gortat as well as step out to launch six three-point attempts or deliver five assists as his team's primary playmaker.\n\nAfter the game, the players who spoke with reporters noted the silver lining in the team's comeback. Yet they still had to acknowledge the truth of the past two losses: Washington lacks the vigor of a team that wants to move up.\n\n\"We definitely got to come out with a lot more energy and urgency,\" Otto Porter Jr. said. \"Especially on the offensive end. That's where we get our urgency from playing hard. We just got to go out and give it our all. This is coming down to the playoff time and we want to be up there in the top. And for us to be out there on the top, we have to come out with more intensity.\"\n\nOn the other side of the court, Denver (40-33) played like a team desperate to make the playoffs. The Nuggets are on the outside looking in. Washington, however, couldn't summon the same energy.\n\nWith just 10 games remaining, their destructive habits -- shown while feebly defending the three-point arc and squandering 17 offensive possessions -- are becoming hard to ignore as well as overcome.\n\n\"We got to practice those tendencies,\" reserve point guard Ramon Sessions said about playing with winning habits. \"It's hard to just turn it on that weekend in April -- the 13th, 14th -- whenever it starts. It's definitely important. We got to, you know, these last 10 games, got to put that together.\"",

The 11-year veteran spent the first eight seasons of his career in Green Bay, intercepting 28 passes in 127 games including 99 starts.\n\nWilliams played last season with Arizona after spending two years in Cleveland. New Packers defensive coordinator Mike Pettine was coach of the Browns in Williams' first year in Cleveland in 2015.\n\nWilliams, who turned 35 last week, was a respected locker room presence when he left Green Bay in 2014. He returns to help mentor a cornerback position that struggled through an injury-filled season in 2017.\n\nGreen Bay may still be looking for cornerback help in the draft or free agency.\n\nLast year's first-round draft pick, Kevin King, showed flashes of promise but his season ended in December because of a shoulder injury. Veteran Davon House is a free agent.\n\nDamarious Randall was traded to the Cleveland Browns in a deal that brought backup quarterback DeShone Kizer to Green Bay.\n\nA 15-game starter as a rookie last season for the winless Browns, Kizer said he was surprised he was dealt away. He threw a league-high 22 interceptions, but showed signs of improvement late in the season.\n\nNow Kizer gets a chance to learn under Packers starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers and potentially compete for the backup job with Brett Hundley.\n\n\"I think it's going to be an awesome opportunity to take a step back and learn from (coach Mike McCarthy and offensive coordinator Joe Philbin) and be around some great competitors and get back to winning the way I know how,\" Kizer said Friday on a conference call.\n\nMore AP NFL: https://pro32.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Kansas tops Clemson despite late letdown to reach Elite Eight",
                "body": "OMAHA -- Kansas won Friday night, but not until it had subjected the stomach linings of its well-educated fans to another one of those familiar old turns of roiling. Luckily, the people who watch the Jayhawks intently are seasoned at such matters, a useful knack for those times when a lead reaches 20 with 18:16 left, and again with 15:42 left, and again with 12 minutes left, then winds up wobbling at a wee six with 90 seconds left with a Clemson coming up the court.\n\nClemson missed a semi-wild three-point shot with 79 seconds left, and its deficit never got any closer than the final score of 80-76 as its breakthrough season ended at 25-10 and with its first Sweet 16 appearance in 21 years. Kansas, in turn, went on to wreak more acid upon its devotees as it will play in its horror chamber known as the final eight, the round that has checkmated it the past two seasons, as well as five times all told in Coach Bill Self's 15-season tenure.\n\n\"We did just enough,\" Self said.\n\n[March Madness 2018: News, updates and schedules from the Sweet 16]\n\nThirty minutes in, he would not have expected to need the little fist-pump he gave at the end, the one that punctured the air with relief before he went to shake hands with Clemson Coach Brad Brownell. Self's Kansas team looked like a masterpiece of spacing and ball movement with its four perimeter players and its interior giant, the 7-foot Nigerian Udoka Azubuike, who would stuff the box score with 14 points and 11 rebounds. Even when both Big 12 player of the year Devonte' Graham and Azubuike had sat down with three fouls each at the 14:15 mark, Kansas kept its polish.\n\nIt got a fine supporting-actor effort from Silvio De Sousa, the Angolan who joined the team in December, and it got another gem from the March-hot guard Malik Newman, who shot 6 for 11 overall and 4 for 7 from three-point range, had 17 points and said: \"My confidence is just sky-high. I'm not really out there thinking anymore, just playing.\"\n\nBy the time Graham reentered the game to drain a three-point shot with 8:34 left in a disagreeable shooting night for him -- 4 for 12, but 16 points padded with late free throws -- Kansas led 65-47 and seemed all set. Brownell would credit Kansas with \"a really good gear\" and an enviable tempo. The typically smart play of the junior Lagerald Vick, with his 13 points and eight rebounds, mattered throughout. It seemed the boffo performance from Clemson's Gabe Devoe on the other side, often dazzling his way to 10-for-17 shooting and 31 points, would prove nothing more than an eye-pleasing sideshow.\n\nSix minutes of play later, a Kansas inbounds pass went amok, Clemson's Shelton Mitchell grabbed it near midcourt and began storming toward the basket. When he came down with the ball in his left hand and made a dunk that might have justified the ticket prices, Clemson lurked just six points away at 74-68, and Self called the hasty 30-second timeout.\n\nSome 2:27 remained, somehow.\n\n\"We could have executed a lot better,\" Graham said. \"I don't know why we do that when we have a lead, just kind of relax.\"\n\nHe clanged a free throw off the back iron with 1:30 left, and the football powerhouse of Clemson looked primed to treat its traveling basketball fans to something truly mad. But Mitchell's quick three-point heave from the right of the top of the key never had much chance, and Devoe's ensuing force from the right side plunked off the rim, and Kansas spent the rest of the seemingly endless time holding on.\n\n\"We finished the game about as poorly as a team can,\" Self said, \"but we got the 'W' and we played really well in stretches and certainly made some timely shots. We know we've got to be a lot better on Sunday.\"\n\nThat will bring either Duke or Syracuse, and that will ratchet up the meaning of Azubuike in the middle, what with Kansas's four-and-one approach this season differing from so many of Self's past teams, and what with the margin for error not thick.\n\n\"Obviously he can score one-on-one,\" Brownell said. \"His size is so big that he's catching the ball five feet from the rim. And because they have four guys making shots, Vick is the guy who you would think maybe we can help a little bit off Vick, because he's, like, their worst three-point shooter, and he has 50-some-odd on the season and goes 3 for 6 tonight.\n\n\"Most teams have somebody that you can kind of scratch off. So one of the reasons they're so hard to guard is they've got a center that scores if he catches it deep, and he's bigger than everybody on the floor so he does get position, and then you've got guards that can all make shots and drive by you, and they play with great spacing.\"\n\nA team Self deems one of his less likely to make it to a final eight has made it to a final eight, where Kansas slipped off the bracket in 2016 as a No. 1 seed against Villanova, and in 2017 as a No. 1 seed in Kansas City against Oregon. \"I think about it all the time,\" said Self, whose two Final Four trips with Kansas came in 2008 (champion) and 2012 (runner-up). \"Devonte's not won the last two, but there's seven that I haven't won when I've been the head coach,\" counting one each at Tulsa and Illinois.\n\n\"Certainly it's etched in the back of my brain,\" he said -- and in the linings of many stomachs.\n\nMore NCAA tournament coverage:\n\nPorter Moser has led Loyola Chicago to new heights after hitting a career low\n\nLoyola Chicago doesn't need divine intervention to reach the Final Four\n\nKentucky Gentlemen?

                "body": "LOS ANGELES -- No. 9 seed Florida State (23-11) vs. No. 3 seed Michigan (31-7)\n\nFinal, West Region, Los Angeles, Saturday, approximately 8:49 p.m.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Michigan could earn a trip to its first Final Four since 2013 by setting a school record with its 32nd victory, but the Big Ten tournament champions must avoid becoming the fourth consecutive upset victim of Florida State. The Seminoles are surprisingly on the brink of the second Final Four in school history after extending the momentum from their upset of top-seeded Xavier last week by knocking out Gonzaga.\n\nBIGGER NUMBERS: After mostly muddling through last week's opening NCAA Tournament games, the Wolverines hit their offensive stride with a 99-point thrashing of Texas A&M in the Sweet Sixteen. Coach John Beilein credits his players' embrace of their up-tempo, aggressive approach while hitting nearly 62 percent of their shots. Michigan had five double-digit scorers in the Sweet Sixteen game, while Florida State had just one while beating Gonzaga.\n\nRARE AIR: Florida State is in the Elite Eight for just the third time in school history, while Michigan has made it three times in the last six years alone. These Seminoles probably aren't coach Leonard Hamilton's most talented team, but they embrace his motto of \"18 Strong\" by playing tremendous team ball on both ends, focused on game-changing defense. Florida State's only other Final Four trip came in 1972.\n\nON A ROLL: Michigan's 12-game winning streak is the second-longest in the nation thanks to the Seminoles, who ended the Zags' 16-game winning streak.\n\nQUOTABLE: \"We realize they have a unique system. They have a 7-footer that shoots 40 percent (on 3-pointers), which is unusual in itself. We have a couple of 7-footers that are more low post-type guys that don't guard people on the perimeter as well as probably you would need to. So we have adjustments we're going to have to make.\" -- Hamilton on Moritz Wagner, Michigan's sharpshooting German big man\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Fallen hopes: Zagitova, Kostner errors hand title to Osmond",
                "body": "ASSAGO, Italy -- Olympic bronze medalist Kaetlyn Osmond of Canada won the figure skating world title Friday with a nearly perfect performance as Olympic champion Alina Zagitova fell a jaw-dropping three times and crowd favorite Carolina Kostner turned in a lackluster skate -- both tumbling completely off the podium.\n\nOsmond, who skated first in the final group, watched with amazement from the sidelines after Zagitova's and Kostner's disastrous programs handed her the title and deprived the two favorites any medals at all. Japan's Wakaba Higuchi won silver and teammate Satoko Miyahara took bronze.\n\n\"I was fighting to skate clean and fighting to hit the podium. Being world champ is something I definitely never expected,\" said the 22-year-old Osmond, who ended a 45-year women's world title drought for Canada. \"And Carolina and Zagitova are both very strong competitors and very consistent competitors. Unfortunately, it didn't work for them today, but they are always incredible to watch.\n\n\"I am just happy I did what I could today,\" said Osmond.\n\nSkating to a Swan Lake-Black Swan suite, Osmond easily won the long program with 150.50 points for a total score of 223.23.\n\nShe hit seven triples with only a minor deduction for stepping out of a combination jump, seemingly leaving the door open to either Kostner, who had an eight-point lead after the short program, and the young Russian jumping genius, Zagitova, to battle for the title.\n\nBut Zagitova fell on a straight lutz, missing a combination, then fell again on two subsequent combinations. The 15-year-old waited two minutes to start her jumps, which in theory raises their value, but in this competition she seemed sapped of energy. The crowd rallied behind her in sympathy after the second fall, clapping rhythmically to urge her on.\n\nAll Kostner had to do was skate clean. But her nerves showed when she doubled an opening triple lutz. And she fell on a triple salchow late in the program and singled an axel. All of her artistic prowess couldn't make up for the errors in what could be her last world championship -- in her home country no less.\n\nKostner said she wasn't aware of Zagitova's errors when she took the ice last.\n\n\"You can see the fatigue in everyone's legs. We are all human beings. We have strong emotions when we are out there,\" Kostner said. \"I think that above all, the fact of feeling nervousness means it is important for us. You know how much work we have put in.\"\n\nWhile she said she was disappointed with the result, the 31-year-old former world title holder and Olympic bronze medalist said she wouldn't decide her future in the heat of the moment.\n\nIn a roller-coaster 15-year career, Kostner has won 11 European medals, the most of any woman, and three world championship medals in 14 appearances. There also have been painful moments, including a suspension for lying to doping officials for an ex-boyfriend that cost her two seasons.\n\nZagitova, who looked stunned at the end of her program, refused to comment.\n\nJapan's medals ensure its team three spots at worlds next year, which will be in Japan.\n\nAmericans Bradie Tennell and Mirai Nagasu finished sixth and tenth, respectively, leaving the U.S. women with just two spots next year.\n\nIn the ice dance, Olympic silver medalists Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron of France skated with nary a wardrobe mishap to lead the short program with a season's best performance\n\nPapadakis wore the same tropical flare dress that came undone during the Olympics -- this time with extra safety measures sewed in during a trip to their training home in Montreal. And Cizeron had on his sleeveless muscle shirt as they performed perfectly executed direction-changing spins in unison and quick-moving rhumba steps to Latin dance and a musical medley including Ed Sheeran's \"Shape of You.\"\n\nAfter the opening of her dress made headlines in South Korea, Papadakis said she made sure that it wouldn't \"open in anyway,\"\n\n\"And it didn't,\" she said triumphantly.\n\nThere was something about the Italian ice that brought out the best in the ice dancers, with all top three couples in the short skating season-best performances.\n\nThe French couple, the only Olympic medalists at worlds, had 83.73 points ahead of U.S. couple Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, who pierced the 80-point ceiling for the first time. Canadians Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje finished third with 78.31.\n\n\"We wanted to go home from the Olympics and keep improving and really put out an incredible performance,\" Hubbell said, adding that they were especially pleased to have achieved the highest levels for all their elements. \"We really feel we gave our best performance today.\"\n\nThis story has been corrected to change the spelling of Kaetlyn Osmond's first name.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Trump issues order supporting ban on many transgender troops, defers to Pentagon on new restrictions",
                "body": "President Trump issued an order late Friday that supports a ban on many transgender troops, deferring to a new Pentagon plan that is more restrictive than a policy adopted by the Obama administration.\n\nThe decision revokes a full ban that Trump issued last summer but disqualifies U.S. troops who have had gender reassignment surgery, as recommended by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\n\"By its very nature, military service requires sacrifice,\" Mattis wrote in a memo to the president that was released Friday. \"The men and women who serve voluntarily accept limitations on their personal liberties -- freedom of speech, political activity, freedom of movement -- in order to provide the military lethality and readiness necessary to ensure American citizens enjoy their personal freedoms to the fullest extent.\"\n\nCurrent transgender service members who have not undergone reassignment surgery should be allowed to stay, as long as they have been medically stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex before joining the military and are able to deploy across the world, Mattis recommended.\n\nIn one concession to transgender service members, Mattis recommended that anyone who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the condition of wanting to transition gender, since the Obama administration ended the Pentagon's longtime ban on transgender service in 2016 may continue to serve. The decision amounts to a \"grandfathering\" of those involved with the new policy.\n\nThe new plan will be challenged in court, just as the full ban that Trump issued last summer was, in at least four separate cases that are still ongoing. Federal judges allowed transgender service members to continue serving under the old ban and permitted transgender recruits to join the military as well.\n\nThe Justice Department filed a copy of Mattis's recommendations in at least one of those legal battles Friday.\n\n\"In service to the ideological goals of the Trump-Pence base, the Pentagon has distorted the science on transgender health to prop up irrational and legally untenable discrimination that will erode military readiness,\" said Aaron Belkin, who has studied transgender issues for the Palm Center, a think tank that had worked with the Obama administration in repealing the previous ban. \"There is no evidence to support a policy that bars from military service patriotic Americans who are medically fit and able to deploy. Our troops and our nation deserve better.\"\n\nIn his memo to the president, Mattis specifically challenged the thinking of the Obama administration when it repealed the ban in 2016. Mattis said that he found a Rand Corp. study -- commissioned by the Pentagon under Obama that became a backbone of the repeal process -- to be flawed.\n\n\"It referred to limited and heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of health care costs, readiness and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own,\" Mattis wrote. \"In short, this policy issue has proven more complex than the prior administration or RAND assumed.\"\n\nThe new direction comes after months of the Pentagon's grappling with how to change its policy after Trump unexpectedly tweeted July 26 that he was banning all transgender people from serving in the military. The president, without any plan in place, cited the \"tremendous medical costs and disruption\" that he believed transgender military service would cause, and said that he had consulted with \"my Generals and military experts.\"\n\nA day later, Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, released a memo effectively stopping the military from making any changes until a new policy was adopted, and Mattis backed the move.\n\nIn August, Trump issued a presidential memorandum providing more detail. He accused the Obama administration of allowing transgender military service without identifying a \"sufficient basis\" that doing so would not \"hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources,\" and he directed Mattis to have the Pentagon adopt a new ban similar to the military's former policy by Friday.\n\nThe Obama administration began allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military in June 2016, following a review that dragged out months longer than expected amid internal conflict in the Pentagon over how the change would be made. Until then, the Pentagon considered gender dysphoria a disqualifying mental illness.\n\nIn removing the ban, then-Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter stopped the military from involuntarily separating anyone in the service, and gave the service branches a year to iron out how they would begin processing transgender recruits. A year later, Mattis delayed allowing transgender recruits for an additional six months as the deadline neared, saying the issue needed more study.\n\nTrump's tweets came a few weeks later.\n\nFederal judges required the military to allow transgender recruits beginning Jan. 1, and the Pentagon signaled in December that it would not stand in the way of the courts' rulings. Instead, it issued new policy guidance to recruits to explain how to enlist transgender men and women, and stated in a policy paper that the guidance \"shall remain in effect until expressly revoked.\"",

                "body": "Washington Bullets great Phil Chenier is greeted by his children and grandchildren during a halftime ceremony in which the team retired his jersey at Capital One Arena. (Photo by Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nPhil Chenier looked to the rafters of the Capital One Arena and saw his name and number. But he didn't stare. In the moment -- Chenier's jersey retirement ceremony that happened in front of family, former teammates and thousands of fans celebrating the franchise's best era -- he did not notice the special flair added to his banner. Unlike the other icons hanging from above, Chenier's flag bears a microphone and \"33\" to signify his years as the team's television color analyst.\n\nChenier said he'll have to look a little closer later because once the banner was revealed, his emotions took over.\n\n\"To look at that 45, I got choked up,\" Chenier said. \"But it looked great. It was nice to see that number up there.\"\n\n[ D.C. Sports Bog: A brief guide to the Bullets' retired numbers ]\n\nDuring halftime of the Wizards' game against the Denver Nuggets on Friday night, Chenier became the fifth Bullets player to have his number retired, joining an iconic starting quintet that includes Earl Monroe (No. 10), Elvin Hayes (11), Gus Johnson (25) and Wes Unseld (41). Steve Buckhantz, the Wizards' play-by-play television announcer, emceed the event and called the five players \"the most synonymous\" with the Bullets/Wizards organization. With his role as a broadcaster, Chenier has been as linked to the team as anyone -- a point that Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar touched on in his video tribute. Jabbar's one question: \"Why did it take so long?\"\n\n\"Our players, they love Phil,\" Coach Scott Brooks said. \"When he comes around, you can just tell. He lights up the court just from his presence. He always just gives you the positive encouragement. He's one of the all-time best. We're all honored to be a part of this great night, not only for him, for his family.\"\n\nChenier played nine of his 10 NBA seasons with the Bullets and averaged 17.9 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists. While Chenier stood out as the team's best scorer from the 1973-74 to 1975-76 seasons, he was slowed by back injuries later in his playing career. Chenier did not play in the second half of the 1977-78 season and, as the Bullets won the NBA championship against the Seattle SuperSonics, he watched from the stands. Still, Chenier left an undeniable impact on the franchise while playing in an era without the three-point shot\n\nChenier ranks in the top five in franchise history in field goal attempts (9,103), field goals made (4,057), two-point field goals (4,054) and steals (667) and owns the record for points scored in a non-overtime game (53).\n\n[ D.C. Sports Bog: Phil Chenier was expecting a \"surreal\" moment when his jersey was retired ]\n\n\"It's unbelievable. It's more than deserving. I was happy to be the one who told him about it. It's a special night for him,\" Bradley Beal said. \"He's shown what it takes to be great and he's being rewarded for it tonight.\"\n\nLast summer, Beal sat down with Chenier for an interview on the Monumental Sports Network and revealed that the No. 45 would join the rafters.\n\n\"Well, Legend. ...\" Beal said to Chenier near the end of their sit-down, slowly letting out the surprise announcement and calling him by the nickname used in the Wizards' locker room.\n\nOver Beal's six-year career in Washington, the two shooting guards have grown close, Chenier imparting wisdom to the rising star and providing a guide in how to become a Washington cornerstone. The 24-year-0ld Beal, who is chasing franchise three-point shooting records, aspires to jersey-in-the-rafters status when his playing days are over.\n\n\"The knowledge that he shares with me and the constant push he puts on me every now and then, whenever he sees me, it's always motivation for me to get better and now I feel like this is the final touch of it,\" Beal said. \"Having your jersey retired by a franchise that you played a lot of part in its success -- it's motivation.\"\n\n[ Long labeled as injury prone, Bradley Beal has goal to play all 82 ]\n\nBeal has heard the stories, but Brooks used to watch Chenier in action. Brooks was familiar with Chenier's game when the coach was younger, but he didn't meet the man until getting hired by the Wizards in 2016.\n\n\"I've been here for two years and you never, ever can get anybody to say anything bad about him,\" Brooks said. \"He's just a terrific guy.\"\n\nNow that Chenier is no longer the full-time television color analyst for the team, he does not travel to road games. He does, however, still watch the Wizards and often reaches out to Brooks after big wins.\n\n\"I watched him when I was a young kid but I never knew him, never met him until I became the coach,\" Brooks said. \"It's a thrill when I get a text message after some games congratulating us how we played from him. It's pretty cool.\n\n\"Now,\" Brooks continued. \"I can call him a friend and it's going to be neat every time we come into this arena after tonight, we can look up and see his jersey because it's well deserved. You want guys like him to represent your organization and there's nobody we can ask for as a better representative to the Bullets back then and the Wizards now.\"\n\nNear the end of his speech, Chenier became visibly emotional when he acknowledged his mother, who could not make it to the ceremony. However, Chenier shared the court with his children and grandchildren and when he gazed toward the box suites, he saw several former teammates from the 1978 championship team.\n\n\"When you play the game,\" Chenier said, \"you play for acceptance.\"\n\nAfter four decades as a face of the franchise, Chenier earned the ultimate sign of acceptance.\n\n\"You're surrounded by so many people that meant a lot to you,\" Chenier said. \"I'm humbled to the deepest.\"",

                "body": "The Latest on the NCAA Tournament (all times Eastern):\n\n12:20 a.m.\n\nDuke is back in the Elite Eight for the first time since its 2015 team won it all after holding off a late charge from rival Syracuse 69-65 on Friday night in the Midwest Region semifinals.\n\nMarvin Bagley scored 22 points and Wendell Carter Jr had 14 with 12 rebounds for the Blue Devils (29-7), who will face top-seeded Kansas -- a rare matchup of bluebloods in a tournament defined by chaos -- on Sunday in Omaha.\n\nBut Duke couldn't shake the Orange (23-14) until the final buzzer sounded.\n\nDuke's Marvin Bagley III dunks during the second half of a regional semifinal game against Syracuse in the NCAA men's college basketball tournament Friday, March 23, 2018, in Omaha, Neb. (Nati Harnik/Associated Press)\n\nSharp-shooting Grayson Allen missed the front end of a one-and-one with 12 seconds left and Duke up 67-64. The Blue Devils fouled rather than let Syracuse go for a game-tying 3, and Tyus Battle only made one of two from the line.\n\nGary Trent Jr. then made two free throws with 6.3 seconds to go to seal a closer-than-expected win that was similar to the Jayhawks' 80-76 win over Clemson -- a game Kansas led by 20 at one point.\n\nBattle had 19 points to lead the Orange. Allen had 15 for Duke, but he was just 3 of 14 on 3s.\n\n-- Luke Meredith reporting from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n11:50 p.m.\n\nA poor shooting night by Grayson Allen hasn't kept Duke from controlling Syracuse and its fearsome 2-3 zone defense.\n\nAllen is just 3 of 11 from 3-point range and the Blue Devils are just 5 of 20 overall from deep.\n\nBut Duke has forced the Orange into 14 turnovers and held a 50-45 lead midway through the second half, despite allowing a pair of quick baskets that so infuriated Coach Mike Krzyzewski that he ripped his jacket off in frustration -- drawing oohs and aahs from a crowd full of blue-clad Blue Devils fans.\n\n-- Luke Meredith reporting from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n11:40 p.m.\n\nDuke is making a run.\n\nThe second-seeded Blue Devils have built a seven-point lead on 11th-seeded Syracuse with about 11 minutes to go in a Midwest Region semifinal.\n\nThe pace has picked up a bit in a game between two Atlantic Coast Conference tournament teams that play zone defense. Duke is 5 of 19 from the 3-point arc but has a decided advantage at the foul line, outscoring Syracuse 13-4.\n\nThe winner plays top-seeded Kansas on Sunday in the Elite Eight.\n\n11:16 p.m.\n\nTexas Tech scored 10 straight points to finish the first half and take a 30-25 halftime lead in its Sweet 16 matchup with Purdue.\n\nThe third-seeded Red Raiders trailed most of the first half. It was 25-20 Purdue with 3:43 to play when the second-seeded Boilermakers went cold.\n\nThe teams are hoping for a spot in Sunday's East regional final against top-seeded Villanova, which beat West Virginia 90-78 earlier Friday night.\n\nJustin Gray had eight points and five rebounds in the half for the Red Raiders.\n\nP.J. Thompson and Vincent Edwards each had eight points for Purdue, and Edwards also pulled down seven boards.\n\n11:03 p.m.\n\nNo Isaac Haas for Purdue.\n\nNot much scoring overall in the East Region semifinal between the second-seeded Boilermakers and third-seeded Texas Tech.\n\nThe game slowed to a defensive crawl for much of the first half tied at 15 before both teams finally found the bucket again. Purdue led 25-20 with 3:27 left in the first half.\n\nTexas Tech is shooting 33 percent overall and 2 of 9 from 3-point range.\n\nFor Purdue, Haas as expected has not played because of an elbow injury. Haas is one of the best big men in the tournament.\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nDespite a sterling start from upset-minded Syracuse, second-seeded Duke is slowly taking control of things in Omaha.\n\nGrayson Allen calmly buried a 3 from the top of the key to cap a 10-0 run and put the Blue Devils ahead 34-27 at halftime in the first half of the Midwest Region semifinal.\n\nDuke is attacking Syracuse's post players and it's working, as the Blue Devils have already hit 11 free throws.\n\nSyracuse hit 8 of its first 12 shots, but after Duke's defense settled down the Orange missed 11 of their next 14 shots -- and stellar freshman big man Marek Dolezaj has been a victim of Duke's aggressiveness, picking up three fouls in just two minutes.\n\nSyracuse certainly isn't intimidated by their ACC rivals as other teams might be in such a big spot. But if the Blue Devils open the second half like they closed the first, things could get ugly in a hurry.\n\n__Luke Meredith reporting from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n10:52 p.m.\n\nCan another No. 11 seed join Loyola-Chicago in the Elite Eight?\n\nThe 11th-seeded Orange can do it if they can overcome a 34-27 halftime deficit to second-seeded Duke in a Midwest Region semifinal in Omaha, Nebraska. It was a tight game before the Blue Devils went on a 10-0 run to finish the first half.\n\nThe winner of this all-Atlantic Coast Conference affair meets Kansas on Sunday for the right to go to the Final Four.\n\n10:24 p.m.\n\nSyracuse is giving second-seeded Duke all it can handle in Omaha.\n\nThe 11th-seeded Orange hit eight of its first 12 shots, all but one of them from inside the 3-point line, to pull within 19-17 on the heavily-favored Blue Devils midway through the first half.\n\nThat's nearly half of the 44 points Syracuse scored in an ugly 16-point loss in Cameron Indoor Stadium on Feb. 24. But Duke, which made just two 3s in that victory, has already knocked down a few from beyond the arc -- a key in defeating Syracuse's headache-inducing 2-3 zone.\n\nThe winner faces Kansas in the Midwest Region final on Sunday.\n\n-- Luke Meredith reporting from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n10:01 p.m.\n\nThe all-Atlantic Coast Conference matchup in the Sweet 16 is underway in Omaha. Second-seeded Duke and No. 11 seed Syracuse have tipped off for the right to face top-seeded Kansas in the Elite Eight.\n\nThere was only one regular-season meeting, and it wasn't a high-scoring one.\n\nDuke beat Syracuse 60-44 at home on Feb. 24, holding the Orange to 31.5 percent shooting that included going 6 of 25 (24 percent) from behind the arc. The 44 points matched a season-low for Syracuse.\n\nThe Blue Devils didn't find a lot of freedom against the Orange's zone. Duke shot 41.5 percent and made 2 of 18 3s despite playing in the friendly confines of Cameron Indoor Stadium.\n\n9:55 p.m.\n\nTop-seeded Villanova beat the press of West Virginia and advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nJalen Brunson scored 27 points to lead the Wildcats to a 90-78 victory over fifth-seeded West Virginia. Villanova will play the winner of the regional semifinal later Friday night between No. 2 seed Purdue and third-seeded Texas Tech for a spot in the Final Four.\n\nVillanova trailed by 6 before scoring 11 straight points to take a 65-60 lead with 9:03 remaining. The 2016 national champions led 68-64 before scoring 10 of the next 14 points to pull away.\n\nOmari Spellman scored 18 with eight rebounds for Villanova, which overcame Press Virginia's well-known defense by hitting 13 of 24 shots from 3-point range.\n\nDaxter Miles Jr. scored 16 for the Mountaineers before fouling out with just over two minutes left. Sagaba Konate added 12 points with nine rebounds.\n\n9:29 p.m.\n\nKansas made it through the Sweet 16 for the third year in a row as a No. 1 seed after surviving a late scare and beating fifth-seeded Clemson 80-76 in a Midwest Region semifinal.\n\nNow the Jayhawks will try to get through the Elite Eight for the first time since 2012, when they lost the national title to Kentucky. They'll play Sunday against the winner of Friday night's second semifinal between No. 2 seed Duke and 11-seed Syracuse.\n\nClemson, in a regional semifinal for the first time since 1997, had a six-minute field goal drought and shot 36 percent in the first half. The Tigers trailed by 20 early in the second half.\n\nBut a 26-12 run fueled by Gabe DeVoe got Clemson within 74-68. DeVoe's two free throws pulled the Tigers to 78-74 with 14 seconds left, but the Jayhawks were able to hang on.\n\nMalik Newman scored 17 points to lead Kansas, Devonte Graham added 16 and Udoka Azubuike had 14 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out with 2:30 left.\n\nDeVoe finished with a career-high 31 points.\n\n-- Eric Olson reporting from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n9:25 p.m.\n\nVillanova has turned back a West Virginia run and retaken the lead midway through the second half.\n\nThe Mountaineers held the Wildcats without a basket for more than three minutes while opening up a six-point lead with 11 minutes to play. But top-seeded Villanova roared back will 11 straight points to make it 65-60.\n\nAfter Mikal Bridges gave Villanova the lead with a 3-pointer, Omari Spellman produced an emphatic dunk on James Bolden. At the other end, Spellman slammed in a putback after Phil Booth's miss to make it a five-point game.\n\nWest Virginia cut the lead to three before the under-eight minute timeout.\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nDown by 20 points at one point in the second half, Clemson has used a 26-12 surge to pull within 74-68 in its Midwest Region semifinal against Kansas.\n\nShelton Mitchell's thunderous dunk forced the Jayhawks to call timeout with 2:27 left.\n\n9:10 p.m.\n\nThe lineups are out for the Purdue-Texas Tech game and Isaac Hass isn't in it.\n\nThe Boilermakers center broke his elbow in their NCAA tournament opener and hasn't played since. That hasn't stopped him from trying, though.\n\nHe's been out on the court practicing with his teammates, trying to prove to coach Matt Painter that he can contribute at least a few minutes. The Purdue engineering department was even on the job, working up a special brace that was approved by the NCAA.\n\nBut Painter said Haas can't play unless he can rebound with two hands and shoot a free throw right-handed. Haas couldn't do that, as of Thursday.\n\nRedshirt freshman Matt Haarms was listed in the lineup instead.\n\n9:02 p.m.\n\nThe players are getting a bit of a history lesson at this year's East regional in Boston.\n\nThe banners honoring the Celtics and Bruins championships and retired numbers were allowed to remain in the rafters at the TD Garden this year -- a change from previous events here.\n\n\"Part of the allure of being in Boston is playing beneath our championship banners,\" TD Garden president Amy Latimer said. \"We are proud to have them on display and part of the student-athlete experience.\"\n\nWhen NCAA tournament last came to town in 2012, the banners were replaced by ones noting past college basketball champions. The 17 Celtics championship banners and six for the Bruins were brought to a Salvation Army facility, where fans lined up to take pictures with them.\n\nThe Celtics also have three banners to honor their 23 retired numbers. The Bruins have retired 10 numbers.\n\n9 p.m.\n\nClemson is trying to get back into its Midwest Region semifinal game against Kansas after falling behind by 20 points.\n\nThe lead was down to 13 with 5:57 left. Malik Newman led Kansas with 16 points. The Jayhawks were shooting 51 percent from the floor to 43 percent for Clemson.\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- For the second consecutive season, the San Francisco Giants will be without injured ace Madison Bumgarner for a while.\n\nBumgarner broke a bone in his pitching hand Friday when it was hit by a line drive off the bat of Kansas City's Whit Merrifield during a spring training game.\n\nThe Giants said X-rays showed the 28-year-old fractured the fifth metacarpal on the outside of his left hand. Bumgarner said the timeline for recovery is four to six weeks and he will have a pin inserted into his pinkie Saturday.\n\n\"It's tough. But I can handle it,\" Bumgarner said. \"These guys can handle it. This obviously was not what I was expecting out of my last start. But it happened and I can deal with it.\"\n\nBumgarner, the 2014 World Series MVP, missed nearly three months with a shoulder injury last season after a dirt bike accident on April 20 during an off day in Colorado.\n\nHis latest setback is a huge blow to the Giants as they try to rebound from a surprising last-place finish in the NL West with 98 losses.\n\n\"It's just a downer. This was a short day. I feel for him,\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \"Obviously, we know what he means to us, but where he was, how well he's thrown the ball all spring. Unfortunately, you've got to deal with these things. But this one certainly was a downer today because we were all getting ready to go to San Francisco and now we've got to make some adjustments.\"\n\nAfter six straight seasons with double-digit wins, more than 200 innings and 30-plus starts, Bumgarner went 4-9 with a 3.32 ERA in 17 starts last season and threw just 111 innings.\n\nBochy wasn't ready to say whether right-hander Johnny Cueto would move into the No. 1 spot and pitch Thursday's opener at the NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers. Jeff Samardzija has a strained pectoral muscle that will shut him down for at least a week and likely force him to start the season on the disabled list.\n\n\"This is horrible news for us,\" Bochy said. \"There's nothing else we can do now except push on.\"\n\nCheslor Cuthbert hit a solo home run off Bumgarner and had four hits as a Royals split squad beat the Giants 9-6. Pablo Sandoval hit his third homer for the Giants.\n\nELSEWHERE AROUND THE GRAPEFRUIT AND CACTUS LEAGUES\n\nDODGERS 10, ROYALS (SS) 0\n\nClayton Kershaw stretched his scoreless streak to 21 1/3 innings with 6 2/3 innings in his final tuneup for Thursday's opener against San Francisco. He allowed a leadoff single to Jon Jay and no other hits. He struck out four and walked none in his first appearance since turning 30 on Monday. Ricky Nolasco, who signed with Kansas City on March 7, allowed eight runs, five hits and two walks over 2 2/3 innings in his first start.\n\nRED SOX 5, YANKEES 0\n\nAaron Judge hit leadoff for the first time in his professional career and went 1 for 4. Masahiro Tanaka gave up one run and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. Boston's Sam Travis hit his sixth home run and Ivan De Jesus Jr. had three hits, including a home run.\n\nCARDINALS 5, METS 1\n\nMichael Conforto went 1 for 4 as a designated hitter in his first big league game action since surgery Sept. 6 to repair a tear in the posterior capsule in his left shoulder.\n\nPHILLIES 8, PIRATES 2\n\nMaikel Franco hit a two-run homer and a grand slam after entering with a .167 average in 48 at-bats. Aaron Nola allowed four hits in his last outing before his first opening-day start, at Cincinnati.\n\nORIOLES 6, RAYS (SS) 1\n\nBaltimore opening-day starter Dylan Bundy yielded one run and five hits in five innings, and Chris Davis and Trey Mancini hit two-run homers. Kean Wong, a brother of Cardinals second baseman Kolten Wong, had a pair of hits for the Rays.\n\nRAYS (SS) 6, BLUE JAYS 5\n\nBlue Jays starter J.A. Happ allowed two hits in four scoreless innings. C.J. Cron had three hits, and Rays closer Alex Colome fanned one in a perfect sixth.\n\nTIGERS 11, BRAVES 3\n\nJames McCann doubled twice and drove in five runs. Detroit's Norris gave up three runs -- two earned -- three hits and four walks in five innings. Anibal Sanchez made his second start for Atlanta, allowing three runs and seven hits in five innings. Freddie Freeman hit his second homer.\n\nASTROS (SS) 2, TWINS 2\n\nRyan LaMarre's double leading off the ninth inning was the first hit for Minnesota and Tanner English followed his first homer. J.D. Davis hit a pair of solo homers, raising his total to five.\n\nROCKIES 8, REDS 2\n\nHomer Bailey, picked to start the Reds' opener, allowed consecutive homers in the fourth to Nolan Arenado and Carlos Gonzalez. Bailey, limited to 26 starts over the past three seasons because of injuries to his forearm and elbow, gave up three runs and eight hits in five innings.\n\nATHLETICS 4, ANGELS 2\n\nAlbert Pujols hit his first spring training homer for Los Angeles. Jake Smolinski finished a single shy of hitting for the cycle for Oakland.\n\nCUBS 4, BREWERS 3\n\nIan Happ hit his sixth homer. Tyler Chatwood allowed two runs, six hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings and also hit an RBI double.\n\nMARINERS 5, WHITE SOX 5,\n\nJames Shields struck out three in three shutout innings. Dan Vogelbach hit his sixth homer, Kirk Nieuwenhuis hit a two-run homer and pinch-hitter Craig Dedelow had a tying three-run drive in the eighth.\n\nNATIONALS (SS) 6, MARLINS 3\n\nJeremy Hellickson made his Washington debut, allowing one run in four innings while striking out four. Starlin Castro had two hits for Miami.\n\nASTROS (SS) 3, NATIONALS (SS) 1\n\nGerrit Cole struck out six over 3 1/3 innings for Houston. He gave up one run and five hits in a split-squad game.

Alonso is batting .396 with seven homers and 12 RBIs this spring.\n\nIndians starter Mike Clevinger struck out seven and walked none over 5 2/3 innings. He gave up one run and three hits. Corbin was touched up for three runs -- two earned -- and six hits in five-plus innings.\n\nPADRES 9, RANGERS 7\n\nHunter Renfroe hit his sixth homer of the spring for San Diego. He connected off Texas starter Martin Perez, who gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings.\n\nSan Diego starter Bryan Mitchell was tagged for seven runs, eight hits and three walks in four innings.

Lincoln, likely bemused and relieved at the distraction from America's then-raging Civil War, politely declined Mongut's offer to send a pair of elephants as a gift to the United States, saying his country uses the steam engine and would have no use for the working animals. (Sakchai Lalit/Associated Press)\n\nIn his 1861 letters, Mongkut offered the elephants after learning they were not native to America. He also sent along three gifts: a sword and scabbard, a photograph of the king with one of his daughters, and an impressive pair of elephant tusks.\n\nHe addressed the letters to then-President James Buchanan \"or whomever would become president\" with elaborate paragraph-long salutations.\n\nLincoln was already president by the time the letters arrived, a year later. He penned a reply where he simply addressing the king as \"Great and Good Friend.\"\n\nThe offer of elephants did not neglect practical details. Mongkut stated, \"On this account, we desire to procure and send elephants to be let loose to increase and multiply in the continent of America.\" But Thailand -- then called Siam -- did not have a large enough vessel to transport them, the letter said.\n\nIt continued: \"In reference to this opinion of ours if the President of the United States and Congress who conjointly with him rule the country see fit to approve, let them provide a large vessel loaded with hay and other food suitable for elephants on the voyage, with tanks holding a sufficiency of fresh water, and arranged with stalls so that the elephants can both stand and lie down in the ship -- and send it to receive them. We on our part will procure young male and female elephants and forward them one or two pairs at a time.\"\n\nMongkut then in his letter directs that the elephants should be kept away from the cold and under the sun, and to also \"let them with all haste be turned out to run wild in some jungle suitable for them not confining them any length of time.\"\n\n\"If these means can be done we trust that the elephants will propagate their species hereafter in the continent of America.\"\n\nThai monarchy expert Tongthong Chandransu said the offer of elephants reveals that Mongkut wanted to be part of building the young United States.\n\n\"You have to consider that 200 years ago elephants were an important means of transportation and helped a lot with our work, not to mention warfare, but also the building of homes and cities,\" Tongthong said.\n\nThe ever-practical Lincoln rejected the offer to send wild elephants running through American forests, saying the country \"does not reach a latitude so low as to favor the multiplication of the elephant.\" He said in his 1862 letter that \"steam on land, as well as on water, has been our best and most efficient agent of transportation in internal commerce.\"\n\nThe exhibition runs until June 30.\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://www.greatandgoodfriends.com/\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "How a Trump power play upended the $30 billion Gateway project",
                "body": "From left, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, President Trump, Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) and Vice President Pence leave an event at the Capitol on March 15. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nThe deal was struck last week in an ornate room just off the House floor, where two New Yorkers discussed a big infrastructure project in their home town as dignitaries milled around a St. Patrick's Day luncheon.\n\nPresident Trump's message to Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) was simple, King recounted Thursday: Federal money would flow to the $30 billion Gateway project, but Trump had to be in control.\n\nIn the end, that is largely what happened: After weeks of precarious negotiations, the $1.3 billion spending bill the president eventually signed Friday doesn't explicitly mention Gateway and reverses some earlier attempts to steer funding its way.\n\nTrump's puzzling intervention to seemingly derail the kind of megaproject that a self-styled master builder might be expected to champion was less about Gateway's merits and more about who was backing it -- specifically, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), according to multiple lawmakers and congressional aides involved. His decision to prioritize a political blow to Schumer offers a fresh demonstration of how Trump dealt with his political rivals in the months leading up to his signing of the spending bill -- hours after he delivered one last veto threat over its failure to deliver substantial border wall funding.\n\n\"I think he was upset by a lack of cooperation on other issues, and I think he wanted to show that you don't take anything for granted,\" said King, who kept details of his conversations with the president private until the House passed the bill Thursday.\n\nTrump's priority quickly became a Republican priority. At a Thursday news conference, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) counted handing the administration more control over Gateway among the GOP's key wins in the sweeping spending bill. He detailed how he overruled efforts by his own Appropriations Committee chairman, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.), to direct $900 million to the project.\n\n\"We stripped that language from this bill so that there's more discretion for the administration,\" Ryan said.\n\nWhether it made a difference to the future of the project -- a rail tunnel and bridge connecting New Jersey and Manhattan -- is a matter of debate. Those who support the project, Republicans and Democrats, assert that it remains on track even after Trump's intervention.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), speaks at a news conference Thursday. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nSchumer told reporters Thursday that the bill continues to offer a \"reliable pathway\" for Gateway through accounts controlled by Amtrak and the states, not by Trump. King, too, said that money would keep flowing to Gateway and that Trump would ultimately support the project.\n\n\"It doesn't say Gateway. It's not specific to Gateway. But the money is there,\" King said.\n\n[Inside Trump's decision to block a crucial New York-New Jersey tunnel project]\n\nBut the final bill brings the funding more firmly under the administration's control. Accounts that appropriators had proposed pumping up for Gateway shrunk in the final deal, and guidelines that would have given the project a leg up in administration funding decisions disappeared. Even project backers acknowledge that only $541 million will be easily accessible to the project this fiscal year, vs. the $900 million eyed last year.\n\nDavid Van Slyke, dean of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University and an expert on major infrastructure projects, said Trump's opposition to Gateway -- as a builder and as a New Yorker -- is mystifying and potentially discourages investors in the sort of public-private projects his administration is advocating.\n\n\"When he gets involved in a project like this, it's hard to understand . . . what is his preferred alternative?\" he said. \"What is the underlying set of goals? He's for something until he appears to be against something.\"\n\nThe deal struck this week followed more than a year of hardball politics -- dating back to Schumer's decision to vote against confirming Elaine Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch Connell (R-Ky.), as transportation secretary. Schumer later held up other Transportation Department nominees in part to advance Gateway, according to aides familiar with the dispute.\n\nBy September, Trump was well aware that Gateway was a top priority for Schumer. A bipartisan delegation that included Schumer, the governors of New York and New Jersey, and numerous lawmakers visited the Oval Office to garner the president's support.\n\nThey left the meeting -- where by all accounts Trump was at his charming, black-slapping best -- confident that his administration would back the project as it started moving through the long pipeline for federal funding. And they had an ace in the hole: As House appropriations chairman, Frelinghuysen could steer dollars in its direction.\n\nA spending bill that passed the House in September was accompanied by a report ordering the Transportation Department to give preference to grant applications addressing \"major critical assets which have conditions that pose a substantial risk now or in the future to the reliability of train service.\" Another provision reserved $400 million for new projects that only Gateway could qualify for.\n\nBut as the Oval Office meeting broke up, there was a signal that Trump saw a bargaining chip, not just a vital project: Trump pulled Schumer aside, according to a person familiar with the encounter, and offered to trade Gateway funding for his border wall.\n\nThat offer went nowhere. \"I didn't want to get involved in any trading,\" Schumer said Thursday, speaking generally about his approach to Gateway.\n\nStill, the project remained on Trump's mind, and White House aides fueled his doubts, portraying Gateway as a politically motivated boondoggle that was sucking dollars away from other administration priorities.\n\n\"You put that much money into one project, it's going to crimp projects across the country,\" Marc Short, Trump's legislative affairs chief, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nFrom left, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), second lady Karen Pence, Vice President Pence and President Trump at the ceremony for the late Billy Graham in the Capitol on Feb. 28. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Pool/European Pressphoto Agence-Efe/Shutterstock)\n\nMatters came to a head Feb. 28, when Trump came to the Capitol to welcome the casket of the late preacher Billy Graham. As he waited to enter the Rotunda, Trump cornered Ryan, raised the Gateway proposal and made clear he would veto any bill that funded it.\n\nThe next week, after The Washington Post reported Trump's opposition, Chao appeared before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and told lawmakers supporting Gateway that the September meeting might have been \"cordial\" but the president had doubts about the project. She dismissed a proposed funding scheme floated by New York and New Jersey, and tentatively endorsed by the Obama administration, that would have had state taxpayers and transit riders pick up half the project's cost.\n\n\"They need to step up and bear their fair share,\" she said.\n\n[Fact Checker on Chao's claim about New York and New Jersey]\n\nThe hearing infuriated Democrats who thought that the project remained on track after the Oval Office meeting and were blindsided by Trump's opposition. Party leaders spent the next two weeks sparring in closed-door negotiating sessions, trying to salvage the project as GOP aides rejiggered the legislation to bring the funding under the administration's control.\n\nRep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.), a member of the Transportation Committee, said Trump appeared intent on \"screwing New York\" -- citing not only Gateway, but also the GOP tax bill and health-care plan.\n\n\"Look, we're New Yorkers, I think we know better than to think anybody's going to give you what you deserve by being nice,\" he said. \"They should do it because it's important to America, and we shouldn't have to tell them that.\"\n\nRead more at PowerPost",

                "title": "Peru's new president vows to tackle endemic corruption",
                "body": "LIMA, Peru -- New President Martin Vizcarra promised to fight Peru's corruption head on as he assumed the office Friday vowing to heal the wounds left by a vote-buying scandal that abruptly forced his predecessor from office.\n\nIn his first address as president, the relatively unknown former governor of Peru's second-smallest state appealed for national unity and urged young Peruvians not to succumb to cynicism.\n\n\"Don't lose faith in our institutions,\" Vizcarra, who had been vice president, said in remarks to congress shortly after being draped in the red and white presidential sash. \"Let us show you that Peru is bigger than its problems.\"\n\nVizcarra's 15-minute speech was short on specifics. Other than vowing to form a completely new Cabinet, he gave little insight into how he would attack endemic corruption.\n\nBut he received warm applause from lawmakers weary of the months-long effort to oust Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, whose resignation from the presidency was approved overwhelmingly just a few hours earlier.\n\nEven the leader of that campaign, Keiko Fujimori, whose opposition party dominates congress, wished the soft-spoken engineer success in his new job and echoed his call for unity and optimism.\n\nVizcarra received something of a hero*s welcome shortly after midnight when he flew in from Canada, where he had been serving as ambassador amid one of the most politically turbulent periods in Peru's recent history.\n\nSupporters greeted him at the airport with a large birthday cake in the red and white colors of Peru's flag. A marching band was on hand and some people carried signs reading \"Peru is with Vizcarra.\"\n\nA last-minute hitch Friday had threatened to delay the transition of power.\n\nKuczynski said in a tweet that the proposed language of a congressional resolution approving his resignation was \"unacceptable,\" and if lawmakers pressed forward with the wording he would reverse his decision to quit, forcing congress to go forward with plans to try for a second time to impeach him.\n\nIn the end, the language was removed. But congress nonetheless rebuked the 79-year-old Kuczynski in its final resolution, scolding him for a \"political crisis that is the result of wrongful acts that the president himself has committed.\"\n\nEfforts to oust the unpopular Kuczynski led by Fujimori, the daughter of former strongman Alberto Fujimori, had been building for months. But the campaign went into overdrive this week after the emergence of secretly shot videos showed allies of Kuczynski, including a son of Alberto Fujimori, allegedly attempting to buy the support of an opposition lawmaker to block the president's impeachment.\n\nTo stem off an even more disgraceful exit, Kuczynski delivered a resignation letter to congress Wednesday, saying relentless attacks by his opponents had made it impossible to govern.\n\nKuczynski's downfall was his association with Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant that has admitted to spreading some $800 million in bribes to officials across Latin America, including $29 million in Peru.\n\nFor months, even as three former Peruvian presidents became ensnared in the bribery scandal, Kuczynski vehemently denied having any business or political ties to the company. But documents presented by Keiko Fujimori's Popular Force party showed his consulting firm had received $782,000 in payments from Odebrecht a decade ago, some of them when he was a government minister.\n\nThe former Wall Street investor said he wasn't then managing the day-to-day affairs of his consulting business and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nStepping into the void left by Kuczynski is Vizcarra, whose name wasn't recognized by 81 percent of Peruvians in a March poll by Ipsos. His only previous experience in public office before becoming vice president in 2016 was as governor of Peru's second-least populated province.\n\nWhile Vizcarra is expected to continue Kuczynski's pro-business agenda, he will face a tough challenge building consensus with a hostile congress and growing public anger at Peru's political class. Protesters scuffled with police Thursday night while calling for new elections for both president and congress.\n\nThe new president's first test on the international stage will come in three weeks when he is due to host President Donald Trump and other Western Hemisphere leaders at the Summit of the Americas in Lima.\n\nVizcarra made no mention of the summit in his speech, but later Friday the state news agency Andina said he ordered the foreign ministry to continue preparations for the meeting.\n\nAssociated Press writer Franklin Briceno reported this story in Lima and AP writer Joshua Goodman reported from Bogota, Colombia.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church said Friday it is investigating a second accusation of sexual assault against a former missionary leader dating back to the 1980s and vowed to \"bring accountability\" for what has occurred.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints didn't say in its statement if discipline will be taken against Joseph L. Bishop. At the time of the allegations, he held an important position of authority over hundreds of young Mormons as president of the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.\n\nThe religion said it's investigating all assertions made by Bishop in a secretly recorded conversation with the first alleged victim that was made public this week and in a police interview that was released this week about her complaint.\n\nIn the recorded conversation in December, Bishop acknowledged molesting a second woman and described it as back rub that he says got \"too frisky.\"\n\nThe church said that woman reported the abuse to local leaders in 2010, but no action was taken after he denied the allegation. Church leaders provided the woman with emotional support and professional counseling, the statement said.\n\nIt is unclear who the woman is, if she has an attorney or if she's filed a police complaint.\n\nBishop's son Greg Bishop said earlier this week his father denies any wrongdoing in either incident.\n\nGreg Bishop, an attorney, didn't immediately return a phone message and email from The Associated Press on Friday.\n\nHe said on Wednesday that his father gave the second woman, who was living with the family during a difficult period of her life, a back rub at her request but quickly realized it wasn't a good idea.\n\nJoseph Bishop told police investigating a rape claim from the first alleged victim that he asked her to expose herself, but he denied raping her. When police asked him to explain why his account about the rape differed from the woman's, Bishop said \"he either can't remember it or that (the woman) was exaggerating her account.\"\n\nBishop is heard apologizing to the first alleged victim during the conversation she secretly recorded with him while posing as a reporter doing a story on Mormon leaders. He doesn't say what happened though. The recording was made public this week by the website MormonLeaks, a church watchdog.\n\nCraig Vernon, an attorney for the first alleged victim, said his client never exposed herself and that Bishop ripped off her blouse and raped her. He said she is prepared to sue the church and Bishop if they can't reach a settlement.\n\nChurch officials offered a strong tone in the new statement Friday about an incident that has led to questions about past handlings of the allegations.\n\n\"We share the anger and distress church members and others feel to learn of incidents where those entrusted with sacred responsibilities violate God's commandments and harm others. Such behavior is repulsive and sinful.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

                "body": "The Interior Department's internal watchdog has opened an investigation into P. Daniel Smith, currently the top-ranking official at the National Park Service, for allegedly making a gesture involving his genitalia in the hallways of the department's headquarter this year.\n\nNancy K. DiPaolo, a spokeswoman for Interior's Office of Inspector General, confirmed late Friday that the office will begin a probe into the allegation. \"It's being processed, and we will be opening an investigation,\" she said.\n\nIn a letter, an anonymous Park Service employee describes how on either Jan. 10 or Jan. 11, Smith \"grabbed his crotch and his penis and acted out as though he was urinating on the wall\" while relaying a story to another employee at the Main Interior Building in Washington.\n\nThe employee wrote he or she chose not to sign the letter for fear of reprisal from within the Park Service, a division in the sprawling Interior Department. \"I wish I could come forward,\" the worker wrote, \"but retaliation is real.\"\n\nThe employee added \"it could have been a sexual act\" but that \"regardless, he grabbed his crotch and penis in a public place.\"\n\nThe March 8 letter was addressed to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose office forwarded it to the inspector general, DiPaolo said. The Washington Post obtained the letter from the advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which also received it.\n\nSince taking office, Zinke has pledged to curb a culture of misconduct inside within the Park Service, which oversees 417 locations covering more than 84 million acres spread across the United States.\n\nIn October, an internal survey revealed more than 1 in 10 Park Service employees felt they had been sexually harassed on the job. Zinke took action by firing four senior management staffers within the department for inappropriate conduct, including sexual harassment.\n\nThe agency undertook the survey after a scandal at Grand Canyon National Park, where investigators found that male employees preyed on female colleagues during long trips down the Colorado River.\n\n\"I fired four. I will fire 400 if necessary,\" Zinke told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week.\n\nZinke encouraged witnesses of improper behavior to come forward: \"'When you see something, say something' is the policy in the Department of the Interior.\"\n\nIn early January, the same week of the alleged incident, Smith assumed the role of deputy director at the agency, replacing acting director Michael T. Reynolds after his 300-day term in the temporary position expired. Smith is currently exercising the authority of director for the Park Service because President Trump has not yet named a nominee for that position, which the Senate would need to confirm.\n\nSmith has come under scrutiny from the Office of Inspector General before.\n\nInvestigators there determined Smith had improperly helped Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder cut down more than 130 trees on park property in 2004 to improve the view of the Potomac River at his Maryland estate.

                "body": "Maybe he was a drug addict; maybe he was suicidal. Maybe his British handlers decided to get rid of him; maybe it was his mother-in-law. Ever since Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy, was poisoned in a provincial English town, Russian state media and Russian officials have worked overtime to provide explanations. The British government identified the poison as Novichok, a substance made only in Russia. The Russian foreign ministry spokesman parried the claim by insisting that the Czechs, the Slovaks and the Swedes had it, too, though all deny it: Perhaps it was one of them?\n\nOne Russian television channel declared that Novichok came from a laboratory in Britain. Another Russian journalist opined that the assassination attempt was a rival's ploy to undermine President Vladimir Putin; another blamed Ukraine, \"to frame Russia,\" of course. The Russian foreign minister said that the whole story was an attempt to distract from Brexit. Putin, when asked, said that Russia had destroyed all of its chemical weapons anyway. The British foreign office has tallied 21 explanations for the assassination attempt, with more presumably on the way. The conspiracy theories came so thick and fast that some had to be retracted. One Russian scientist said that the Soviet Union had created Novichok before expressing doubt about its use; the interview was removed from the Internet because it contradicted the foreign ministry spokesman, who claims that Novichok never existed at all.\n\nNo one should be surprised by this barrage of contradictory claims: This was exactly how the Russian media and Russian authorities responded after Russian-backed troops in eastern Ukraine shot down a Malaysian passenger plane in 2014, killing everyone on board. Those explanations were just as varied and far-fetched (the Ukrainians were trying to shoot down Putin and missed; the plane took off from Amsterdam with dead bodies on board), and they had the same aim: to pollute the conversation and make the truth seem unknowable.\n\nInside Russia, that campaign was a huge success. A Radio Liberty journalist did a series of man-in-the-street interviews in Moscow soon after the crash. Almost everyone he asked told him that not only was it impossible to know what happened but also that nobody would ever know. Even some in the Netherlands (which had many passengers on the doomed flight) have adopted \"nobody will ever know\" as an explanation for the crash -- even though Dutch authorities and others have shown quite convincingly that it was shot down by a Russian Buk missile launched by the Russian-backed \"separatists\" in eastern Ukraine.\n\nKnowing that there is no point in rebutting each claim -- that would simply amplify them further -- the British foreign office decided to respond, as one official told me, \"by exposing the methodology\" of deceit. Its officials created a short video mocking the multiple Russian explanations, and they posted it on Twitter and Facebook with a statement accusing Russia of offering \"denial, distraction and threats\" instead of explanations. They also sent samples of the Skripals' blood to a neutral international institution, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, for testing to confirm their conclusions.\n\nBut the campaign will continue in places that are much harder to see. Trust in the government is very low in large swaths of the British political spectrum. The leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has said that he still wants a \"definitive answer\" about the source of the nerve agent. Russian Internet trolls are working hard on deepening this doubt. While watching the debate about Skripal, Ben Nimmo of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab noticed an online poll, the creation of a pro-Corbyn blogger with a large social media following. It asked, \"Are you satisfied that Theresa May has supplied enough evidence for us to be able to confidently point the finger of blame at Russia?\" When Nimmo investigated, he found large numbers of Russian and consistently pro-Russian accounts answering the poll (with an overwhelming \"no,\" of course) -- and then amplifying the result so that it appeared to have even more approval. A minor thing, but it was enough to convince the blogger that \"the mood of the public is starting to shift.\"\n\nThis is an example in miniature of the kinds of efforts that will be repeated again and again, and it's instructive. Since 2016, we've become fixated on the idea that Russian disinformation is something that happens during election campaigns. But it goes on all the time, and coordinators respond to all kinds of circumstances and will evade official attempts to avoid them.\n\nSocial media, which makes it easy for anonymous trolls to have influence, makes it easy to invent disinformation. Social divisions, which diminish trust in authorities like the British foreign office, help it spread.\n\nWhat is needed now is a broader version of Britain's \"expose the methodology\" campaign, one ambitious enough to reach below the surface. That will take time and effort. But unless we get started, we're doomed to live in a world where truth is defined by those who have the least respect for it.\n\nRead more from Anne Applebaum's archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more on this topic:\n\nThe Post's View: Is Putin's poison squad back in Britain?\n\nThe Post's View: Britain is punishing Putin.

                "body": "The kids have come to save us.\n\nThey have come from Florida, where their high school peers were gunned down on Valentine's Day, inspiring them to organize Saturday's March for Our Lives.\n\nThey have also come from Minnesota, where my two teenage nephews boarded an overnight bus to Washington to participate in the march.\n\nThey have come by the hundreds of thousands to the capital, or to the streets of their home towns -- just as kids across the country, my daughter and her classmates among them, walked out of classes on March 14 to protest school shootings.\n\nMost important, they are coming to the polls in November, the beginning of a generational wave that will upend our politics. And they are going to get what they have come for.\n\nThey will get reasonable gun control -- eventually -- but they will get a lot more than that. The kids -- millennials and those following, Generation Z, born since the mid-1990s and just coming of age -- are going to save us from ourselves.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll this week shows that a whopping 67 percent of voters in the 18-to-34 age group want to see a Democratic Senate vs. only 28 percent favoring Republicans (it's similar for the House), a dramatically larger margin than for older generations. These voters also profess to be more motivated than usual.\n\nThe change they seek won't come immediately. Though the National Rifle Association may be out of favor (dramatically so among young Americans), it still controls the Republican Party, which still controls Congress and the White House despite being overwhelmingly unpopular.\n\nBut the future belongs to these kids, and it is arriving. We are on the cusp of change of a magnitude not seen since the 1960s, at least, and not just on guns but on immigration, race, health care, diplomacy, the role of government and America's place in the world.\n\nThis is a paradox of the Trump era, which every day brings more calamity: a trade war, dramatic debt expansion during an economic boom, tax cuts that expand the gap between rich and poor, the arrival of a dangerous ideologue as national security adviser, a president aligning himself with a hostile foreign power trying to disrupt U.S. democracy with an assist from America's own Facebook empire, a sprawling criminal inquiry of top presidential advisers, a leader turning Americans against each other by race, gender and religion and attacking the pillars of democratic governance.\n\nAnd yet it could not be clearer that the power structure that created this mess is on its way out. Millennials will sometime next year become the largest living generation, and Generation Z is poised to be even larger. Together, they will resoundingly repudiate the status quo. Just 27 percent of millennials approve of Trump's job performance, according to the Pew Research Center, which says the generational gap in political views is wider than at any point since Pew began examining it in the early 1990s.\n\nThis is related to rapidly changing racial demographics (millennials are more than 40 percent nonwhite, Gen Z even more so), but, even controlling for racial diversity, Pew reported in a study this month that young Americans are markedly more liberal than older cohorts.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of millennials say immigrants strengthen America (vs. 47 percent of the oldest, Silent generation). Seventy-seven percent of millennials say good diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace (vs. 43 percent of the Silent). There are similar gaps in views of free trade, universal health care, welfare and racial discrimination, and liberal millennials outnumber conservative millennials 57 percent to 12 percent; among the oldest generation it's almost the reverse: 28 percent liberal to 40 percent conservative.\n\nThe kids might even save us from Facebook, a creation of millennials that is now being turned into an anti-democratic weapon. The research firm eMarketer found that the number of 12- to 17-year-old American users of Facebook declined 9.9 percent in 2017, part of a drop of 2.8 million U.S. users of Facebook under age 25. The firm expects Facebook to shed another 2.1 million this year, as young people switch to other platforms.\n\nOn gun control, there is broad and growing support across generations. But the issue of mass shootings is the \"defining fear\" for the youngest Americans, according to an attempt by USA Today and Ipsos to poll 13- to 24-year-olds. The survey, released this week, found that gun violence eclipses all other worries, including terrorism, racism, college affordability and climate change. Nearly one-fifth don't feel safe at school.\n\nThis will change. The zeitgeist is already changing, as seen in recent actions by Delta Air Lines, Hertz, MetLife, Dick's Sporting Goods, Walmart, Citigroup and others. Those now controlling Washington may not adapt. But rest assured, kids: They will soon be gone.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more on this issue:\n\nHelaine Olen: How millennial women may change our politics\n\nPaul Taylor: Millennials are allergic to politics.

                "body": "James C. Roberts is president of the American Veterans Center.\n\nMarch 25 is National Medal of Honor Day, a day to pause and reflect on the profound legacy of the United States' most highly decorated heroes. About 30 of the 71 surviving recipients will have gathered in Washington to celebrate the bond that unites them over the span of seven decades -- from World War II through the wars in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan.\n\nOne major modern conflict is noteworthy for its lack of representation: the Iraq War.\n\nThis eight-year war claimed the lives of almost 4,500 Americans and left more than 32,000 wounded. The most brutal battles since Vietnam took place in Iraq, in cities such as Baghdad, Fallujah and Ramadi, and acts of heroism abounded. Emblematic is the story of Marine Sgt. Maj. Bradley A. Kasal. On Nov. 13, 2004, then-1st Sgt. Kasal entered an enemy-occupied building in Fallujah, a death trap our troops had dubbed \"Hell House,\" to assist fellow Marines who were pinned down by a superior enemy force. Under withering fire, Kasal killed an insurgent immediately; then, while dragging a wounded Marine to safety, he was struck with seven rounds of small-arms fire. Severely wounded, Kasal used the few bandages he had to treat his injured comrade rather than himself.\n\nWhen the insurgents lobbed a grenade at them, Kasal rolled on top of the wounded Marine, absorbing the impact of the blast and suffering 43 shrapnel wounds. He refused to leave the house until all of the other Marines were safe. A photograph taken of Kasal staggering from the house, pistol in hand, supported by fellow Marines, his uniform soaked in blood, became an iconic image of the Iraq War.\n\nKasal was later awarded the Navy Cross -- the Navy and Marine Corps' second-highest award for valor. Does anyone seriously doubt that his heroism is also worthy of the Medal of Honor?\n\nThere are many other Iraq War veterans with stories as compelling as Kasal's, and I have met many of them. They are extraordinary men, yet without the Medal of Honor their stories will almost certainly be forgotten as time passes.\n\nThat is because the Medal of Honor confers a unique cachet upon its recipients. Honorees are in demand as speakers at civic, military and corporate conventions -- and, most importantly, by schools and youth groups.\n\nThe fact that not a single living Iraq War veteran has received the Medal of Honor is a serious injustice to the 1.5 million Americans who served in that conflict. Consider: 1,523 Medals of Honor were awarded for heroism in the Civil War, 126 in World War I, 471 in World War II, 145 in the Korean War and 260 in Vietnam. Two soldiers killed in Somalia in 1993 and 14 who fought in Afghanistan have received the award (three of the latter posthumously). Yet for Iraq, only four Medals of Honor have been awarded, all posthumously.\n\nUntil 2009, there were no living recipients from Afghanistan, either. That year, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates expressed disbelief that of the 2.5 million American veterans who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan, none who were still living had received the Medal of Honor.\n\nThings began to change almost immediately, with the eventual awarding of 11 Medals of Honor to living veterans of Afghanistan, the most recent going to Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator Edward C. Byers Jr. in 2016. All are veterans of Afghanistan. Inexplicably, incredibly, not a single medal went to a living Iraq veteran.\n\nIt is not too late for remedial action.\n\nThe Pentagon has periodically conducted reviews of conflicts going back to World War II to correct injustices regarding withholding the Medal of Honor. Most recently, three living Vietnam veterans -- Sgt. Santiago Erevia, Sgt. 1st Class Melvin Morris and Sgt. 1st Class Jose Rodela -- received the medal from President Barack Obama four years ago.\n\nThe selection of Medal of Honor recipients is not done by formula. It is up to the judgment of those responsible in the Pentagon.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis commanded troops in Iraq and must surely rue the irony that not one of the living veterans of that conflict has been found worthy of the nation's highest award for valor.\n\nThis year marks the 15th anniversary of the beginning of the war in Iraq. It is an appropriate time to recognize the first of many deserving Iraq War veterans with the Medal of Honor.",

They apparently believed they had bought her silence about the year-long extramarital affair she claims to have had with the future president a decade ago.\n\nBut it turns out they had only rented it.\n\nWhen Daniels signed a nondisclosure agreement in the weeks before the 2016 election, hardly anyone thought Trump had much chance of winning, especially after the furor over comments he had made about women on the now-famous \"Access Hollywood\" tape. So $130,000 to stay quiet must have looked too good for Daniels to pass up. (Cohen said the money came from his personal home equity line of credit.)\n\nWith her alleged paramour in the Oval Office, however, there is surely much more to be gained from her account, so she is trying to slip free from the agreement on the technicality that Trump never signed it.\n\nBacking out of a deal if there's a better one to be had? Trump did it for decades. \"I've made a fortune by using debt, and if things don't work out I renegotiate the debt. I mean, that's a smart thing, not a stupid thing,\" he boasted to CBS during his presidential campaign. As president, he has reversed himself so many times that his befuddled allies on Capitol Hill are never sure where or if he will land on most issues.\n\nNow, instead of Daniels, it is Trump who is remaining silent -- conspicuously so. No tweets, no vicious nicknames, no threats. She, meanwhile, is going on \"60 Minutes,\" where viewership is likely to be some of its highest ever. Count that as another blow to a president who measures the import of every event by its television ratings.\n\nDaniels seems to be having a great time. She has become a ninja master in Trump's own medium, smiting trolls on Twitter with a verve that my colleague Monica Hesse compared to \"a very smart cat batting off a series of very dumb mice, who come at her under the delusion that the relationship is reversed.\" When one man tweeted that she was a \"scank,\" she responded by correcting his spelling.\n\nMcDougal, who was Playboy's 1998 Playmate of the Year, claims to have had an affair with Trump around the same time as Daniels. But in her case, the arrangement that she is trying to escape is the one she made with the National Enquirer's parent company, whose chief executive, David Pecker, is close to Trump. In her lawsuit, McDougal claims American Media was working secretly with Cohen to keep her quiet; the company says it contacted Trump's lawyer only to vet her story.\n\nA takedown by a former playmate would be a sour endnote indeed, given how assiduously Trump styled himself as Playboy's ideal of libidinous masculinity. In 1990, the magazine's cover featured the married real-estate developer posing with another playmate, Brandi Brandt. She wore only his tuxedo jacket.\n\nHe hung a framed copy of that Playboy in his Trump Tower office. \"I was one of the few men in the history of Playboy to be on the cover,\" Trump once boasted to a Post reporter.\n\nZervos, a former contestant from \"The Apprentice,\" presents a different kind of threat, and potentially the most serious one. She is one of more than a dozen women who have accused the president of unwanted sexual advances, in her case that he kissed her and groped her breasts when she met with him to discuss a job. During his presidential campaign, Trump called them all liars, and threatened to sue.\n\nBut Trump never did, empty threats being another of his favorite tactics. It was Zervos who went to court, charging defamation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the same day McDougal filed her lawsuit, a New York judge ruled that Zervos's case can go forward. It was lost on no one that the precedent cited was the one in the sexual harassment lawsuit that ultimately led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton.\n\nThe Zervos lawsuit opens the possibility that Trump's other accusers, and maybe even more women, will return to tell their stories under oath. And that the president himself will have to as well.\n\nWhen Zervos was on the fifth season of \"The Apprentice,\" Trump fired her because she interrupted him. It turns out she may get in a last word after all.\n\nRead more on this topic:\n\nLaurence H.

                "body": "One school district is equipping its classrooms with buckets of smooth rocks for students to use as a weapon of last resort against a shooter. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nOne schools superintendent has a novel way to keep his students safe from school shooters: arming them with rocks.\n\nDavid Helsel, superintendent of a school district in northeast Pennsylvania, explained his plan to a legislative education committee last week, drawing a flurry of local media coverage.\n\n\"Every classroom has been equipped with a five-gallon bucket of river stone,\" Helsel explained about his Blue Mountain School District in Schuylkill County outside Harrisburg, in a video broadcast by ABC affiliate 16 WNEP. \"If an armed intruder attempts to gain entrance into any of our classrooms, they will face a classroom full of students armed with rocks, and they will be stoned.\"\n\nHelsel's comments come amid a new chapter in the public debate about mass shootings after a man killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Despite polls showing that large numbers of Americans support stricter gun-control measures, Congress has thus far not produced any significant legislation, and schools and other officials have looked to other solutions. President Trump floated an NRA-backed idea to arm teachers.\n\nHelsel told local news reporters that students in his district routinely drilled on shooter simulations and were given active shooting training through a program known as ALICE, short for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate.\n\n[ The extraordinary number of kids who have endured school shootings since Columbine ]\n\nAccording to ABC, ALICE protocol involves evacuating students and barricading classroom doors for those who can't safely leave. In at least one school district, in Redmond, Wash., ALICE training also involved guidance for children to distract an intruder.\n\nHelsel described the bucket of rocks, which will be kept in classroom closets, as a \"last ditch\" option to use as an alternative to students hiding passively under desks.\n\n\"At one time, I just had the idea of river stone,\" Helsel said. \"They're the right size for hands, you can throw them very hard, and they will create or cause pain, which can distract.\"\n\nHis schools have been using the idea, called \"go buckets,\" for the last two years, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nThis School Has Been Arming Classrooms With 5-Gallon Buckets Of Rocks In The Event Of A School Shooting https://t.co/PgfvqveuxG pic.twitter.com/0zOlCKi3Sb -- Tanya Chen (@Tanya_Chen)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nAnother district had floated the idea of using golf balls, Helsel said, according Fox News but that idea did not seem effective to him.\n\n\"Obviously a rock against a gun isn't a fair fight, but it's better than nothing,\" he said. \"I'm not sure why some people feel that it's more appropriate to be a stationary target under a desk in a classroom rather than be empowered to defend yourself and provide a response to deter the entry of an armed intruder into their classroom.\"\n\nSome students and parents interviewed by the outlet were supportive of the idea.\n\n\"At this point, we have to get creative. We have to protect our kids first and foremost,\" parent Dori Bornstein told 16 WNEP. \"Throwing rocks, it's an option.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to converge in Washington on Saturday to call for stricter gun regulations.\n\n\"We've been trying to be proactive, just in case,\" Helsel told ABC. \"\"We wanted to provide some type of last response to an intruder ... rather than crawling under a desk and getting shot.\"\n\nHelsel did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nRead more:\n\nFormer Playboy model gives emotional account of alleged affair with Trump, apologizes to Melania\n\nFormer Fox News anchor sues Bill O'Reilly, alleging defamation\n\nCNN chief calls Fox News 'propaganda machine,' and Hannity responds",

                "title": "How Cambridge Analytica broke into the U.S. political market through Mercer-allied conservative groups",
                "body": "Two years before helping Donald Trump target prospective 2016 supporters, the now-embattled data firm Cambridge Analytica tested its tools with an array of conservative groups allied with the wealthy Mercer family, including a super PAC run by newly appointed national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe fledgling company courted groups on the right for work on the 2014 midterms with pitches about its \"psychographic\" profiling, which relied in part on data that appears to have been obtained improperly from tens of millions of American users of Facebook.\n\nCambridge executives aggressively sought the backing of rich GOP donors, who they believed would help the company \"effectively corner the market\" in the United States, internal records show. To win them over, executives sought to craft personal appeals drawn from information housed in the company's extensive database of American voters.\n\nAt one point, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix decided to build a psychological profile of billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson's stepdaughter and son-in-law and present it to Adelson -- a move that would give his pitch a \"wow\" factor, he predicted to his employees.\n\n\"Can we pull a LOAD of data on them????\" Nix asked his researchers, who followed through, according to emails provided to The Washington Post by former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie.\n\nAdelson adviser Andy Abboud said Nix did not end up presenting the profiles when he met with the Cambridge Analytica chief executive that year.\n\n\"Generally speaking, coming in with a profile of us would not have gone over well,\" Abboud told The Post in an email Friday. \"They met with me I believe, but it was nothing that we found interesting, and the pitch was not compelling.\"\n\nInternal documents and interviews with former Cambridge Analytica employees illustrate how intently the company -- a spinoff of a British firm -- worked to win over U.S. political clients for the 2014 midterms.\n\nAt the time, the company had access to Facebook data that had been obtained by a researcher for academic purposes and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, Facebook executives said last week. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into whether the sharing of the Facebook data violated a 2011 consent decree that governs Facebook's privacy practices.\n\nNix, who was suspended this week amid the controversy, did not respond to a request for comment. But in a statement released Friday, Cambridge Analytica's acting chief executive, Alexander Tayler, expressed regret over the firm's handling of the Facebook data, which he said was deleted in 2015. He said the board has launched \"full and independent\" investigation into the practices of the firm's British parent company.\n\nCambridge Analytica was launched in 2013 by the wealthy Mercer family and conservative strategist Stephen K. Bannon, later a top Trump adviser, in an effort to give conservatives an edge in the political data game.\n\n[Bannon oversaw Cambridge Analytica's collection of Facebook data, according to former employee]\n\nLate that year, Nix hosted Bannon, then-executive chairman of Breitbart News, and Texas energy investor Toby Neugebauer at a dinner at the exclusive Carlton Club in London, according to a copy of the invitation.\n\nOver a dinner of venison, duck terrine and roasted lamb, researchers at SCL Elections presented their methodology and case studies.\n\nLess than two months later, Nix met with hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, Neugebauer and Bannon in Palm Beach, Fla., on the sidelines of a conference hosted by the conservative group Club For Growth.\n\nClub For Growth had no record of inviting Nix to the event, officials said.\n\nAt the meeting, Neugebauer said he asked Nix to present a cost analysis of his services, knowing that this was a major concern for campaigns and donors.\n\n\"I was saying, 'Get me the numbers,' \" Neugebauer recalled.\n\nIn an email, Nix berated his staff for failing give him strong enough material to win over billionaires such as Adelson and Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus.\n\n\"I just cannot begin to convey how disappointed I am in you all,\" Nix wrote his staff, according to documents obtained by The Post. \"Please can you go the extra mile to ensure that there is a (very good) final document in my inbox.\n\n\"This is a huge opportunity to take this project to the next level and effectively corner the market,\" he added.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, Cambridge Analytica succeeded in signing up as a client a super PAC created by Bolton, a Mercer ally whom Trump named this week as his new national security adviser.\n\nThe John Bolton Super PAC, led by the former diplomat and foreign policy hard-liner, paid Cambridge Analytica more than $1.1 million in the 2014 and 2016 cycles for research, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nMercer has been the largest donor to Bolton's super PAC, giving $5 million since the 2014 cycle, according to FEC records.\n\nPart of the work that Cambridge Analytica performed for Bolton's super PAC was psychographic voter targeting, which the company claimed could profile voters on the basis of certain characteristics. The predictive microtargeting was based in part on data gleaned from Facebook profiles and other sources, according to documents and former Cambridge Analytica employees.\n\n[Cambridge Analytica harnessed Facebook data in work for super PAC led by John Bolton, according to former employees]\n\n\"They used the psychographic stuff, and the Facebook data was a part of that,\" said a former Cambridge Analytica employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal strategy. The New York Times first reported that Cambridge harnessed its Facebook data in services it provided to the Bolton super PAC.\n\nIn notes from a July 2014 meeting to discuss the project, SCL officials noted that they were able to \"harvest substantial and useful information on people from Facebook, with permission.\"\n\nThe company suggested directing potential supporters to a Facebook app to collect personality profiles. It said it would merge that information with consumer and voter history data to identify and target voters.\n\nGarrett Marquis, a spokesman for Bolton, said Friday the Bolton super PAC did not know of any wrongdoing by Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\"With respect to any allegations of impropriety, the John Bolton Super PAC was completely unaware of anything Cambridge Analytica did until recent press reports,\" he said in a statement, adding that the super PAC has not worked with the data-science firm since 2016.\n\nOther 2014 Cambridge Analytica clients had received support from the Mercer family, including Ending Spending Action Fund and B-PAC super PACs.\n\nEnding Spending paid the firm $470,000 for advertising to boost the Mercer-backed GOP congressional candidate Art Robinson in Oregon, records show. An official with the organization said that Cambridge Analytica presented innovative ideas and that the super PAC had no knowledge about any improper data the firm may have used.\n\nInternal documents show that Cambridge Analytica also provided services to politically active nonprofit organizations that are not required to disclose their donors, including the Colorado-based antiabortion group Centennial Coalition and For America, led by L. Brent Bozell, who founded the Mercer-backed Media Research Center.\n\nAfter the election, Cambridge Analytica drafted detailed memos for its clients with recommendations for the 2016 cycle, according to records provided to The Post.\n\n\"A lot of Cambridge Analytica's work in 2014 was to sort of hone their activities for 2016,\" the former employee said.\n\nThe firm's 2016 revenue reflects the success of that strategy.\n\nIn the 2014 cycle, GOP congressional campaigns and conservative-leaning groups paid at least $729,000 to the firm for a range of services, including research, data analytics and microtargeting.\n\nIn the 2016 cycle, when Cambridge Analytica worked for both Trump and GOP White House hopeful Ted Cruz, it was paid at least $15.4 million, FEC records show.",

                "body": "The date was Jan. 20, 2005, but it might as well have been a million years ago. George W. Bush, freshly sworn in for a second term as president, delivered an address brimming with optimism for a future shaped by the United States and marked by the spread of liberty.\n\n\"Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul,\" Bush declared. \"We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty will come to those who love it.\"\n\nThe speech was a bracing distillation of ideas that had been spreading like ripples across the pond of Western thought ever since the fall of Soviet communism some 15 years earlier. Legions of us, whether we knew it or not, caught the spirit of the philosopher Georg Hegel, who imagined history as a tide flowing toward freedom, and envisioned nations as pure expressions of free peoples.\n\nLike college sophomores swept up by a Theory of Everything, we found evidence wherever we looked. There was China, apparently buoyed by freer markets, trading Mao suits and bicycles for Chanel and Audis. There was Libya's Moammar Gaddafi, voluntarily surrendering his weapons of mass destruction after years as an outlaw sponsor of rogue violence.\n\nA hopeful, if sometimes facile, tendency attributed every dysfunction in the world to a shortage of liberty. Free markets could cure the scourge of war, an influential pundit suggested, observing that countries with McDonald's franchises never started shooting at each other. Free elections could cool the fevers stoking international terrorism.\n\nThese thoughts were so widespread that Bush could say without irony that his freedom agenda was \"common sense\": \"The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.\"\n\nIt's possible in hindsight to see that the foundations of that confidence were already crumbling. After all, Russia had gone reeling from the collapse of the Soviet Union into the corrupt grip of Vladimir Putin, who was shutting the windows tight against the breeze of freedom.\n\nMore damning was the failure, already festering, of the U.S.-led West to foster democracy in Iraq after toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003. Despite years of promises to create an oasis of freedom, the Bush hawks skimped on postwar nation building. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, when he should have been preparing for a difficult success, instead busied himself writing a CYA memo to trot out when things went bad. It was the beginning of many years spent dodging his share of responsibility for what is now a 15-year debacle.\n\nStill, optimism persisted in spite of it all, at least long enough for many American leaders to greet the Arab Spring of 2011 with untempered hope. But today, the Hegelian tide has receded. China has a new dictator-for-life in Xi Jinping. Russia's boss steals Crimea, hacks Western elections and orders hits on British streets with impunity. Turkey, once a leading hope for Middle Eastern democracy, is skidding into authoritarianism. And America's new best friend in the Muslim world is a Saudi prince who exercises monarchical power with more vigor than the kingdom has seen in decades.\n\nWe can draw either of two lessons from this disillusioning silence of freedom's bell. One lesson would be that America should never have tried to ring it in the first place. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested as much recently as she explained why President Trump didn't denounce Putin's recent sham election. \"We don't get to dictate how other countries operate,\" Sanders said. \"What we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country, and that's not something that we can dictate to them, how they operate. We can only focus on the freeness and fairness of our elections.\"\n\nMinding our own beeswax sounds appealing in light of the high costs and disappointing results of our efforts to promote democracy. But a longer view of history shows that tyranny and despotism abroad, if ignored, will eventually come banging on our own doors -- or walls.\n\nThough Bush's performance in office was checkered, his analysis that day was correct: \"There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.\"\n\nThe better lesson: Something so precious doesn't just wash up with a tide. Freedom must be planned for, worked for, struggled for; it must be planted, fed and tended before it can be harvested, and planted anew with each season and each generation. Liberty is still the best agenda, demanding passion and sweat even in our own backyard.\n\nRead more from David Von Drehle's archive.\n\nRead more on this topic:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump doesn't bother to hide his submissiveness to Putin anymore\n\nBrian Klaas: Vladimir Putin's wildest dreams are coming true -- courtesy of a U.S. president\n\nKhalid bin Salman: Saudi Arabia embraces change -- and the United States can help\n\nThe Post's View: Trump is already losing the long-term fight in Iraq\n\nJohn Allen and Michael O'Hanlon: Trump is recklessly reversing Americans' progress in Iraq",

                "body": "Joe Biden gave Donald Trump a gift this last week when he engaged the president of the United States in a verbal slugfest, saying that if the two men were in high school, he'd take Trump out back and teach him a lesson.\n\nThe former vice president was clearly kidding, speaking off-the-cuff about Trump's alleged mistreatment of women.\n\nBut Trump, never one to let an insult pass -- and always eager to deflect attention from the chaos engulfing him -- responded in kind.\n\nBack and forth they went, hurling insults and behaving in the faux-masculine ways of teenagers staking out their corner of the parking lot, as though the future were secure and all that mattered was the size of one's hands.\n\nMeanwhile, in the grown-up world: It was announced that two more key figures are leaving the White House -- H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser; and John Dowd, Trump's top legal adviser in the Mueller investigation. And, the president hired John Bolton -- a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and, perhaps more important to Trump, a veteran Fox News commentator -- to replace McMaster.\n\nEarly Friday morning, Congress passed a spending bill and sent it to Trump for his signature, just in time to forestall a government shutdown. Trump had previously said he would sign it, but woke up that morning to tweet that he might veto the bill. By midday Friday, he signed it.\n\nMeanwhile, former Playboy bunny Karen McDougal sat down with CNN's Anderson Cooper to discuss her affair with Trump before he became president. McDougal is seeking liberation from a $150,000 exclusive agreement she had with American Media, which owns the National Enquirer, for her story, which was paid for but never run -- a \"catch and kill\" story, ostensibly so the tabloid's owner, a Trump buddy, could protect the then-reality star.\n\nLurching right along, tout le monde was anticipating Sunday's \"60 Minutes\" interview with the adult-film actress who calls herself Stormy Daniels. Presumably, she's ready to dump the details of her own alleged affair with pre-President Trump and the apparent hush money Trump's attorney paid her shortly before the 2016 election.\n\nIn yet another breaking development, a third woman, Summer Zervos, got the green light from a New York Supreme Court judge to pursue a defamation suit against the president for referring to her -- among a dozen or so others who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct -- as a liar.\n\nIt would seem that we have reached not a tipping but a retching point.\n\nIn the midst of so many meanwhiles, the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III slogs along, searching for clues into the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russian operatives who tried to influence U.S. elections. Into this mess entered reports of Facebook's lack of vigilance in protecting personal information from the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica, which helped the Trump campaign target voters with advertising aimed right at their sweet spots.\n\nSit back down, please. I know you need an adult beverage, but there's more.\n\nStill ahead is the planned meeting with North Korea, for which Trump apparently wanted Bolton on board. The hawkish Bolton, who previously has recommended preemptive strikes to denuclearize unpleasant nations, is hardly what you'd call a cool head. Reputed to share Trump's my-way-or-you're-dead-to-me approach to governance, Bolton also has recommended military action to achieve change in Iran.\n\nBy most accounts, Bolton doesn't play well with others, though he and his mustache plainly have a special relationship.\n\nTo the despair expressed by those who learned something from our regime-change experiment in Iraq, one can only add tears, weeping for the loss of the few moderating voices who briefly surrounded the president. With the exception of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who seems wisest in all ways, most others have abandoned ship, either through firing, resignation or gettin' while the gettin's good.\n\nWith so many battles on so many fronts, not to mention a possible tariff war and Thursday's 724-point market plunge, Trump still managed to find time to engage in a meaningless war of words, in the only combat theater this flat-footed deferred veteran has ever known.\n\nDonald Trump -- gladiator of earthly delights, hawker of shams and artist of lies -- loves chaos, he has said. Well, then, he must be a very happy man. But one of these days, considering all of the above, something is going to blow up. Let's hope it isn't us.\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker's archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.\n\nRead more on this issue:\n\nThe Post's View: Trump won't release his NDAs.

                "title": "Opinion | The second-most dangerous American",
                "body": "Because John Bolton is five things President Trump is not -- intelligent, educated, principled, articulate and experienced -- and because of Bolton's West Wing proximity to a president responsive to the most recent thought he has heard emanating from cable television or an employee, Bolton will soon be the second-most dangerous American. On April 9, he will be the first national security adviser who, upon taking up residence down the hall from the Oval Office, will be suggesting that the United States should seriously consider embarking on war crimes.\n\nThe first two charges against the major Nazi war criminals in the 1945-1946 Nuremberg trials concerned waging aggressive war. Emboldened by the success, as he still sees it, of America's Iraq adventure that began 15 years ago this month, Bolton, for whom a trade war with many friends and foes is insufficiently stimulating, favors real wars against North Korea and Iran. Both have odious regimes, but neither can credibly be said to be threatening an imminent attack against the United States. Nevertheless, Bolton thinks bombing both might make the world safer. What could go wrong?\n\nMuch is made of the fact that Bolton is implacably hostile to strongman Vladimir Putin, whom the U.S. president, a weak person's idea of a strong person, admires. And of the fact that the president has repeatedly execrated the invasion of Iraq that Bolton advocated. So, today among the uneducable, furrowed brows express puzzlement: How can the president square his convictions with Bolton's? Let's say this one more time: Trump. Has. No. Convictions.\n\nEven this scatterbrain's Swiss cheese-style tariffs are too sloppy to reflect forethought. He has sentiments, and visceral reactions to which he is attentive. But to speak of, say, a sincere sofa is to commit what philosophers call a \"category mistake\" -- sofas are incapable of sincerity -- and to speak of this president's convictions (or plans, or policies) about this or that is a category mistake.\n\nIt is frequently said that the decision to invade Iraq was the worst U.S. foreign policy decision since Vietnam. Actually, it was worse than Vietnam, and the worst in American history, for two reasons. One is that so far we probably have paid no more that 20 percent of the eventual costs of that decision that enhanced Iran's ascendancy. The other reason is that America gradually waded waist deep into Vietnam without a crossing-the-Rubicon moment -- a single clear, dispositive decision. In contrast, the protracted preparation for invading Iraq was deliberative and methodical. It is not true that, as the current president and the virulent left insist, President George W. Bush and his senior advisers \"lied\" about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. They simply got things wrong, which conservatives, especially, understand was an event not without precedent in the annals of government.\n\nFor the first time since World War II, when the mobilization of U.S. industrial might propelled this nation to the top rank among world powers, the American president is no longer the world's most powerful person. The president of China is, partly because of the U.S. president's abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership without an alternative trade policy. Power is the ability to achieve intended effects. Randomly smashing crockery does not count. The current president resembles Winston Churchill's description of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles -- \"the only bull I know who carries his china closet with him.\"\n\nLike the Obama administration, whose Iran policy he robustly ridicules, Bolton seems to believe that the United States has the power to determine who can and cannot acquire nuclear weapons. Pakistan, which had a per capita income of $470 when it acquired nuclear weapons 20 years ago (China's per capita income was $85.50 when it acquired them in 1964), demonstrated that almost any nation determined to become a nuclear power can do so.\n\nBolton's belief in the U.S. power to make the world behave and eat its broccoli reflects what has been called \"narcissistic policy disorder\" -- the belief that whatever happens in the world happens because of something the United States did or did not do. This is a recipe for diplomatic delusions and military overreaching.\n\nSpeaking of delusions, one died last week -- the belief that this president could be safely cocooned within layers of adult supervision. Bolton's predecessor, H.R. McMaster, wrote a brilliant book (\"Dereliction of Duty\") on the failure of officials, particularly military leaders, who knew better but did not resist the stumble into the Vietnam disaster. McMaster is being replaced because he would have done his duty regarding the impulses of the most dangerous American.\n\nRead more from George F.

                "title": "Porter Moser has led Loyola Chicago to new heights after hitting a career low",
                "body": "ATLANTA -- The past couple months make it seem that Porter Moser is a college basketball coach whose career is on a straight upward trajectory.\n\nHe has Loyola Chicago within one victory of its first Final Four berth since 1963, when it won the national championship.\n\nHis team is 31-5 and hasn't lost since Jan. 31, and has captivated a previously dormant fan base by underscoring what's possible in the men's NCAA tournament despite being a No. 11 seed from a mid-major conference and without a stable of future NBA draft picks.\n\nHe even has the darling of March Madness on his side, Sister Jean Dolores-Schmidt, 98, who both leads the Ramblers in prayer and serves as an honorary assistant coach to help scout the upcoming opponent, which in this case is ninth-seeded Kansas State (25-11) in the South Region final on Saturday night at Philips Arena.\n\nSister Jean Dolores-Schmidt, 98, didn't take credit for Loyola-Chicago's win on March 22. Instead, she thanked God for her team's NCAA tournament success. (Reuters)\n\n[March Madness 2018: News, updates and schedules from the Sweet 16]\n\nOnly Moser is 49, and on his third head-coaching job. When he took over at Loyola in 2011, he was trying to reboot his career. The protege of both Tony Barone and the late Rick Majerus long had been familiar with Loyola while growing up in Naperville, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, and playing high school basketball at Benet Academy roughly 45 miles west of the Loyola's campus. But the Ramblers weren't exactly a plum job, with one 20-win season in the 26 since their previous NCAA tournament appearance, in 1985.\n\nFour years earlier, Illinois State had fired Moser following consecutive losing seasons. On the even of the biggest game of his career, Moser recalled leaning on Barone for support and guidance. Barone had coached Moser at Creighton from 1986 to '90, when the scrappy guard started only a handful of games but made multiple winning shots.\n\nAfter graduation, Moser served as an assistant for the Bluejays in 1990-91.\n\n\"Coach Barone was a huge influence on my life,\" Moser said. \"When I worked for him, he wouldn't allow you to think that any task was too small or too big. It was about getting it done, getting it done the right way, and the work ethic of working and doing things. Coach Majerus was the same way.\"\n\nMoser also received a morale boost following his dismissal from Illinois State from Majerus, who hired Moser to his staff at Saint Louis. Moser would spend four seasons there, until he was hired by Loyola.\n\nMajerus died of heart failure at 64 during Moser's second season at Loyola. Majerus is the professional mentor Moser still affectionately refers to as a bona fide \"genius\" when it came to basketball strategy.\n\n\"Sitting in a boardroom with Coach Majerus for a couple days preparing for a game was like nothing else,\" he said.\n\nThere's plenty of Majerus's influence embedded into the Ramblers' playing style, particularly on defense, where the outsized former coach was a stickler for detail.\n\nSo too is Moser, who crafted a game plan that limited No. 7 seed Nevada to 26 percent shooting from three-point range and created 12 points off turnovers during Friday night's 69-68 triumph in the round of 16.\n\n[Loyola Chicago doesn't need divine intervention to reach the Final Four]\n\nThe outcome became all but certain when Marques Townes made a three-pointer with seven seconds to play for a four-point lead.\n\nSitting in her wheelchair off to the side of the Loyola bench, Sister Jean raised both her hands in jubilation as she watched Townes's shot swish through the net, later saying her bracket had been busted after picking the Ramblers to lose in the round of 16.\n\n\"I'm so grateful to the young men and to Porter, of course, for doing this,\" said Sister Jean, the 98-year-old nun who has become the most recognized member of the Loyola community during the Ramblers' improbable run.\n\n\"I'll probably remember it for the rest of my life,\" said Townes, who, during the postgame news conference, apologized to Sister Jean for ruining her bracket. \"I mean, it doesn't really get any better than that.\"\n\nTownes is among many players on the roster Moser recruited in part because of their winning backgrounds. Seven of his players won high school state championships, and Aundre Jackson helped his junior college team reach the national championship game.\n\nThat \"winning gene,\" as Moser calls it, has put Loyola in position to become the fourth No. 11 seed in tournament history to reach the Final Four, after LSU in 1986, George Mason in 2006 and Virginia Commonwealth in 2011 .\n\nThe coaches of the latter two teams, Jim Larranaga and Shaka Smart, ultimately went on to accept positions at major-conference programs, but Moser at the moment isn't addressing speculation in that regard.\n\n\"It's just kind of been who we are, about the next game,\" Moser said. \"When we got into the tournament, it was like we didn't just want to be here. They have this edge to them that they believe, and they want more. Some of these meals back at the hotel after these wins are priceless, when everybody is not around, and it's just us, and those moments are unbelievable.\n\n\"And the next day, it's like today, it was all about Kansas State. It's just how they're wired with that.\"\n\nMore NCAA tournament coverage:\n\nSister Jean continues to steal the show at NCAA tournament\n\n'I got shivers down my whole body': Michigan walk-on hits the shot of his life\n\nKentucky Gentlemen?

                "title": "Trump signs massive spending bill, but not before a little drama",
                "body": "President Trump jolted Washington Friday when he began the day tweeting he might veto a massive spending bill needed to prevent a government shutdown -- and then appearing in front of cameras five hours later to say he had signed the legislation.\n\nTrump ripped into the $1.3 trillion funding package in remarks at the White House shortly after 1 p.m., calling it a \"ridiculous situation,\" filled with overspending yet lacking enough money for his border wall or a deal to resolve the future of young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers. He said he was only signing the bill because it contained a boost for the military.\n\n\"I looked very seriously at the veto,\" Trump told reporters. \"I was thinking about doing the veto. But because of the incredible gains that we've been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our thinking.\"\n\nFriday's five hours of confusion showed once again nothing is certain in Trump's Washington and that any deal is at risk of being blown up by the mercurial president. Just Thursday, administration officials and congressional leaders said the president would sign the bill -- even though for days he privately complained about the package in late night phone calls and early morning rants -- and the White House issued a news release touting its accomplishments.\n\nIt also highlighted Trump's desire to be seen as his own political entity and still an outsider, separate at times from the Republican Party he leads. During his remarks at the White House, Trump sought to distance himself from a bill unpopular with his base but that his aides helped craft and the GOP-led Congress passed. At times he went so far as to portray himself as being almost helpless and having little choice but to accept the spending package.\n\n\"As a matter of national security, I've signed this omnibus budget bill,\" he said. \"There are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill, but we were, in a sense, forced -- if we want to build our military -- we were forced to have.\"\n\nThe president's unhappiness was fueled Friday morning how it often is, with Trump in the residence watching \"Fox and Friends.\" For days, he heard Republicans were getting rolled in the spending negotiations and that message was now being delivered by his favorite morning show.\n\n\"This is a swamp budget, this is a Mitch McConnell special, this is a dysfunctional Senate,\" Fox News personality Pete Hegseth vented, referring to the Senate majority leader. \"There's no wall. Ultimately the Democrats controlled the process in the Senate. That's why Chuck Schumer was so happy.\"\n\nTrump had confided to several advisers that he was tired of watching Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) crow on TV -- or hearing that he was being snookered by Democrats. He gets particularly agitated by Schumer, two of these people said.\n\nHe also heard from Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) Friday morning, who said he shouldn't sign the spending package. Trump seemed to agree. The president had already talked to a number of other conservatives and friends, including Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the leader of the hard right House Freedom Caucus.\n\nNone of the reviews coming in from his favorite media outlets, including Fox News and the conservative website Newsmax, about the massive funding bill were positive, even with a big uptick in military spending that Trump so prized. The president was told about radio show host Rush Limbaugh's rant against the bill.\n\n\"The president was really sold a bill of goods here,\" said Christopher Ruddy, Newsmax's CEO who speaks frequently to the president. \"Conservatives look at this omnibus bill and say, this is not why they elected Donald Trump. This is not a good bill for him to sign.\"\n\nThe spending bill is widely expected to be the last major piece of legislation that Congress will pass before the November midterm elections, which increased pressure to jam it full of legislative odds and ends, such as provisions ranging from gun safety to combating invasive carp. The bill funds the federal government through Sept. 30 and provides $700 billion for the military and $591 billion for domestic agencies.\n\nConservatives and some of Trump's top supporters found plenty they didn't like about the package. The House and Senate both passed it just over 24 hours after it was released, drawing complaints there was little time to review its contents. Overall, critics on the right said it spent too much money, yet only included a pittance for Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nImmigration seemed to frustrate Trump the most. He secured $1.6 billion for some fencing and levees on the border, but it comes with strings attached and the amount fell far short of the $25 billion requested for a wall. He was also eager to blame Democrats for the failure to reach a deal to protect the dreamers by coming up with an alternative to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) he ended last year.\n\nEven Friday morning, he asked aides how he could still get more money for the border wall and whether some of the items that Democrats celebrated were in the bill -- such as money for so-called sanctuary cities and Planned Parenthood -- were really included in the package, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nHe was told it was unlikely he could get more wall funding and that Democrats did secure the items they were touting. He grew angry. So shortly before 9 a.m., Trump took to Twitter.\n\n\"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nInside the White House, senior officials such as Vice President Pence, legislative director Marc Short and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis were summoned to persuade the president to sign the bill and avoid a shutdown.\n\nMattis stressed that the Pentagon desperately needed the funding boost -- a $66 billion increase over last year's levels -- that the bill would provide. Aides told Trump it would be \"historic\" funding, a word that he likes to hear.\n\nShort argued that the funding package would give the president money for immigration and infrastructure programs and that the White House had already committed to signing the bill.\n\nTrump was given a list of all the planes, submarines and other military equipment the bill would fund, a list the president would rattle off later in the his hastily-organized appearance in the White House's Diplomatic Reception Room.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) made his own pitch, calling the president about 30 minutes after the veto threat. Trump continued to say the bill was terrible, but Ryan again touted benefits for the military. McConnell (R-Ky.) called Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, two White House aides said, to keep tabs on the situation.\n\nHill staffers and lawmakers were frustrated, if not surprised.\n\nLast year, Trump also threatened to veto a large spending bill in April on the day he was supposed to sign it, leading Ryan to rush over to the White House. Trump was set off by an episode of Fox and Friends and was confused about the legislation, advisers said.\n\nThe details of this spending package should not have been new to the president. Short, Jonathan Slemrod and Kathy Kraninger -- all administration aides -- were involved in the negotiations in recent days that went until the wee hours of the morning with congressional appropriators, according to three people familiar with the talks.\n\nAt times, they would go outside to call others in the White House to ask for approval on certain parts of the bill. The arguments were sometimes tense and lasted until 3 a.m.\n\nSo members were perplexed when Trump, all of a sudden, seemed to not know what was in the bill Friday and said he might not sign it.\n\nOne senior administration official said Stephen Miller, the White House's senior policy adviser, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen were critical of the spending measure because it did not do enough to advance Trump's priorities on combating illegal immigration. Miller had eventually relented after realizing there were no good options if the president vetoed the bill, officials said.\n\nWhile Trump was not all that concerned about the cost, he kept reminding aides that many legislators, including the Freedom Caucus, hated the spending.\n\n\"The president's instincts were right,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a member of the caucus. \"The bill is terrible. We still wish he would have vetoed it. It is a bill that funds items we said we would not fund while not funding items we promised we would.\"\n\nSome lawmakers and White House officials were confident Trump's veto tweet was a bluff and that he was just letting off steam.\n\nStill, until Trump himself made clear at the televised signing, White House aides said the only thing they could really say. Nothing.\n\n\"Everyone was trying to talk to the president,\" Jordan said. \"On both sides.\"\n\nEventually, White House officials said, Trump demanded having a public event, where he could show his political supporters that he didn't like the bill while attacking Democrats -- and labeling it all for the military.\n\nBefore cameras at the White House, Trump vented about the parts of the bill he disliked, called for the power to issue line-item vetoes -- something the Supreme Court has deemed unconstitutional -- and urged the Senate to junk the legislative filibuster, which has little support among senators.\n\nBut this battle was already over -- he signed the bill before appearing before reporters.\n\nJohn Wagner, Mike DeBonis, Erica Werner and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.",

                "body": "The string of bombings in Austin this month revived an ongoing debate over how the government investigates and prosecutes terrorism, revealing a split between the way many Americans think about terror and the way U.S. law defines it.\n\nAfter package bombs killed two people and injured several others, police cornered the suspect Wednesday morning on the side of a highway, where authorities say he detonated a homemade bomb as officers closed in. Authorities on Friday ruled his death a suicide caused by \"multiple penetrating shrapnel injuries,\" according to Dain Johnson, a justice of the peace in Williamson County, Tex., where the bomber died.\n\nAfter his death there was widespread relief, but law enforcement officials also found themselves dealing with a familiar question: Why don't they call this terrorism?\n\nLaw enforcement officials have repeatedly said the Austin bomber terrorized the community. But at the same time, they made clear they have not found indicators that he was inspired by any foreign terrorist groups. Nor, they said, did his self-made confession video indicate he was motivated by hate for a particular race or group.\n\n\"Some people will say it's terrorism, because it caused terror in that community. I don't look at it as terrorism, because there's no organization behind it,'' said Malcolm Brady, a former assistant director for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \"This is a single individual that was more than likely mentally unstable about something, so he blew things up. . . . He's not a terrorist.\"\n\n[Was the Charlottesville car attack domestic terrorism, a hate crime or both?]\n\nTwo strands of federal criminal law define violent crimes intended to terrorize or intimidate large groups of people.\n\nFederal anti-terrorism laws focus on attacks inspired by foreign terrorist groups, arising out of an era when such groups hijacked or destroyed planes. Domestic civil rights and hate crimes statutes seek to punish those who try to harm people because of their race or group, arising in part out of cases of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nBut in an era when a disturbed person with a weapon can kill randomly in public, the legal distinctions between terrorism, hate crime and a killing rampage can seem less meaningful.\n\n\"A lot of people feel like there's a double standard being used,\" said Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama and an expert on mass killers. \"And it makes them skeptical of what law enforcement says, because they're seeing it as, well, if this guy's Muslim you're going to call him a terrorist, and if he's not, you're going to use some other label. When in fact, it's really putting law enforcement in a tricky position, because they're really just responding to a definition they've been given and trying to apply it accurately.\"\n\nLankford said that whatever mass killers' particular motivations might be, they tend to share certain psychological traits that may be more important than their agendas. Such traits include a sense of victimization, a pattern of seeking negative attention, and being suicidal or not caring whether they live.\n\nIn the Austin case, police have not officially declared a motive, saying only that the bomber expressed anger with his life during a confession recorded on his phone. Brian Manley, the interim Austin police chief, said Wednesday that Mark Anthony Conditt left behind a 25-minute recording \"talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.\"\n\n[Austin bomber expressed anger at his life in confession, police say]\n\nThis description prompted some to criticize Manley and argue that he was being overly sympathetic toward the bomber. The chief said later that his remarks were only \"a reflection of what [the bomber's] comments were. They are not my belief; they are not my opinion.\"\n\n\"In no way am I going to be sympathetic towards someone who murdered people in our community,\" Manley told KVUE, a Texas television news station, on Thursday. \"My opinion is that he created terror in our community by his actions and he stole lives from our community.\"\n\nPolice have declined to release the 25-minute recording publicly, citing the ongoing investigation into the bombings, but Lankford said that what authorities have described publicly matches what often emerges about mass killers in other contexts.\n\nWhile the Washington-area sniper killings terrified the D.C. region in 2002, some authorities said that the attacks appeared to be terrorism. President George W. Bush said that the shootings were \"a form of terrorism, but in terms of the terrorism we think of, we have no evidence.\"\n\nRonald Knight, the then-sheriff of Spotsylvania County, Va., where two of the sniper attacks occurred, said at the time: \"To me, it is terrorism. I'm not going to stand here and say it's Al Qaeda. Whether it's a local terrorist or a global terrorist, it is striking terror in people's hearts.\"\n\nAfter those attackers were identified, officials said they found nothing tying them to organized terrorism. Yet terrorism played a role in what followed: Virginia used its anti-terrorism law, passed after the 9/11 attacks, for the first time, in the trial of D.C. sniper John Allen Muhammad; he was executed in 2009.\n\nMany other states have their own terrorism statutes. After police said a white Maryland man admitted to fatally stabbing a black man in New York City and intending to kill many more, prosecutors indicted him on two counts of murder as an act of terrorism.\n\n[Prosecutors say stabbing attack in New York was an act of terror]\n\nShooting rampages also often conclude with the attackers facing police gunfire or killing themselves. An FBI study of shootings between 2000 and 2013 found that in nearly half of the incidents studied, the attackers committed suicide; in many other cases, attackers were killed or wounded by law enforcement officials.\n\n\"Violence now is not just a symbolic statement for the traditional terrorist,\" said Brian Levin, who runs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino. It is unfortunate, he said, but \"violence has currency in our society, and it's not just for the traditional terrorist. It's for anyone who thinks they have some kind of personal grievance.\"\n\nLevin also said that even without directly knowing the Austin bomber's motivation, the explosions were different from a more traditional crime such as robbing someone.\n\n\"These attacks were symbolic in their own way,\" he said. \"There was a goal to kill, but also to disrupt the community.\"\n\nWhile people may have felt terrorized in Austin and Parkland, the crimes that caused their fear still might not meet the legal criteria for terrorism, he said.\n\n\"Just because something has a terroristic effect might not make it necessarily have the critical mass of ideology that is attached to the traditional terrorist definition,\" Levin said. \"If all violence is labeled as terrorism, then the definition fails as well.\"",

                "title": "Opinion | Trump convenes a festival of fear-mongering on sanctuary cities",
                "body": "tHE SPREAD of so-called sanctuary cities raises fair questions about how local law enforcement can balance collaboration with federal deportation officials, on the one hand, with maintaining trust with immigrant communities, on the other. Those questions were absent, however, when President Trump convened a roundtable on the issue the other day -- a festival of scare-mongering, factual distortion and rhetorical overkill that did nothing to elucidate a tricky subject.\n\nTo hear the president tell it -- along with a like-minded group of almost uniformly Republican officials, politicians and law enforcement -- sanctuary cities are intent on unleashing a crime wave on America. They are doing so, Mr. Trump and his claque asserted, by safeguarding murderers, rapists and other bloodthirsty felons on what amounts to a virtual underground railroad traversed by illegal immigrants between local jails and vulnerable communities.\n\n\"We have gang members; we have predators, rapists, killers,\" said the president. His assessment of sanctuary cities was seconded by a group that included Attorney General Jeff Sessions (\"shocking,\" \"radical\"); Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) (\"they have blood on their hands\"); Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge (\"liberal cabals\" fomenting \"unconstitutional chaos\"); and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) (\"breed of madness\").\n\nWhat hogwash.\n\nThe fact is that in virtually every so-called sanctuary jurisdiction, local officials continue to cooperate with federal deportation agents when it comes to handing over most dangerous and repeat offenders when their sentences are done; they do not do so in the case of minor offenders. Even in California -- which, having recently enacted one of the nation's most sweeping sanctuary laws, came in for special abuse at Mr. Trump's event -- local law enforcement is authorized to turn over unauthorized immigrants who have committed any of about 30 serious crimes to agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And they can share information with ICE officials on inmates who have been convicted of hundreds more serious misdemeanors and felonies.\n\nThose subtleties were swept under the carpet at the roundtable as officials vied with each other to scare Americans senseless. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said illegal immigrants had killed 1,200 people in the state since 2011. Actually, it's fewer than half that many, according to the state's own figures. (Mr. Paxton also said Texas had spent heavily on border security during his 12 years in the state legislature, ending in 2015, because the federal government \"wouldn't do it\"; in fact, the number of Border Patrol officers along the Mexican border increased by more than 75 percent, to about 17,500, in that span.)\n\nThe event dovetailed with Mr. Trump's ongoing crusade to use cherry-picked anecdotes to convince Americans that illegal immigrants pose a dire threat to law and order. Numerous studies have shown that immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, generally commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans. The fact that those statistics clash with the president's agenda doesn't make them any less true.\n\nRead more here:\n\nThe Post's View: Trump could have embraced an immigration deal. Instead, he poisoned the debate.\n\nEd Rogers: I hope Democrats defend sanctuary cities. It's bad policy, and it'll cost them.\n\nErwin Chemerinsky, Annie Lai and Seth Davis: Trump can't force 'sanctuary cities' to enforce his deportation plans\n\nRobert J.

                "body": "It matters not how many children, teenagers and families show up for Saturday's \"March for Our Lives\" demonstration in our nation's capital. Suffice to say, thousands are expected to take to the streets both here in Washington and in sister marches around the country.\n\nNumbers don't matter. Not as much as the reasons behind this mobilization of youths. How could they not step forward? All else has failed to stiffen the spines of elected officials who, in the face of gun lobby pressure, have lost the nerve to take action against the scourge of gun violence.\n\nSo, it falls to today's young people to lead the way, just as youths of prior generations took it upon themselves to force America to face up to other national curses. They were driven by the spirit of protest.\n\nThat spirit was there in 1960 when four college students staged a sit-in at the whites-only lunch counter at a Woolworth's store in Greensboro, N.C.\n\nThe spirit was there in the years that followed when both black and white students traveled together on buses and trains through the Deep South violating Jim Crow laws.\n\nThat same spirit was there in 1963 in Birmingham, Ala., when kids from elementary to high school marched out of their classrooms to protest racial discrimination, earning for themselves the title \"Children's Crusade of 1963.\"\n\nIt was there when young people by the tens of thousands joined and often dominated protests against war in Southeast Asia, the nuclear arms race and the degradation of our environment.\n\nAnd it is here today within youths who are taking the bold step to shake up a system and prick the consciences of adult political leaders too craven, indifferent or passive to lift a finger against a terror that could take away the lives of their own children and grandchildren.\n\nSo, the young are taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAgain, why not? According to the Gun Violence Archive, thus far in 2018: 141 children (ages 0-11) have been killed or injured by guns; 588 teens (ages 12-17) have suffered the same fate. There have been 49 reported and verified mass shootings.\n\nThe national response to this carnage is almost as dreadful and disgusting as the gunplay itself.\n\nLet's start with the White House.\n\nPresident Trump's initial response to the Parkland, Fla., shooting massacre was self-absorbed and wide of the mark.\n\nHe tweeted on the Saturday following the shooting: \"Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud.\"\n\nTrump's tweet landed with a thud causing outrage among shooting survivors. Responded one student:\n\n\"17 of my classmates are gone. That's 17 futures, 17 children, and 17 friends stolen. But you're right, it always has to be about you. How silly of me to forget.\"\n\nBut then Trump carried the affront one step further.\n\nHe staged a White House show in front of a bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers. With cameras blazing, Trump mouthed a bunch of stuff to make himself out to be a gun-control advocate. He told the guests and television audience that he wanted \"comprehensive\" gun-control legislation that would raise the legal age for buying assault-style weapons and close the loopholes in the background-check system. He even went so far as to express interest in California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's bill banning assault weapons. He seemed on his way to the other side.\n\nBut with the cameras and congressional members gone and following a \"Come to Jesus\" meeting with the NRA, Trump stepped back up on the curb.\n\nCapitol Hill's post-Parkland shooting performance was no better.\n\nLawmakers flooded the airwaves with news releases denouncing the shooting, expressing thoughts and prayers for the victims, survivors and families, and issuing calls for presidential leadership. To do what was left unaddressed. Oh yes, they passed legislation tweaking background checks, along with provisions allowing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct gun-violence research. But little else.\n\nStudents in town on Saturday to demand legislative action on gun violence will learn an invaluable lesson: Today's Congress is the sanctuary city for the AR-15 and other favored firearms of mass killers.\n\n\"With us or against us?\" was a question posed by a student in Parkland -- a sentiment also expressed by my grandson, Henry, and granddaughter, Audrey, who participated in their high school's walkout in New York.\n\nA do-nothing Washington has given its answer.\n\nSo, march on, children, march on.\n\nRead more from Colbert King's archive.\n\nRead more on this topic:\n\nChristine Emba: We all know what guns are really for\n\nThe Post's View: Are you serious about gun control, Mr. Trump?

                "title": "Opinion | Don't #deletefacebook. Get even.",
                "body": "\"It is time. #deletefacebook.\"\n\nThat declaration came from Brian Acton, co-founder of the messaging service WhatsApp -- itself a Facebook property, sold to the company for $19 billion in 2014 -- in a tweet after news of the social network's Cambridge Analytica scandal began to break. Apparently, the fact that app developers were able to siphon off the data of 50 million users and sell them to a nefarious political advisory firm unsettles even those who have made billions from the platform.\n\nSo, just leave? Easy for him to say. Certainly the network effects that have made Facebook nearly indispensable to millions of Americans are more resistible if you have the time and resources to crisscross the country, visit distant relatives and misinform gullible high school classmates face to face. Alas, not all of us are so lucky.\n\nThis call to delete Facebook from one of Facebook's billion-dollar beneficiaries was the latest example of tech leaders belatedly warning us off their creations. The Internet-era adage has never been more true: If you're not paying for it, you're the product. The Cambridge Analytica mess shows that for most of us, that's been true for quite some time.\n\nAs Facebook's hasty mopping-up proposals make clear, much of the data-theft damage has been done. So what do we do now? Here's one idea: Rather than just stay mad, perhaps it's time to try to get even. To do that, we regular users should act with as much care as those who have long known the risks that these platforms entail -- the people who invented and run them. Individual users can do plenty to protect themselves, taking our cues from those who, one would assume, know best.\n\nThe first? Stop sharing.\n\nI can't even see Mark Zuckerberg's friends on Facebook. It's highly unlikely that Sheryl Sandberg has ever spammed 500 acquaintances with an invitation to FarmVille, and she probably never will. Facebook's top brass use the site for messaging and brand management, but it's worth noting that their posts, likes and shares are infrequent and unrevelatory. Facebook's creators haven't invited us into their lives. Why have we invited them into ours?\n\nSecond: Log off.\n\nDeleting Facebook may not be immediately feasible for a variety of reasons. But must we be on it all the time? Just a few months ago, Facebook's founding president, Sean Parker, said that \"the thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them . . . was all about: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?' \" Parker said that he has since become \"something of a conscientious objector\" on social media. The hosts have left the party, everyone. Time for us stragglers to take a hint.\n\nThird: Trust no one.\n\nSure, it sounds cynical. But the silver lining of the Cambridge Analytica revelations is that they have prompted many Facebook users to think, really think, about the business model of the platform they treat as a neutral utility. Social media makes its money by selling us out. Exaggerated or not, Cambridge Analytica's technology promised to use our freely given likes and dislikes, biographies and quiz results, to create psychographic profiles that would, in the words of whistleblower Chris Wylie, \"exploit what we knew about [users] and target their inner demons.\" We hesitate at sharing this much information with our friends, or even lovers. Should we so casually hand it over to an algorithm that certainly doesn't have our best interests at heart?\n\nIn his much-delayed mea culpa for Facebook's failure to protect its users, Zuckerberg admitted that the scandal constituted a breach of trust. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.\" It's possible that Facebook will reform, that its leaders will begin to regulate their business model and make sure that the platform is built to serve, but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nIn the meantime, here's a tip: Don't do as the titans of Facebook say -- do as they do.\n\nRead more on this issue:\n\nE.J. Dionne Jr.: Yes, we should be outraged about Facebook\n\nThe Post's View: Let's take a deep breath about Facebook's 'breach of trust'\n\nFareed Zakaria: Facebook, Google, your reign may soon be over\n\nSandy Parakilas: I worked at Facebook.

                "title": "Opinion | Va. takes a big step forward on Metro  --  but there's a catch",
                "body": "THE LAST time Virginia took a major step in the direction of preparing the state's transportation network for 21st-century traffic and commerce, it took more than a quarter-century to get there -- that's how much time elapsed between a landmark funding package in 1986 and, after its revenue stream had dried up and the state's roads had crumbled, the next one, in 2013. The bad news is the 2013 deal did nothing for Metro. The good news is that Virginia's Republican-controlled legislature is now fixing that omission.\n\nIn a move few would have believed likely, or even possible, just six months ago, Virginia lawmakers this month approved a $154 million increase in the subsidy the state provides annually for Metro's repairs, upgrades and other capital expenses. That stunning success comes with an oversized asterisk, however, namely: About two thirds of the \"new\" funds for Metro really aren't new at all. Rather, they're raided from other transportation projects in Northern Virginia, where local officials, who had expected additional dollars, not diverted ones, are now panicked.\n\nGov. Ralph Northam (D), who has recognized that a zero-sum game is not the best solution to Northern Virginia's transportation problems, should do all he can to amend the bill to minimize damage to other transportation projects . Those range from road widenings and intersection upgrades on major regional arteries to transit projects such as bus lanes and new Metro station entrances, to smaller plans such as bike lanes and sidewalk construction. Across Fairfax, Arlington, Alexandria and other Northern Virginia localities, the landscape is dotted with projects large and small that will stall as a direct result of new Metro funding.\n\nFor that residents can blame Del. Tim Hugo, a Fairfax lawmaker who is one of the last remaining Republicans representing Northern Virginia. Mr. Hugo, an anti-tax hard-liner and his party's caucus chairman in the House of Delegates, opposed Democratic efforts to generate more new revenue, from slightly higher taxes on hotel and motel bills and on real estate sales in Northern Virginia. Downstate House Republicans, who had no dog in the fight -- the new taxes wouldn't have affected their constituents -- deferred to him.\n\nMr. Northam could simply sign the bill as is. But he also has the power to amend it -- for instance, by proposing that some $50 million be generated from increasing taxes on real estate sales. The amended bill would then go back to the legislature, which would accept or reject it in a one-day session next month.\n\nIn the closely divided General Assembly, with Democrats united in favor of additional, genuinely new funding for Metro, the governor would need a single Republican vote to prevail with an amended bill in the Senate, and a couple of GOP votes in the House. He should make the case that Virginians help themselves by paying for the transportation projects they use and need. Having allowed much of the state's transportation infrastructure to deteriorate through the 2000s, the state would be foolhardy to go down the same path again.\n\nRead more here:\n\nThe Post's View: A blueprint for saving Metro -- at last\n\nThe Post's View: Soaring stakes for Metro funding\n\nJeffrey C.

                "body": "(iStock)\n\nAn Iowa family of four was found dead in the condominium where they stayed while on vacation in Tulum, Mexico, police confirmed Friday.\n\nKevin Wayne Sharp, 41, his wife Amy Marie Sharp, 38, and their children Sterling Wayne Sharp, 12, and Adrianna Marie Sharp, 7, were reported missing early Friday morning to police in Creston, Iowa, by their immediate family members. The Sharps had planned to return home Wednesday, family members said.\n\nPolice quickly made contact with the U.S. State Department, Creston police said in a statement. A welfare check at the condominium where the family was believed to be staying led to the discovery of the four bodies.\n\nAutopsies are being performed in Mexico. It is not immediately clear what led to the Sharp family's deaths, but Creston police chief Paul Ver Meer told KCCI that there were no signs of traumatic injury.\n\nLocal Mexican authorities have taken over the investigation, according to the State Department. The Mexican Tourism Board said in a statement obtained by CBS that \"preliminary reports from local officials conclude that there were no signs of violence or struggle.\"\n\n[ TripAdvisor, under fire for removing claims of rape, will now flag hotels with reported incidents ]\n\nAshli Peterson, a relative of the Sharps, posted about the family's disappearance on Facebook Thursday night, around the time that the family contacted police. The post was shared hundreds of thousands of times. On Friday afternoon, Peterson posted an update.\n\n\"Please respect the family at this time as they go through the grieving process,\" she wrote. \"Thank you for all the posts, shares, and kind words.\"\n\nThe Sharps left the United States for Cancun, Mexico, on March 15, according to Peterson's post. The family then rented a car and drove to Tulum, where they were renting a condo, according to Amy Sharp's sister Renee Hoyt, who spoke with the Creston News Advertiser. The Sharps were supposed to return to the United States about 2:45 p.m. Wednesday from Cancun and arrive in St. Louis at about 6 p.m.\n\nFrom there, they would travel to Danville, Ill., to attend Thursday's Southwestern Community College men's basketball game, Peterson said. The Sharps were avid Southwestern fans, and the college on Friday extended its condolences to their friends and family. Head basketball coach Todd Lorensen called the family \"loyal, caring, supportive and generous.\"\n\n\"If our guys play that way we will be successful,\" Lorensen wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe Sharps had informed their family members on March 15 that they had arrived safely at their condominium in Tulum. So when family members didn't hear from them on Thursday -- after they were supposed to have arrived in St. Louis -- they became worried.\n\n\"We have filed a missing persons report through the US Embassy in Mexico already. We have also pinged cells phones and show that they are still in Mexico with no movement on their phones. Social media is also inactive,\" Peterson said in her Facebook post late Thursday night.\n\nUPDATE: The Sharps have been located. They were found last night in their condo deceased. There was no foul play! At...\n\nPosted by Ashli Peterson on Thursday, March 22, 2018\n\nThe family's mysterious deaths come amid increased travel warnings to Quintana Roo state, which is home to Tulum -- a popular destination for those looking to explore Mayan ruins or snorkel in limestone sinkholes. The State Department issued a level 2 advisory to those traveling to Quintana Roo on March 16, meaning visitors should be cautious because of increased crime there. Department officials cited a spike in Quintana Roo's homicide rate since 2016.\n\nLast month, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel published an investigation that identified more than 150 reports from travelers who said they blacked out or became violently ill after having just one or two drinks at dozens of Mexican resorts in Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Puerta Vallarta and Los Cabos. It's unclear whether those tourists were deliberately drugged or became random victims of tainted alcohol, according to the investigation.\n\nAnother Journal Sentinel investigation from November looked at repeated instances where the travel and restaurant review website TripAdvisor removed posts warning of alleged rape, assault or other injuries at some Mexican resorts. And a July investigation into the death of a Wisconsin college student in Mexico uncovered widespread safety issues, including those tied to tainted alcohol, at Mexican resorts.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Wright publicly apologized to his wife, Shannon, after baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced the penalty Friday. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\nMajor League Baseball suspended Boston pitcher Steven Wright 15 games following a domestic violence arrest in December, the league announced Friday.\n\nIt also announced it will not punish Minnesota third baseman Miguel Sanó, citing \"insufficient evidence,\" after a photographer in December alleged Sanó tried to push her into a bathroom and kiss her at a shopping mall in 2015.\n\nWright was arrested on Dec. 8, 2016, in Williamson County, Tenn., and charged with domestic assault and preventing a 911 call. The charges were eventually retired, a process by which prosecutors agree to dismiss charges if a defendant satisfies a set of requirements before a future court date.\n\nWright has asserted he \"never touched\" his wife, and the dispute was purely emotional, not physical. Still, baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred ruled Wright had violated the MLB's domestic violence policy. He may continue to participate in Spring Training activity, and his suspension will begin when the Red Sox activate him in the regular season; he may start the year on the disabled list.\n\nA knee injury limited Wright to just five games in 2017. The prior year, he went 13-6 with a 3.33 ERA and was an all-star. The 33-year-old knuckleballer is expected to compete for a spot in Boston's starting rotation.\n\nSano, 24, was an all-star for the first time last year during a season in which he batted .264 with 28 home runs.\n\nFreelance photographer Betsy Bissen wrote in a Twitter post in December that Sanó tried multiple times to kiss her and pull her into a restroom after an autograph signing at a mall in 2015. Baseball investigators interviewed \"more than 20 individuals,\" according to a league news release, \"including Sanó and the complainant, as well as a review of available documents, including communication records.\"\n\nThe league found \"conflicting and inconsistent witness accounts and the absence of contemporaneous substantiation\" about the incident.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nEagles' Michael Bennett indicted on felony charge of injury of the elderly\n\nJohnny Manziel shows off his arm to 13 NFL scouts in workout with college receivers\n\nWith NFL draft approaching, Giants' trade of Jason Pierre-Paul could be foreshadowing\n\nDespite guaranteed deal, Kirk Cousins likely didn't set new precedent for NFL free agents\n\nStephen Curry-linked group drops out as Carolina Panthers' price reportedly hits $2.5 billion",

                "title": "John Bolton, famously abrasive, is an experienced operator in the 'swamp'",
                "body": "Among the many things they have in common, President Trump and John Bolton, his newly designated national security adviser, both have traded insults with North Korean leaders. After Bolton called Kim Jung Il, the father of the current leader, a \"tyrannical dictator\" during the George W. Bush administration, Kim labeled the then-State Department official the \"envoy of evil\" and \"rude human scum.\"\n\nTrump and Bolton also have volatile tempers and a tendency to want to fire those who challenge them.\n\nIn recent months, Bolton has echoed Trump's use of Twitter for pithy statements about complicated issues. The Iran nuclear deal was a \"mistake,\" he tweeted, and the United States should \"tear [it] up.\" He lauded Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as an \"injection of reality.\"\n\nLike Trump (sometimes), however, he has opined that a military strike against North Korea would be more effective than trying to negotiate. During negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, he suggested that bombing Iran was a better option.\n\nAt times, Bolton has edged toward disagreement with the president. \"I personally believe we should increase migration,\" he tweeted, although he supported Trump's \"merit\" based visa plan.\n\nBut where the scion of New York wealth and the son of a Baltimore firefighter truly differ is the experience and knowledge they bring to their jobs.\n\n[The return of John Bolton sparks concern around the world]\n\nBolton, 69, has spent a long career in foreign policy, and is deeply versed in national security issues of the past several decades. He is also known among both admirers and critics for his masterful grasp of how to manipulate the bureaucracy and the policymaking process.\n\nHe has long been scorned by Democrats, and a not-insignificant number of Republicans, for using those skills in pursuit of hard-line, doctrinaire views, as well as for his legendary abrasive treatment of underlings and perceived fools, and a creative definition of the truth when it suits his purposes.\n\nUnlike Trump, whose politics and party affiliation have often shifted, Bolton was a card-carrying conservative from the start. As a high school student, he took the day off (with permission) to hand out election-day leaflets in support of Barry Goldwater, the 1964 GOP presidential candidate who demanded the defeat of a nuclear-armed Soviet Union.\n\nLater, as a scholarship student at Yale University, Bolton considered himself a \"libertarian conservative,\" according to his 2007 autobiographical book, \" Surrender Is Not an Option .\" Given \"prevailing campus political attitudes,\" reflected in student strikes and anti-Vietnam War mobilization, \"I might as well have been a space alien,\" he wrote.\n\nAfter Yale Law School, Bolton interned in the office of then-Vice President Spiro Agnew, a fellow Marylander he admired, before becoming an associate at Covington & Burling, the prestigious Washington law firm. He left to join the Reagan administration in the Agency for International Development, where, he said, his goal was to make foreign aid more \"market driven.\"\n\nAfter another stint in private law practice, Bolton worked at the Justice Department, under Ronald Reagan's attorney general, Edwin Meese, where he helped shepherd the failed Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork, and the successful effort of Antonin Scalia.\n\nWhen Reagan left office, Bolton moved to the State Department under new president George H.W. Bush and his chief diplomat, James Baker, as assistant secretary in charge of international organizations, including the United Nations. There, he later wrote, he concentrated on \"the ineffectiveness, corruption and mismanagement that characterized so much of the U.N. system.\"\n\nIt was at State, he wrote, that he learned how to circumvent the bureaucracy or, when necessary, to use it to his advantage. \"While not exactly scintillating to outsiders,\" he wrote, \"surviving and flourishing in a federal bureaucracy is often the difference between failure and success, which I define as implementing the president's policies.\"\n\n\"Since the bureaucracy defines success differently -- who sat where at the daily morning staff meeting, whose name appeared first on the 'from' line of a memo to the secretary, who went on what trip, and other such weighty questions -- I often got what I wanted by giving the bureaucracy what they wanted.\" Yielding on process to win on substance, Bolton wrote, \"was like buying Manhattan for beads and shells.\"\n\nBolton spent most of what he called the \"wilderness\" years of the Clinton administration at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank that became his home when Republicans were out of power.\n\nIn 2000, he offered to help Baker, the man he considered his mentor in diplomacy, as part of presidential contender George W. Bush's legal team, contesting the Florida vote against Bill Clinton's vice president, Al Gore. Assigned to oversee the counting of paper ballots in Palm Beach County, red-faced, mustachioed Bolton became a familiar media figure. Some local officials, down whose necks Bolton and other partisan observers breathed, later described him in newspaper accounts as \"rude\" and overbearing.\n\nBut the victory he helped win brought Bolton attention and admiration from Bush's soon-to-be vice president, Richard B. Cheney. Colin Powell, named as the new administration's secretary of state, later recalled Cheney pushing him to hire Bolton as a senior diplomat.\n\nPowell agreed, he later said, despite misgivings. \"The book I had gotten on John was that John will push the edge constantly, and he will get you in trouble on a regular basis\" and \"break china all over the world,\" but could be a useful attack dog. At the same time, Powell said, he believed that Bolton was being placed at State as a Cheney spy.\n\nBolton was already a polarizing figure, and won a confirmation as undersecretary for arms control and international security with the support of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who said that Bolton was the kind of man he wanted by his side at Armaggedon.\n\nAmong the policy moves Bolton counted as victories, he worked to ensure that the United States would not participate in the International Criminal Court -- something he later called \"my happiest moment at State\" -- and the Bush administration's withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. In the run-up to the Iraq War, he wrote the State Department Fact Sheet distributed to reporters that claimed Iraq's Saddam Hussein had sought to purchase uranium for nuclear weapons from Africa, an assertion the administration had reason to believe at the time was false.\n\nBolton was, and remains, an ardent supporter of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq -- a war Trump first supported, later disavowed, and recently said had made the United States look \"like the dummies of the world, because we had bad politicians running our country for a long time.\"\n\nHe worked to undermine multiparty negotiations with North Korea and Iran -- both of which he thought were pointless and should be replaced with hard-line stands, and reportedly kept Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld's Pentagon informed of diplomatic efforts to help scuttle them. When Powell, at a crisis point in North Korea negotiations, told reporters that the administration was working to get them back on track, Bolton made his own calls to the media to say that was not true.\n\n[North Korean insults to U.S. leaders are nothing new -- but Trump's deeply personal reactions are]\n\nIn 2005, Bush nominated Bolton to be his ambassador to the United Nations. State Department and intelligence officials lined up to testify against him during lengthy and contentious hearings.\n\nThe State Department's chief bioweapons official said that in 2002, Bolton had prepared a speech charging that Cuba had a secret biological weapons program, despite analysis to the contrary, and then tried unsuccessfully to have the analyst fired. The charge was backed up by the analyst's boss, Assistant Secretary for Intelligence Carl Ford, who famously described Bolton in congressional testimony as a \"kick-down, kiss-up\" kind of guy.\n\nIn a floor speech opposing Bolton's confirmation, Sen. Carl Levin (Mich), then the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, warned that \"in the near future, we may face a crisis over North Korea's nuclear program or Iran's nuclear intentions. Congress and the public must be confident that intelligence assessments represent information that has been assessed objectively, not shaped to serve policy goals.\"\n\nLevin also said that Bolton had asked the intelligence community to reveal the names of Americans mentioned in intercepted communications, saying they \"could be part of an effort by this nominee to politicize and punish.\"\n\nMost Republicans supported the nomination, and many Bush national security officials testified to Bolton's skill and value. Then-Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), harshly criticized attacks against him, saying in his own floor speech that the United States needed an ambassador \"whose knowledge, experience, dedication and drive will be vital to protecting the American interest in an effective, forward-looking United Nations.\"\n\nWhen the Republican-majority Senate failed to confirm him in summer of 2005, Bush awarded Bolton with an interim appointment as U.N. ambassador, which lasted until Democrats took control of Congress in the 2006 elections.\n\nReturning to AEI, Bolton has been a prolific speechmaker, tweeter, writer of op-ed articles and paid commentator on Fox News. \"I have never been shy about what my views are,\" he told Fox on Thursday, after news of his appointment.\n\nBut \"frankly, what I have said [as a private citizen] is now behind me,\" he said. \"The important thing is what the president says and the advice I give him.\"\n\nJohn Hudson, Greg Miller and Greg Jaffe contributed to this report.",

                "body": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico government officials said Friday they will not bow to demands from a federal control board overseeing the island's finances that they implement cuts to a struggling public pension system as part of an upcoming fiscal plan to help pull the U.S. territory out of an economic crisis.\n\nGov. Ricardo Rossello told reporters the biggest disagreement between his administration and the board is over a proposed average 10 percent cut to pensions of more than $1,000 a month paid by a system facing nearly $50 billion in liabilities.\n\nChristian Sobrino, the governor's representative to the board, defended the government's revised fiscal plan and said it would generate a $5.5 billion surplus in upcoming years and help reverse the economic slump while avoiding the elimination of vacation or sick days and reductions in maternity leave, among other things he said the board has proposed.\n\n\"We're not talking about business as usual here in Puerto Rico,\" Sobrino said. \"The fiscal plan recognizes the island's fiscal and demographic spiral. If we don't stop it, the game is over. Puerto Rico will be a footnote in the history of the Caribbean.\"\n\nThe board is expected to vote on the revised fiscal plan Monday and has the power to implement its own measures if it disagrees with those proposed by the government.\n\nSobrino warned that the board is considering some measures which would have a detrimental effect on an island mired in an 11-year-old recession as it struggles to rebound from Hurricane Maria and restructure a portion of its $73 billion public debt.\n\nSome members of the U.S. Congress also weighed in Friday on the upcoming fiscal plan, with 35 of them signing a letter voicing opposition to privatizing much of Puerto Rico's Department of Correction and Rehabilitation. They said the move would increase the island's deficit and lead to higher rates of recidivism.\n\nMany in the U.S. territory of 3.3 million people are wary of the overall proposed fiscal plan and fear they will struggle economically more than before even as they try to recuperate from Hurricane Maria. Nearly 100,000 power customers remain in the dark six months later, and more than 130,000 people are estimated to have left the island since the storm, according to one study.\n\nAnger also is building after Rossello submitted a labor reform measure Wednesday that in part calls for reducing vacation and sick days from 15 days a year to seven and eliminating a Christmas bonus that most public and private sector employees have received for decades. The measure also would increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $8.25 by 2021.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They responded by staging a quiet protest during their punishment. (Washington Post screen grab from The Morning Call)\n\nThey call themselves #Pennridge 225 -- students who were given detention by their school, Pennridge High in Bucks County, Penn., when they walked out of school March 14 to participate in a nationwide demonstration against gun violence. But this was no ordinary detention.\n\nThe students had been warned by administrators that they could not leave during the protest and that Pennridge students could attend an assembly on campus to mark one month since the Feb. 14 shooting deaths of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla.\n\nThe students left anyway, joining thousands of students across the country who walked out of school to honor the Parkland victims. Nationally, some students left classes with support from school administrators, some without.\n\n[ Watch what happened when older students saw young kids protesting gun violence on a N.Y. street ]\n\nSome schools got tough on students who left campus, with a few actually paddling students. At Pennridge, 225 of them received detention.\n\nWhen the first group of students showed up March 17 -- a Saturday -- to sit in a two-hour detention, all 46 participated in another protest, this time a quiet one as they sat with arms linked. Each displayed a piece of paper with a name of one of the Parkland victims. Outside the school, students, parents and others shouted support for the kids and gave them cookies.\n\nOne Parkland student survivor, Lauren Hogg, dubbed the detention a \"modern Breakfast Club\" -- a reference to a 1985 movie titled \"The Breakfast Club\" about kids in school detention -- in this tweet:\n\nYes!! You guys are on the right side of history.

Trump issued a memo instructing the attorney general \"to dedicate all available resources to ... propose for notice and comment a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns.\"\n\n[Again under pressure, Justice Department plods toward regulation of bump stocks]\n\nThe Justice Department is proposing to amend the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to say that bump stocks fall within the definition of an automatic weapon because they allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.\n\nThe proposed rule will be published in the Federal Register with a 90-day comment period. If the rule becomes final, bump stock devices would be banned and people who have the devices would be required to surrender, destroy or make their devices permanently inoperable.\n\nIn 2010, the ATF, a component of the Justice Department, decided it could not regulate bump stocks because officials said the devices did not meet the definition of a machine gun. A 1986 law bans the sales of machine guns manufactured after 1986 and restricts the sales of such guns before that year.\n\nATF officials concluded that bump stocks did not fall under the law because they did not permanently alter a gun's trigger mechanism.\n\n[The ATF-approved \"goofy little doodad\" used by Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock]\n\nThe Trump administration asked ATF to reconsider that decision.\n\nOn Friday, after Sessions's announcement, Trump took to Twitter to blame his predecessor for allowing bump stocks to go unregulated for the last eight years.\n\n\"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks,\" Trump tweeted. \"BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"\n\nCurrent and former ATF agents have told Congress that because of the ATF's 2010 conclusion, it is Congress that must take action.\n\nRead more:\n\nSessions calls on U.S. attorneys to aggressively prosecute gun buyers who lie on background checks\n\nNo action by Congress of ATF on the device used in Las Vegas shooting",

This is not to question the ethics of either of these senators. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D) was one of the lead sponsors of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Sen. Tim Kaine (D) has a well-deserved reputation for ethical behavior. I don't believe either would sell out to the financial-services sector.\n\nBut here's the problem: Both are among the biggest recipients in Congress of campaign contributions from the financial-services sector -- about $1 million each. Money is a key ingredient in getting reelected. It can have a subconscious influence in the thinking of anybody, including an elected official. It won't make an ethical legislator abandon their principles, but it might influence close decisions on some provisions of legislation that are close calls.\n\nI have no knowledge that either Mr. Warner or Mr. Kaine were influenced in any way by the millions they received from the financial-services sector, but some people will suspect that they may have been. Both would be better off if campaign contributions were substantially reduced, as would their colleagues in both parties.\n\nBruce Hahn, Winchester, Va.",

                "title": "Opinion | Andrew McCabe: Not in my worst nightmares did I dream my FBI career would end this way",
                "body": "Andrew McCabe served in the FBI from 1996 until March 16. He was the bureau's deputy director from 2016 to January, including time as acting director from May to August 2017.\n\nOn March 16, I spent the day with my family waiting to hear whether I would be fired, after 21 years in the FBI and one day before I qualified for my long-planned, earned retirement.\n\nAs day turned to night, I had a lot of time to reflect on how it would feel to be separated from the organization I loved -- and led -- and the mission that has been the central focus of my professional life. Despite all the preparation for the worst-case scenario, I still felt disoriented and sick to my stomach. Around 10 p.m., a friend called to tell me that CNN was reporting that I had been fired. She read me the attorney general's statement.\n\nPresident Trump's gleeful response to the firing of Andrew McCabe raises questions about the motivation behind the senior FBI official's ouster. Lawfare deputy managing editor Quinta Jurecic breaks down the latest in what Trump calls a \"witch hunt.\" (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)\n\nSo, after two decades of public service, I found out that I had been fired in the most disembodied, impersonal way -- third-hand, based on a news account. Shortly after getting word, I noticed an email from a Justice Department official in my work account, telling me that I had been \"removed from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the civil service.\"\n\nI have been accused of \"lack of candor.\" That is not true. I did not knowingly mislead or lie to investigators. When asked about contacts with a reporter that were fully within my power to authorize as deputy director, and amid the chaos that surrounded me, I answered questions as completely and accurately as I could. And when I realized that some of my answers were not fully accurate or may have been misunderstood, I took the initiative to correct them. At worst, I was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me may well have been confused and distracted -- and for that I take full responsibility. But that is not a lack of candor. And under no circumstances could it ever serve as the basis for the very public and extended humiliation of my family and me that the administration, and the president personally, have engaged in over the past year.\n\nNot in my worst nightmares did I ever dream my FBI career would end this way.\n\nThe next day I woke to find the president of the United States celebrating my punishment: \"Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI -- A great day for Democracy.\" I was sad, but not surprised, to see that such unhinged public attacks on me would continue into my life after my service to the FBI. President Trump's cruelty reminded me of the days immediately following the firing of James B. Comey, as the White House desperately tried to push the falsehood that people in the FBI were celebrating the loss of our director. The president's comments about me were equally hurtful and false, which shows that he has no idea how FBI people feel about their leaders.\n\nI was drawn to the FBI by nothing more complicated than a desire to do good. In 1994, I submitted a special-agent application, dreaming about what life as a criminal investigator would be like. I devoured every book I could find, and binged on news coverage of FBI investigations. When the day came for me to report to the FBI training academy at Quantico, Va., I embarked on the greatest professional adventure I could ever imagine.\n\nEach year, more than 2,000 men and women of all races, colors and creeds are drawn to the FBI by the same professional and personal desire to do good. It is the DNA that we all share. As acting director, I frequently talked to FBI people about that shared DNA as the glue that bound us together and enabled us to stay mission-focused during the chaos that followed Comey's firing in May 2017. True to form, our agents, analysts and professional staff reacted as FBI people always do. They continued to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution despite the political winds -- and the unprecedented attacks on us by the president and other partisans -- that buffeted us.\n\nThe nation continues to need them. And not just the current employees of the FBI, but all smart, talented, dedicated people considering careers in the law enforcement and intelligence communities. These are hard jobs that demand sacrifice, often involve danger, and take a toll on families and personal lives. But they also offer the rare opportunity to enter into a sacred trust with the American people: to protect and defend them, honestly, justly and fairly. There is no greater responsibility, but there is no greater reward. We cannot afford for young people to be dissuaded from lives of public service by the divisive politics and partisan attacks that now so characterize our national discourse and that, I believe, played a major role in the end of my FBI career.\n\nTo those men and women, I say: Fear not. Set the headlines aside and give in to what draws you to this work. The country needs you.\n\nThere is nothing like having the opportunity to be a part of the greatest law-enforcement organization in the world, working every day for goals that you respect and cherish. It is the best job you will ever have. Even if a president decides to attack you and your family. Even if you get fired on a Friday night, one day from your retirement.\n\nRead more on this issue:\n\nGary Abernathy: The D.C. bubble's credulous embrace of McCabe is embarrassing\n\nJosh Campbell: Americans need to know the truth about Andrew McCabe\n\nRonald A.

Arizona is holding a special election to replace Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned amid accusations of sexual misconduct. (Ralph Freso/AP)\n\nThe Republican National Committee has put $281,250 into the special election to replace former congressman Trent Franks, the first financial commitment by either national party in a district that has voted reliably Republican since being drawn in 2011.\n\nThe RNC declined to comment on the investment, but Arizona's 8th District was not necessarily seen as a potential Democratic pickup. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won just 37 percent of the vote in the district -- worse than her showing in Pennsylvania's 18th District, which Democrat Conor Lamb just won in a squeaker.\n\nThe Cook Political Report rates the Arizona 8th as \"safe\" for Republicans, and Democrats seemed to write off the district after scandal-plagued former state senator Steve Montenegro lost last month's Republican primary to former state senator Debbie Lesko.\n\nEven Democratic nominee Hiral Tipirneni has portrayed Lesko as a heavy favorite. In a poll conducted by Lake Research Partners for Tipirneni's campaign, the Republican held a 14-point lead, and 59 percent of likely voters in the district said that they approved of President Trump. But after Lamb's surprise victory, it appears Republicans aren't taking anything for granted.\n\nLesko did enter the general election dinged by scandal, after Montenegro said that she had broken campaign finance law by moving money from her state campaign fund to a super PAC that boosted her congressional campaign.\n\nTipirneni, an emergency room physician and first-time candidate, had slightly more cash on hand than Lesko at the start of the general election; last week, she began running a sharp-edged ad that portrayed Lesko as \"everything you hate about politics,\" making use of an awkward interview in which Lesko defended her vote for a tax increase by saying she talked to a lobbyist who supported it.\n\nOn Wednesday, the RNC sent national reporters a rundown of negative stories about Tipirneni, branding her as too \"far to the left\" for one of Arizona's most conservative districts; on Friday it clipped her answers in a televised debate to advertise her opposition to the tax cuts passed by Congress last year and to Trump's proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But Democrats were confused by the RNC's attack on Tipirneni for supporting NAFTA, a trade deal that's more popular in border states than it is in the Rust Belt.",

Indeed, these data strongly suggest that for every 4,167 low-income, nonelderly adults enrolled in Medicaid, one death is prevented annually. Thus, Mr. Newman and Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) have important decisions to make. They should consider that the position they take on Medicaid expansion may have life-or-death consequences\n\nEdward N.

                "body": "Praying mantis sex gets a bad rap because sometimes the female bites off the male's head and eats him. Like, once in a while. Usually it goes perfectly fine for both mantises, but everyone fixates on the bad dates.\n\nDeep-sea anglerfish sex, on the other hand, is an endless horror. Every. Single. Time.\n\nA male anglerfish's first and only sexual adventure results in him becoming permanently fused -- by his lips, no less -- to the side of a relatively gargantuan female that resembles David Cronenberg's nightmare about the shark from \"Jaws.\"\n\nUnlike the mantis, Mr. Anglerfish does not die as Ms. Anglerfish subsumes him into her body. His skin becomes her skin. His major organs dissolve, his fins fall off and his blood becomes her blood, until not much more is left of him but a living set of testes to make sperm at her demand.\n\nThen he dangles off her like that for the rest of his life, even if she goes on to merge with other anglerfish, wearing her sex partners like Mardi Gras beads.\n\nFor as long as anglerfish have been having body-meld sex -- a bizarre but efficient way of reproducing in the sparsely populated ocean depths -- it's been a relatively private affair. We of dry earth and independent genitals know of the phenomenon mainly through dead specimens caught in nets, and illustrations, and this inventive CGI rendering that you will never be able to unsee.\n\nUntil Thursday, that is, when Science published what it says is the first video of wild anglerfish engaged in their eternal hell of coitus.\n\nSomewhat appropriately, a pair of married deep-sea explorers took the video in 2016, from a submersible about half a mile underwater near the Azores islands in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n[ Scientists spent a month terrifying guppies to prove that fish have personalities ]\n\nKirsten and Joachim Jakobsen were about to call it a day and surface Science wrote, when they spotted a female fanfin angler about the size of a fist. They noticed a weird little appendage on her belly, which of course was actually a male fanfin angler that will never be whole or independent again.\n\nThe Jakobsens recorded the pair for about half an hour, Science wrote. They did not see the female release an egg, which the male only exists now to fertilize. Nor did they witness Mr. Anglerfish's \"fins and other disused body parts wither away until the male is only what the female needs him to be,\" which National Geographic assures us will eventually happen.\n\nBut they took a rare high-quality video of the elusive creatures, which showed off the female's dazzling mane of long whiskered filaments and the bioluminescent lure, as well as her dead eyes and gaping mouth full of monster teeth.\n\nThe biologists were thrilled to see video of this rare form of reproduction, Science wrote -- rather than, say, distraught at the philosophical implications of what they were seeing.\n\nAn ecologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute \"was impressed with how flexible the male was despite its solid attachment,\" Science wrote, \"seemingly moving around in any direction he wished.\"\n\nThe ecologist was apparently confident that Mr. Anglerfish had no wish to stop dissolving into the creature that took his body, his will and his very identity, not to mention his virginity.\n\nMore reading:\n\nScientists celebrate the weird world of animal genitalia with #junkoff\n\nScientists celebrate weird animal sex with #HumpOff\n\nWe thought New Zealand was an island nation.

(Pete Marovich for The Washington Post)\n\nDays before the crash, before his out-of-control food truck plowed into a station wagon, killing a mother of three, Tony Dane knew something was wrong with his brakes.\n\nInstead of taking it to a mechanic, he tried to fix the problem himself, he acknowledged to authorities in a recorded interview played this week in a Loudoun County courtroom. Even after the brakes began to falter again on the day of the crash, he kept driving.\n\nOn Friday, a Loudoun County jury convicted Dane of involuntary manslaughter and four other charges in the Sept. 8, 2017, crash that killed 39-year-old Erin Kaplan.\n\n\"Sorry is such a shallow word in this instance,\" Dane, 57, told the jury. \"I did such a devastating thing to their family. I not only destroyed the Kaplans, but I destroyed my own family at the same time. I don't know how to correct this. It's something that's not fixable.\"\n\nThe jury recommended sentencing him to almost 12 years in prison and fining him $3,500. Loudoun County Circuit Court Judge Benjamin Kendrick will make the final decision at a formal sentencing.\n\n\"Nothing makes me feel good about somebody going to jail,\" said Kaplan's husband, Faran. \"But I definitely think justice has prevailed.\" Even so, he added, \"nothing can bring my wife back.\"\n\nThe verdict came six months after the crash at Watson Road and Evergreen Mills Road near Leesburg, Va.\n\nErin Kaplan was driving her mother and kids to the grocery store when Dane's Great American Hamburger food truck -- a bright red school bus converted into a 22,000-pound \"rolling diner\" -- blew through a stop sign and T-boned her Audi station wagon.\n\nKaplan, a stay-at-home mother, died at the scene. Her children each suffered multiple broken limbs. The oldest, 16-year-old Benjamin, nearly lost a leg and spent months in the hospital, undergoing more than a dozen surgeries.\n\n[A horrible crash, a shattered family and a recovery filled with uncertainty]\n\nFaran Kaplan, left, and his wife, Erin, at a 2013 Ravens game. (Family photo)\n\n\"Tony Dane killed Erin Kaplan,\" assistant commonwealth's attorney Eric Shamis told the jury during opening statements. \"He did not kill her with a gun. He did not kill her with a knife. But he killed her nonetheless.\"\n\nDane's weapon, Shamis said, was the food truck -- a 20-year-old bus in such bad shape it was a \"ticking time bomb.\"\n\nAdam Pouilliard, one of Dane's public defenders, said the food truck's brakes had cut out less than a minute before the crash, leaving Dane with seconds to make a terrible choice. The reason Dane didn't run off the road, Pouilliard said, was that he was worried about his son and another minor who were on board and did not have seat belts.\n\nHe was in \"a horrible position that had an absolutely tragic result,\" Pouilliard said. \"Mr. Dane never wanted this to happen.\"\n\nCharity Dokos, a school bus driver, testified that she was dropping off students when the out-of-control food truck appeared in her rearview mirror.\n\n\"Have a great weekend,\" she had just told disembarking students, according to bus surveillance footage played in court. When she spotted the truck, she blared her horn to warn the kids, watching in horror as the truck almost hit them.\n\n\"Did you see what that was?\" she asked the bewildered students, according to the video.\n\nSarah DeWees testified that she was driving directly behind Kaplan when the food truck came flying toward them.\n\n\"I knew it wasn't going to stop. There was no way it was going to stop,\" DeWees said, shaking with emotion. \"It plowed right into the silver car. It was just -- awful.\"\n\nPatrick Beaver, then a detective with the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, said he was headed home when he saw a long line of cars at the intersection and went to investigate.\n\n\"I could hear yelling and screaming coming from the car,\" he testified. \"It sounded like a young child.\"\n\nA bystander said they smelled gasoline, so Beaver -- afraid a fire could burn the family alive -- smashed a rear window with a sledgehammer, only to find that the damage was even worse than he thought.\n\nFaran Kaplan visits with his son Benjamin, 17, who was hospitalized for months after the accident but is now home and back at school. (Pete Marovich for The Washington Post)\n\n\"I knew I wouldn't be able to remove anyone from the vehicle,\" he said on the stand.\n\nAs rescue workers were still extricating the family from the car, a Loudoun County sheriff's detective interviewed Dane at the hospital.\n\n['Where's Mommy?': A family fled death threats, only to face separation at the border.]\n\nDane told the detective that he had a Colorado driver's license and insurance but could not provide them since he had lost his wallet in the crash.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Shamis said.\n\nA few days before the crash, he had replaced part of the food truck's hydraulic brake line after noticing brake fluid leaking, he said in the recorded interview played in court. On the day of the crash, the brakes again began to feel \"spongy\" but, instead of pulling over, he drove for another 20 minutes until he came upon the school bus.\n\n\"When I tried to stop, my brakes went right to the floorboard,\" he told the detective. \"The bus was speeding up instead of slowing down. I told the boys: 'I can't stop it. We're going to crash.' I tried to make a sharp right turn, but I couldn't make it sharp enough and I hit the car.\"\n\nThe prosecutor called the bus, which had last been inspected in 2011 in Utah, \"a 22,000-pound pile of junk on the road.\"\n\nIt was rusted underneath, a sheriff's deputy testified. Its tires were split and rotting before the crash. It had no power-steering fluid, no seat belts and no working brake lights.\n\nIt was also badly unbalanced. Dane had put most of the kitchen equipment on the back left of the bus, making it difficult to turn, the second deputy said.\n\nDane had recently replaced some tires and thought he had fixed the brakes, Pouilliard said. But he actually allowed air into the line that eventually led the brakes to fail completely, the deputies testified.\n\nAnd when the brakes did fail, Dane did not try shifting into a lower gear, Shamis argued. He did not use the parking brake. And he did not drive off the road, although he had between 30 seconds and a minute to do so.\n\nAfter the crash, Dane belatedly applied for a driver's license and car insurance, the prosecutor said.\n\nDane was already facing legal troubles in Nevada, where he was a conservative political activist and robo-caller. He was charged in 2016 with 11 felonies in Clark County, Nev., for allegedly pressuring a Republican legislator to change his vote for speaker of the state's assembly.\n\nDane pleaded not guilty, and seven of the counts were eventually dropped. He has yet to go to trial on the remaining charges, which include extortion and filing false campaign documents.\n\nHe also faces a wrongful-death lawsuit filed weeks after the crash by Faran Kaplan.\n\nKaplan sat through the trial with a service dog -- given to family members to help them with their grief -- at his feet.\n\nHis kids are back in school. Sophia, an 11-year-old gymnast whose pelvis was crushed in the crash, just did the splits for the first time since, Kaplan said. Emma, 13, is the only one who remembers what happened. She remains traumatized.\n\nBenjamin's legs are covered in scars from surgeries and skin grafts, Kaplan said. But in June, he will receive his diploma on schedule, walking across the stage without a cane.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe sole survivor of a family killing spree wonders: 'Why am I the one who was left?'\n\n'There's nothing left': Fire devastates Rockville dive bar beloved for its history\n\nThe love of his life was lured into a deadly trap.

                "body": "BEIRUT -- Syrian rebel groups said Friday that a deal had been struck to evacuate thousands of people from the besieged and broken Syrian enclave of Eastern Ghouta amid growing reports that men who crossed to government territory are being forcibly conscripted.\n\nFriday's agreement, which was expected to take force in the coming days, entails the surrender by militant fighters in one of three pockets of rebel control. In a statement, the Faylaq al-Rahman group said that Russia had agreed to a deal that would allow opposition fighters and their relatives to travel to Northern Syria.\n\nIn effect, this means boarding the green buses that have become a regular feature of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's victories, carrying opposition fighters, relief workers and other civilians toward the rebel-held province of Idlib. A similar agreement has already been reached in another pocket.\n\nUnited Nations investigators have described the practice as \"enforced displacement,\" a war crime.\n\nFaylaq al-Rahman said that Russian military police would deploy in areas that have been under the group's control, including the suburbs of Arbeen, Zamalka, Ein Tarma and Jobar. A prisoner exchange will take place between the group and the government, the group said.\n\nSyrian and Russian warplanes have killed hundreds of civilians in the enclave since Feb. 18, in an offensive to root rebel forces out of their final stronghold on the edge of Damascus.\n\nTens of thousands of residents have returned to Syrian government areas after five years of punishing sieges. State television has broadcast scenes in which former residents clutching posters of Assad and declaring their relief. Others have trudged past the camera in silence, dazed and exhausted. With all entrances to the enclave controlled by pro-Assad forces, dozens of people had died from lack of food or medicine.\n\nMonitoring groups and local residents say that men of fighting age have been forcibly conscripted as they leave. The Violations Documentation Center monitoring group said it had received reports that young men had, in some cases, been arrested as they passed government checkpoints, later telling families they had been forced to join the army.\n\nAmong cases documented by the White Helmets rescue group was one of their own. The organization said Friday that a volunteer had surrendered to the Syrian authorities in return for his family's safe passage. They said that the man had been conscripted into a pro-government militia.\n\n\"We cannot blame anyone who does this because it is the only way to survive now. They are doing it to save their brothers, their children,\" said Mahmoud al-Yousef, an official with the White Helmets in Damascus.\n\nAlmost 2,000people have been killed across the enclave since mid-February, according to the opposition-run health authority, despite a United Nations Security Council resolution intended to halt the violence.\n\nMonitoring groups have documented the use of bunker-busting munitions, chlorine gas and barrels packed with explosives and shrapnel. On Friday, the groups said that Russian warplanes had dropped incendiary weapons on an air-raid shelter, killing at least 37 people, many of whom were women and children.\n\n\"We have previously documented how the use of incendiary weapons is burning alive civilians who are literally left with nowhere to hide. This attack would appear to be the latest horrific example in that pattern,\" said Rawya Rageh, Amnesty International's crisis response senior adviser.\n\nIn a statement on the Tass news agency, Russia's defense ministry called the allegation \"a glaring lie.\"\n\nAs Syrian forces advanced through the enclave, a widely circulated selfie showed two soldiers grinning for the camera as they stood guard over a room full of women and young children. The offensive is being lauded across state media, and Damascus residents cheered from car windows Friday night as they drove through the city.\n\nThe U.N. said that more than 50,000 people from Eastern Ghouta have arrived at its temporary reception centers, a number that far exceeded the organization's capacity to provide the displaced with food, water or toilets.\n\n\"The conditions are really dire,\" said Rachel Sider, a policy adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council. She said that, in some cases, the shelters had been filled with four times the expected number of displaced people, and many showed signs of malnutrition and trauma.\n\nEvery family is being screened by Syrian government forces, according to people in the area, with full names searched against a database to establish whether they are wanted by the government for further interrogation.\n\nIn a video circulated on Syrian news websites and social media Friday, a member of parliament identified as Muhammad Kanbad was seen handing out aid from the back of a van as he exhorted the gathered crowd to chant in favor of the government.\n\n\"Say 'Long live Assad'; say it!\" he cried, raising a finger aloft as he paused his distribution. They did.\n\n\"Who is your president?\" he asked.\n\n\"Bashar Assad.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Assad!\"\n\nAnd with that he handed them a single bottle of water.\n\nSuzan Haidamous in Beirut, Zakaria Zakaria in Istanbul and Heba Habib in Stockholm contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nAirstrikes kill scores in Syrian rebel suburb as civilian exodus gathers pace\n\nSyrians stream out of a Damascus suburb as it is overrun by government forces\n\nAs Syrian bloodshed continues, UN delays vote on emergency cease fire\n\nToday's coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",

Duncan Hunter's (R-Calif.) alleged misuse of campaign funds amid an ongoing criminal investigation into the same matter.\n\nIn a statement released Friday, the panel noted that the Justice Department asked it to defer consideration of Hunter's case one year ago. Further deferrals do not necessarily indicate \"that any violation has occurred,\" the statement read.\n\nHunter has denied knowingly using any campaign funds for personal expenses. His lawyers have said he is fully cooperating with the criminal probe, and he reportedly repaid his campaign fund $60,000.\n\nInvestigators are looking into whether Hunter spent campaign funds improperly to benefit friends and family, including funding vacations and private school tuition for his children. His spending has been under scrutiny since 2016.\n\nEarlier this year, Hunter said it was \"concerning\" the law enforcement investigation had lasted so long and urged officials to \"just get it over with.\"\n\n\"I think that the Department of Justice is somewhat biased. There are individuals there, they like to make big cases, they like to do big things, it makes a name for them. I think that the longer they drag this out, the worse it is for me, and they know that,\" Hunter said in an interview with television station KUSI.",

                "title": "Scoop. Denial. Scoop confirmed. That's business as usual for writers covering the Trump White House.",
                "body": "The New York Times had what appeared to be a big scoop earlier this month. President Trump, it reported, was considering shaking up the legal team advising him on the investigation conducted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nWithin hours of the story's publication, however, Trump himself threw cold water on the Times. He tweeted, \"The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job. . . . The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access.\"\n\nExcept the story, and a second one earlier this week updating Trump's legal search, turned out to be accurate. On Thursday, Trump's lead attorney, John Dowd, resigned three days after Trump added Joseph diGenova, a former federal prosecutor and sometime Fox News commentator, to his legal team.\n\nLast week, too, The Washington Post broke some news about a forthcoming shake-up among White House advisers. Trump had decided to remove national security adviser H.R. McMaster, the paper reported.\n\nWithin hours, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders rejected that very idea. \"Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster -- contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes\" at the National Security Council, she tweeted.\n\nThat denial stood up until Thursday, when the White House announced McMaster's departure and Trump named as his replacement former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, also a sometime Fox News commentator.\n\nWhite House officials say it's possible for events to change rapidly, and a denial at one moment is, in fact, an accurate and truthful reflection of the immediate state of play. Until the president actually makes a decision, a news story projecting the course of events can be speculative and even inaccurate, they said. This is especially true of personnel decisions because new events can intervene, undermining the president's previous confidence in a top aide.\n\nAs an example, one official alluded to President Barack Obama's expression of confidence in his embattled veterans affairs secretary, Eric K. Shinseki, in May 2014. But later that month, under mounting congressional criticism of Shinseki, Obama reversed course and accepted Shinseki's resignation.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in an interview that reporters have their own form of denial -- by speculating about events and then never correcting the record when things don't pan out as they had first described. \"I've seen plenty of reports saying so-and-so is going to be out by the end of the week,\" he said. \"And then so-and-so is still there a few months later. No one admits they got it wrong.\"\n\nYet last week's Times and Post stories suggest that some of Trump's claims about \"fake news\" don't hold up. In many instances, the news isn't \"fake\" -- just inconvenient and ill-timed for the White House.\n\nThat's why some White House reporters view the administration's denials of otherwise well-sourced information with skepticism.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this happens often enough that reporters have learned that we can't trust the denials,\" said Peter Baker, a veteran Times White House reporter. \"It doesn't help anyone when reporters have to assume that what the White House tells us may not be true or that a White House statement will prove inoperative just days or even hours later.\"\n\nBaker's colleague Haberman, who co-wrote the stories about Trump's legal team, reacted to Trump's denials with the verbal equivalent of a sigh. \"He denied [the two stories] both times,\" she tweeted on Thursday . \"It all stems from him. People can focus on staff and I certainly have, but at the end of the day it's the president who runs things this way and makes the choices to deny true stories and attempt to confuse people.\"\n\nTrump's administration has been strewn with similar denials of stories that eventually came to pass. During the post-election transition, for example, a spokesman denied a Washington Post report that Gen. Jim Mattis would be his nominee for secretary of defense; Trump confirmed it hours later at a public appearance. In October, the White House denied a Post story that Trump would decertify the Iran nuclear agreement as not in the national interest. He ended up doing so.\n\nReporters say they believe Trump sometimes employs denials to maintain an image of orderly calm until it's no longer possible to do so. It could also be a delaying tactic, aimed at holding off a news report until the White House is ready to announce it. In fact, some outlets reported Thursday that Trump was angry that Bolton walked through the White House's front gate and was spotted by reporters, thereby spoiling a big \"reveal.\"\n\nOr it could just be Trump's way of confusing the issue and playing to his loyal base, said Nikki Usher, an associate professor in the school of media and public affairs at George Washington University.\n\n\"Even introducing something that turns out to be false into our information system means that it's out there, and the vast majority of people will never hear the correction,\" she said. \"Or if they do hear the correction and acknowledge it to be factually accurate, we now know this doesn't even matter because their enduring partisanship remains. It is the best tactic, actually, to introduce false information into the news ecosystem because most people will never notice that it has been corrected. If they do, they'll find reasons to dismiss the correction as significant, leaving their underlying support intact.\"",

(Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Taylor Swift published an Instagram post that took many people by surprise: A logo for this weekend's March For our Lives, the student-led rally urging Congress to take action on gun control and stop mass shootings.\n\n\"No one should have to go to school in fear of gun violence. Or to a nightclub. Or to a concert. Or to a movie theater. Or to their place of worship,\" the pop superstar wrote in the caption. \"I've made a donation to show my support for the students, for the March for Our Lives campaign, for everyone affected by these tragedies, and to support gun reform.

I'm so moved by the Parkland High School students, faculty, by all families and friends of victims who have spoken out, trying to prevent this from happening again.\n\nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Mar 23, 2018 at 11:56am PDT\n\nSwift is the latest in a long line of A-listers to support the endeavor, as George Clooney announced a $500,000 donation and stars from Miley Cyrus to Common will be at the Washington march on Saturday. But Swift's statement is significant, simply because she's one of the most powerful celebrities on the planet, with many millions of followers -- and typically, she avoids saying or doing anything remotely political.\n\n[ Why is Taylor Swift's tweet about the Women's March so controversial? ]\n\nBecause of her influence, her silence has recently become a point of criticism, as she didn't speak out one way or another about the 2016 election -- and she hasn't publicly denounced fans who are white supremacists. Last January, Swift's tweet about the Women's March (\"So much love, pride, and respect for those who marched. I'm proud to be a woman today, and every day.\") also became controversial; many criticized her for not attending the event, even though she uses feminism to promote her brand.\n\nIt culminated in a mini-\"controversy\" at the end of 2017, as she thanked her fans for supporting her new \"Reputation\" album and wrote on Instagram, \"I couldn't have asked for a better year.\" Afterward, she was mocked for celebrating a year that had been so difficult for so many people.\n\nFor the March For our Lives, however, Swift went beyond just a general social media message, as she noted that she made a donation and specifically addressed gun reform. Swift has made a concerted effort over the past two years to stay out of the public eye, so when she does break her silence on a topic, it's clear that she really wants people to pay attention.\n\nRead more:\n\nCountry singers usually stay quiet on gun issues, but since Parkland, some are speaking out\n\n'The march is just the start': Parkland students and lawmakers speak out about gun violence\n\nTaylor Swift's 'Reputation' avoided -- and mocked -- the media. And it worked.",

                "title": "Analysis | Trump Wanted a Trade War. Here's What One Looks Like: QuickTake",
                "body": "In a two-week span, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered up an array of tariffs against numerous countries, blocked Chinese takeovers of U.S. companies and sought new restrictions on future Chinese investment. Economists are warning that the world is on the verge of an all-out trade war, featuring tit-for-tat reprisals, heated rhetoric and appeals to the World Trade Organization, which may be ill-equipped to respond. If Trump's trade provocations mushroom out of control, dozens of border-opening trade deals negotiated over several decades could be shoved aside. The prospect of slower economic growth has stock markets worldwide reeling.\n\n1. What is a trade war?\n\nThe dictionary says it's \"an economic conflict in which countries impose import restrictions on each other in order to harm each other's trade.\" Trump's tariffs and the threatened retaliation from other countries meet this definition, but so do centuries of protectionist skirmishes by numerous countries in countless sectors. The recent escalation is stoking fears that Trump has touched off a full-blown trade war by singling out of China for retaliation for intellectual property theft. The quid-pro-quo actions by the U.S. and China over steel tariffs, Trump's invocation of national security to justify some of his moves -- which could open a Pandora's Box of similar claims by other nations -- and Trump's threat to further punish the EU if it imposes counter-duties also add to the trade-war atmospherics.\n\n2. What happened in previous trade wars?\n\nOne of the most notorious examples is the Smoot-Hawley Act passed by Congress in 1930 and often blamed for deepening the Great Depression. The law hiked U.S. tariffs by an average of 20 percent, initially to protect American farmers but then broadened as other industries lobbied for protections. As demand collapsed, countries scrambled to maintain their gold reserves by devaluing their currencies or imposing even more trade barriers. Global trade fell off a cliff.\n\n3. Who wins in trade wars?\n\nNo one, if history is any guide. When President George W. Bush raised steel tariffs in 2002, U.S. gross domestic product declined by $30.4 million, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. The U.S. lost about 200,000 jobs, about 13,000 of which were in raw steel-making, by one estimate. A report by the pro-free trade Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that Bush's tariffs cost about $400,000 for every steel-industry job saved. The World Trade Organization also ruled that the Bush tariffs were illegal.\n\n4. What has Trump done so far?\n\nHe's imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion of as-yet unspecified products imported from China in retaliation for what he calls decades of intellectual property theft. He imposed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively, on steel and aluminum imports, which prompted China to say it could hit back with tariffs of its own. While he temporarily exempted allies, including the European Union, from the metals tariffs, he expects them to grant concessions to the U.S. to maintain the exemption.\n\n5. Why did Trump invite this fight?\n\nIn a March 2 Twitter post, he declared trade wars \"good, and easy to win.\" His focus remains reducing the U.S. trade deficit, which shows the country imports hundreds of billions of dollars more than it exports. Stepping back from trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership also appeals to Trump's base of voters in America's Rust Belt. But talk of a trade war is alarming to many U.S. business leaders, who largely support existing trade deals, and the securities markets, which fear lower profits and slower economic growth if the U.S. turns protectionist and other countries retaliate.\n\n6. Who has retaliated?\n\nSo far, China said it would hit $3 billion of U.S. wine, fruit, steel pipe and other exports with tariffs. The bigger worry for the U.S. is that China, the U.S.'s biggest creditor, will scale back purchases of Treasuries in retaliation. China's ambassador to the U.S. doesn't rule out the option. Other countries haven't retaliated for the steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect March 23, largely because Trump temporarily exempted many of them. Still, the EU is unhappy and warned it will respond with its own 25 percent tariffs on $3.5 billion of American goods, particularly iconic U.S. brands produced in states that are part of Trump's political base. The list includes motorcycles, blue jeans and bourbon whiskey. In turn, Trump warned that he would impose a 25 percent penalty on European car imports if the EU carried out its threat.\n\n7. When does the WTO get involved?\n\nThe U.S. took the first step on March 23, filing a \"request for consultations\" with China at the WTO on technology licensing. China also notified the WTO how it could respond to the steel tariffs with levies of its own. But retaliatory actions that unfold quickly can test the WTO's somewhat ponderous deliberative process. The arbiter of international trade disputes was born in 1995 out of a set of agreements struck by countries trying to reduce trade barriers. If a government's complaint about another nation's trade barriers is seen as grounded, the WTO recommends acceptable retaliation. In the case of steel, Trump is invoking a seldom-used clause of a 1962 U.S. law that gives him the authority to curb imports if they undermine national security. Under WTO rules, countries can take trade actions to protect \"essential security interests.\" Other nations could challenge the validity of the U.S. use of that clause. They also could copy the U.S. move by citing national security to block imports themselves.\n\n8. Could tariffs backfire on the U.S.?\n\nYes. Take steel tariffs. Many more people are employed in industries, such as auto manufacturing, that buy steel to make products, than in steel-making itself. Some consumers may also have to pay higher prices. Trade tensions could boost inflation more than desired by Federal Reserve policy makers, who might feel the need to raise rates more aggressively than planned. On the other hand, if the tariffs result in job losses and the economy slows, the Fed might want to ease the pace of rate hikes.\n\n9. Are tariffs the only weapon in trade wars?\n\nNo, there are many others. Clamping down on Chinese investments in the U.S., which Trump is already doing, is one example. Talking down, or manipulating lower, one's currency is another. Countries through the years have used other means to keep foreign goods out and protect homegrown companies, a practice known as mercantilism. Trump accuses China of using government subsidies to prop up its domestic industries. Some practices are overt, such as quotas, and others covert, such as unusual product specifications, lengthy inspections of goods at entry ports and intricate licensing requirements.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Mayeda in Washington at amayeda@bloomberg.net, Bryce Baschuk in Geneva at bbaschuk2@bloomberg.net.\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sarah McGregor at smcgregor5@bloomberg.net, Paula Dwyer, Randall Woods\n\n©2018 Bloomberg L.P.",

                "title": "Opinion | Craigslist missed connections is the consummate Internet casualty",
                "body": "(Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nOn a week when Mark Zuckerberg would really like a second chance, a corner of the Internet that offered exactly that has gone away: Craigslist deleted its \"missed connections\" section on Friday, along with all its other personal ads, citing Congress's passage of an anti-sex trafficking bill that would hold sites liable for some unlawful user behavior.\n\n\"To the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through craigslist,\" a parting note from administrators reads, \"we wish you every happiness!\"\n\nCraigslist's decision to strip away a sizable portion of its offerings lends credence to the view that the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, nicknamed FOSTA, will lead sites afraid of lawsuits to self-censor. Some think it is a small price to pay to stop trafficking -- especially of children. Others say the law would actually make the Internet less safe by driving voluntary sex workers deep into the darker web.\n\nIt's a crucial and complicated debate. But the fact we're even having it helps explain why some have spent their time not diving into the ins and outs of selling sex online, but instead just mourning the demise of missed connections.\n\nIn our purest early-aughts dreams, connection was what the Internet was all about. The web would help us learn things we would never have learned, read things we would never have read, buy things (of course) we would never have bought and meet people we would never have met.\n\nThis all came true, but so did a lot else. Isolated and angry young men were learning and reading things that only made them angrier. For everything we bought, some corporation bought a little bit of us, too, gathering information on where we lived, what we \"liked\" and whom we loved. And those people we met weren't always in it for cross-cultural heart-to-hearts. On the Internet, as the old cartoon says, nobody knows you're a dog -- or a scammer, a troll, a trafficker, an abuser of another sort, or even an ax murderer.\n\nMissed connections, though, focused on that initial Internet idealism. The belief that, with the web, we never had to miss something again if we didn't want to. Sending a memory out over the webwaves -- I smiled at you on the street, or on a train or in a cafe, where you were reading the New Yorker, or Cosmo, or \"In Search of Lost Time,\" wearing a T-shirt, or a suit or a summer dress, and you smiled back -- felt a bit like tossing a bottled-up message to the sea. Yet still, the hundreds of thousands who posted held out hope that someone would answer. And sometimes, someone did. Because the Internet was magic.\n\nCraigslist launched in 1995. In 2006, the site's founder told ABC, \"The really big lesson that I have learned from doing Craigslist customer service full time . . . is that people are overwhelmingly good and trustworthy.\" Tell that to anyone who has seen what Russia wrought on our elections 10 years later.\n\nThe Internet doesn't inspire much idealism anymore. Instead, either we're so used to it that it doesn't feel like anything at all, or it's scary. And to make it less so, legislators seem prepared to sacrifice some of the freedom that thrilled us in the first place. Missed connections is the consummate casualty.\n\nOver the years, we've seen more and more of how the World Wide Web can go wrong, but we still remember how we imagined it would go right, and we're still waiting for someone to tell us how to get there -- our hopes hanging on like unanswered ads. But as any dedicated Craigslist user knows, those ads always eventually disappear.",

                "body": "Alabama lawyer Eddie Sexton alleges two supporters of Roy Moore worked to discredit allegations of sexual impropriety against the then Republican senate canidate and undermine the credibility of one of his accusers, Leigh Corfman. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nBIRMINGHAM -- Days after a woman accused U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual impropriety, two Moore supporters approached her attorney with an unusual request.\n\nThey asked lawyer Eddie Sexton to drop the woman as a client and say publicly that he did not believe her. The damaging statement would be given to Breitbart News, then run by former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon.\n\nIn exchange, Sexton said in recent interviews, the men offered to pay him $10,000 and promised to introduce him to Bannon and others in the nation's capital. Parts of Sexton's account are supported by recorded phone conversations, text messages and people in whom he confided at the time.\n\nThe effort to undermine Leigh Corfman's allegations -- beginning on Nov. 13, a month before the election -- shows how far some of Moore's most fervent supporters were willing to go to salvage an Alabama campaign that many hoped would propel a nationwide populist movement and solidify Bannon's image as a political kingmaker.\n\nIn the phone conversations and texts, copies of which were obtained by The Washington Post, one of the men spoke of ties to Moore and Bannon while urging Sexton to help \"cloud\" the allegations, which included other women's claims that Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.\n\n\"What they're saying, all they want to do is cloud something,\" Gary Lantrip, who attended at least one private fundraising event for Moore, said during a phone call recorded by Sexton. \"They said if they cloud, like, two of them, then that's all they need.\"\n\nLantrip also made references to money -- at one point speaking haltingly about the \"the ten [pause] dollars,\" a shorthand for the $10,000 offer, Sexton said.\n\n\"We got some chance to do something, make some quick little-bitty for you ... and then, on down the line, we can go to D.C.,\" Lantrip said during the recorded call.\n\nSexton was initially reluctant to talk publicly about the alleged offer, because the men -- Lantrip and Bert Davi, business partners in a small construction firm -- are his clients in an unrelated court case, a dispute over a real estate venture. Sexton decided to speak publicly after repeated requests over months from Post reporters, who contacted him after obtaining one of the recordings.\n\nSexton vouched for the authenticity and accuracy of the recordings and messages.\n\nIn a statement, Moore said Thursday that Lantrip and Davi had attended rallies but that the campaign was not involved in any effort to pay Sexton. \"I nor anyone else in the campaign offered anyone money to say something untrue, nor did I or anyone else authorize someone else to do such a thing,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesman added that, although Lantrip and Davi had met Moore, \"they did not have any special access to Judge Moore, nor were they ever commissioned with any special tasks by the campaign team.\"\n\nA spokeswoman said Bannon, who worked in the White House until August, could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn separate interviews on Monday, Lantrip, 55, and Davi, 50, acknowledged seeking the statement and arranging a meeting between Sexton and two Breitbart reporters but denied doing anything improper.\n\nLess than a week after Leigh Corfman accused U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual impropriety, two Moore supporters asked her attorney, Eddie Sexton, to drop her as a client and say publicly that he did not believe her. Bert Davi, right, is one of the Moore supporters who approach Sexton. Washington Post reporter Shawn Boburg is at left. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring a 20-minute interview at a construction site in Birmingham, Davi parried questions about money, saying his partner would know details of what was offered to Sexton. \"That was between Eddie and Gary,\" Davi said. Asked where the money would have come from, he said, \"Probably Gary.\"\n\nDavi said he has known Bannon for years but declined to say how they met or describe the nature of their relationship. He added that Bannon never knew about any offer to pay Sexton.\n\n\"Our effort was really to let the truth come out,\" Davi said.\n\nAt one point, Davi suggested it was Sexton who raised the idea of payment, saying the lawyer indicated that if he were to issue a statement about Corfman, he \"wouldn't do it for free.\" Sexton denied that.\n\nDavi ended the interview but said he would talk later that day. He was not available at the scheduled time, however, and refused to talk to a reporter as he left the site.\n\nApproached outside his home that afternoon, Lantrip declined to comment on whether Sexton was offered money or about his own references to money during the recorded call. He acknowledged telling Sexton, however, that if he made the statement he would get legal work from Bannon as part of a Breitbart expansion in Alabama.\n\n\"I'll protect what I did, because I know I didn't do nothing,\" Lantrip said shortly before ending the interview.\n\nGary Lantrip gets into a truck in downtown Birmingham. He is one of the Moore supporters who approached Sexton. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nA spokeswoman for Breitbart said the two reporters were not aware of any offer to pay Sexton or provide him with legal work and did not know who penned a handwritten statement he says he was asked to sign.\n\nTwo people interviewed by The Post said Sexton told them about the alleged offer around the time it was made, including a lawyer he was consulting for advice. They provided time-stamped texts and private Facebook messages that show their discussions with Sexton as he considered how to handle the situation.\n\nAlso, Sexton said he reported the incident to a federal prosecutor in Alabama. Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Posey told Sexton in a Dec. 5 email that the events Sexton had described by phone did not appear to constitute a federal crime.\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment.\n\n'Hey buddy call me if you can' This undated family photo shows Leigh Corfman around 1979 when she was about 14. (Family Photo)\n\nIn October and November, Corfman told Post reporters that she met Moore in an Alabama courthouse nearly 40 years ago, when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. She said he later drove her to his house, where he took off her shirt and pants and touched her sexually.\n\nCorfman asked Sexton to help manage the media scrutiny that would follow the story's publication, Sexton said in a recent interview. Sexton was an unconventional choice. A partner at a small firm outside Birmingham, he specializes in product liability cases and had spent most of the past decade on a class-action lawsuit involving defective drywall. But Corfman and Sexton were childhood friends from Gadsden, Ala., Sexton said.\n\nAfter the story broke on Nov. 9, Alabama website AL.com identified Sexton as Corfman's attorney and quoted him as saying she stood by the account she gave The Post. Amid the barrage of media calls, Sexton said a partner at his firm expressed angst about being associated with such a politically charged issue. Sexton said that, though they made no public announcement, he and Corfman privately agreed to part ways.\n\nTwo days later, on the campaign trail, Moore predicted that Corfman's claims would unravel under scrutiny. \"There are investigations going on. In the next few days there will be revelations about the motivations and the content of this article,\" Moore said at a news conference.\n\nBreitbart jolted into action, too.\n\nThe conservative website had a lot riding on Moore. Bannon had backed him in a primary against Luther Strange, the favorite of establishment Republicans. The website had heralded Moore's win in the primary as proof of Breitbart's \"enduring power and reach.\"\n\nOn Breitbart's daily radio show, Bannon called The Post's report a \"weaponized hit\" during a segment with Matt Boyle, one of three Breitbart reporters he dispatched to Alabama after the story broke.\n\n\"We expect that there will come out evidence that demonstrates the collusion between the Democrat establishment, the Republican establishment and the media,\" Boyle said.\n\nLantrip reached out to Sexton that same day.\n\n\"Hey buddy call me if you can. It's important,\" Lantrip wrote.\n\nSexton and Lantrip had been friends for decades, both men said. Sexton had represented him in several civil cases, including a bankruptcy and construction billing disputes, records show. Their kids, now grown, had been friends when they were younger, Sexton said.\n\nThe men spoke by phone on Nov. 12, a Sunday, and agreed to meet Monday at Sexton's law office in Hoover.\n\nLantrip brought Davi, his partner in the construction firm they launched in 2015.\n\nThe three chatted on a concrete slab behind the law office, Sexton told The Post. Davi mentioned that he knew Bannon, Sexton said. Davi said the Breitbart executive wanted to talk about whether Sexton would say publicly that he did not believe Corfman, Sexton said.\n\nSexton said he told them such a statement would not be credible, in part because he had already made supportive statements about Corfman on his Facebook page. He sent Lantrip images of those comments by text message early that afternoon, records show.\n\nSexton said Lantrip told him by phone a short time later that \"Bannon's group\" still wanted to talk to him.\n\nSexton said he doesn't recall whether money first came up during this phone call or at the meeting behind his law office, but he said Lantrip or Davi told him that he could collect $10,000 -- and possibly more.\n\nSexton said he was pressed for money at the time, and Lantrip knew it. Sexton had told his friend about the pressure that built up as he invested years working on the drywall case, he said.\n\nSexton said he was disturbed by the offer but also intrigued by the prospect of meeting Bannon. He said he did not know how Lantrip and Davi got involved in the Senate race, and he did not ask.\n\nEddie Sexton became Leigh Corfman's attorney when her allegations about Senate candidate Roy Moore became public. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nIn interviews with The Post, the men said they were courted by the campaign. Davi said they were asked to hang banners touting Moore at a construction site. Lantrip said they met Moore three or four times, adding that he was \"trying to get us on his side to campaign for him.\"\n\nMore than a week before Corfman's allegations surfaced, Davi and Lantrip had access to the candidate's inner circle.\n\nOn Nov. 1, the pair attended a Moore fundraiser at a townhouse in Washington, D.C., arriving in a black SUV with an unidentified third man, video obtained by The Post shows. The private gathering, hosted by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), featured a handful of senators and other high-profile supporters. Moore was there, as were Bannon and Boyle, according to footage shot by operatives with the progressive group American Bridge.\n\nDavi told The Post the third man was their business partner, whom he declined to identify but described as \"more involved politically.\" Shown images of the three of them outside the Capitol Hill fundraiser, Lantrip said he did not recognize the man.\n\nDavi said during the interview that he has long known Bannon but would not say how. \"Let's just say that I know Steve,\" he said. \"I've known him for a while.\"\n\nDavi has the kind of background that most campaigns try to avoid.\n\nHe spent years in state and federal prison in the 1990s, convicted of multiple felonies including auto theft in both Colorado and California, forgery in Wyoming, and a federal charge in Louisiana for being a felon in possession of a firearm, records show.\n\nDavi had claimed to be a former member of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang, federal prosecutors wrote in the 1997 weapons possession case. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. In 2005, he pleaded guilty in San Diego for distributing methamphetamine, identity theft and firearms violations, records show. He was sentenced to five years in state prison.\n\n\"My past has nothing to do with any story,\" Davi wrote in a text message.\n\nMeeting with Breitbart reporters\n\nAfter their conversation behind the law firm, Sexton agreed to meet that afternoon at the office where Lantrip and Davi run their construction business, in a low-slung industrial building at the end of a cul-de-sac in Pelham, south of Birmingham. Before he went inside, Sexton called a friend and told him what was happening.\n\n\"He told me that he had been asked to turn on his client, to state that he didn't believe his client, and he would be paid to do it,\" Kevin Hodges, who met Sexton through their children's rodeo competitions, said in an interview. \"He was concerned about what he needed to do, and he was calling for my advice.\"\n\nHodges said that he told Sexton not to go to the meeting but that Sexton wanted to confirm the offer. Hodges said Sexton told him he was considering recording it. Hodges provided a partial billing statement for his cellphone, at The Post's request, showing a 24-minute call with Sexton starting at 2:16 p.m. that day. Hodges said he leans Republican and supported Moore. He did not vote in the December election, state records show.\n\nSexton said he arrived at the Pelham office and joined Lantrip and Davi in a conference room. He said Lantrip told him that they had the money for him. Boyle, Breitbart's Washington bureau chief, soon joined them, he said. Minutes later, Aaron Klein, Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief walked in, Sexton said.\n\nSexton said he was too nervous to record the meeting from his phone.\n\nOn the table was a notebook, he said, opened to a page that contained the handwritten statement he was expected to sign. There was little small talk, Sexton said. He said they began discussing the possibility of issuing a statement about Corfman's credibility.\n\nSexton said he told them he didn't see any way he could make a statement disparaging his client -- that he would lose his law license if he did -- and besides that, he hadn't even asked Corfman about the details of her allegations against Moore.\n\n\"I don't know how y'all, or how anybody, would ever believe me,\" Sexton said he told them. \"And Matt and Aaron kind of tell me, 'Well, that's not really the point of whether or not anybody believes you. It's just, you know, getting other information out there.' \"\n\nSitting to the left of Sexton, Davi put his head down on the table in apparent exasperation, Sexton said.\n\n\"And I kind of started getting, I guess, maybe irritated and agitated, or I think everybody kind of did when they realized that I wasn't going to sign a statement,\" Sexton said. \"I said, 'I don't know what I could say.' I said, 'This is a pretty big deal.' And I said, 'I just need to go. I'm going to think if I can do anything at all. I will let you all know.' \"\n\nSexton said he ripped the page with the handwritten statement from the notebook as he left the meeting. He says he does not know who wrote it.\n\nThe statement, which Sexton provided The Post, says: \"After reviewing the allegations, after taking Leigh Corfman as my client, I believe there is not sufficient evidence to back them up and that the case strains credulity. I decided that since I would have difficulty represent a client that don't believe I have to recuse myself from this case. I hope Leigh the best.\"\n\nThis is the statement discrediting Corfman that Sexton says he was asked to sign. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nAs he backed his truck out of the parking lot, Sexton aimed his phone out the window and recorded a shaky video of a man he says is Boyle.\n\nBoyle did not respond to a request seeking comment, and Klein did not respond to an email.\n\n\"Hey brother sorry if I was a dick. If you weren't comfortable you were right to leave,\" Davi texted Sexton at 5:24 p.m. \"it's a big deal and you have to make smart decisions. I understand\"\n\nHuddling with Roy Moore\n\nSexton said he decided to begin recording his subsequent interactions with Lantrip and Davi because he was concerned they might mischaracterize the meeting as his attempt to solicit a bribe. He recorded an eight-minute phone call with Lantrip later that evening.\n\n\"Where in the hell did you get these guys?\" Sexton asked Lantrip, referring to the Breitbart reporters.\n\n\"That's the first time I met them today, and we just been talking with Bannon and then with Roy Moore and then with Rand Paul. We never met those guys until today,\" Lantrip said in the recorded call, a copy of which was obtained by The Post. (A spokesman for Rand Paul said the senator does not know Davi or Lantrip and had no involvement in seeking the statement.)\n\n\"I mean, have y'all -- have they already paid y'all money?\" Sexton asked.\n\n\"No, just what I'm about to give you,\" Lantrip replied.\n\n\"We got the 10,\" Lantrip said, pausing briefly, \"dollars. We got that, but it, it don't matter.\"\n\nSexton told Lantrip that he'd like to help, but making a statement -- they did not specify about what -- would be \"bombastic.\" He reiterated his concern that it could also lead to the loss of his law license.\n\n\"I'm just going to say you called and you need a little more time,\" Lantrip said. \"You're gonna think about, you ran into some problems and you'll call us tomorrow.\"\n\nDuring the call, Lantrip also assured Sexton he would meet Bannon one day.\n\nIn a phone call recorded by Eddie Sexton and later obtained by the Post, the Alabama lawyer is heard speaking with a friend and client Gary Lantrip who Sexton alleges offered $10,000 to undermine accusations of sexual impropriety against then Republican senate candidate Roy Moore. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nThe next day, Sexton discussed the alleged offer with a lawyer and friend, Michael J. Evans, who gave The Post copies of private messages showing that Sexton told him about the meeting and phone call with Lantrip. Evans was politically active during the campaign. He started a Facebook group that created memes critical of Moore and supportive of Moore's opponent, Doug Jones. He said he also made multiple small contributions to the Jones campaign.\n\nThe overtures from Lantrip continued.\n\n\"Hey buddy we'll be with Roy Moore tonight if you come up with anything. Thx,\" Lantrip wrote to Sexton at 2:29 p.m. on Nov. 14, 28 days before the election.\n\nThat evening, Moore was set to appear at a church in Jackson, three hours southeast of Birmingham. When Moore arrived, he and his wife, Kayla, were trailed by Lantrip and Davi, video of the event shows. They walked down the aisle behind Moore as he shook hands.\n\nA screengrab from a broadcast by ABC 33/40 in Birmingham shows Republican candidate Roy Moore during a campaign event in Jackson, accompanied by Bert Davi and Gary Lantrip. (ABC 33/40)\n\nLantrip and Davi took seats in the front row, near Moore and his wife. At one point, Davi motioned to someone in the audience, the video shows. Soon after, Boyle took a seat next to him.\n\nDavi leaned in and whispered to Boyle several times as the church choir sang. After Moore's speech, Lantrip and Davi huddled with him and his wife, along with several other people, just off the stage. Later, Davi held back television cameras as Moore ducked into a car, according to video of the event.\n\nAt 9:49 p.m. that evening, Lantrip sent Sexton another text: \"Hey brother just got done with that meeting. Call me when you can\"\n\nAs Lantrip made the late-night drive back to Birmingham, he also left a voice mail, asking Sexton to call him \"first thing in the morning.\"\n\n\"We got some business to talk about,\" Lantrip said in the message.\n\nA call to federal prosecutors\n\nSexton, who was in New Orleans for the drywall case, didn't respond to multiple text messages sent by Lantrip and Davi over the next few days.\n\n\"Ok buddy call me in the mourning before you get started got some important info from Bannon,\" Lantrip wrote on Nov. 15.\n\n\"Maybe you could respond to Gary even to say can't help you,\" Davi wrote later that day.\n\nSexton was silent, according to the string of messages reviewed by The Post.\n\n\"Hey Eddie call me it's real important I've got some info that benefits you and me,\" Lantrip pleaded two days later.\n\nThe men persisted until Nov. 25, when Sexton wrote in a text message that he would be at his farm if they wanted to meet him.\n\n\"We are heading out to see ya brother,\" Davi wrote.\n\nAt the farm, Sexton said, Davi pressed him on why he wouldn't make a statement. Sexton said he did not record the conversation.\n\nSexton said he challenged Davi to \"call Bannon's lawyers and get them to indemnify me and hold me harmless and support me the rest of my life if something happens and get them to tell me what they think I can say.\"\n\nThe next morning, on Nov. 26, Davi sent Sexton a text message: \"DC attorneys agree with you. You cannot say anything further than you declined to represent her. Nothing more, no reasons, no explanations.\"\n\nDavi told The Post that the attorneys referenced in the text were his lawyers. He declined to identify them.\n\nAs Sexton played coy, he and Evans were weighing the options.\n\nGo public? Sexton said that possibility was complicated by the fact that Davi and Lantrip were his clients. Plus, Evans and Sexton said, Corfman had told them she preferred if they waited until after the election because it might otherwise look like an attempt to influence the results in the final days.\n\nSexton and Evans said they decided to report it to federal authorities.\n\n\"I think I slept well because you are going to FBI today,\" Evans wrote on Nov. 29 in a private Facebook message he provided to The Post. \"I feel like that is the right move.\"\n\nThe following day, Sexton contacted the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Alabama, according to an email.\n\n\"Do you have a few minutes to discuss something?\" he wrote to Posey, an executive assistant U.S. attorney. They spoke later that day, Sexton said, and Posey said he would be back in touch.\n\nThe election was less than two weeks away.\n\nLantrip called Sexton on Dec. 4, the day before Bannon was to appear at a Moore campaign rally in Alabama.\n\n\"On that other thing we've been talking about, with Bannon and them,\" Lantrip said during the recorded call. \"They was wantin' to see if you'd make a statement saying you declined ... to take the case and don't represent her anymore. Period.\"\n\nSexton demurred.\n\nThe following day, Posey, the federal prosecutor emailed Sexton back.\n\n\"We don't find any applicable criminal provision in federal election law,\" he wrote.\n\nOn Dec. 8, Boyle reached out to Sexton directly.\n\n\"Hey Eddie,\" he texted. \"Give me a call when you get a second.\"\n\n\"Only need a few minutes of your time,\" he wrote the following day.\n\nSexton said he didn't respond.\n\nOn Dec. 12, Moore lost the election. The stakes for Bannon and Breitbart were soon clear.\n\n\"Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,\" Trump said in a statement on Jan. 3.\n\nLess than a week later, Bannon was pushed out of Breitbart News.\n\nDuring the interview Monday, Davi said he and Lantrip initially did not believe Corfman's claims but do now.\n\n\"At the end of the day we came to believe the allegations,\" Davi said. \"We stepped away from Roy Moore.\"\n\nAlice Crites and Michael Scherer contributed to this report.",

                "body": "FRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys added another receiver in free agency Friday when Allen Hurns agreed to a two-year deal.\n\nHurns' deal with the Cowboys came three days after he was released by the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nCowboys receiver Cole Beasley welcomed Hurns to the team in a Twitter message, ending that with \"lets go to work!\" Hurns responded, \"Let's get it bro\" on his account.\n\nHurns initially signed with the Jaguars as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2014. He got a $40 million, four-year contract extension after the 2015 season, when he had 64 catches for 1,031 yards and 10 touchdowns in 15 games. But he has since been hampered by injuries.\n\nHurns missed 11 games because of injuries during the past two seasons with the Jaguars, who last week brought back receiver Marqise Lee and added Donte Moncrief in free agency.\n\nIn his four seasons with the Jaguars, Hurns had 189 receptions for 2,669 yards and 21 TDs. He caught just 74 passes for 961 yards and five scores the past two years while dealing with a sports hernia in 2016 and a high ankle sprain in 2017.\n\nOn Thursday, Dallas signed free agent wide receiver Deonte Thompson, who played 53 games the past six seasons for Baltimore, Buffalo and Chicago.\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "* Good thing we've got a businessman president with the world's greatest temperament running things:\n\nPresident Trump left the White House for Florida on Friday after a head-spinning series of moves on national security, trade, the budget and his legal team that left the capital reeling, sent the stock market into another dive and left his own advisers nervous of what comes next.\n\nThe decisions attested to a president riled up by cable news and increasingly unbound. Mr. Trump appeared heedless of his staff, unconcerned about Washington decorum, confident of his instincts and determined to set the agenda himself, even if that agenda looked like a White House in disarray.\n\nInside the West Wing, aides described an atmosphere of bewildered resignation as they grappled with the all-too-familiar task of predicting and reacting in real time to the shifting moods of the president.\n\nOur best guess is that this is the New York Times' polite way of saying that Trump is a total madman and things are spiraling into complete chaos. Happy Friday! -- gs\n\n* Rosalind Helderman and Tom Hamburger report new details on the Trump campaign, Russia, and George Papadopoulos:\n\nWhen a Russian news agency reached out to George Papadopoulos to request an interview shortly before the 2016 election, the young adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump made sure to seek approval from campaign headquarters.\n\n\"You should do it,\" deputy communications director Bryan Lanza urged Papadopoulos in a September 2016 email, emphasizing the benefits of a U.S. \"partnership with Russia.\"\n\nThe exchange was a sign that Papadopoulos -- who pushed the Trump operation to meet with Russian officials -- had the campaign's blessing for some of his foreign outreach. [...]\n\nAmong those who communicated with Papadopoulos were senior campaign figures such as chief executive Stephen K. Bannon and adviser Michael Flynn, who corresponded with him about his efforts to broker ties between Trump and top foreign officials, the emails show.\n\nOh yeah, they barely knew him, he was just some volunteer.\n\n* Shawn Boburg and Dalton Bennett report that Roy Moore's supporters were ready to pull out all the stops for him:\n\nDays after a woman accused U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual impropriety, two Moore supporters approached her attorney with an unusual request.\n\nThey asked lawyer Eddie Sexton to drop the woman as a client and say publicly that he did not believe her. The damaging statement would be given to Breitbart News, then run by former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon.\n\nIn exchange, Sexton said in recent interviews, the men offered to pay him $10,000 and promised to introduce him to Bannon and others in the nation's capital. Parts of Sexton's account are supported by recorded phone conversations, text messages and people in whom he confided at the time.\n\nThe effort to undermine Leigh Corfman's allegations -- beginning on Nov. 13, a month before the election -- shows how far some of Moore's most fervent supporters were willing to go to salvage an Alabama campaign that many hoped would propel a nationwide populist movement and solidify Bannon's image as a political kingmaker.\n\nCorrupt political practices in Alabama? I am shocked.\n\n* Eliana Johnson has the disconcerting details of a meeting at which James Mattis and Rex Tillerson tried to explain to Trump how the rules-based international order works, and Trump kept offering idiotic objections. This is the one that led Tillerson to call Trump a \"f-ing moron.\"\n\n* Michael Birnbaum, Anna Fifield, and Loveday Morris report that governments all over the world are horrified by John Bolton becoming national security adviser.\n\n* Robin Wright explains why Bolton is so dangerous.\n\n* A good point from Jonathan Bernstein: The hires of Bolton and Larry Kudlow show that the GOP won't acknowledge the disastrous policy failures of the Bush years, revealing that there's something fundamentally wrong with the party.\n\n* Pamela Brown, Gloria Borger, and Evan Perez report that the president isn't quite sure how his new hire Joe diGenova is going to fit into his legal team, and may have him just defend Trump on TV.\n\n* Jonathan Cohn reports on what may be a turning point in the debate over the Affordable Care Act: Democrats feel like they can finally start improving it.\n\n* Tom Nichols argues that America may never recover from the way Trump is degrading our position in the world.\n\n* Michael Tomasky rightly notes that Republicans keep saying they don't want Trump to try to remove Mueller, without ever saying what they'd do if he did.\n\n* Tal Kopan offers a useful timeline of all the times President Trump has turned down offers to fix DACA.\n\n* John Stoehr says if Bernie Sanders is going to run for president again, he needs to address the help he got from Russia in 2016.\n\n* Steve Peoples and Emily Swanson report on new polling that shows support for gun control measures is soaring.\n\n* And over at The Week, I explored the anxious masculinity behind Trump and Joe Biden threatening to duke it out.",

                "body": "When it is over, you are cold, and alone, wondering who those people were, why they were treated so brutally, and what can be done to make the world right.\n\nUntil it closes, sometime late this summer, the hottest ticket in town is likely to be for \"Carne y Arena,\" a virtual-reality experience created by the Academy Award-winning director Alejandro G. Iñárritu. Installed in a converted church on Benning Road near the bustling H Street Corridor, \"Carne y Arena\" uses architecture and virtual reality to immerse participants in a terrifying and topical vignette of modern life, the experience of fleeing violence, crossing borders and confronting the full fury of state power.\n\nAfter interviewing refugees from Mexico and Central America, Iñárritu has distilled their experience into a 6 1/2- minute virtual-reality drama that places the spectator directly in the moment when exhausted and brutalized migrants are captured by American border agents, guns drawn, dogs barking and helicopters thundering overhead. It is a shattering experience.\n\n\"Carne y Arena,\" which roughly translates as \"Flesh and Sand,\" premiered last year at Cannes as the festival's first virtual-reality Official Selection, and has been seen in Mexico City, Milan, and at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It arrives in Washington as President Trump's border wall and the new, ardent nationalism of his supporters threaten to erase this country's self-image as a haven for the oppressed. But Iñárritu, who includes in his woven stories the perspective of a U.S. Border Patrol agent haunted by his encounters with dehydrated and dying migrants, says his goal is to transcend political debate: \"Once we intellectualize it and politics gets into it, everything is reduced and everything goes to vulgarity,\" he said in an interview.\n\nA user in the \"Carne y Arena\" experience. (Emmanuel Lubezki)\n\n\"I try to keep myself away from judgment and not take sides,\" said the director, whose credits include \"Babel,\" \"Birdman\" and \"The Revenant.\"\n\nThe installation of \"Carne y Arena\" was no lightly scrubbed, quick paint job pop-up. It required not only converting a small church to incorporate a large, sand-covered space for the virtual-reality component, but the design and construction of a waiting gallery for those with tickets, as well as museum-quality galleries and other rooms. Only one person can enter at a time, and visitors are allowed in at 15- minute intervals, though some will linger longer in the last gallery which presents biographies of people seen in the virtual-reality room. Passersby will see the old church lined with the rusting metal barrier elements used in some places along the southern border, and a crisp, sleek wood-covered structure for the adjacent waiting lounge.\n\nThe experience begins with a brief introduction to the work before you enter a deliberately cold, sterile, cement-floored room with crude metal benches and two lockers for shoes, socks, bags and backpacks. This room mimics the holding cells for detained migrants, who speak of inhumanely cold temperatures and lack of privacy. The virtual-reality component, experienced in bare feet on sand, includes goggles, headphones and a backpack and allows the visitor to move freely through an illusionistic space that gives an uncanny sense of being alone in one this country's vast and breathtaking southwestern deserts.\n\n[What will an ICE assault on undocumented Americans look like?]\n\nThe medium of virtual reality is developing at an extraordinary pace. Iñárritu says, \"I don't think the technology is yet there, and there is still a lot to really get better.\" But it was sufficiently developed that he felt he could use it now, even if that meant mustering all his directorial savvy to \"hide all the limitations of the medium.\" The experience he produced breaks free from traditional Hollywood narrative, dispensing with backstory and character development, to focus on what would be, in a traditional film, the climax of the story.\n\n\"I think this medium deserves to find its own language,\" he says. \"It should not carry that narrative tradition.\" Rather, he believes, it should focus on a more abstract representation of space combined with a kind of proto-narrative. Without revealing what happens within the short drama, one can say this: It leaves you with a profound sense of being in the desert, before and after a trauma, and that sense of isolation and beauty combine with the residue of emotion to catalyze a deep sense of common human frailty and vulnerability.\n\nIñárritu's work offers one answer to a powerful question raised by another virtual-reality experience at last year's Whitney Biennial. Jordan Wolfson's \"Real Violence\" focused all the power of the technology on a single, brutal scene of violence, in which a young man is beaten and stomped bloody and senseless, on a beautiful, sunny day in New York. It seemed to ask: Which way will this medium drive us, toward voyeurism or empathy? Iñárritu's \"Carne y Arena\" answers: If used right, empathy is possible.\n\nAlejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu directs a motion capture shoot for \"Carne y Arena.\" (Chachi Ramirez)\n\nBut what to do with that empathy? Americans have a tendency to think of immigration as a quintessentially American problem, when it is in fact a global issue, and one of the defining issues of our age. We haven't yet comprehended what Hannah Arendt called \"the right to have rights\" and that no matter what our Constitution says, the United States has an obligation to defend that fundamental ur-right to have rights for everyone within its borders. Neither the United States nor the European Union quite comprehend the corrosive power of militarizing the border against refugees, and how the dehumanizing effects of encounters such as the one depicted in \"Carne y Arena\" may destroy the very ideals we believe we're protecting.\n\n[At the Guggenheim, a narrative of co­lo­ni­al­ism and desire]\n\nSo in Iñárritu's work, the invitation to think beyond borders has both a political and aesthetic dimension. We see a nascent technology of fully immersive illusionism, which shatters the traditional frame of the camera, used to depict an episode of terror that should shatter any illusion we have that walls, guns, dogs or armed men brutalizing defenseless people are going to solve the global problem of migration. This feels like an epochal moment. For 2,500 years, at least, from the shadows of Plato's Cave to the cycloramas of the 19th century to Hollywood and virtual reality, the species has dreamed warily of a form of storytelling that would put us in each other's heads, in each other's spaces, fully open to other realities.\n\n\"This technology can be used very badly, scarily badly,\" says Iñárritu. A spokeswoman for the event declined to comment on the cost of the project, which was produced by the Fondazione Prada, the Emerson Collective and Legendary Entertainment. Until the technology is affordable, the development of this medium will probably fall to corporate actors and those who can attract substantial institutional support, which means it may not be a genuinely democratic art form for years to come. And the potential for political manipulation is indeed terrifying.\n\nBut this effort, which may in five years be seen as primitive as the old flickering fantasies of the Lumière brothers, shows the potential of the medium's capacity for utopian epiphanies.\n\nCarne y Arena opens Monday at 1611 Benning Rd. NE. Advanced tickets, which are free, are necessary. For more information, visit carneyarenadc.com.",

In the interview, Karen McDougal apologized to the first lady for the extramarital affair.\n\nTrump spoke of the bravery and resilience of the women seated to her side.

It is equal parts bravery and nobility.\"\n\nThe women who were honored had shown both.\n\nAliyah Khalaf Saleh of Iraq had rescued young military cadets ambushed by Islamic State militants, and helped recruits to the extremist group get fake identity cards so they could escape.\n\nAiman Umarova, a lawyer in Kazakhstan, represents political prisoners and helps bring to justice those involved in the sexual abuse of women and children.\n\nL'Malouma Said of Mauritania was born into slavery, and has become an anti-slavery activist elected to parliament.\n\nSirikan Charoensiri, a Thai lawyer, helped found a human rights group that documents human rights abuses under the military government that came to power in a 2014 coup.

                "title": "Opinion | The ongoing myths and misconceptions about 'accidental addiction'",
                "body": "Oxycodone pills (John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nOver at Reason, Jacob Sullum has written a much-needed corrective to the prevailing narrative about opioid addiction -- that there is a widespread problem of \"accidental addiction\" among pain patients. It's a destructive narrative, because it makes it more difficult for people in real pain to find doctors willing to treat them.\n\nFrom Sullum:\n\nContrary to the impression left by most press coverage of the issue, opioid-related deaths do not usually involve drug-naive patients who accidentally get hooked while being treated for pain. Instead, they usually involve people with histories of substance abuse and psychological problems who use multiple drugs, not just opioids . . .\n\nBut the truth is that patients who take opioids for pain rarely become addicted. A 2018 study found that just 1 percent of people who took prescription pain medication following surgery showed signs of \"opioid misuse,\" a broader category than addiction. Even when patients take opioids for chronic pain, only a small minority of them become addicted. The risk of fatal poisoning is even lower -- on the order of two-hundredths of a percent annually, judging from a 2015 study.\n\nDespite such reassuring numbers, the government is responding to the \"opioid epidemic\" as if opioid addiction were a disease caused by exposure to opioids, a simplistic view that ignores the personal, social, and economic factors that make these drugs attractive to some people. Treating pain medication as a disease vector, the government has restricted access to it by monitoring prescriptions, investigating doctors, and imposing new limits on how much can be prescribed, for how long, and under what circumstances. That approach hurts pain patients by depriving them of the analgesics they need to make their lives livable, and it hurts nonmedical users by driving them into a black market where the drugs are deadlier.\n\nA large majority of opioid-related deaths now involve illicitly produced substances, primarily heroin and fentanyl. As usual, the government's efforts to get between people and the drugs they want have not prevented drug use, but they have made it more dangerous.\n\nAnd more data:\n\nAccording to a 2014 analysis of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 54 percent of nonmedical users got prescription opioids for free from friends or relatives. Another 16 percent bought or stole pills from friends or relatives, while 4 percent bought them from strangers. About 6 percent mentioned other sources, including online purchases, forged prescriptions, and theft from doctors' offices or pharmacies. Just 20 percent of nonmedical users said they obtained opioids through prescriptions written for them.\n\nAlthough some people who now obtain opioids indirectly may have had prescriptions at some point, these results undercut the notion that nonmedical users typically start as bona fide patients. Even among the heaviest users, just 27 percent had prescriptions at the time of the survey, and it is not clear how many of those were legitimate at the outset. In most cases, says Sidney Schnoll, a physician specializing in addiction and pain treatment who works for the consulting firm Pinney Associates, \"These are people who were drug-seeking. They are not people who went to a physician, got a prescription, and suddenly became addicted to the drug.\"\n\n. . . A study reported in The BMJ this year tracked 568,612 opioid-naive patients who took prescription pain medication following surgery and found that 5,906, or 1 percent, showed signs of \"opioid misuse\" during the course of the study, which included data from 2008 through 2016. Although some studies have described \"rates of misuse, abuse, and addiction-related aberrant behaviors\" as high as 26 percent among chronic pain patients, Volkow and McLellan reported, \"rates of carefully diagnosed addiction\" average less than 8 percent.\n\nFatal overdoses among patients are even rarer. A 2015 study reported in the journal PLOS One followed chronic pain patients treated with narcotics for up to 13 years and found that one in 550 died from an opioid-related overdose, which is a risk of less than 0.2 percent over the course of the study. A 2015 study of opioid-related deaths in North Carolina, reported in Pain Medicine, found 478 fatalities among 2.2 million residents who were prescribed opioids in 2010, an annual rate of 0.022 percent.\n\nDespite what you may have read elsewhere, the Drug Enforcement Administration hasn't exactly been going easy on doctors who overprescribe. In the 1990s and 2000s, the agency targeted lots of doctors with highly publicized investigations. (I know this because I wrote about some of them.) The intent of these investigations -- and the news conferences and media releases that went with them -- was to scare doctors away from prescribing opioids. It worked. A lot of competent and conscientious doctors left pain treatment.\n\nBut the pain their patients were experiencing didn't go away. The demand for relief persisted. Unfortunately, but not at all surprisingly, that demand was filled by less scrupulous, less careful \"pill mill\" doctors willing to write prescriptions for addicts and legitimate patients alike, with about the same amount of care and attention for either. (The government and anti-opioid interests also tend to conflate addiction with dependence, which is a separate problem. Diabetics, for example, are dependent on insulin. They aren't addicted to it.)\n\nThe basic problem here is that drug cops shouldn't be dictating medical policy. If doctors are overprescribing, medical licensure boards should intervene. But as we saw for decades with the medical use of marijuana, when it comes to controlled substances, drug warriors don't see nuance. They tend to view intoxicating drugs with a Puritan fervor. The research suggests that one way to get more people off opioid painkillers, for example, would be to ensure better access to medical marijuana. The current U.S. attorney general isn't having that. He advises people suffering from chronic pain to take an aspirin instead.\n\nWe need rational, evidence-based opioid policy that balances the the medical needs of people in pain with the government's interest in preventing addiction and overdose deaths. Right now, the latter is dominating the debate. Worse, it's not at all clear that limiting access to prescription opioids actually prevents addiction and overdose.",

                "body": "David Ropeik began his excellent March 11 Outlook essay, \"School shootings are rare, We're still terrified. ,\" with an inaccurate statement. He wrote: \"The first recorded school shooting in the United States took place in 1840, when a law student shot and killed his professor at the University of Virginia.\"\n\nA much earlier \"school shooting\" occurred in Bel Air, Md., in the fall of 1824. The Rev. George Morrison was the principal and teacher at the Academy in Harford County. His obituary reads, in part:\n\n\"In this situation he continued until the fall of 1824; when in the discharge of his duties as a teacher and guardian of the youth committed to him, he offended a vicious youth that had been sent to his school from Baltimore. This youth determined on revenge, armed himself with a pistol, and one day as Mr. M. returning from the school room to his house had passed, he fired upon him, the ball entering the back above the hip joint, passing through the body, lodged on the opposite side within the skin. From this wound he was confined for a number of months, during part of which time, all hope of his recovery was given up, by himself and his physicians. To the surprise of all he recovered.\"\n\nDuring his time in Bel Air, Morrison was also pastor at the Bethel Presbyterian Church in Harford County, where I was recently interim pastor. Though often in great pain, he preached at Bethel \"until the beginning of his last illness\" from which he died on April 19, 1837. \"At his own request the Physicians proceeded to a post mortem examination.\" The cause of his death at age 40 was determined to be the \"ball\" from the gunshot wound 11 years earlier. (Quotes from the obituary.)\n\nMorrison's three-page obituary in the Baltimore Literary and Religious Magazine in May 1837 made no mention of what happened to the student who shot him. It does, however, describe a man who I believe would agree with Ropeik: \"The real lesson we need to learn is this: We need not just reasonable gun control, but also a bit more self-control over our emotions and instincts if we want to keep ourselves and our kids safer.\"\n\nDick Sheffield, Hummelstown, Pa.",

I wish there were other places to look, too, but she seems limited to small Magazine articles, except for contributing unspecified bits to Gene Weingarten and others seeking fresh and witty ideas for their columns. The March 11 Just Asking interview, \"Gianluigi Dellaccio, gelato ambassador,\" was a prime example of what Manteuffel can do. The questions she asks, her comments and her follow-ups reflect an agile and quick mind. I don't think she could do a boring interview if she tried. It probably would be the same with longer articles (hint, hint).\n\nMyron Beckenstein, University Park\n\nFilm critic Ann Hornaday wrote a compelling essay suggesting that Hollywood's expression of female power in terms of physical strength in such films as \"Resident Evil\" and \"Tomb Raider\" has run its course and urging filmmakers to \"discover a new kind of heroine, capable of evolving beyond muscles, machisma and mimicking the good guy with a gun\" [\"Hollywood is missing link in roles of heroines,\" Style, March 16]. Her essays about the film industry are always informative, timely and expertly written. I grew up idolizing New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael. Though their writing styles are different, I have become a big fan of Hornaday's essays and film reviews. I may not always agree with her take on a particular film, but I enjoy reading it anyway.\n\nBob Litman, Washington",

Their demands are straightforward and direct: Ban assault weapons and enact meaningful, constitutional gun-control measures.\n\nThe response of adults has been to deflect the argument and distract from the basic fact that gun violence is the product of too many guns that are too lethal and too readily available. President Trump has called for arming teachers, \"hardening\" schools and institutionalizing people with mental illness. Not only will these measures have little or no effect on gun violence, but they pose significant social hazards.\n\nIn 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 13 people at Columbine High School. In response, the federal government created the COPS in Schools grant program and invested more than $700 million to hire police to patrol schools. By 2014, there were more than 43,000 security officers in schools across the country.\n\nBut putting police in schools has not stopped school shootings. Since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2014, more than 400 people have been shot and 138 killed in 200 school shooting incidents, according to a New York Times report based on the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nWhat the increased police presence in schools has done, however, is criminalize young people of color. Though the Columbine shooting was in a predominantly white, wealthy Denver suburb, schools that are primarily black and brown, located in urban centers, are the most heavily patrolled. According to data compiled by the Education Week Research Center, a black student is more likely to attend a middle or high school patrolled by police than a white student is.\n\nThis disparity contributes to the criminalization of youths of color and is an essential component of the school-to-prison pipeline. Misconduct on school grounds is far more likely to be referred to police if an officer is on site, so adolescent misbehavior that should be addressed as a school disciplinary matter is increasingly becoming a function of law enforcement.\n\nIn 2012, the Justice Department found that one Mississippi school had African American students arrested for: \"dress code infractions such as wearing the wrong color socks or undershirt, or having a shirt untucked; tardies; flatulence in class; using vulgar language; yelling at teachers; and going to the bathroom or leaving the classroom without permission.\" Consent injunctions have since been entered in federal court against the school and the police to cease these practices as a violation of students' rights.\n\nEven though Justice Department guidelines say that school resource officers should not be involved in addressing noncriminal conduct, police involvement in ordinary classroom management has been reported across the country. In fall 2016, a black South Carolina high school student refused to surrender her cellphone to a teacher. The police officer stationed at the school was called, and the student was flipped from her desk and dragged across the floor. A cellphone video of the incident went viral, but the officer was not punished, nor was the policy changed. Such incidents have a devastating effect on the education of black and brown youths.\n\nBlaming mental illness for gun violence is equally misguided and grounded in the false and prejudicial assumption that people with mental illness are dangerous. We don't know the mental-health status of the Parkland shooter or whether it had anything to do with the shooting. We do know, however, that there are plenty of mass shooters who are sane. Dylann Roof shot to death nine people at a Bible study class at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015 out of racial hatred.\n\nThere's no reason to believe that mental illness is any more common in the United States than anywhere else in the world, but mass shootings are. The rate of death from gun violence in the United States is nearly five times the rate in Canada and more than 50 times the rate in Britain. The difference is the prevalence of guns.\n\nThe students in Florida have created a moment for change. They are correct: Guns are the problem. Until guns are addressed, mass shootings will occur. Making schools more of a police state and discriminating against people with mental illness won't stop them.\n\nRead more on this issue:\n\nMichael McBride: The young voices we aren't hearing in the gun-control debate\n\nVictor J. Dzau and Mark Rosenberg: Congress hasn't banned research on gun violence. It just won't fund it.\n\nPaul Taylor: Millennials are allergic to politics. But they could change anything.\n\nThe Post's View: The public has spoken on gun control. Don't wait for the White House.\n\nEugene Robinson: The issue is not mental health. The issue is the guns.",

                "body": "Regarding the March 15 front-page obituary for Stephen Hawking, \" He saw a universe without limits \":\n\nDespite his almost unbelievable conquest of his disabilities, Stephen Hawking should be remembered for at least four other reasons:\n\nFirst, and many times with collaborators, for his seminal work on black holes, entropy and the radiation emitted from the black holes. Second, for his copious and popular writings of both nonfiction and fiction, making physics more interesting and understandable to the general public. Third, his heated and unsuccessful arguments with other physicists that the Higgs boson, if it existed, could never be found. (Incidentally, he was proved wrong in 2012.) Fourth and finally, his vitriolic attacks on Israel, motivated by his mentor Noam Chomsky, that included support of boycott, divestment and sanctions and questioning the need for a Jewish state.\n\nWhich Hawking will be remembered? The one who overcame his disabilities, achieved and helped popularize science. Hopefully, his scientific career will be his heritage.\n\nNelson Marans, New York\n\nAlong with his many achievements, Stephen Hawking also contributed to the widespread misunderstanding of physics by insisting that space-time is four-dimensional.\n\nThe four-dimensional notation is just a convenient way of handling the mathematical relationship between space evolution and time evolution.\n\nIn fact, as I wrote in my book \"Fields of Color,\" \"one might almost say that physicists couldn't live without it. Nevertheless, space and time are fundamentally different, and I say shame on those who try to foist and force the four-dimensional concept onto the public as essential to the understanding of relativity theory.\"\n\nFurther, while \"searching for a way to reconcile Einstein's theory of relativity with quantum physics,\" Hawking (along with most physicists) ignored the papers in Physical Review by Nobel laureate Julian Schwinger that united them (\"The quantized gravitational field,\" 1963).\n\nThe neglect and ignorance of Schwinger's formulation of quantum field theory is why I wrote my book.\n\nRodney Brooks, Silver Spring",

                "body": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- From hog producers in Iowa to apple growers in Washington state and winemakers in California, farmers expressed deep disappointment Friday over being put in the middle of a potential trade war with China by the president many of them helped elect.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on products including Chinese steel, Beijing responded Friday with a threat to slap an equal 25 percent charge on U.S. products such as pork, and a 15 percent tariff on such things as wine, apples, ethanol and stainless-steel pipe.\n\nAmerican farmers \"should be not necessarily infuriated but close to it,\" said Wayne Humphreys, who farms corn and soybeans and raises hogs and cattle near Columbus Junction, Iowa. \"We've invested a lot of time, talent and treasure in developing markets around the world, and with the stroke of a pen, that investment has been jeopardized.\"\n\nOverall, the nation's farmers shipped nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. The American pork industry sent $1.1 billion in products, making China the No. 3 market for U.S. pork.\n\n\"No one wins in these tit-for-tat trade disputes, least of all the farmers and the consumers,\" said National Pork Producers Council President Jim Heimerl, a pig farmer from Johnstown, Ohio.\n\nThe U.S. has complained for years about China's sharp-elbowed trading practices, accusing it of pirating trade secrets, manipulating its currency, forcing foreign companies to hand over technology, and flooding world markets with cheap steel and aluminum that drive down prices and put U.S. manufacturers out of business.\n\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration declared the talk approach a failure, noting that the U.S. trade deficit in goods with China last year hit a record $375 billion. In a move to punish Beijing for stealing American technology, the White House set in motion tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports and restrictions on new Chinese investment in the U.S.\n\n\"We're doing something that will be the start of making trade with China more fair,\" Trump said. \"Our past presidents should never have allowed this to happen.\"\n\nThe stakes are high: China is America's largest trading partner. Last year, the two countries exchanged $636 billion worth of goods, and American companies such as Boeing and Caterpillar depend heavily on the Chinese market.\n\nFarmers voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016. But now many worry about economic blowback from his combative approach.\n\n\"When you start hurting this big segment of the economy from the people that gave him a lot of support in the election, I think it's going to hurt him. I really do,\" said Dave Struthers, who raises pigs, corn, soybeans and hay on a 1,100-acre family farm 30 miles northeast of Des Moines.\n\nHe said hog farmers are already struggling to make a profit, with prices below the break-even point, \"and any more pressure against that is just going to hurt us that much more.\"\n\n\"We're very concerned about what might happen as far as a tariff,\" he said.\n\nSome are holding out hope a trade war can be averted and the disputes can be resolved through negotiation.\n\n\"I think it's important to realize that China has said this, but it hasn't been implemented,\" said David Preisler, CEO of the Minnesota Pork Producers Association. \"Hopefully there's still time to sit down and have respective governments work through things.\"\n\nU.S. apple growers just got their foot in the door in China in 2015, and the country is now their 10th-largest market, with demand growing. They expressed frustration that their efforts could be damaged with tariffs.\n\n\"We are competing, and winning, with our exports to China growing nicely from zero to about 2.5 million boxes per year,\" said Jim Bair, CEO of the U.S. Apple Association, a trade group. He warned that U.S. apple growers are going to \"get hurt in a fight we didn't start and in which we have no interest.\"\n\nAt a time when U.S. wine exports have been slipping overall, there's been growth in exports to China, where a rapidly growing middle class is adopting many Western tastes.\n\nExports to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan grew 10 percent to $197 million in 2017, the San Francisco-based Wine Institute said. The value of U.S. wine exports to China alone increased 450 percent in the past decade, the industry group said.\n\n\"Chinese retaliation against U.S. wine would put our producers at a significant disadvantage in one of the most important markets in the world at a critical time,\" said Bobby Koch, CEO of the Wine Institute. He said the industry could end up losing market share for years to come.\n\nAbout 97 percent of U.S. wine exports come from California.\n\n_____\n\nKarnowski reported from Minneapolis.

                "title": "Opinion | Roy Moore-lite emerges in Mississippi",
                "body": "While almost nobody is looking, a perfect storm may be developing that could elect a Democrat in Mississippi to the United States Senate. Impossible, you say? Well, just as it was seemingly impossible for a Democrat to be elected in Alabama, something similar could be happening in the Magnolia State. Everyone should take note of Mississippi's upcoming special election.\n\nVying to fill Sen. Thad Cochran's (R-Miss.) long-held Senate seat in November is Mississippi Republican state Sen. Chris McDaniel. McDaniel is Roy Moore-lite. McDaniel has earned a reputation as someone who is every bit extreme, shallow, hypocritical and ignorant as Moore, but he has more energy and will be a better campaigner. Minus the child molestation aspect, McDaniel might actually be even worse than Moore. Specifically, when it comes to racism, McDaniel isn't using a dog whistle - he's clanging the dinner bell screaming for the dogs to come and get it. Following McDaniel's loss to the beloved incumbent Cochran in 2014, his campaign released a creepy 250-page \"Election Integrity Challenge\" binder that included complaints such as \"without the predominantly Democrat\" -- read: black -- \"voter participation in the Republican runoff, Cochran would have lost the runoff election by about 25,000.\" Seriously? Does McDaniel really believe that the votes of black Americans shouldn't be counted or somehow tainted the election because they voted against him? Every Democratic fantasy about GOP voter suppression comes to life in Chris McDaniel.\n\nAnyway, McDaniel's principal Republican primary opponent will be Mississippi Agriculture Commissioner Cindy Hyde-Smith. She is an authentic, conservative rancher who is comfortable with guns and religion, and she understands Mississippi's rural communities. She has the full backing of Mississippi's able and popular Gov. Phil Bryant. While Hyde-Smith isn't particularly well known, the fact is she is the only person in the race who can hold Cochran's Senate seat for Republicans. McDaniel, however, is the only person in the race who can lose it for Republicans.\n\nJust as was the case with Moore, many Republican donors and party leaders will not want to be associated with McDaniel's radioactive, race-baiting campaign. But people who know Mississippi think Hyde-Smith has a lot of potential. She might be the next Joni Ernst, a hyper-popular Republican senator from Iowa who came out of nowhere in 2014. The fact that Hyde-Smith is new gives her the potential to be exciting against a candidate like McDaniel, who is a throwback to an era that a lot of us from the South want to see abandoned.\n\nMississippi runs an open primary. That means Republicans and Democrats run on one ballot and the top two proceed to compete in a runoff general election. If the first-round primary election were to take place today, Hyde-Smith would probably finish third. She wouldn't make it to the general election. Instead, it would likely be a contest between Roy Moore-lite Chris McDaniel and former Mississippi Democratic congressman and agriculture secretary Mike Espy, who would probably finish first in the initial ballot. And like Doug Jones in Alabama, Espy could coalesce traditional Democratic Party voters with enough disgusted suburban Republicans to squeak out a victory. Presto! Just like that, Alabama and Mississippi have Democrat senators when no one thought it was possible.\n\nRepublicans appear to be on the brink of making the same mistakes they have in years past. Pitting far-right, radical and race-tinged candidates against more palatable Democrats is not a winning strategy. With the election of Doug Jones and other primaries still outstanding, we know how quickly an otherwise safe Republican seat can fall into the hands of Democrats. Mississippi could be next if Chris McDaniel manages to win the primary.",

But they wanted to get a good education for their children, a teenage boy who loved art and computers, and an 8-year-old girl who liked whatever her brother liked.\n\nThis month, just a few weeks after emerging from the South Korean government's resettlement program for North Korean refugees, the kids were preparing to enter new schools. Schools with books and electricity and teachers who didn't need to be bribed into giving lessons.\n\n\"I have so much to do!\" the housewife exclaimed a few days before school started, rushing around their small apartment and rifling through a drawer for newly begotten documents.\n\nSouth Koreans use a phrase literally meaning \"skirt wind\" to describe the whoosh of an education-mad mother zipping around. Even though she'd been in fast-paced capitalist South Korea for only a few weeks, the housewife had already become fully assimilated to these \"skirt wind\" southern ways.\n\nIt was a whole new world for them.\n\nI first met the family on the banks of the Mekong River last August, just 12 days after they had escaped from North Korea. The fisherman had been earning decent money, smuggling goods back and forth between China and North Korea, while moonlighting from his official job.\n\nBut they were disillusioned. They had hoped that Kim Jong Un, only 27 years old when he inherited the leadership of North Korea in 2011, would usher in a new era of freedom and prosperity.\n\nInstead, while they toiled, the state remained largely the same. They found ways to feed themselves, but the bad schools deeply troubled them. The teachers didn't show up and the school had almost no supplies. How were their kids going to lead a better life than theirs?\n\n[ Escaping North Korea: 'We had already decided to kill ourselves rather than be sent back' ]\n\nSo the family fled.\n\nAfter I last saw them, in the cells of a provincial police station in northern Thailand, they were transferred to an immigration detention center in Bangkok. There, they were processed relatively quickly -- just a few weeks in that jail -- and then they started the last leg of their journey.\n\nSince then, they've been through a lot of firsts: first passports, first airport, first plane.\n\nUpon landing at the space-age Incheon Airport outside of Seoul, they were taken to a debriefing center run by South Korea's intelligence agency to root out North Korean spies or ethnic Koreans from China trying to get the resettlement money offered to refugees. It's the same process that the 30,000-plus North Koreans who'd made the journey before them had been through.\n\nThey were held there for questioning for 70 days. What did you do in North Korea? Why did you come to South Korea? Can the Kim Jong Un regime survive? What do ordinary people think of him?\n\nWhen they weren't being questioned, they gorged on South Korean television. They had more than 70 channels -- unimaginable after a TV in North Korea that received only state propaganda.\n\nThe boy loved watching action movies and playing computer games. The girl said she loved watching animations -- but the word she used for animation was an old-fashioned one that hasn't been used in South Korea for decades. It's little things like this that highlight the cultural divide that opened up in the 70 years since one country was split in two.\n\nThe teenager, in his hoodie and jeans and constantly looking at his cellphone, could be any South Korean boy. But he admits he uses the Internet to look at satellite images of their home town. \"I miss my grandparents and my friends,\" he said. (Anna Fifield/The Washington Post)\n\nThen they moved to Hanawon, the resettlement center operated by South Korea's Ministry of Unification to help people from the North adjust to the high-tech, fast-paced South.\n\nThey learned about the Internet and mobile phones, how to open a bank account and how to use a debit card. They learned about job opportunities, about South Korean laws and about a foreign concept called gender equality.\n\nThey watched in amazement as, in January, the man who had helped get them from China to Thailand, Ji Seong-ho, was lauded by President Trump during his State of Union address in January.\n\nIn February, their reeducation was complete. They were installed in a small, two-bedroom apartment on the tired fringes of Seoul. Time to embark on their new lives as South Koreans.\n\n[Kim Jong Un's North Korea: Life Inside the Totalitarian State]\n\nWhen I visited them the first time in their new apartment, just a few days after their release from Hanawon, they were clearly struggling. They wrestled with the electronic lock on the front door, and their apartment was bare except for a small television sitting on an old plank of wood.\n\n\"They say that North Korea is a socialist country and South Korea is a capitalist country. But it doesn't feel capitalist here,\" the fisherman said, looking around his government-provided apartment. They asked The Washington Post to continue withholding their names to avoid endangering the family members they left behind.\n\nThe Unification Ministry provides $7,000 to a family of four to help them get settled, then $4,300 for the next three quarters. They also get a housing subsidy of $2,000 for the first year.\n\nTheir emergence into daily South Korean life came with more firsts: first driving lessons for the fisherman, first electric washing machine for the housewife. She didn't need to scrub their clothes by hand any more. And first day of school for the kids.\n\nDuring a second visit, just days before school started, the family was more settled. They'd brought an abandoned wardrobe they'd found on the street into their home, and had a computer for their kids.\n\nNow, unlike in North Korea, the teenager can get on the Internet. He likes looking for music and movies and games, but admits that he also looks at satellite images of their home town. \"I miss my grandparents and my friends,\" he said.\n\nThe fisherman had spectacles, the housewife had a Christian cross around her neck. The teenager was looking much more like a teenager. He was wearing jeans -- verboten in North Korea because they are the preferred pants of the American imperialists -- and a hoodie. And the girl was torn between playing with a jar of slime and cellphone games, so she tried to do both at the same time.\n\nThe housewife and her daughter in the kitchen area of their small apartment in South Korea. They are adjusting to life in the capitalist country, where even going to the supermarket is an adventure. (Anna Fifield/The Washington Post)\n\nThey still had telltale North Korean accents, but those would soon be gone, for the kids at least.\n\nThey were settling in.\n\n\"People are very kind here. When you go to a government office in North Korea, they say: 'What do you want?' Here, they say: 'How can I help you?' \" the fisherman said. \"And I won't get into trouble for saying anything. For example, if I complained about the president, I don't have to worry about getting arrested.\"\n\n[ Trump accepts invitation to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ]\n\nBut this next phase also came with more worries. Mainly, money worries.\n\nThey were discovering how expensive life in the South would be.\n\nThey'd spent almost $1,000 getting their son ready for school: books and uniforms and a bag and shoes. He was excited -- as much as a teenage boy trying to play it cool could be -- about attending his new school and learning new things. He'd already gone to look around and saw that the school was so much bigger and more modern than the one he attended in North Korea.\n\n\"I'm a little bit worried about settling into this new school system,\" he said. \"But we're slowly getting used to things.\"\n\nHis sister was too busy playing with the cellphone to answer a reporter's question about whether she was looking forward to her new school. \"Huh?\" she said, and returned her eyes to the screen.\n\n[ North Korean women have plenty of reason to say 'Me Too' -- but no hope of a reckoning ]\n\nThey said they still owe $30,000 to the brokers who helped the family escape from North Korea into China, and those brokers were very insistent about being paid. The cost of defecting has risen sharply since Kim Jong Un took over six years ago, cracking down on the borders and making it more perilous and expensive to bribe one's way out.\n\nNow the fisherman is thinking about how to make a living here. He wants to get a job as a cleaner or as an electrician. Being an electrician would pay more over the years, but he'd have to do six months' training for that. If, at the age of 46, he becomes a night cleaner in a commercial building, he can start earning money right away.\n\n\"Then I can stay in that job until I retire,\" he said. \"I know it's going to be hard work and dirty, but what else can I do at my age?\"\n\nSince they emerged from Hanawon, their television and phone screens have been filled with news about their home country: the Olympics and the Kim family charm offensive, the planned summit between Kim and President Trump.\n\nThey were intrigued that so many North Koreans, almost 500 in total, had been allowed to attend the Olympic Games in South Korea last month, and wondered if they were talking about what they'd seen. \"Word of mouth is a very powerful thing in North Korea,\" the fisherman said.\n\nNow that they've experienced life on the outside, with all its adventures and upheavals, they're hoping others like them can make the same journey.\n\n\"I hope that Kim Jong Un quits his job and North Korea and South Korea are united,\" the housewife said, \"and that North Korea will become like South Korea and that everyone can do as they wish.\"\n\nAnd with that, she swished out the door. School errands beckoned.\n\nRead more:\n\nKim Jong Un wants to be seen as Donald Trump's equal.

The U.N. official confirmed the decision not to send an election mission to Venezuela, without giving reasons behind the move.\n\n\"The U.N. is not providing any electoral assistance to Venezuela,\" the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nOil-rich Venezuela has been sinking deeper into a political and economic crisis after global crude prices fell and the country's state-run oil production has been spiraling downward due to mismanagement under nearly two decades of socialist rule.\n\nThe hand-picked successor to the late-President Hugo Chavez, Maduro is seeking a second six-year term.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will reject the outcome of the election it says won't be free or fair, and several Latin American leaders have pressured Maduro's government to return to what they consider democratic rule.\n\nOfficials loyal to Maduro have banned the largest opposition parties from participating and the most popular opposition candidates are imprisoned or in exile.\n\nU.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told The Associated Press earlier Friday that a letter was sent to Venezuelan authorities about their request. He would not disclose the contents.\n\nA campaign representative for Falcon said the independent candidate is considering his next move. Falcon, a former governor, had demanded the U.N.'s participation as a condition for his own candidacy.\n\n\"The scenario has changed,\" the Falcon representative told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity.

                "title": "Opinion | Unsafe Maryland",
                "body": "David Alpert is president and founder of Greater Greater Washington.\n\nCities and counties across the nation have been pledging to a concept called \"Vision Zero,\" the idea that not a single person ought to die in crashes on our roadways. Locally, the District, Alexandria and Montgomery County each have Vision Zero programs. These programs are in the early stages, but D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) recently announced a plan to fix 36 intersections, including ones with dangerous \"double turn\" lanes.\n\nMeanwhile, many state transportation departments, including Maryland's, continue to pay lip service to making roads safe. A December analysis by the University of Maryland's Capital News Service brought the failings of the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) into sharp focus.\n\nSean Emerson, a member of the Action Committee for Transit and a legislative aide to state Del. Marc A. Korman (D-Montgomery), said the SHA is unwilling to make safety changes if they would delay drivers by even 10 to 15 seconds. SHA spokesman Charlie Gischlar blamed distracted drivers or pedestrians. He told Capital News Service reporters Lindsay Huth, Angela Roberts and Jake Gluck, \"We say that the majority of pedestrian crashes are, sadly, on the part of highway user (driver or pedestrian) behavior.\"\n\nThat statement should shock all of us. The SHA's mission statement begins: \"Provide a safe, well-maintained, reliable highway system.\" Safety is the first of the three goals listed. Yet when asked why the state's highway system leads to people dying, the agency spokesman in effect, is saying, \"it's the dead people's fault, not ours.\"\n\nThere are two major problems with this. First, other experts seem to disagree. Montgomery County data analyst Wade Holland told the CNS reporters that he doesn't see an \"epidemic of pedestrians being struck due to cellphone use\" in the county's data. And Gischlar told them he wasn't basing his victim-blaming on data, just anecdotal experience. That's a terrible and often quite misleading way to make decisions.\n\nSecond, we shouldn't design systems in which common -- but perhaps unsafe -- behaviors lead to death. We could simply not insulate the electric cords to our lamps, say. If you were to touch it and get electrocuted, well, we could just say \"the majority of shock injuries are, sadly, on the part of lamp user (adult or child) behavior.\"\n\nWe could have a world in which 40,000 Americans die in lamp \"accidents\" a year, as that number did in motor-vehicle crashes in 2016. The actual number of annual fatal electrocutions involving all consumer electrical appliances? About 60. Thanks, wire insulation, electrical building codes and other safety systems! Good thing the SHA isn't in charge there!\n\nTraffic engineering may be the only technical profession where a large number of practitioners still shrug at deaths that happen on their watch. By comparison, airplane crashes are scrutinized in great detail, and airlines are often required to make changes to procedures or aircraft. That's why there hasn't been a single death on a commercial passenger flight in the United States since 2013 and none on a flight operated by a U.S. airline since 2009. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has rightly endured intense federal and local scrutiny for the death of Carol Glover on a smoke-filled train in 2015. We expect better. Why not for our roads?\n\nEven when the SHA does take action, it makes a place harder to walk. Where the state has a high-speed highway-like road next to places people shop, eat, live and walk, it too often responds to crashes by trying to keep the people away so the cars can go faster.\n\nIn College Park, the SHA put a fence in the median of Route 1 to stop people from crossing. A nearly 2-mile-long fence is planned for Coastal Highway in Ocean City. People drive too fast, and others try to walk across the road to get to the beach. The SHA's solution: stop people from crossing the road, even though the distance between intersections with traffic lights can be as much as a half a mile.\n\nAs Dan Malouff put it on Twitter, \"This is not how you make streets safe for pedestrians. This is how you tell pedestrians they should drive.\" And ironically, making people drive can make roads less safe, since more cars can mean more crashes.\n\nBack in our region, one of the biggest problem with SHA roads, and fences, is that bus stops are usually right on major state highways, often with little or no space for the bus to stop. They often are not even at the intersection. For instance, Ben Ross observed that it took more than eight minutes to legally cross the street when he got off at the bus stop at Route 355 and Shady Grove Road in Montgomery County. People getting off the bus have to choose between long walks and interminable waits to cross or trying their luck at a game of Frogger.\n\nThe SHA doesn't need to stay in the Stone Age, but it should admit it has a speeding problem. There's no sign of that so far: When denying a public records request for information about audits it had conducted at crash sites, its lawyers said disclosure was \"contrary to the public interest\" because \"it could be used to attempt to discover MDOT SHA's thought process regarding decisions affecting highway safety.\" The horror.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan (R) and the state legislature should demand better. The only reasonable number of deaths on Maryland state roads is zero.\n\nRead more about this issue:\n\nReid Wilson: West Virginia is the best state in America for improving traffic safety\n\nThe Post's View: More people are dying on the road.

It is being amended to address the city's current growth trajectory. The D.C. Office of Planning projects 1 million residents by 2045.\n\nHousing advocates are pushing back at Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's attempt to use the plan as a vehicle for accelerating development. The plan blames displacement of longtime residents on \"rising demand that has not been met with a proportional increase in supply,\" but this would be true only if all the new condominiums being planned were meant for low-income people. A more fundamental problem is the plan's explanation for why the city's black population has declined drastically in recent years: \"Many blacks left the city for the suburbs, or migrated to other parts of the country because of family ties, increased opportunities and lower cost of living.\"\n\nI am a public historian of race and housing in the District, one of several D.C.-focused scholars alarmed at the Office of Planning's claim that African Americans are leaving the city by choice. Some of us are native Washingtonians or have lived here for decades, and we care deeply about the city and its future. The District's black population declined by more than 200,000 between 1970 and 2010. While it is true that many middle-class people have voluntarily moved out of the city, this is not what explains our city's profound racial transformation. In fact, as the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute has reported, we lost 28,000 black residents primarily from low-income neighborhoods in the 1990s alone.\n\nThe city's planning goals of attracting real estate investment and higher-income residents to the District have not accounted for who would be forced to leave. As recently reported by a Georgetown University study overseen by the first chair of D.C.'s Commission on African American Affairs, gentrification -- which is barely mentioned in the amended Comprehensive Plan -- \"leads to displacement.\" The theory that poor residents benefit from the same economic investments that have brought more than 150,000 new residents since 2006, says the report, \"stems from a lack of knowledge\" about where people are moving and why. Ironically, Bowser established the commission in response to the alarming decline of black residents, but her administration doesn't seem to care anymore about what happened to them.\n\nThese issues are not new. In the 1950s, thousands of buildings were razed in Southwest for urban renewal with the promise that displaced residents would be rehoused in the same area. But only a tiny number of affordable units were developed, and at least 12,000 black residents were required to move permanently. Large black communities were also displaced by revitalization in Georgetown, development in Foggy Bottom and, later, by condominium conversions across the city, especially around Adams Morgan. By 1962, 5,000 families were already wait-listed for public housing, 94 percent of them black. In 2013, the waiting list closed after reaching more than 70,000 names , yet public housing continues to be razed in favor of mixed-income developments with far less capacity for housing low-income people or families.\n\nHere is what else we know, based on research by the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute and others:\n\nThe income of the typical black D.C. household has not grown since 2007, and the gulf between black and white residents is growing. The poverty rate for black residents rose between 2007 and 2016 to 28 percent . Income inequality is higher in the District than in any of the 50 states .\n\nThe virtual disappearance of low-cost housing in the District means that most extremely low-income residents are forced to spend the majority of their income on rent. As of December 2016, some 26,000 households were both extremely low income and spending more than half their income on rent; 91 percent of these residents were black.\n\nThe displacement and destabilization inherent in the District's economic renaissance have also eroded black family and social networks, which are especially important to people who are economically vulnerable. Black-owned retail and food outlets have been replaced by high-end development and businesses where many longtime black residents don't feel welcome.\n\nIt is essential that our city's plan for the future recognize the true impact of development on our city. Ignoring this allows the mayor to pretend that accelerating new development will address our housing crisis. As history shows, this will only make things worse for those already struggling to remain here.\n\nRead more about this issue:\n\nDia Michels: Vacation rentals are not the cause of D.C.'s affordable housing shortage\n\nThe Post's View: Can the government push a private company to serve the public good?\n\nDavid Alpert: We need to make room for everyone in D.C.\n\nMichael Downey: A financing model for affordable and supportive housing in D.C.",

Lamar is a D.C. tour guide.\n\nThe tragic death this month of Hunter Brown, a 14-year-old on a school trip from North Carolina, is a sobering reminder that the safety of children must always be the top priority.\n\nI began guiding here in 2010. Not long after, I was involved in a near miss involving a student on a field trip. That forever changed how I do my job.\n\nGroups of kids, mostly eighth-graders, but some younger and some older, are mesmerized as they visit the many sites that make our city so splendid. At the same time, they are caught up in the drama of travel away from home and new social interactions, and they often are dealing with the human effects of excitement, hunger and fatigue, familiar to any seasoned traveler. That combination can make for some (especially) erratic behavior.\n\nA professional tour director once reminded a group of guides about to start a three-day gig with eighth-graders: \"Remember, they aren't small adults, they are big children.\"\n\nWisdom for the ages.\n\nAbout my near-miss: It is a strange fact that the most exhausted and fatigued kids, returning from a walk, perhaps around the Tidal Basin, will suddenly experience an explosive burst of enthusiasm when they spot the bus they are riding.\n\nI was with such a group when we emerged from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial on West Basin Drive at about 11 in the morning. Our bus was parked on Ohio Drive, eastbound, which meant we had to cross the street to board it.\n\nAs we were about 150 feet from the bus, a young girl sprinted by me and ran onto Ohio Drive, where a car headed westbound, traveling 35 or 40 miles per hour, missed her by inches.\n\nShe would surely have been killed if struck; the bus driver also witnessed how close it was, and we shook our heads the rest of the day.\n\nI decided then and there I wasn't going through that again.\n\nNow, the first time I get off the bus with a group, we go over the safety rules: No one is in front of me at any time, we use crosswalks and cross only with the light, and we walk on the right.\n\nThen, I enforce those rules like the curmudgeon I can be. Walter Matthau on a city stroll.\n\nI know they get it when they start to test me by walking beside me, exactly matching my step. We get a good laugh, but we also know the deal: I lead, they follow.\n\nThe closer we get to the bus, the slower I walk to calm the savage mob.\n\nIn Hunter's case, the kids were actually at the bus parking area, about as dangerous a place as you will encounter -- crowds, poor lighting and vehicles coming and going.\n\nIn that environment, calm and control become essential to safety.\n\nOur kids need to experience the grandeur of Washington firsthand. It is our collective responsibility to make it as safe as possible, even when it makes no sense to them.\n\nRead more about this issue:\n\nReid Wilson: West Virginia is the best state in America for improving traffic safety\n\nThe Post's View: More people are dying on the road.

Also, the indictment says operators were aware of at least 13 other injuries -- including two concussions -- on the ride and that the specific raft Caleb was on went abnormally fast and would go airborne more frequently than other rafts.\n\nA Schlitterbahn spokeswoman has not responded to requests for comments on the company's indictment.\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nA grand jury has indicted a corporation for involuntary manslaughter after a 10-year-old boy died on a giant waterslide at one of the company's water parks in Kansas.\n\nKansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt announced Friday that Schlitterbahn Waterpark of Kansas City, Kansas, was indicted along with a former executive in the August 2016 death of Caleb Schwab, who was decapitated on the 17-story \"Verruckt\" waterslide.\n\nSchmidt said the indictments also involve injuries suffered by 13 other people, including four children, who rode on the slide. The executive, Tyler Miles, and Schlitterbahn also face charges of interference with law enforcement.\n\nA spokeswoman for Schlitterbahn didn't immediately return a call for comment.\n\n_____\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nA former executive for Schlitterbahn pleaded not guilty Friday to involuntary manslaughter in the death of a 10-year-old boy who was decapitated on a waterslide at the Kansas water park.\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Tyler Austin Milesa, former operations director for the company, was charged Friday in the August 2016 death of Caleb Schwab at the Schlitterbahn water park in Kansas City, Kansas.\n\nMiles is the only person criminally charged so far in the boy's death, which occurred when the raft he was on hit a pole and netting on the 17-story Verruckt waterslide. Miles also faces 19 other charges.\n\nSchlitterbahn officials defended Miles after the charges were filed, saying they stood by him and were shocked by the allegations against him.\n\n_____\n\n2 p.m.\n\nA former executive with the Kansas water park where a 10-year-old boy died on a giant waterslide has been charged with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nTyler Austin Miles, who was an operations director for Schlitterbahn, was booked into the Wyandotte County jail Friday and is being held on $50,000 bond.\n\nCaleb Schwab died in August 2016 on the 17-story Verruckt water slide at the park in western Kansas City, Kansas. An autopsy revealed the boy was decapitated when the raft that he and two women were on went airborne. It hit a pole that supported nets that were designed to keep riders from flying off the ride.\n\nWinter Prospapio, a spokeswoman for Schlitterbahn, said the company was \"deeply disappointed\" that someone was charged for the \"terrible accident.\" She said Schlitterbahn stood by Miles, who left the company for another job in September.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nTeachers, social workers and other public servants at risk of missing out on federal student loan forgiveness because they enrolled in the wrong repayment plan now have a shot at debt relief under the spending bill signed into law Friday.\n\n[ Congress rejects much of Betsy DeVos's agenda in spending bill ]\n\nThe sweeping $1.3 trillion bill includes a measure that temporarily expands Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program that cancels federal student debt after 10 years of on-time payments for people who take jobs in the public sector.\n\nThe program requires borrowers to be enrolled in specific repayment plans, primarily those that cap monthly loan payments to a percentage of a borrower's income. But some people have complained about loan servicing companies failing to provide consistent and clear guidance, leading them to believe they were making qualifying payments when they were not.\n\nNow, those borrowers could apply to have their ineligible payments counted toward loan forgiveness. But there's a twist: Their most recent monthly payment and the one made a year before applying for forgiveness must be as much as they would have paid in a correct plan.\n\nCongress has created a $350 million fund to cover the cost of canceling more loans, but once the money runs out, so will the offer. Forgiveness under this measure is being offered on a first-come, first-served basis. The U.S. Department of Education must reach out to borrowers and develop a simple way for them to apply, according to the budget bill.\n\nThe measure is based on a bill introduced by Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) in November that would have provided relief to all borrowers who qualified. Reps. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), John Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) sponsored the companion legislation in the House. Their measure failed to advance earlier, but was revived during budget negotiations.\n\n\"Americans who honorably serve our communities have earned much-deserved relief from crushing student loan debt in return for their time and commitment,\" Kaine said in a statement. \"But unfortunately because of confusion around a provision in the program, we were at risk of breaking that promise to Virginia teachers, social workers, nurses and military service members.\"\n\n[ Watchdog agency blasts government contractor for mishandling student loan forgiveness program ]\n\nProblems in the loan forgiveness program were documented in a scathing report released in June by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The watchdog agency said flawed payment processing, botched paperwork and inaccurate information from FedLoan Servicing, the company handling the program for the government, had derailed hundreds of public-sector workers from receiving loan forgiveness.\n\nBorrowers told the consumer bureau they were placed in ineligible payment plans even after identifying themselves as public servants, a misstep that delayed their ability to obtain loan forgiveness. Others said they were never told that payments made before enrolling in a qualifying repayment plan would not count toward forgiveness. In some instances, borrowers said the servicing company provided an inaccurate count of their qualified payments and gave them a hard time as they fought to have the error corrected.\n\nThe administration of President George W. Bush introduced the loan forgiveness program in 2007 to encourage college graduates to pursue careers as teachers, social workers, public defenders or rural doctors -- public service fields that traditionally pay low wages.\n\nThe program has been criticized as a backdoor subsidy for graduate school. It has also received flak for helping doctors and lawyers who have the earning potential to repay their student loans. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating it, as have House Republicans in their higher education bill.\n\n\"Congress created this program so bright, talented people could use their college education for public service,\" Whitehouse said in a statement. \"There's more to do, but I'm proud that a version of our legislation will help public servants continue their important work.\"",

Other participating youth groups represent such states as Colorado, Oregon, Georgia and Arizona.\n\nThe visual idea for the protest came from the film \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" starring the Oscar-winning Frances McDormand as a mother seeking justice after her child was slain.\n\nTwenty-one cartoonists -- some of them nationally syndicated and all of them preferring to remain anonymous -- funded the roving billboard campaign, which aims to raise awareness and show solidarity with marching students. The campaign is part of the wave of growing protest since the Parkland, Fla., school shooting in February left 17 dead.\n\n\"Our mission was to pretty much let everyone know that enough was enough!\" says Hobbs, who was assisted by high-schoolers Madie Lake, Kelly Choi and Marcel McClinton. \"No more kids need to live in fear of stepping out of their house because they might be shot.\"\n\n\"Gun violence kills 32 people a day.
