                "body": "He's seen as a policy moderate and an ally of Chairman Powell Search committee this month was vetting a 'handful' of people\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams is the leading candidate to replace William Dudley as head of the New York Fed, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nWilliams, 55, has led the Fed's 12th district bank since 2011, when he took the reins from Janet Yellen, who ultimately went on to become Fed chair before stepping down Feb. 3 after four years at the helm. He's a career Fed policy maker and economist, though he's also lectured at Stanford University and served as a senior economist on President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nDudley, 65, has said he plans to step down by mid-year. The New York Fed presidency, which has a permanent vote on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, is considered one of the three most powerful positions in the U.S. central bank because of its close oversight of and interaction with financial markets and Wall Street firms.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal sourced its report on Saturday to people familiar with the matter and gave no further details. A spokesman for the New York Fed declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the Fed Board in Washington.\n\nEarlier this month, New York Fed directors said they had narrowed their search for the bank's next president to a \"handful of final candidates,\" without naming any of those still in the running or the timetable for announcing their selection.\n\nWhile his resume includes many of the qualifications for the job, Williams' possible shift to New York might draw criticism about the lack of gender and racial diversity in the upper ranks of the Fed.\n\nMembers of the Fed's Washington-based board of governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The 12 regional bank chiefs are chosen by non-banking directors of their respective boards and then are subject to approval by Fed governors.\n\nGenerally considered a moderate on monetary policy, Williams has indicated support for three or four rate hikes this year. He has been urging his colleagues and his profession to start rethinking the Fed's inflation target in an era of historically low interest rates, and has spoken positively about price-level targeting -- a policy where the central bank aims to achieve an inflation rate on average over time, tolerating equal overshoots and undershoots.\n\nWilliams, together with Fed Board economist Thomas Laubach, has written a series of studies on the neutral interest rate -- which he refers to, often and affectionately, as r-star. His recent research has suggested that across advanced economies, the level of central bank interest rates that neither stoke nor slow growth have fallen, leaving monetary authorities less crisis-fighting ammunition.\n\nWilliams has a good working relationship with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whom President Donald Trump nominated to replace Yellen. Williams is also known as a colorful character who delivers speeches containing Green Day lyrics and talks often about his video game habit.",

An arrest warrant has been issued for Puigdemont, whose whereabouts are unknown.\n\nA Spanish Supreme Court judge on Friday filed preliminary charges against 13 Catalan separatist leaders, including Puigdemont, for their part in the push to break away from Spain last year. Pablo Llarena said the separatist leadership should be charged with rebellion for holding an illegal referendum and declaring independence from the state.\n\nPuigdemont fled to Brussels immediately after that declaration in October and has remained in self-imposed exile ever since.",

                "body": "President Donald Trump is preparing to expel dozens of Russian diplomats from the U.S. in response to the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy in the U.K., two people familiar with the matter said Saturday.\n\nTrump agreed with the recommendation of advisers and the expulsions are likely to be announced on Monday, the people said, though they cautioned that Trump's decision may not be final. Trump is prepared to act but wants to be sure European allies will take similar steps against Russia before doing so, aides said.\n\nThe advisers reached recommendations for a U.S. response to the U.K. attack at a National Security Council meeting on Wednesday and honed the proposals on Friday. Trump discussed the issue Friday with U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, outgoing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and others, two people said.\n\nAll of the people familiar with the discussions asked not to be identified. White House spokespeople declined to comment.\n\nA battle within the White House over how to best address the provocations of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been intensifying. The internal divisions flared this week after Trump congratulated Putin on his recent re-election without first reviewing written guidance that he not do so, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nTrump has meanwhile reshaped his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced he would replace McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations who is a staunch conservative and military hawk. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had also adopted a more confrontational stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.\n\nCongress has pressured Trump to get tougher on Putin and passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive U.S. measures imposed after Russia's incursion into Ukraine. Substantively, Washington's policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump's critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin's provocations.\n\nTrump has agreed to adopt increasingly tough policy stances on Russia. But the president places a priority on maintaining a personal relationship with the Russian president, won't publicly attack him, and doesn't see any benefit to the U.S. in confronting Putin in one-on-one encounters, one administration official said Thursday.\n\nTrump defended his call with Putin on Twitter Wednesday, dismissing those who \"wanted me to excoriate him.\"\n\n\"They are wrong!\" Trump wrote. \"Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May earlier this month condemned Russia for the nerve agent attack that critically injured the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia. A British police officer was also hospitalized. May ordered 23 Russians -- who she said were undeclared spies -- to leave Britain in retaliation. She has sought the cooperation of other countries in her campaign to punish Moscow.\n\nHeather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said on Friday night that \"the United States is considering a range of options to respond to Russia's outrageous actions in the U.K., both to demonstrate our solidarity with our ally and to hold Russia accountable for its clear breach of international norms and agreements.\"\n\nShe added that the State Department \"doesn't have any actions to announce today.\"\n\nRegardless of Trump's rhetoric, his administration sees the Kremlin as a threat.\n\nA national defense strategy assembled by the Pentagon under Mattis and publicly summarized in January described China and Russia as the top global adversaries of the U.S. Earlier this month, the administration slapped financial sanctions against a St. Petersburg-based internet \"troll farm\" and its alleged owner -- a close Putin ally -- whom Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted over a covert social media campaign to influence the 2016 election.",

                "title": "Why Democrats Are Bullish on Governor's Races, Too",
                "body": "The fight for the House is getting all the headlines, but wins at the state level may be more consequential.\n\nThe media is focused on the Democrats' bright prospects for winning control of the House this November. But the gains they expect to make in governor's races may be more important to the party's long-term future.\n\nOf 36 gubernatorial seats up for grabs this year, 26 are held by Republicans. The Democrats' top targets are Ohio, Florida and Michigan, where they have been out of power for years. If they succeed, the party stands to gain strength on three critically important fronts:\n\n\"The governor's races this year are even more important than Congress,\" says Terry McAuliffe, who just stepped down as Virginia governor and is a former party chairman. Republicans remember the impact of their 2010 sweep. They devoted huge resources to state races, then dominated redistricting the next year. The result: a policy and political counterweight to a Democratic White House.\n\nThe fruits of state battles are already becoming clear. The GOP's gerrymandering in Pennsylvania in 2011 was overturned this year, thanks in part to help of a Democratic governor who took office in 2015. The result? Three to five House seats this fall, Democrats say.\n\nBut they still are suffering from partisan lines in Ohio, Michigan and Florida. All three are purple; only a third of their combined 57 members of the House are Democrats.\n\nIn recent months, in part reflecting a national tide, Democrats have become more optimistic about contests in Ohio and Michigan.\n\nRichard Cordray, who clashed with Trump as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is the party's preferred candidate in Ohio. He should be a strong general election candidate if he avoids getting beat up in the primary by left wing provocateur Dennis Kucinich, the former congressman. That probably would set up a rematch with Attorney General Mike DeWine, who narrowly won in 2010, in a climate friendlier to Republicans.\n\nIn Michigan, the political and labor union establishment has gotten behind Gretchen Whitmer, a former state legislative leader, one of many women this year riding the energy of the MeToo movement. She would be a slight favorite in a November race against the state's Republican attorney general.\n\nIn Florida, where the primary isn't until August, the contests in both parties are unsettled. Still, Democrats say Trump has energized important elements of their voters, younger women and Latinos.\n\nRepublicans seem certain to hold Texas and Democrats New York and California. After this week's primary, Democrats expect to flip Illinois.\n\nGovernors aren't as directly affected by the Trump factor as are members of Congress, but the gathering blue wave represents a major force nevertheless. Two Republican governors in Democratic states, Charlie Baker in Massachusetts and Larry Hogan in Maryland, having distanced themselves from Trump are in good shape.\n\nBoth sides are looking for a surprise. Republicans think they may turn Minnesota if former Governor Tim Pawlenty, after more than five years as a Washington lobbyist, returns. Democrats are also bullish on finally unseating Wisconsin's Gov. Scott Walker, who has been dashing to the political center.\n\nOverall, the opportunities for Democratic pickups range from from Nevada and New Mexico in the West to Iowa in the Midwest to Maine on the East Coast. That's why Terry McAuliffe is upbeat: \"The future of the Democratic Party will be decided in state capitals and it's looking very good.\"",

The failure to hold a vote brings the prospect of new elections closer as a separatist movement riven by its own internal divisions struggles to find a candidate to be regional president.\n\nTurull had failed in a first bid to become president in a vote on Thursday when he was unable to persuade the radical pro-separatist party CUP to back his candidacy.\n\nPuigdemont, who is in Finland, won't be arrested while visiting the country, Interior Minister Kai Mykkanen told Finnish media outlet Verkkouutiset.

                "body": "In the China-U.S. spat, the timing and the implementation make all the difference.\n\nThe flashy term \"trade war\" is being thrown around with abandon, but thankfully for now it's actually more of a frontier skirmish.\n\nWhile announcements fly back and forth between Washington and Beijing, what's been said -- and not said -- offers opportunities to de-escalate.\n\nConsider the Trump administration's announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The exemptions granted are significant: Mexico, Canada, the EU, Australia, Brazil and no doubt more to come. They now look more like they are aimed at China, but the process allowed for lots of room to maneuver.\n\nThe same anti-climax may follow the White House's announcement this week of tariffs against imports from China (and Beijing's proposal to levy tariffs on certain items from the U.S.).\n\nIn short, everybody calm down and take a cool shower.\n\nFirst: A fact sheet from the U.S. trade representative shows the measures are far from immediate. USTR has 15 days to publish a proposed list of products to be subject to the tariffs. There is then a 30-day period of public comment on the proposals. The trade representative then reviews the comments and takes some time to conclude matters.\n\nSecond: The White House has called for a 25 percent tariff on certain Chinese imports. Um ... 25 percent of what, exactly? Watch that space.\n\nLet's assume the timing and the implementation details are, like everything in Washington, subject to lobbying.\n\nOne group that has surely swung into action is multinational companies, many of them U.S.-based. A lot of what the U.S. buys \"from China\" does not originate there, but is assembled there from components made in other places. Deutsche Bank AG economists estimate that well over a third of American imports from China are produced in third countries. Can you think of any multinational corporations that might start to grumble? Apple Inc., for example, is based in Cupertino, California. The pieces that come together as an iPhone, though, tread a complex path to the door of your local Apple store.\n\nTwo other things Trump announced will take time. The Treasury Department has two months to piece together a response to China's investment practices in sensitive technology. Don't expect big changes from this review. Even under existing rules, does any Chinese company now seriously think it has a chance to buy an American tech firm?\n\nAnd I love this: The U.S. will object to China's technology licensing rules through the World Trade Organization (another long process). Isn't the WTO up there with the press as a globalist enemy of the American people? As Trump might tweet: Interesting!\n\nChina's much-ballyhooed \"hit back\" proposal to tax imports from the U.S. is only in response to the earlier Trump tariffs on steel and aluminum. Given the timing, it would be easy to conflate it all, but China was careful. The \"hit back\" over steel and aluminum could be read as a signal along the lines of: We are watching and waiting and showing we won't be pushed around, but we aren't going to get into some self-harming spat unless we really, really have to.\n\nNone of this is to say that China deserves praise for trade practices -- far from it -- or that the U.S. should just sit on its hands. For both sides, there's plenty of room to maneuver here and still claim victory.",

                "body": "Meituan's considering a listing in Hong Kong and China as well\n\nMeituan Dianping, the Chinese food reviews and delivery giant backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., has begun discussions on a Hong Kong initial public offering as soon as this year, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe company is weighing a valuation of at least $60 billion and is considering a listing in China as well if policy conditions allow, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Discussions however are at a preliminary stage and deal details could change, they added. Meituan declined to comment.\n\nMeituan, the world's fourth most valuable startup with a latest valuation of $30 billion, is emblematic of a generation of up-and-comers that have emerged to challenge the dominance of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. It provides on-demand and local services akin to a mash-up of Groupon, Yelp and Deliveroo, and is moving into new areas such as ride-sharing and travel.\n\nFormed by the merger of Meituan and Dianping, it's grown into a super-app hawking everything from group-buying deals and ride hailing to travel packages and payments. With a few taps to navigate its smartphone apps, Chinese customers can order up hot meals, groceries, massages, haircuts and manicures at home or in the office. Founded in 2010 by Wang Xing as a Groupon-alike, it handled $57 billion of transactions last year between about 320 million active buyers -- about the size of the American population --- and more than four million merchants.\n\nIf it gets the desired valuation, it could rival Uber Technologies Inc. as the world's largest startup and represent a doubling in size. The company however faces formidable rivals in each of its key businesses. It's competing with entities backed by Alibaba in food delivery, with Didi Chuxing in ride hailing, and even with its own backer Tencent in payments. Investors also question whether it can sustain growth without a heavy cash burn.\n\n\"Meituan attracts huge traffic volume. It's adding many new services and showing that it can monetize the business,\" said Li Yujie, an analyst with RHB Research Institute Sdn in Hong Kong. \"As a platform business, it's justified that the company is seeking this kind of valuation, and investors are still willing to give high-traffic platforms a premium.\"\n\nRead more: Tencent Backed Super-App Emerges to Rival its Own WeChat\n\nShares in Tencent closed 4.4 percent lower after coming off a much deeper trough. Meituan's other backers include Booking Holdings Inc., Sequoia Capital, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Trustbridge Partners, Tiger Global Management, Coatue Management and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC.\n\nThose investors and more have handed Meituan $7.3 billion in funding over the past two years. It's now also begun promoting the use of its own digital wallet on its app: it handles about a fifth of overall transactions on its platforms. Tencent accounts for about 60 percent while Ant Financial's Alipay and others contribute about 20 percent.",

                "title": "ECB Acts to Ensure Glitch-Free Journey to Smooth QE Conclusion",
                "body": "Bundesbank request to broaden asset pool highlights scarcity\n\nThe European Central Bank is making sure its bond-buying program doesn't run into any problems in Germany in the final stretch.\n\nSix months before purchases are currently set to expire, the ECB added seven German regional development agencies to the list of institutions whose debt is eligible for quantitative easing. The expansion was done at the request of the Bundesbank, which under rules linking QE to the size of national economies is responsible for the largest share of the euro area's purchases.\n\nThe decision suggests that while ECB President Mario Draghi repeatedly says QE isn't running into shortages, there may well be risks unless tweaks are made. Monetary officials are scouring the market for 30 billion euros ($37 billion) a month under the program -- a core plank of stimulus measures to revive inflation -- and holdings will top more than 2.5 trillion euros by September. With price pressures still weak, the scheme might yet be extended again.\n\n\"The ECB can always play with numbers and parameters to make QE last a little longer,\" said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva. \"What they did, can at least at the margin help them to postpone the binding constraints -- the day when they see those constraints kicking in.\"\n\nOne of those limitations is a self-imposed commitment to hold less than 33 percent of a single country's outstanding debt. That's primarily aimed at shielding the ECB from accusations it's financing governments, but also at maintaining a functioning market for QE-eligible securities.\n\nGermany's economic size, the government's commitment to not issue new debt and the role of its bond-market as a haven for banks seeking quality assets makes the country a particular concern. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said last month that less than 10 percent of the outstanding stock of German bunds might currently be in the hands of private investors.\n\nRising bond prices in the past two months have pushed yields on 5-year German debt back below zero. The 10-year has dropped to around 0.5 percent from 0.8 percent over the same period.\n\nAnother sign that the Bundesbank is operating in a tight market comes from the failure of so-called reverse auctions. Since March, the German central bank invited sellers to offer bonds with the intent of buying as much as 450 billion euros, but only 8 billion-euros worth of assets eventually traded hands as price expectations diverged.\n\nThe additional wiggle room the Bundesbank gained with the expansion of the pool of assets will probably be small, said Pictet's Ducrozet.\n\n\"It's not a game changer -- it's not enough for them to extend QE in any meaningful way into 2019,\" he said. \"But it could help at the margins to smooth the collateral damage, and the market impact from the end of the program when they will come closer to those constraints.\"",

                "body": "A row between Italy's League leader Matteo Salvini and ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi has raised the prospect of a government formed by the League and the Five Star Movement -- a worst-case populist pact that alarms investors.\n\nIn accord with the anti-establishment Five Star, Salvini fractured the center-right coalition by failing to back Berlusconi's candidate for the job of speaker of the Senate in a vote late Friday. The ballots for speakers of both houses of parliament, which will last through the weekend, are a first clue to new alliances after both the center-right and Five Star failed to win a majority in March 4 general elections.\n\nA jubilant Luigi Di Maio, Five Star's leader, saw Salvini's move as promising for efforts to form the next government together. \"Salvini kept his word. He was brave,\" Di Maio told his advisers, newspaper La Stampa reported Saturday. \"And this is a great signal for the government.\"\n\nDi Maio's office declined to confirm the report, saying that Five Star appreciated Salvini's coherence and the fact that he did what he had said he would do.\n\nInvestors in Italy, and the country's European Union partners, fear a populist government could jeopardize state finances and a feeble economic recovery, as well as undermining the euro area because of their spending plans and demands for EU reform. Di Maio and Salvini, whose party overtook Berlusconi's Forza Italia in the general elections, have taken the lead in negotiations for the speakers' jobs.\n\nThe center-right could yet be salvaged. Berlusconi met Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, at his Rome residence Saturday. The leaders agreed they would name new candidates for speakers in both houses of parliament, newswire Ansa reported.\n\nThe center-right has long been divided over Five Star, with Salvini open to an alliance, while Berlusconi has been pushing for a pact with the center-left Democratic Party.\n\nBerlusconi's party late Friday described as \"an act of cold hostility\" the League's vote for ex-minister Anna Maria Bernini as Senate speaker. While she is a member of Berlusconi's party, she wasn't its selected candidate.\n\nThe former premier's office said that the Senate vote, \"on the one hand breaks the unity of the center-right coalition, and on the other reveals a plan for a League-Five Star government.\"\n\nForza Italia had selected former minister Paolo Romani as its candidate for the Senate job, but Salvini's senators voted against him. Salvini's decision is seen by Forza Italia as yielding to Five Star, which had ruled out backing Romani or any candidate with a judicial conviction. Romani has been convicted of embezzlement, an offense he denies.\n\nBig hurdles still remain on the way to populist power. Di Maio and Salvini both claim the premiership. Adding to the challenges, Five Star's political base is among the poorer voters of southern Italy, while the League's traditional support comes from the industrial north.\n\nSupport for a joint government has increased among Five Star and League voters. An SWG poll for Il Messaggero published Saturday showed 59 percent of Five Star voters and 58 percent of League voters support an administration formed by the two parties.\n\nSalvini said Friday that the League's choice was \"a courageous and generous help to the coalition\" to break a political deadlock.",

Rather as a country that has preferential market access to 1.2 billion consumers and soon to be 1.7 billion.\"",

Chief Executive Tim Cook has called for stronger privacy regulations that prevent the misuse of data in the light of the controversial leak of Facebook user information.\n\nCook called for \"well-crafted\" regulations that prevent the information of users being put together and applied in new ways without their knowledge during a session on global inequality at the annual China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday.\n\nHis comments will ramp up pressure on Facebook Inc. and other technology companies that rely on the huge reams of data gathered from billions of people to power their products, services and sales. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg belatedly apologized for failing to better control its customers' data following reports that it let Cambridge Analytica amass information on 50 million users. The social network's shares have tumbled 14 percent following the reports.\n\n\"I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,\" Cook said after being asked if the use of data should be restricted in light of the Facebook incident. \"The ability of anyone to know what you've been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life -- from my own point of view it shouldn't exist.\"\n\nCook said his company had long worried that people around the world were giving up information without knowing how it could be used.\n\n\"We've worried for a number of years that people in many countries were giving up data probably without knowing fully what they were doing and that these detailed profiles that were being built of them, that one day something would occur and people would be incredibly offended by what had been done without them being aware of it,\" he said. \"Unfortunately that prediction has come true more than once.\"\n\nTop U.S. executives from Google chief Sundar Pichai to IBM's Ginny Rometty gathered in Beijing this weekend under the shadow of a brewing trade war, as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to slap tariffs on Chinese goods, potentially affecting more than $50 billion worth of products. Until the U.S. government formalizes the details of the tariffs, the impact on American companies will be difficult to gauge.\n\nCook said that he held passionate views on the issue and that he'd personally weighed into the debate.\n\n\"The countries that embrace openness do exceptional and the countries that don't, don't,\" he said. \"It's not a matter of carving things up between sides. I'm going to encourage that calm heads prevail.\"",

                "title": "Regulation Could Power a New Era of Silicon Valley Growth",
                "body": "The companies need customers, and customers need some reassurance.\n\nThe secret use of Facebook data in the U.S. presidential election has forced governments and consumers to think about how such companies gather and profit from personal information -- a major concern overdue for close attention. This scrutiny may be the beginning of the end of the unregulated growth of Silicon Valley.\n\nTech companies and their investors may shudder at the thought, but their fear of regulation may be unwarranted. Part of the maturation process of any industry is regulation that suits its activities, and the gains from a safer, more trusted technology sector could quite plausibly outweigh any losses.\n\nThis was one theme that emerged from discussions at last week's Bloomberg Ideas event in San Francisco, where Bloomberg columnists discussed some of the issues facing the technology sector. In a panel on regulatory challenges, columnist Joe Nocera talked about the growth of the credit-card industry decades ago. The industry fought regulation that imposed limits on how much cardholders could be liable for in the case of fraud or theft, but after the industry lost that fight and consumers had some protections, plastic became the coin of the realm. This would not have happened if the credit-card industry had remained a Wild West.\n\nThis is the model Silicon Valley should consider as its ambitions expand to industries at the heart of our daily lives. It was one thing when the industry was more focused on semiconductors and database software, where product failures may have been a big problem for engineers who relied on them but were a nuisance at worst for the public at large. It's quite a different matter when the industries in question are transportation, media, health care and finance -- when failure has a much graver real-world impact on far more people.\n\nOne industry where regulation may provide the greatest catalyst for growth, as became apparent in my own Bloomberg Ideas panel on capital markets and innovation, is cryptocurrencies. While I remain a skeptic about the future of cryptocurrencies, a member of the audience expressed the modern version of the case Nocera mentioned: that institutional investors who are interested in cryptocurrencies could be waiting for a regulatory framework to emerge before allocating money to them. The early enthusiasts focus a lot on how a regulatory crackdown could represent the demise of cryptocurrencies -- but clear rules and investor protections may provide the foundation for a more legitimate and much larger industry to emerge.\n\nMy decision to deactivate my Facebook account last week in response to the company's data practices reflects this theme. While I remain a fan of Facebook's product as a user -- there's no better way for me to keep up with distant family members and local news -- I'm concerned with how the company and others use my personal data in ways I don't know about, and how indifferent the company seems to be about the appropriate business use of said data. My hope is that continued public scrutiny on the company leads to adequate reform or regulation, after which I would gladly reactivate my account.\n\nA regulated tech sector will be different, but there's no cause to assume it will be worse. By curtailing some actions, regulations will encourage the public to go along with everything else the companies do -- ultimately supporting this dynamic sector toward continued growth.",

                "body": "Facebook to Alert All Whose Data May Be Affected, CEO Tells CNN\n\nAs a bet on the future of everything, technology stocks are too cheap to pass up. Even after last year's epic rally and the uproar over Facebook Inc.'s handling of personal data.\n\nSo says Credit Suisse Group AG's chief investment officer Michael Strobaek, who lists robotics, artificial intelligence and automation among \"super trends\" with the biggest investment potential.\n\n\"It's not a bubble like in 2000,\" said Strobaek in an interview in Hong Kong, \"Tech is not expensive, tech is growing fast, tech can continue to grow even with rising interest rates, and tech is here to stay.\"\n\nFor a valuation case on global tech, Strobaek's looks at share prices relative to analyst forecasts for earnings over the next year. He finds those forward multiples are right where they've always been versus the market as a whole, excluding some extreme stretches like the dot-com bubble. With companies boosting spending on technology at a rate that could surpass global growth, the industry remains appealing.\n\nTech has had a bumpy week following Facebook's evolving data issue and a fatal accident involving a self-driving car from Uber Technologies Inc. Nasdaq 100 Stock Index came off 3.9 percent from it's all-time high.\n\nFacebook's travails may spur a review of business models -- and that's not a bad thing, he said. Regulators will pay more attention to how firms deal with people's private data, but tightened policies could make businesses \"more sustainable, more defined,\" according to Strobaek, who sets investment strategy for Credit Suisse's $1.46 trillion managed assets.\n\nOne place where tech stocks are less cheap is China, going by price-earnings ratios in absolute terms, but companies there hold distinct advantages, said Credit Suisse global equity strategist Andrew Garthwaite in a separate interview.\n\n\"You got the Great Firewall that protects you from foreign competition,\" Garthwaite said, \"There is much less concern about data security.\"\n\nWith great opportunities come new challenges. Strobaek, who's favorite movie is Ex Machina -- a 2014 sci-fi thriller about a humanoid A.I. -- believes in the long run people will be challenged ethically and morally by technology they've created. \"You can't stop it, so you better now get a grip on it before it goes to fast,\" He said.\n\nCredit Suisse is bullish on global stocks and advises clients to hold 45 percent of assets in them. \"Signs of bull market still exist,\" said Strobaek, particularly in earning. Inflation, \"an elephant in the room,\" may cause a market correction, but would only become a problem if U.S. wage growth rises above 3.5 percent, he said.",

                "title": "Why Women Earn Less",
                "body": "There are many ways to look at the explosive issue of why women earn less than men: Are you comparing men and women in the same exact job, at the same company? Or aggregate figures skewed by the fact that more women work in schools and hospitals and fewer advance to the top ranks of lucrative professions such as banking? What the numbers lay bare depends on how they're assembled. Yet in almost all cases, they provoke outrage, like the revelations about the gender pay gap in Hollywood, professional sports, at the BBC and among Uber drivers. In the U.K., a new law requiring large companies to disclose their pay gap is putting real numbers on wage inequality. Advocates say the flood of data will push women's wages up. Skeptics say it's a simplistic way to look at a stubborn problem.\n\nCompanies with 250 or more workers in Britain must unveil a blunt, uniform assessment of what women earn versus men by April 4. Some of the widest gaps have appeared at banks such as HSBC Holdings Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which pay women in their workforce less than half of what men earn on average. That's largely because women are under-represented in senior roles. A new German law gives workers the right to compare their pay with up to six colleagues of the opposite sex who have the same job. The U.S. has moved away from requiring more reporting. President Donald Trump's administration reversed an Obama-era rule change that would've compelled companies to report pay information to the government. But some companies are doing it anyway: Under pressure from activist shareholders, several large U.S. banks, including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. disclosed figures that revealed -- after adjusting for factors such as job title and geography -- an identical 1 percent gap. That led some critics to question the data. In the U.S., the typical job-to-job gap, for workers of equal education and experience, is about 5 percent. In France and Germany, it's about 3 percent.\n\nHistorically, the pay gap has been fed by beliefs that women should stay at home or doubts that they could perform jobs as well as men. Thus they earned lower salaries, even as they entered the workforce in larger numbers. These days, the debate is colored by the fact that women still do a disproportionate share of household work and childcare, so are more likely to work part time, work from home, or drop out of the workforce after they have children. When the U.S. passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, American women earned, in aggregate, roughly 60 percent of what men did. Over the next 30 years the gap was cut in half to about 80 percent but has been relatively stagnant since the 1990s. Nordic countries are often lauded for having near economic parity but they still have female workforces that earn at least 15 percent less than men on average.",

In the 2016 campaign, Trump actively sought out culturally conservative voters while also promising to \"fight for\" the gay and transgender community.\n\nAt least four lawsuits have been filed seeking to overturn the ban, and several courts issued preliminary injunctions while the cases proceed. In November, U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis in Baltimore, called the president's tweets announcing the change in policy \"capricious, arbitrary, and unqualified.\"\n\nAnd last week, a federal judge in Washington said that the Trump administration had failed to identify evidence it might use to defend the policy.\n\nThat judge, Marsha Pechman, criticized the administration's earlier claims that no such information could be identified because the policy was not in effect.",

Both indexes suffered their steepest weekly drop in more than two years.\n\nEquities are now teetering near -- and for blue chips, below -- levels seen at the worst point in February's volatility-fueled meltdown. At the epicenter this time is U.S. President Donald Trump, with his China tariffs driving Boeing Co. down more than 5 percent in a single session on Thursday and losses rippling across industries from technology to banks.\n\n\"Investors that have for months relied on Trump's pro-business rhetoric are now caught off guard,\" said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. \"Trade tariffs are a big change and China's response can even get stronger. There isn't too much to be optimistic about: investors' concern associated with Trump's tariffs isn't going to be resolved neither next week nor the week after.\"\n\nConsider this as a worrying sign of investor fragility: the S&P 500 has closed lower than the midpoint of its daily range for 10 straight days, the longest stretch since at least 1982. That suggests traders are finding reasons to dump shares in the afternoon rather than buy dips.\n\nFriday was a case in point. The S&P 500 fluctuated for most of the morning before sinking as much as 2.2 percent in the afternoon, coming within 0.2 percent of its Feb. 8 closing low. The Cboe Volatility Index jumped nearly 7 percent to the highest level since early March.\n\nAgainst the violent moves in equities, other asset classes looked relatively tame. Yields on 10-year Treasuries slipped three basis points on the week, the dollar lost some ground, and gold gained. Oil ignored the risk-off tone, jumping as Trump's appointment of a new national security adviser heightened the possibility of sanctions against Iran.\n\nBut with every sector trading in the red, stock investors had nowhere to hide. Concern over the tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods roiled industrial and material companies. China has already hit back, unveiling its own levies on $3 billion of U.S. imports. And its ambassador to the U.S. wouldn't rule out the possibility of the Asian nation scaling back purchases of Treasuries in response.\n\nRead more about China's signal on Treasuries here.\n\nBank of America Corp., the best-performing big bank stock since Trump's election, tumbled 9.3 percent this week. Facebook Inc. plunged 14 percent in the throes of a privacy scandal, leading tech megacaps lower.\n\n\"It was the week when one bad thing led to another, it was a perfect storm,\" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden Capital Management. \"You took the starch out of the FANGs, you saw banks, industrials, discretionary companies reacting to negative news. What investors are not pricing in is a potential impact on companies' profit margins.\"\n\nThe uncertainty around how the tariffs will be implemented has analysts staying quiet on what will happen to earnings. But it's shaping up as a big risk to watch, given that optimism about the prospects for bumper profits underpinned the market's jump in January.\n\nAmid all those surprises, the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest-rate increase on Wednesday almost felt like a side note. But that too has some investors feeling jittery.\n\n\"We saw the Fed talking about two more rate hikes this year, which raises some concerns about the pace of economic expansion,\" Paulsen said. \"Aggressive forward-looking Fed tightening policy is something the markets will need some time to adjust to. When you combine this with other market concerns, this may be a little too much to take.\"\n\nThe Dow lost 5.7 percent this week, leaving it almost 5 percent below the level where it was before Congress passed Trump's sweeping tax overhaul in late December. The S&P 500 closed at 2,588.26, hovering just above its 200-day moving average. Small caps that don't rely on foreign sales as much as their larger peers did slightly better, sliding 4.8 percent. The Nasdaq 100 Index sank 7.3 percent.\n\nThe S&P 500's decline since March 9 was its third dip of at least 5 percent in two months. Before that, the last time the gauge lost that much was in June 2016 when the U.K. voted to leave the European Union.\n\n\"The quiet days are now gone,\" said Stephen Carl, head trader at Williams Capital Group. \"There are too many things investors have to be worried about.\"",

                "body": "President Donald Trump's advisers are poised to recommend that he expel some Russian diplomats from the U.S. in response to the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy living in the U.K., a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe advisers reached the preliminary recommendations at a National Security Council meeting on Wednesday and honed them on Friday in a gathering that included Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, according to two people familiar with the meeting.\n\nTrump has not made a decision and is unlikely to do so before next week, one of the people said.\n\nA battle within the White House over how to best address the provocations of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been intensifying. The internal divisions flared this week after Trump congratulated Putin on his recent re-election without first reviewing written guidance that he not do so, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nTrump has been reshaping his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced the departure of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, and announced that he would replace him with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations known for his hawkish views. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who also took a more combative stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.\n\nTrump faces pressure to take a stronger stance against Putin from Congress, which passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive measures imposed after Russia's intervention in Ukraine. Substantively, Washington's policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump's critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin's provocations.\n\nTrump, who's aware of the disagreement among his aides, didn't mention such sensitive issues as the U.K. poisoning or continuing concerns over Russian interference in American elections during a 30-minute call with Putin.\n\nTrump has been willing to adopt increasingly tough policy stances on Russia. But the president places a priority on maintaining a personal relationship with the Russian president, won't publicly attack him, and doesn't see any benefit to the U.S. in confronting Putin in one-on-one encounters, one administration official said.\n\nTrump defended his call with Putin on Twitter Wednesday, dismissing those who \"wanted me to excoriate him.\" \"They are wrong!\" Trump wrote. \"Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\n\nRegardless of the president's own rhetoric, his administration sees the Kremlin as a threat.\n\nA national defense strategy assembled by the Pentagon under Defense Secretary James Mattis and publicly summarized in January described China and Russia as the top global adversaries of the U.S. Last week, the administration slapped financial sanctions against a St. Petersburg-based internet \"troll farm\" and its alleged owner -- a close Putin ally -- whom Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted over a covert social media campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. election.",

                "body": "Device became infamous after the Las Vegas concert shooting\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday formally proposed a ban on bump stocks, the firearms accessory that allows semi-automatic guns to fire more quickly, similar to a fully automatic weapon.\n\nThe proposal seeks to fulfill a promise made by President Donald Trump after the Feb. 14 massacre at a Florida high school and comes a day before a protest march in Washington organized by survivors of the Florida shooting.\n\nPreviously an obscure gun accessory, bump stocks became infamous after the device was linked to the Las Vegas concert massacre on Oct. 1. The gunman owned multiple such devices, law enforcement authorities said. Fifty-eight people were killed in the attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.\n\n\"After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress,\" Sessions said in a statement.\n\n\"I look forward to working with the president's School Safety Commission to identify other ways to keep our country and our children safe, and I thank the president for his courageous leadership on this issue,\" he said.\n\nSessions's proposal involves amending Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives regulations that would categorize bump stocks under the federal definition of a machine gun. Trump signed an order on Feb. 20, less than a week after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, directing the Justice Department to make the change.\n\nThe president hailed the announcement Friday on Twitter. \"As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period,\" Trump wrote. \"We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"\n\nAfter the Parkland killings, the president and congressional leaders demanded solutions to gun violence. Congress voted Friday to bolster background checks for gun purchases, spend more on school safety, and let the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study gun violence, ending what was in effect a 22-year ban that was supported by the National Rifle Association. But more far-reaching gun control proposals didn't advance.\n\nThe comment period for the amendment is 90 days. After Trump's announcement in February, prices of bump stocks rose on firearms auction platforms.\n\nAvery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a statement, \"We welcome a DOJ regulation. We will be ready to defend this regulation if and when, as we expect, the gun lobby challenges it in court.\"\n\nOpponents of gun control quickly reacted to Session's announcement and to new regulations passed by Congress this week. \"After signing an anti-gun omnibus bill today, Trump gives another slap in the face to gun owners,\" Jordan Stein, a spokesman for the Gun Owners of America, said on Twitter.",

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon lauded the 2015 global Paris accord, and the bank has committed to buying and financing clean energy, as well as reducing its coal-industry work.\n\nYet the bank is the top U.S. lender and financier to oil-sands producers and pipeline companies, according to some shareholders who want the company to disclose the risks.\n\nAmong the most carbon-heavy forms of petroleum, oil-sands production has also disrupted indigenous communities and leveled forests. That's why shareholder groups in December proposed a resolution that would prod the company to tell the world about financial risks it may face from these investments.\n\nFinancing by JPMorgan to oil-sands producers and pipeline companies totaled $8.4 billion from 2014 through the third-quarter of 2017, according to the proposed resolution, which asks the bank to prepare a report on the losses it might face if oil isn't produced, whether the financing is consistent with the 2015 Paris climate change accord and the bank's policy on indigenous people's rights and if adopting a policy similar to other banks would reduce its risk.\n\nThe bank has resisted putting the resolution to a vote of shareholders. It was not listed in JPMorgan's preliminary proxy, which was released this week, and the bank sought informal assurance from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it wouldn't fault the bank if it drops the proposal. The resolution amounts to micromanagement, would interfere with \"ordinary business operations,\" and be therefore inappropriate according to SEC rules, the bank argues in a Jan. 12 letter.\n\nThe shareholders said that they are not requesting a company policy to limit or ban oil-sands financing, only an assessment of the oil-sands work -- both on its merits and relative to larger societal debates. The request is consistent with increasing attention given to climate change in the financial sector, they wrote.\n\nMichael Passoff, chief executive officer of Proxy Impact, which is the lead group working with shareholders, said that in his experience companies tend to include a disputed resolution in their preliminary proxies when the SEC has not weighed in. In a first for him, JPMorgan has not included it.",

Nissan reached 86 days of inventory as of Sept. 1 last year, and the company increased incentive spending and shipped more cars to rental companies and other fleet customers to help bring that number down.\n\n\"We didn't do a very good job of forecasting the softness that was coming, so we're kind of playing catch-up here from a production standpoint,\" Mohnke said in an interview in Las Vegas ahead of the National Automobile Dealers Association's annual convention. \"Some of the other competitors maybe did a little bit better job of seeing that earlier and adjusting earlier. We're adjusting essentially right now.\"\n\nNissan has struggled more than some of its Japanese peers to adjust to the U.S. auto market slowing down for the first time since the global recession. In February, the company cut its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending this month, as costlier sales incentives in the U.S. weigh on operating profit. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. both lifted their projections.\n\nWhile Nissan gained U.S. market share last year, its 13 percent increase in incentive spending per vehicle was the biggest jump among the six largest carmakers, according to Autodata Corp. The company also boosted fleet sales by 15 percent last year, Zohaib Rahim, an analyst at Cox Automotive, said in an email.\n\nAs of March 1, Nissan's supply of vehicles was at 60 days, according to Automotive News Data Center. Mohnke, who was named a senior vice president in October, said he expects to reduce dealer inventory further in the April-to-June quarter.\n\n\"They're saying all the right things,\" Paul Sansone Jr., the executive manager of a Nissan dealership in Neptune, New Jersey, said in an interview. \"But the question is, if they come up a little bit short if their objectives, will they hit the panic button again?

To succeed, the route must defy the boom-and-bust commodities cycle that has preyed on Western Australia. And Qantas needs business travelers to pay up for the shorter, one-hop flight to London rather than make a stop in Asia or the Middle East.\n\n\"You have the resources sector on both sides, you have banks, you have lawyers that all want to fly fast and reliably and comfortably,\"' said Rico Merkert, professor of transport and supply-chain management at the University of Sydney's business school. \"And I think they're prepared to pay the premium.\"\n\nRead More: How airlines are trying to beat jet lag with science\n\nMining companies in Western Australia dig up more than a third of the world's iron-ore and bring in some of the largest hauls of gems and rare earths. The sector also supports financial-services firms such as Hartleys Ltd., whose Perth-based director of corporate finance Steve Kite is booked on Sunday's flight -- the second in the new service to London -- for just a four-day trip.\n\n\"It's effectively an overnight flight for me and that feels like I'm saving a lot of time,\" said Kite.\n\nQantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce is betting he can make money from the daily service by stripping excess weight from a Boeing Co. Dreamliner and stacking it with top-tier passengers.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of the route's commercial future.\n\nAircraft leaving Perth for London will need feeder passengers from around Australia, said Volodymyr Bilotkach, author of the book \"The Economics of Airlines.\" But flying from Sydney to London via Perth saves little time over a transfer in Asia or the Gulf, he said.\n\nAndrew McGinnes, a spokesman for Qantas in Sydney, said bookings on the new route \"have been strong\" and corporate clients in eastern Australia have indicated they'll stop in Perth for meetings on their way to London. \"It's a very competitive market but this is a unique flight,\" McGinnes said.\n\nAn analysis of flight times and prices highlights the challenges Qantas faces.\n\nFlying business class from Perth to London with Qantas in mid-June would cost A$6,614 ($5,121). Opting for Singapore Airlines via Singapore would take an extra 2 1/2 hours but cost just A$4,843, according to fares on Webjet.\n\nQantas has challenged Boeing and Airbus to build a jet by 2022 that can fly fully loaded from Sydney to London without a break. Success on the Perth-London service would lay the foundations for even longer routes to Europe.\n\n\"It's really just the beginning,\" said Merkert at the University of Sydney.",

His disclosure shows that, if elected, he'd be one of the richest members of Congress, but his exact net worth isn't discernible from the forms, which list asset values in broad ranges and exclude assets such as homes and artwork.\n\nRomney's wealth and tax-deferred retirement savings became an issue in 2012 when he was the Republican presidential nominee. The new disclosure shows that in the last year Romney received $1.7 million in distributions from a Goldman Sachs individual retirement account.\n\nIn the document, Romney discloses various accounts -- including IRAs -- that hold at least $88 million in assets, and probably far more. The form reports many values as \"over $1,000,000.\"\n\nNormally, the annual contribution limits for IRAs are capped at $5,500 for individuals under 50 and $6,500 for older workers -- limits that helped draw attention to the size of Romney's retirement savings. After the election, which Romney lost, then-President Barack Obama proposed capping tax-favored retirement accounts of some private-equity executives and self-employed professionals at $3 million. The plan didn't advance in Congress.\n\nRomney earned $131,039 as a director for Marriott International Inc. hotels and $220,000 as a director for son Tagg Romney's investment firm Solamere Capital.\n\nThe form covers Romney's speeches from Feb. 1, 2017, until Feb. 11, 2018, shortly before he announced his candidacy. He was paid about $100,000 for most of the speeches, with the largest payment of $137,082 coming from NBC Universal.\n\nRomney spokeswoman M.J. Henshaw said this week that Romney will step down from the Marriott board if he wins the Senate race. She said Romney will release his 2017 tax returns as soon as they are filed.\n\nRomney is running for the Senate seat held by Republican Orrin Hatch, who is retiring.",

                "title": "Spotify Saved Music. Can It Save Itself?",
                "body": "Investors are about to decide whether it matters that the most popular music streaming service doesn't make any money.\n\nDaniel Ek, Spotify Technology SA's co-founder and chief executive officer, was in a celebratory mood on Feb. 28, the day his streaming music company filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange. And like any modern CEO with faith in technology to reorganize the world, he celebrated by threatening anyone who stands in his way. Spotify, he wrote to investors, will render record labels and publishers obsolete by connecting artists directly to fans. \"The old model favored certain gatekeepers,\" he said, but today \"artists can produce and release their own music.\"\n\nEk, 35, started Spotify in 2006 because he thought he could stamp out the piracy that had ravaged the music business. He was right. Total global music sales have grown three straight years after a 15-year decline. More than 70 million people now pay Spotify an average of about $5 a month to access 35 million songs, plus playlists and podcasts. In private transactions, investors have valued the company at more than $20 billion, a market cap many analysts expect Spotify to justify when it lists its shares on April 3.\n\nThere's only one small flaw in the business model: Spotify doesn't make any money. The service has reported higher losses in three consecutive years despite quadrupling sales. It's hard to be profitable when music-rights holders collect more than 75¢ on every dollar that comes in.\n\nInvestors weighing whether to bet on Spotify need only look at the chorus of predecessors that tried and failed to meet the same challenges. Pandora Media Inc. hasn't been profitable in six years as a public company. Deezer SA, a European service once seen as a Spotify rival, called off an initial public offering in 2015. If you don't remember Grooveshark, MOG, Songza, or Rdio, it's because they shut down or were bought by larger companies. Meanwhile, the tech giants don't mind losing money on music if it helps sell other stuff: Apple Inc. doesn't care what it pays the industry as long as Apple Music moves iPhones.\n\nEk has to improve gross margins for Spotify to survive on its own. With the scrutiny of public markets a couple of weeks away, he's been visiting executives at the three major music companies -- Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group -- to propose more Spotify-friendly arrangements, say executives at those companies, who declined to be identified. But Ek may need to crank it up to 11. Matt Pincus, founder of Songs Music Publishing, says Spotify has to be \"at such a scale that they can shove it down the music industry's throat.\"\n\nThe Stockholm-based company's pitch to investors hinges on that word: \"scale.\" More than 1 billion people worldwide have their credit card information on their smartphones, and many are just waking up to the appeal of paid music services. Spotify is the dominant player, with as many subscribers as all its competitors combined. \"We're just in the second inning of this game,\" Ek said at an investor presentation on March 15. \"Spotify is a lot bigger than you thought, and the opportunity ahead is much, much greater than you realized.\"\n\nTo convince Wall Street, Ek hired Barry McCarthy, the finance whiz who taught investors to love another subscription service. McCarthy was chief financial officer of Netflix Inc. when it went public in 2002. He's also the chief advocate for Spotify's unorthodox path to public markets. The music service is eschewing a conventional IPO, in which companies issue stock to raise money, and instead is letting existing investors sell their shares directly to the public. The unusual approach has led to much debate about whether others will follow. The way McCarthy sees it, Netflix was a fledgling DVD-by-mail business when it went public, and it needed an IPO to raise enough capital to fight the Establishment (Blockbuster, R.I.P.). Spotify is an international brand and already generates enough cash to keep the lights on.\n\nIf Pandora is the worst-case example for Spotify, Netflix is the best case and the comparison McCarthy is eagerly making. Investors have overcome concerns about Netflix's spending -- it budgeted at least $8 billion for programming in 2018 -- because more than 100 million people around the world pay about $9 a month to be part of the binge-watching revolution. The company is valued at more than $120 billion.\n\nLike Netflix, Spotify has created an on-demand alternative universe. It knows what you listen to, when, and for how long. It processes that data to churn out custom mixes such as Discover Weekly, a collection of songs from bands you haven't heard and deeper cuts from those you have. Spotify's premade playlists account for about 30 percent of listening on the service, which gives them the power to make careers. Irish singer-songwriter Dermot Kennedy was playing the streets of Dublin until he got on more than 500,000 personalized Discover Weekly playlists. Now he tours the world.\n\nYet unlike Netflix, which produces original TV shows and movies, Spotify insists it doesn't want to make music. It seeks to emulate another tech giant, Facebook Inc., and serve as a platform for content others create. McCarthy was brought in because he's one of the only CFOs to successfully guide a subscription service to the market. He left Netflix before it started making original series.\n\nRecord labels, of course, would revolt if Spotify competed for talent. As it is, the company's last round of negotiations with the industry dragged on for two years, the same length as the compromise deals eventually signed, which expire in 2019. Spotify gave labels more control over what music was offered free to the 90 million users who don't sign up for the paid service, and the labels agreed to take a smaller cut of sales. These terms have improved Spotify's margins, but rate cuts accomplish only so much.\n\nSo the company is looking for alternative ways to cash in. Artists use its data to plan album releases and its marketing to reach new fans. In his visits with music executives, Ek has floated the idea of charging for this service or asking for a share of the dollars the acts make that Spotify can link directly to its promotions. This might be a hard sell. Dozens of artists, including Taylor Swift and Radiohead's Thom Yorke, have criticized the service for devaluing music -- though Swift made her latest album, Reputation, available. Representatives for Tom Petty and Neil Young are suing the company for not paying them. Spotify acknowledges not compensating some artists and is working to settle outstanding disputes ahead of its public debut.\n\nSpotify has also dabbled in new businesses, such as podcasts and videos, that labels don't get a cut of. And it encourages artists to sign with publishers, including Kobalt Music Group Ltd., which collect a smaller share of royalties. \"Spotify is a good thing for the music industry,\" says Willard Ahdritz, CEO of Kobalt, which represents acts such as Beck and De La Soul. \"I'm embarrassed by how badly the music industry has treated Spotify.\"\n\nIn 2012 the Red Hot Chili Peppers signed an exclusive distribution deal with the company. It's since stopped pursuing such arrangements and has focused instead on creating tools and services that enable musicians to bypass labels altogether. In Spotify's thinking, the cost of production is so low that artists don't need record labels, whose marketing and distribution support isn't as important in today's decentralized model as it used to be.\n\nThe bigger Spotify gets, the more critical it becomes to the music industry's bottom line -- and the more leverage it has. It's so important to artists that only a couple, including Jay-Z, still avoid Spotify (they don't like that it has a free tier). Concern about the service's growing power is pushing the industry into alliances with the tech giants that the labels normally distrust because they want a battle royal: The more rivals, the less power any one of them has.\n\nEk is optimistic. \"The music industry today is quite inefficient when it comes to breaking artists, when it comes to promoting and marketing artists,\" he said at the investor presentation. \"There is a tremendous opportunity in connecting these 3 million artists we have today with these 160 million-plus users that we have.\" The question now is whether investors think he can do that and how much profit he can wring out each time he does.",

                "body": "Turns out, it may be easier to strike gold by growing green.\n\nJust ask Jay Wilgar, a former wind power developer who started a medical marijuana company with friend Travis Kanellos after hatching the idea while lifting weights at a gym. When they began looking at ways to take their startup public, advisers suggested partnering with Newstrike Resources Inc., a Toronto-based firm that had been looking for gold in Ontario and Wyoming without much luck.\n\n\"I think they had given up on what they were pursuing from a mining point of view,\" Wilgar said by phone. He also wanted to work with \"people that understand capital markets, and that was really how the Newstrike transaction came about.\"\n\nNewstrike, backed by The Tragically Hip, one of Canada's most iconic bands, was reborn last year through a reverse takeover by Wilgar's startup and has since shot higher. While the company has no revenue, it's valued at C$612 million ($467 million) and became a takeover target itself by rival producer CanniMed Therapeutics Inc. in November.\n\nThe number of companies that started in the mining or oil and gas sectors that are now part of Canada's burgeoning marijuana industry has jumped to more than 40. In all, almost half of the country's marijuana firms started out in the resource sector before many converted to pot via reverse takeovers and spinoffs.\n\nThe listings reflect a surge of investor optimism as Canada moves to legalize recreational pot this year. Market values for the four largest publicly-traded firms, Canopy Growth Corp., Aurora Cannabis Inc., Aphria Inc. and MedReleaf Corp., have all ballooned to more than C$1 billion. The pot companies on Canadian exchanges have a combined market value of about C$32 billion.\n\nWhile the surge is being fueled by estimates that retail sales of recreational and medical pot could reach C$8 billion by 2021, there's mounting concern companies are overvalued. It remains unclear how Canada will set prices for marijuana and some publicly traded growers have yet to make a sale.\n\nMarijuana stocks plunged in January following a rally at the end of last year that saw Aurora Cannabis more than triple, while Canopy Growth and Aphria more than doubled. Stocks began to look \"overvalued and overbought,\" according to a Jan. 31 note from the BCMI Cannabis Report. The BI Canada Cannabis Index has tumbled 18 percent this year.\n\n\"Every hot equity cycle tends to create a pile-on effect,\" Jason Zandberg, an analyst at PI Financial in Vancouver, said in an email. \"Individuals will enter a hot new space looking to capitalize on a growing demand, in this case legalized cannabis.\"\n\nThe reverse takeovers allow investors to quickly tap into this new space, giving Canadian entrepreneurs and exchanges a leg up on global rivals as legalization of pot spreads around the world.\n\nMany new entrants go public via a reverse takeover and use the old mining or oil and gas \"shells\" as the listing vehicle, Zandberg said. It's a potentially faster way to list on a public exchange, and unlike a traditional initial public offering, companies don't have to undergo a full securities commission review or file a prospectus.\n\nThere are plenty of failed mining exploration companies that are sitting on Canadian exchanges paying fees and doing annual audits that still have \"shell value,\" said Canadian Securities Exchange Chief Executive Officer Richard Carleton. While that's something that U.S. Securities Commission has cracked down on to avoid fraudulent pump-and-dump schemes on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchanges, Canadian exchanges demand that companies present a viable plan to sustain their operations and undergo a thorough review, he said.\n\nStill, there are signs Canadian exchanges could lose their first-mover advantage to bigger U.S. peers. Toronto-based Cronos Group Inc. became the first cannabis stock to list on the Nasdaq Stock Market last month. Other producers, including Canopy Growth and Aurora, say they plan to follow suit, which could shift some trading to the U.S. from Canada.\n\nCanada's venture markets are known for their risk appetite due to its listing rules and the nation has always been a \"mining frontier country,\" said Chris Damas, editor of the BCMI Cannabis Report. No one can say for certain how much marijuana will be consumed when recreational sales become legal, and there are some small investors jumping into the market with a \"gambling chip and they don't really read the fine print\" in company disclosure statements, he said.\n\n\"It's like a Yukon gold rush,\" Damas said. \"It's always been part of our DNA.\"",

They climbed as much as 50 percent above their IPO price in earlier trading to as high as $31.60. Dropbox, founded by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi in 2007, was valued at $10 billion in its last private funding round four years ago.\n\nInvestors' enthusiastic response to the IPO could help clear one roadblock that's been holding back Silicon Valley companies from going public: Their own lofty private valuations.\n\nAfter initially targeting a market value of only $7.1 billion, strong demand for Dropbox shares helped close the gap as its IPO priced above the marketed range. Dropbox sold 36 million shares for $21 apiece Thursday, raising $756 million, after offering them for $18 to $20 apiece -- already an increase from the original price range.\n\nInvestors were willing to pay up even as equity markets -- and especially technology stocks -- took a tumble on Thursday, sending the Nasdaq 100 Index on its steepest decline in six weeks. As Dropbox climbed on Friday, all major U.S. indexes clocked losses.\n\nDropbox appears to have overcome the so-called down round at its IPO, in which a company's debut market valuation fails to match up to its fundraising promise. Friday's share surge indicates investors don't see that gap as an obstacle to becoming a successful public company. As billions of dollars of private funding have driven up the valuations of technology companies, concerns about not living up to those metrics have helped slow the U.S. IPO pipeline. Pre-IPO candidates have put off listing plans to try to grow into their private valuations.\n\n\"There was always a little of fear around acknowledging that if I price below what it was previously, there was a guilty feeling that it was a failure,\" said Yogesh Amle, a managing director and head of software at tech-focused investment bank Union Square Advisors. \"You just have to open up to the reality that we have to price this pragmatically.\"\n\nWhile there is more to judging a successful public company than market value, IPO performance is so closely watched that negative sentiment after a value cut can hit customer relationships and employee morale, as well as limiting the ability to raise more money.\n\nThe post-IPO success of Square Inc., which faced harsh criticism for listing in 2015 at a valuation far below its last funding round, had already gone some way to removing the stigma of a down round. The payments company raised less than expected to clock a market value of $2.9 billion, well below the $6 billion valuation it reached in a private funding round just a year earlier.\n\nAt the time, Gil Luria, then an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., called the drop \"really monumental,\" saying a reckoning had arrived for heady private valuations. Luria now works at D.A. Davidson & Co.\n\nSquare has since proved itself to investors. Its revenue has more than doubled since the year before its listing, while its losses shrank by more than half and the business became cash-flow positive. The stock has increased more than sixfold since the IPO, giving the company a market value of more than $20 billion.\n\nDropbox, whose users store and share files online through its cloud service, might have gotten more leeway because it achieved a favorable financial profile while private. The San Francisco-based company is cash-flow positive and edging toward a net profit, while showing revenue growth of more than 30 percent last year to $1.1 billion, according to its latest pre-IPO filing.\n\n\"It is a very impressive set of operating metrics,\" said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at tech-focused investment firm Battery Ventures, which has also invested in household-goods retailer Wayfair Inc. and software maker Marketo Inc. \"You've got an environment where there are not a lot of high growth IPOs that are coming out and there's a lot of investor demand in cloud.\"\n\nIncreasing the marketed share price range, as Dropbox did on Wednesday, is an unusual move for large technology IPOs. While more than $12 billion in stock has been sold in U.S. listings this year, up by a third from the same period in 2017, technology companies have been largely absent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cloud-security company Zscaler Inc. was the only notable IPO out of Silicon Valley, raising $221 million this month.\n\nInvestors' comfort with Dropbox's books could help it avoid a flame-out like Blue Apron Holdings Inc. The money-losing meal-kit delivery company raised less than expected at a $2 billion valuation, 38 percent lower than its last private round. Its stock has tumbled another 80 percent since its June IPO to value the company at just $390 million.\n\nDropbox has also had more time to adjust to life in the spotlight. While Blue Apron was founded in 2012 and went public within five years, Dropbox co-founders Houston and Ferdowsi have had more than a decade to prepare for this moment.\n\nDuring that time, the startup has found itself under scrutiny at several Silicon Valley inflection points, making it a fitting poster child for managing private versus public expectations.\n\nThe Valley was shook when mutual funds that had piled money into private companies started publicly posting changes to their in-house valuation calculations. Dropbox was one of the highest-profile examples, raising questions about the company's worth: In 2015, Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc. wrote down the value of their investments in the company by at least 15 percent.\n\nDropbox -- with a gleaming chrome panda statue greeting visitors at its San Francisco headquarters and employee perks that include free meals from a chef who's worked for Michelin-starred restaurants -- was once emblematic of startup excess. Critics assailed such young companies for collecting millions in private funding and prioritizing spending on millennial-baiting office bars and decor over turning a profit.\n\nSince then, Dropbox took pains to focus its business and work toward profitability rather than simply pushing for growth at all costs. The company cut expenses and found its focus, growing to 500 million users storing and sharing files online through its cloud service. If anything, Dropbox's time in the spotlight through the good and bad has given it an appreciation for the intense scrutiny of public markets.\n\nThe company made its public market debut at a time when technology stocks have slipped out of favor. Facebook Inc. has dropped about 14 percent this past week as it acknowledged its mishandling of user data, while less-than-stellar earnings have driven others lower. The Cboe Volatility Index is up 39 percent since Wednesday as President Donald Trump announced about $50 billion of tariffs against China over intellectual property violations.\n\nThe scenario in which valuations always go \"up and to the right is only manufactured in private markets,\" Agrawal said, invoking a popular Silicon Valley phrase to describe exponential growth. \"That's not the reality being public.\"",

                "body": "Project would replace the overstuffed Mexico City terminals\n\nThe group behind Mexico City's new airport raised $1.6 billion in an initial public offering of Fibra E shares Friday, providing another buffer against threats to shut the endeavor down.\n\nGrupo Aeroportuario de la Ciudad de Mexico, or GACM, sold 300 million of the securities at 100 pesos each to raise 30 billion pesos, including an overallotment option known as a greenshoe, according to a person with knowledge of the deal, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. It was the biggest-ever sale of Fibra E securities in Mexico. The state-backed electricity company raised $759 million last month.\n\nThe idea for the sale, coming less than four months before Mexico's presidential election, was that entangling more investors in the $13.3 billion project and securing capital from local investors to help ramp up construction will make it that much harder for a future administration to unravel it. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is leading rivals in polls, has pledged to cancel construction if he wins, calling the airport a gift to contractors that's steeped in corruption.\n\nThe offering attracted local and foreign investors, said the person.\n\nThe new airport is part of a plan unveiled by President Enrique Pena Nieto at the beginning of his six-year term to rekindle growth by spending on public works and is due to open by the end of 2020 to replace the overstuffed Benito Juarez International Airport. The Mexican government is contributing about $8 billion to the project, according to the prospectus for last year's bond issue.\n\nLopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor, has said he wants to replace plans for the new airport with a less expensive project to build two new runways at a military base 30 miles away and open it to commercial flights. Earlier this week, he said he is considering seeking injunctions to prevent Mexico from awarding new airport contracts in the months leading up to the election.\n\nPena Nieto announced the creation of the Fibra E in 2015 as part of a larger plan to increase opportunities for Mexico's pension funds and insurance companies to invest in public works. The instrument is a hybrid between a master-limited partnership and a REIT. Through the structure, earnings are essentially tax-free and the trust has to pay out 95 percent of revenues to investors.\n\nPart of the construction of the airport is also being funded by $6 billion of bonds sold by an airport trust that gives lenders exclusive claim on passenger tariffs, first at the old airport and then at the new one. The debt includes a provision that requires immediate repayment of the principal and interest if a governmental change interrupts the flow of passenger tariffs that have been pledged exclusively to the trust, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nCredit Suisse Group AG was the lead global coordinator for the offering. Citigroup Inc., BTG Pactual, Banorte, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, Banco Santander SA and Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB also helped underwrite the deal, while Banobras was the structuring agent.",

The U.S. Justice Department on Friday charged nine Iranian citizens with hacking hundreds of companies, academic institutions and government agencies to steal more than $3.4 billion in trade secrets and other data on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nAmong the victims: FERC.\n\n\"While the administration has taken significant steps to address cyber threats to our critical infrastructure, I believe that these threats will continue to grow,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nAmong the more recent targets are the Colorado Department of Transportation, where more than 2,000 computers shut down after it was breached in a ransomware attack; and the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, which operates the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline that transports roughly roughly 500,000 barrels of crude a day.\n\n\"We know they are trying\" but have so far been unsuccessful, Kate Dugan, a spokeswoman for Alyeska, said. \"The number grows every year.\"",

The watchdog is leading the probe with the backing of the European Union's remaining 27 regulators, who earlier this week vowed to collaborate to get to the bottom of the \"very serious allegation with far-reaching consequences.\"\n\n\"We're pleased with the decision of the judge and we plan to execute the warrant shortly,\" the regulator said in the statement. \"This is just one part of a larger investigation into the use of personal data for political purposes and we will now need time to collect and consider the evidence.\"\n\nFacebook has also come under pressure since the revelations that vast swathes of data was illegally held by Cambridge Analytica after it was obtained from a researcher who shared the data without the social network's permission. According to published news reports, Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan created a personality-analysis app that was used by 270,000 Facebook users, who in turn gave the app permission to access data on themselves and their friends, ultimately exposing a network of 50 million people.\n\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg apologized Wednesday and promised to investigate whether Cambridge Analytica still holds the information it obtained from a third-party app creator and to broaden the probe to other developers who harvest data. Lawmakers in the U.S. have also called on Zuckerberg to testify about how Facebook safeguards user data.\n\nThe company's shares fell 3.3 percent Friday to $159.39 at the close in New York, bringing the loss this week to almost 14 percent since the revelations broke. A movement called #DeleteFacebook is gathering momentum after Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., joined those who want to get rid of their Facebook accounts. Musk tweeted on Friday that Tesla's official Facebook page should \"definitely' be deleted, and it promptly was, along with the page of his rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp.\n\nEarlier Friday, Cambridge Analytica said it's undertaking an independent third-party audit to verify that it does not hold any of the data. The company worked for Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Trump's former adviser Stephen K. Bannon served as an executive and board member and major Republican donor Robert Mercer's family owns part of the company.\n\nUnderstanding the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Story: QuickTake\n\nIt had already suspended its chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, this week after he was filmed bragging about dirty tricks the firm used to obtain information. He retains a large ownership stake in Cambridge Analytica's affiliated companies, and many of its top executives share his history of questionable campaign techniques.\n\nCambridge Analytica apologized that one of its affiliates licensed Facebook data and derivatives from Global Science Research, and said it believed data had been obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service and data protection laws.\n\nIt said the information was deleted at Facebook's request, and that it has been in touch with the U.K. ICO since February 2017.",

                "body": "CEO Kocher says size doesn't matter for acquisition strategy\n\nThe energy industry has long been predicated on selling more and more fuel to an increasingly power-hungry world. France's Engie SA is betting its future on the opposite tack.\n\nThe power and gas giant that supplied coal that fueled the French Industrial Revolution and excavated the Suez Canal now sees its greatest potential for growth in helping large energy users like hospitals, schools and airports reduce their bills and carbon emissions, Isabelle Kocher, Engie's chief executive officer, said in an interview in Singapore.\n\nEngie's push for efficiency aligns it with demands in developed countries, where total energy use peaked in 2007 and has since fallen to levels not seen since the 1990s, according to the International Energy Agency. The company is increasingly targeting deals like one it signed with Ohio State University in the U.S. last year, where it makes more money if it meets energy-reduction goals, Kocher said.\n\n\"More and more we do that -- we invest in the site, we manage everything about energy. Effectively we are a tech company,\" Kocher said. \"We have an engagement to make the energy bill effectively decrease, and our own remuneration depends on that.\"\n\nBy focusing on business-to-business service deals and selling 15 billion euros ($18.5 billion) of coal, oil and gas assets, the company's profitability is now tied more to stable contracts and less to wild swings in commodity prices, Kocher said. Engie shares fell 0.7% to 13.47 euros on Thursday.\n\nEngie and Axium Infrastructure US Inc. last year inked a $1.16 billion deal with Ohio State to manage energy use at the Columbus school's 485-building campus for 50 years. The companies promised to improve the school's energy efficiency by 25 percent in the first 10 years, and the fee structure was designed to give financial incentives for energy-conservation measures, Ohio State said in a statement.\n\nEngie is targeting air cooling and heating, lighting and transportation as areas it can cut down on wasted energy at facilities and campuses it manages, Kocher said. Engie can also implement micro-grids that take advantage of cheap renewable power investments to help reduce power purchases from the grid without risking reliability.\n\nEnergy efficiency has become a big business. Global investment in energy efficiency grew 9 percent in 2016 to $231 billion, according to the International Energy Agency. Efficiency improvements implemented since 2000 wiped out about 12 percent of global energy use in 2016, equivalent to all of the consumption in the European Union.\n\nEngie has also been active on the mergers and acquisition market. It bought 43 small- and mid-sized companies in the past two years, Kocher said, including ones that specialize in smart-charging for electric vehicles and building micro-grids.\n\nA $27 billion mega-deal last week between German energy giants RWE AG and EON SE, which focused RWE on generating and trading power and EON on supplying 50 million energy customers across Europe, won't affect Engie's strategy, Kocher said.\n\n\"I've been asked several times if I'm tempted to buy big companies that are more classical, and I said no,\" she said. \"I want companies that help me accelerate Engie's transformation. That's the point more than the size.\"",

                "title": "How Singapore's Wealth Fund Invests in Tech Companies",
                "body": "GIC has invested several billions in tech cos. in recent years\n\nSingapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte spoke to Bloomberg News about its technology investment strategy. Here are edited excerpts from the interview on Tuesday with Chief Executive Officer Lim Chow Kiat and head of the company's technology investment group, Jeremy Kranz.\n\nKRANZ: Our objective is to have lifetime relationships with the most important companies that are emerging in every business cycle.\n\nThe way we are designed is we are multi-geography, but one team. And we are multi-strategy, meaning we invest in public equities as well as in funds and companies on the private side. And the reason to do that is it keeps you connected to the life cycle of any one company. So in an ideal world, the founder would be able to say that when he is pitching for venture capital and he met someone from GIC, it's the same group that he will be dealing with when it's time for the roadshow or lockup expiry.\n\nKRANZ: For us, it starts when a company is born. We don't often invest directly at the early stage. One of the reasons is we have a long history of being limited partners in venture funds in Silicon Valley as well as in Asia.\n\nKRANZ: We invest directly in companies at the growth stage. Over the past few years, we invested several billion dollars in minority tech growth deals. My team has over 50 companies in eight countries. The check sizes per company, they range on one extreme single-digit millions and on the other extreme, single-digit billions.\n\nKRANZ: Companies will transition to the public markets. And at that stage, we have been very different from a typical VC or private-equity fund. We think that post-IPO the returns continue to compound. We have the flexibility to hold the stock long-term.\n\nKRANZ: Most institutions that look like us will define specific departments that have severe limits on stage or geography or sector. And in some cases, the really big institutions will tell founders, 'You should only call us if the check size is really, really big.' We don't think that way. The reason is if we can have this life-cycle engagement with the company it can lead to things beyond investment in that specific asset.\n\nKRANZ: The heuristic we have in our team is that one day we want them to be standalone, enduring, public, profitable companies that are category creators, category leaders, founder-led. That's kind of the checklist of what you want the end-result to look like. And it's actually ideal if they end up standalone public companies because we can keep holding it and watch returns compound year after year.\n\nLIM: If you invest in these early-stage companies, potential disrupters, you may gain some knowledge about what will happen to other parts of the universe. That is not the one and only reason you invest. We want to make money.\n\nKRANZ: Interactions. If there's bike sharing, ride sharing, what's the interactions of those trends with other things? Would you design your restaurant, would you locate your restaurant differently?\n\nThe advances of transportation networks, where consumers want to go, what it means for other types of enterprises.\n\nWhat we try to do is we say, well, where is that change happening first? It may not be San Francisco. It may not be Beijing.\n\nWe're looking around the world to see where this topic unfolds and creates interactions, and we hope from that, we may have a list of things that we can do in anticipation.\n\nKRANZ: Just as an extreme, one of the members of my team went and registered as an employee at an online grocery delivery company. And through her work, we were able to understand how fast you can possibly run around at a grocery store and pick products and bring them into a car and deliver them to a house.\n\nWe talk to customers, not through a blind survey, but actually by calling them.\n\nWe'll be employees of some of our companies; whatever it takes to truly understand what's ticking and what's working.\n\nLIM: There is this general theme about restrictions of all forms. In today's world, the supply chain is very tight. Every time you have frictions, or restrictions, it makes it harder for businesses. Generally, that would be a negative.\n\nLIM: We are independent. Temasek (Singapore's other state-owned investment firm) is a fellow investor that we sometimes work with. We also work with other long-term investors. We don't coordinate (with Temasek).\n\nI would say from our point of view, it is good that Singapore has two managers who hopefully can look at the best opportunities.",

                "title": "Tesla Shows Signs of a Model 3 Surge",
                "body": "As the quarter ends, Bloomberg's tracker suggests a strong finish after three months of production turmoil.\n\nIt's been a rough quarter for the rollout of Tesla's Model 3. There were faulty robots at the Nevada battery factory and an idled production line in California. Reservation holders from San Diego to Brooklyn, New York, saw their delivery times pushed back. What should have felt like a cascade of electric cars flooding American streets seemed more like a trickle.\n\nNow, with less than two weeks left in the quarter, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is looking to make up for lost time. \"Just got back from Gigafactory,\" he said on Twitter before dawn Thursday. \"Will be at our Fremont factory in the morning. Tesla team is going all out.\"\n\nThose efforts appear to be paying off.\n\nBloomberg is tracking the Model 3 rollout with an experimental tool that estimates production using vehicle identification numbers (VINs). Our model estimates that Tesla is making 805 Model 3s a week, for a grand total of 10,636 cars so far. But that tells only part of the story. We track two sets of VIN data, and both are showing indications of significant improvement to come.\n\nMethod 1: Registered VINs\n\nFirst, our model looks at batches of VINs that Tesla registers with U.S. safety regulators. So far in March, Tesla has registered four batches -- enough to build 7,192 new Model 3s. Each batch of VINs was larger than the last, and the time between batches was shorter than we've typically seen so far. These are signs of progress.\n\nOur model is, by design, slow to respond to such changes in the data. In order to avoid over-reacting to unusual batches, we've averaged our production rates over time. That means our model's current estimated production rate is still being held back by February's temporary manufacturing pause. We expect the improving trend will continue next week, based on the data we've already received.\n\nMethod 2: Spotted VINs\n\nOur second data set is made up of VINs from Model 3s spotted in the wild (as in, out on the streets) and those reported by new owners directly to Bloomberg. This week those VINs breached a new threshold, exceeding 12,000 for the first time, with five new record-high VINs. The trajectory of the reported VINs is steeper and more consistent than we've seen before, and our model's estimates are just beginning to reflect that.\n\nBoth of our methods are designed for long-term accuracy, but they take some time to register sudden shifts. The tracker currently shows Tesla making 810 Model 3s a week, up from 693 in the prior week. However, we think our model may be underestimating what's going on at the Tesla plants. Based on some of the numbers we're seeing, we think it's possible that Tesla could already be producing well over 1,000 a week and climbing.\n\nTesla Model 3 Tracker\n\nThat doesn't make up for all of Tesla's first-quarter production woes. At the start of the year, Tesla said it was already capable of cranking out 1,000 Model 3s a week and would finish the quarter at 2,500 a week. Bloomberg's model suggests Tesla is still nowhere near where it wanted to be -- but there's still one week left to make up some ground.",

Una exclusión para esos países después del 1 de mayo dependerá del estado de las \"negociaciones de medios alternativos satisfactorios a largo plazo para abordar la amenaza de deterioro a la seguridad nacional de Estados Unidos\", dijo la Casa Blanca.\n\nLos jefes de gobierno de la UE respondieron con una declaración en términos muy incisivos que expresa \"pesar\" de que Trump haya impuesto los aranceles a los metales, destacando que las medidas no abordan la raíz del problema del exceso de capacidad e insistiendo en que Europa ya ha ofrecido la \"cooperación total\" a EE.UU. para ayudar a reequilibrar el mercado global.\n\n\"Estas medidas no pueden justificarse sobre la base de la seguridad nacional y la protección sectorial en EE.UU. es una solución inadecuada para los problemas reales de exceso de capacidad\", dijeron los 28 líderes nacionales del bloque en el comunicado publicado el viernes en Bruselas.\n\nLa UE ha pasado las últimas semanas luchando por una exención de los aranceles a los metales impuestos por EE.UU. al tiempo que ha advertido que el no obtenerla conduciría a una represalia sobre importaciones de bienes estadounidenses avaluados en 2.800 millones de euros (US$3.500 millones), las que incluyen motocicletas Harley-Davidson Inc., jeans Levi Strauss & Co. y whisky bourbon.\n\nLa UE dijo además que, sin una exención, presentaría una queja ante la Organización Mundial del Comercio contra la administración Trump e introduciría medidas de \"salvaguardia\" para evitar que los envíos de metales desde otras partes del mundo a EE.UU. se desvíen al mercado europeo y lo inunden. China anunció que presentaría una queja ante la OMC tras no obtener ninguna exclusión de los gravámenes estadounidense a los metales.\n\nLa declaración de los líderes de la UE \"toma nota de que los envíos de acero y aluminio de la Unión Europea han sido eximidos temporalmente de dichas medidas y solicita que esa exención se haga permanente\". Asimismo menciona el derecho de la UE \"a responder a las medidas de EE.UU. según corresponda y de manera proporcionada\".\n\nPóngase en contacto con nosotros y contrate nuestro servicio Bloomberg Professional.",

                "body": "Pentagon chief's influence shown in Trump move to sign budget\n\nPresident Donald Trump's shakeup of his national security team adds to the burden on one man at the center of any decision about war and peace: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\nLong a champion of alliances and diplomacy, Mattis increasingly finds himself surrounded by policy hawks on issues from Iran to North Korea. Yet his command of the nation's 1.2 million active duty personnel makes him uniquely placed to steer Trump away from any rash decision to unleash the U.S. military.\n\nTrump stunned his own aides this month by reshaping his foreign policy team in a more hawkish bent ahead of a key decision on the Iran nuclear deal and a historic summit with North Korea's leader. With a tweet, he said he'd replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Then Thursday he tapped former United Nations ambassador John Bolton to be his third national security adviser in 14 months, dismissing H.R. McMaster.\n\nWhile the 67-year-old Mattis has broken with his boss on several top policy issues, he's as permanent a fixture as anyone can be in the tumultuous Trump administration.\n\n\"He'll be the last man standing,\" said MacKenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. \"He is the most powerful Cabinet member and knows it. He gets to run DoD and be a shadow secretary of state.\"\n\nMattis made rare public comments alongside Trump on Friday when the president announced his decision to sign a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that earlier in the day he threatened to veto. Trump cited a $70 billion boost to the Pentagon budget as the overriding reason for him to sign the legislation, singling out a number of priority weapons projects that could now go forward.\n\n\"We need to take care of our military,\" Trump said.\n\nTaking the microphone, the four-star general lauded Trump's decision to sign the funding bill by citing comments attributed to President George Washington in the 1790s, saying the support will help guarantee peace. \"We in the military are humbled\" by the backing provided by the American people, he added.\n\nIt's clear from their relationship that Mattis \"won't be next\" to leave the administration, Eaglen said, even though his three predecessors at the Pentagon -- Ash Carter, Chuck Hagel and Leon Panetta -- each lasted two years or less in the job.\n\nSee a list of all the officials who have left the Trump White House\n\nMattis, who Trump introduced to the country more than a year ago using the general's \"Mad Dog\" nickname, will still have to contend with the rise of Pompeo and Bolton. The two are widely viewed as more hardline conservatives who have openly championed the utility of regime change and pre-emptive strikes abroad.\n\nSo far, Mattis's term as defense secretary has been characterized by a low-profile approach seemingly designed to limit \"gotcha\" moments where he might be seen as openly contradicting his boss. He's held only two televised press conferences in the Pentagon briefing room -- one last April after a cruise missile attack on Syria and the other in May, directed by Trump, to tout progress against the Islamic State.\n\nBut he has shown flashes of disagreement.\n\nIn a pep talk overseas last year, Mattis told U.S. soldiers to \"hold the line\" until Americans respect each other again, a comment many analysts interpreted as a criticism of the rhetoric emerging from Washington.\n\nAfter Trump said in August that U.S. forces were \"locked and loaded\" to confront the North Korean regime, Mattis helped calm tensions by saying \"nothing's changed\" in U.S. force posture and continuing with a tour of the U.S. west coast. \"U.S. forces maintain their usual high state of readiness in their deployed positions,\" he said.\n\nAnd while Trump has repeatedly labeled the 2015 deal with Iran to curtail its nuclear program a \"disaster,\" and threatened to tear the agreement up by mid-May, Mattis has been more cautious. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee in October that if the U.S. \"can confirm that Iran is living by the agreement,\" he believed \"this is something the president should consider staying with.\"\n\nThat tightrope act between moderation and bombast seems to have worked so far. Trump referred to Mattis as \"our great military genius-slash-person\" in December. And the defense secretary earned a laudatory presidential tweet when he said it would be \"game on\" if North Korea fires missiles at the U.S.\n\nIn at least one way, Mattis has had a simpler job than any of his counterparts did: he oversees a department whose success Trump holds paramount and whose budget he has long sought to increase.\n\nUnlike Tillerson, Mattis also seems to have earned the right to steer his department as he sees fit. On foreign policy, Trump once said \"I'm the only one that matters.\" He's made no such claim when it comes to military issues, seeming to treat the military brass as a breed apart. Trump early on moved to give his generals in the field -- from Afghanistan to Syria -- more direct authority over combat decisions.\n\nThe question now is whether Mattis will find Bolton and Pompeo chipping away at his powers. Mattis had a strong alliance with Tillerson -- they frequently coordinated their positions -- in a partnership that was a break from past tensions between the heads of the Pentagon and the State Department.\n\nNow, however, he finds himself surrounded by Cabinet members and advisers who disagree with his worldview, experienced bureaucratic insiders who enjoy the rough-and-tumble of Washington politics. Mattis is a firm believer in the so-called rules-based international order, under which the U.S. pays for the bulk of institutions such as the United Nations and NATO as a way of ensuring stability and maintaining its influence.\n\nOf course, there's never any guarantees in the Trump White House. The president has frequently proven quick to sour on top aides whose views he disagrees with, with almost half of his key advisers leaving since he took office.\n\n\"Mattis is now more isolated,\" said Byron Callan, a defense markets and politics analyst in Washington for Capital Alpha Partners LLC. \"He had kindred spirits in Tillerson and McMaster.\"\n\nIf Mattis were to leave this year, he'd be the fourth consecutive defense secretary to do so after serving less than 24 months. Panetta, asked by President Barack Obama to shift over from the Central Intelligence Agency to the Pentagon, served less than two years, from July 2011 to February 2013.\n\nHis successor, former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel, lasted a little longer -- from February 2013 to February 2015. Hagel was succeeded by his deputy, Carter, who filled the position until January 2017.\n\nThose who know Mattis say that he will play a more important role than ever now, with Iran deal decision looming and the president's planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un coming as soon as May.\n\n\"Trump is the decider and while he is a saber rattler I think he is very reluctant to get into conflicts that are dangerous with people who can shoot back,\" said James Jeffrey, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Studies who was previously ambassador in Iraq, where Mattis commanded the 1st Marine Division during the most recent war.\n\nJeffrey said he expects Mattis to resist any effort by Bolton to encourage another war. Even if he pushes, Jeffrey said, the Pentagon chief \"won't loan him an army to carry it out.\"",

It appeared first on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nThe future of brick-and-mortar retailers isn't as dire as it would appear. The bulk of overall retail sales -- more than 90% -- is from physical stores, making their revenue essential. The segment is evolving by transforming stores into attractive destinations, which helps stem further share loss. Experiences, differentiated products and adjusting store sizes aid the transformation. Slowing store traffic, with consumers favoring digital, and rising expenses are challenges that must be overcome to remain in the game.\n\nRetailers increased the number of stores too quickly starting at the turn of the century and must shrink to grow again or redirect and share the excess square footage. Those with more-balanced store portfolios can drive gains, decoupled from square-footage growth, by focusing on product, speed and execution.",

In 2010, in response to an institutional client asking if the bank routed orders to electronic traders on the way to other venues, BofA falsely denied that it did.\n\nIn another exchange in 2013, an institutional client asked for the names of all the other venues where the bank sent orders. A Bank of America salesperson drafted a response that identified the outside traders, but after some internal debate, including a managing director asking \"is there anything you want to streamline or eliminate (i.e., the HFT stuff at the end of to whom do we route)?\" the trading firms were deleted.\n\nThe bank also swapped in its own trading identification code in reports to customers, removing the codes of the outside firms, according to the New York attorney general.

The companies had been discussing the A330neo as a possible substitute for an unwanted A350 aircraft deal, and the decision means the U.S. carrier appears set to buy more Boeing Co. 787s.\n\n\"In this case, the competition simply priced their aircraft lower than we were willing to offer,\" Airbus said in a statement. \"We look forward to the next opportunity to compete with what we know is a superior product.\"\n\nBoeing spokesman Paul Bergman declined to comment on Airbus's remarks. American Airlines didn't immediately comment. The carrier said in January that it was considering the re-engined A330 and 787-9 as possible replacements for the 22 A350s ordered more than a decade ago.\n\nAirbus said it has a series of ongoing sales campaigns for the A330neo with more than 100 airlines that currently operate the older version of the plane. The 250-seat A330-800 is on track for its first flight in the middle of this year, with the bigger -900 variant set to enter into service around the same time to launch operator TAP -- Air Portugal.\n\nBoeing last month secured an order for 10 787 Dreamliners from Hawaiian Airlines after that carrier canceled an earlier deal for six A330-800s.\n\nAmerican Airlines inherited the A350 contract from US Airways when it merged with the smaller carrier in 2013 but is reluctant to operate such a comparatively small fleet.",

We are going very close to it. It was a deal that was causing a lot of problems for our country in terms of employment and in terms of lots of other things.\"\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross elaborated, saying the U.S. is close to a \"pretty comprehensive resolution\" with South Korea. \"It will encompass, if it goes through, both the 232s and broader trade issues,\" Ross said, referring to section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. It was the legal clause the president used to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the grounds they threaten national security.\n\nSouth Korea was among several U.S. allies initially excluded from the tariffs when they took effect Friday. The U.S. spared these countries as it negotiates with them on the conditions under which they may be exempted on a permanent basis.\n\nU.S. and South Korean officials met this month for the latest round of talks to amend their free-trade agreement, which Trump has called unfair to America. Before the negotiating round, Trump hinted the U.S. might withdraw troops from South Korea if it doesn't get a satisfactory overhaul of the trade agreement.",

                "body": "Agency official to meet with California regulator next week\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that a landmark Obama-era effort to cut vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions is too aggressive and agrees with automakers that the standards should be revised, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe agency has completed a draft decision outlining the rationale for easing fuel efficiency regulations for model-year 2022-2025 cars and light trucks, two people said. Bill Wehrum, chief of the agency's Office of Air and Radiation, plans to meet with environmental regulators in California next week to discuss the draft decision ahead of an April 1 deadline to make it public, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision hasn't been made public.\n\nIn an email, EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman confirmed the agency has sent a draft of the decision on the standards to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, and that the final determination will be signed by April 1. Bowman did not describe the contents of the draft.\n\nThe EPA has not determined what the new tailpipe-emission standards should be, the people said. However, the move is widely expected to result in weaker targets that will be easier for automakers to achieve as sales skew toward SUVs, pickups and other light trucks.\n\nEarlier: EPA Chief Signals Showdown With California on Tailpipe Rules\n\nFinalizing the decision next week will set in motion a longer-term EPA process needed to re-write the tailpipe rules enacted by President Barack Obama's administration. The rules aimed to slash carbon emissions from cars and light trucks by boosting fuel economy to a fleet average of more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. That's equivalent to roughly 36 mpg in real-world driving.\n\nThe EPA's so-called final determination marks the culmination of a yearlong re-evaluation of the Obama-era rules that was announced by President Donald Trump in March 2017. He touted the move in his State of the Union address in January, saying, \"In Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America's autoworkers -- so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again.\"\n\nReopening the review nullified an EPA decision during Obama's last days in office to finalize the rules without changes after a lengthy analysis that found automakers could meet the standards at a reasonable cost.\n\nWhy Trump Would Want to Slow Tough Fuel Standards: QuickTake Q&A\n\nAutomakers aggressively lobbied the Trump administration to reopen the review, saying it was ended prematurely without an adequate consideration of how gas prices, consumer preferences and other issues had changed the auto market since the rules were agreed upon in 2011.\n\nThe EPA's decision also raises the specter of a legal battle with California regulators, who in 2011 agreed to align their own vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions standards with the federal rules. The deal, which had the support nearly every major carmaker, ensured consistent mileage and greenhouse-gas rules nationwide.\n\nTrump officials have been in talks with California Air Resources Board officials about the future of the rules but there have been no signs of an agreement. A spokesman for the agency did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nIf a deal to maintain that consistency can't be reached, automakers could face a regulatory patchwork with EPA tailpipe rules in most states and California-set efficiency rules in that state and several others that have adopted California's rules. Those states together account for about a third of the U.S. auto market.",

They'll also look at progress on simplifying executive compensation and reporting how much company chiefs are remunerated.\n\n\"Excessive executive pay and gaps in gender pay are at root an issue of fairness,\" Committee Chair Rachel Reeves said in the statement. \"Awards for top bosses which vastly outstrip worker pay and which owe little to building genuine long-term value in a company are impossible to justify and damage the social contract between business and the public.\"\n\nRead more: A QuickTake on what the pay gap figures are telling us\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly spoken out against excessive wages in the corporate sector, and last year introduced measures to strengthen mandatory reporting around executive compensation. But she was criticized for stepping back from plans for tougher measures, including putting workers on company boards, and in the wake of corporate failures such as Carillion Plc's bankruptcy earlier this year, lawmakers are keen to show they're prepared to get tough.\n\nThe committee's probe will include an examination of the role played by remuneration committees, institutional investors and shareholders in containing outsized deals for directors and management. Another area of interest for lawmakers is the use of so-called claw-back provisions to reclaim cash and share bonuses from company chiefs in the event of poor performance.\n\n\"Unjustified executive pay awards are the most corrosive influence on public trust in business and businesses must face up to their responsibilities and tackle this problem,\" Reeves said. \"If businesses don't step up on executive pay, Government will need to step in.\"",

                "body": "Investors have gone gaga over Dropbox Inc. in its first few hours as a public company. It looks as if their enthusiasm has become overheated.\n\nShares of Dropbox, the digital file-cabinet company, shot up about 39 percent on Friday from their initial sale price. That gives Dropbox a valuation of about $13 billion, including the value of shares held by employees and others. Dropbox's multiple of revenue now stands at about 12 based on 2017 revenue, which is on the high end for companies that sell subscription software to businesses.\n\nAs I have written previously, the vast majority of Dropbox's paying customers are individuals who sign up on their own. The majority of customers for other subscription software firms such as Workday Inc., Salesforce.com Inc. and similarly named Box Inc. are companies. That made it unclear whether investors would choose to value Dropbox in that familiar category.\n\nAt least on Dropbox's first day as a public company, the wisdom of the market crowd is that Dropbox is a business-software company despite its difference. And investors have decided Dropbox deserves to be valued on the high side of subscription software firms. Dropbox's price-to-sales ratio is about double that of Box, higher than that of Salesforce and in the territory of Workday, which tends to have a rich valuation in its category.\n\nYes, Dropbox is growing quickly, generates impressive cash flow and spends far less than a typical subscription software company to find and lure new paying customers. For now, stock market investors have decided those characteristics deserve a rich premium to most of Dropbox's peers -- or quasi-peers.\n\nDropbox's success on Day One should give hope to other young tech companies that don't neatly fit with software companies that came before. SurveyMonkey, DocuSign, Slack and Evernote are other firms that sell software by subscription and rely to varying degrees on the Dropbox-like approach of appealing to individual users rather than pitching their software to the corporate bosses that spend trillions of dollars a year on workplace technology.\n\nOnly time will tell whether investors' first day enthusiasm about Dropbox will last. The company may actually be worth more than a typical business-software firm that must spend lavishly to land picky corporate technology buyers. But Dropbox stock buyers are putting a lot of faith in a company that has a relatively novel business model and economic characteristics and that struggled until relatively recently to hit its financial stride.",

Earlier in March he said that he had been a member of a Facebook group where such views were expressed, but that he had never seen them.\n\nOn Friday, Labour lawmaker Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, said she'd challenged Corbyn's office about a Facebook post he made five years ago. At the time, Los Angeles-based artist Kalen Ockerman, the artist who had painted the London mural, had complained it was being painted over in response to criticism. \"You are in good company,\" Corbyn replied. \"Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.\"\n\nAfter Berger's questions, Corbyn's office released a statement. \"In 2012, Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on the grounds of freedom of speech,\" it said. \"However, the mural was offensive, used anti-Semitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed.\"\n\nBerger described that response as \"wholly inadequate.\"\n\n\"It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about anti-Semitism,\" she said on Twitter. \"I will be raising this further.\"\n\nOckerman didn't respond to an email requesting comment. In 2012, he denied the painting was anti-Semitic. \"My mural is about class & privilege,\" the Daily Mail quoted him as saying. \"The banker group is made up of Jewish & white Anglos.\"",

The company has yet to deliver written answers to the committee's requests, which come as lawmakers consider whether new laws or regulations are needed to protect privacy and require disclosure of political advertising online.\n\nFacebook earlier said it was reviewing the House invite to testify.\n\n\"While our internal and external reviews are still ongoing, we appreciated the opportunity to explain what we know, as well as to outline both the steps we have already taken and those we will take to address these challenges,\" company spokesman Andy Stone said.\n\nOther committees that could call Zuckerberg to testify include the Judiciary and Intelligence panels.",

El documento especifica por primera vez cuándo terminarán esas exenciones, lo que aumenta la presión para que se llegue a un acuerdo sobre el TLCAN alrededor de la misma fecha.\n\nUn comunicado de la Casa Blanca señala que Trump decidirá el 1 de mayo \"si continuará eximiendo a estos países de los aranceles, según el estado de las discusiones\". México señaló que necesita un acuerdo para fines de abril, o que las negociaciones se extiendan hasta después de las elecciones del país en el verano boreal, y luego las elecciones de mitad de mandato en EE.UU. este otoño boreal.\n\nCanadá y México continúan presionando por exenciones permanentes de los aranceles, que se establecieron en un 25 por ciento para el acero y un 10 por ciento para el aluminio. Canadá es la principal fuente de importaciones de acero y aluminio de EE.UU. El acero está estrechamente ligado al sector automotor, una de las disputas centrales en el TLCAN y en la que se ha avanzado recientemente.\n\n\"EE.UU. continúa las negociaciones con Canadá y México\", junto con la Unión Europea, Corea del Sur y otros, \"sobre medidas alternativas satisfactorias para abordar la amenaza a la seguridad nacional que constituyen las importaciones de artículos de acero de esos países\", según el anuncio de Trump.\n\nTrump se comprometió a aplicarlos a menos que \"determine mediante un nuevo anuncio que EE.UU. ha llegado a una medida alternativa satisfactoria\" para abordar la \"amenaza a la seguridad\" del sector siderúrgico.\n\nLa medida se produce después de recientes señales de optimismo sobre las conversaciones del TLCAN. El primer ministro canadiense, Justin Trudeau, dijo esta semana que \"parece haber un cierto impulso alrededor de la mesa\" y que \"un acuerdo en el que todos ganen no solo es posible sino probable\". El representante comercial de EE.UU., Robert Lighthizer, dijo el miércoles que los países están \"finalmente comenzando a converger\" en el crucial tema de las reglas del sector automotor, pero advirtió el jueves que se estaba acabando el tiempo.\n\n\"Creo que se está logrando un importante avance, pero rápidamente nos estamos quedando sin tiempo si queremos que se realice esta votación del Congreso sobre una aprobación final\", dijo Lighthizer el jueves en Washington durante una audiencia en el Senado.\n\nPóngase en contacto con nosotros y contrate nuestro servicio Bloomberg Professional.",

                "body": "\"Trump adviser\" is an oxymoron. Thus it has always been, and thus it shall ever be.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has rarely sought or heeded the advice of others, beginning several decades ago when he was a young developer in New York, through his years as a tabloid fixture and reality TV star, and on into the White House.\n\nThe president trusts his own instincts first and foremost, and lacks the attention span, curiosity and empathy to take other points of view on board. This should be no revelation to anyone observing the inner workings of the Oval Office lately, or to anyone climbing aboard the Trump Train now. It is, as they say, a feature of life in this White House, not a bug.\n\nAs I noted in a column early last year, beheadings are \"Trump being Trump, and the country he's presiding over should brace itself accordingly.\" Yet the fact that \"Trump adviser\" is a contradiction in terms and West Wing churn is expected hasn't kept ambitious people from thinking -- bless their souls -- that they might be able to ride things out and even get the president to listen to them.\n\nChris Christie, Rudy Giuliani, Cory Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, Mike Dubke, Katie Walsh, Steve Bannon, Rex Tillerson, Dina Powell and Gary Cohn are case studies.\n\nJohn Dowd and H.R. McMaster can join the list, too.\n\nDowd, who was Trump's lead attorney handling Special Counselor Robert Mueller's investigation, left his White House job on Thursday. An injudicious lawyer who seemed occasionally to have done as much to encourage the president's worst habits as to restrain them, Dowd said he quit because...wait for it, wait for it...Trump wasn't taking his advice.\n\nBut Dowd's announcement barely got a chance to register before the next departure hit the news. On Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter to defenestrate McMaster:\n\nAs national security adviser, McMaster had been dispensing wisdom that Trump didn't want to hear. And he even had \"adviser\" in his job title! While Trump is president, the role should probably be renamed \"national security buddy\" or \"national security whatever.\"\n\nTrump's tweet caught even McMaster's replacement, John Bolton, off guard. And it apparently also came as a surprise to a White House staff anticipating that others might be axed alongside McMaster as part of a group purge. How are you feeling today Ben Carson and David Shulkin? How about you, Jeff Sessions and John Kelly? And you, Ryan Zinke and Scott Pruitt?\n\nTrump has come to enjoy making his hostages -- er, teammates -- walk the plank on Twitter, as Tillerson learned. Stressed-out West Wing employees should probably keep an even closer eye on their social media feeds.\n\nSo who's attracted to working for such a boss, and who thrives in such an environment? Those questions continue to fascinate students of the Trump administration, because they say as much about human nature as they do about the president's mismanagement.\n\nTrump's fresh replacements, Bolton and economic adviser Larry Kudlow, are both strong-minded ultra-conservatives with long track records -- and both prone to Manichean views of the world.\n\nBolton's idea of how best to manage international threats more or less boils down to bomb them before they bomb you. Kudlow believes that endless tax cuts will ignite a supply-side economic boom. Both men also had become fixtures of conservative television so long in the tooth, they seemed unlikely to land meaningful positions in any White House.\n\nTrump, a policy apostate presiding over the most shambolic administration in modern U.S. history, is giving them a shot at wedding extremism to policy -- at least for as long as Trump keeps them in the game.\n\nWhat about those who have stayed, and even thrived in Trumplandia, while other advisers have fallen by the wayside? Sarah Huckabee Sanders is one such survivor.\n\nDay in, day out, the president's press secretary commands the briefing-room podium, sometimes dissembling, runnning interference and offering silly justifications for bad behavior. A week ago, she said McMaster would not be fired. If she believed that, Trump helped undermine her credibility. If she knew it not to be true, then she and the president may be kindred spirits. Watch Sanders talk about Trump, Russia and Putin if you want to see someone whose expressions and locution are malleable enough to contain explanations for just about anything.\n\nUnlike Spicer, who regularly appeared discombobulated, Sanders displays nary a tic and shows no outward signs that the work is taking a physical or psychological toll. So what traits distinguish White House advisers who can survive? For starters, they must possess transactional values, be unburdened by regret, and understand that they are there to foster a cult of personality around the boss.\n\nThey must also know that it's not their job to provide advice.",

Others raised doubts, though they still signed up to the tough language in the collective communique from this week's EU summit in Brussels.\n\nWhen May said on March 12 that Russia was \"highly likely\" to blame for the attack, it was imperative for Britain to find international allies to back up her assessment. That need became urgent two days later when she ordered the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats who she said were actually spies.\n\nYet support was slow to materialize. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, first gave a muted response -- whilst still expressing shock and sympathy with the British. Some suggested Macron wanted more evidence before committing himself to blaming the Kremlin, though one official familiar with the matter said this interpretation was mistaken and that the French leader was solidly supportive from the start.\n\nOn March 15, May won some breathing space with a coordinated joint statement from herself, Merkel, Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they were \"horrified\" by the attack and shared the British assessment that there was \"no plausible alternative explanation\" to Russia being responsible.\n\nAfter British officials made their case to the United Nations and to NATO, they turned their attention to the EU. Despite the U.K. leaving, May has said she wants to maintain close security ties to the bloc after Brexit, and the Skripal case was a test of that policy.\n\nLeading up to this week's EU summit, British officials worked overtime to explain the nature of the Russian attack to members. Doubters were said to include Greece, Hungary, and Italy.\n\nThis is when Sedwill showed his value to May, traveling with his team to Brussels to share detailed intelligence in person. Specifically, he told each one of the 27 other EU member states exactly which so-called Russian Novichok nerve agent was used in the attack.\n\nThe U.K. had two key objectives: to persuade all EU leaders to sign up to a tough statement blaming Russia explicitly for the attack; and to help individual countries understand the need to take down Putin's spy networks -- potentially by expelling agents posing as legitimate diplomats in the way May had done.\n\nBut despite Sedwill's efforts, British lobbying appeared to be coming up short. By Wednesday, the day before the summit opened, the language contained in draft conclusions that leaders would sign up to was weak. Rather than blaming Russia directly, it said that the summit \"takes extremely seriously\" the U.K.'s assessment that Putin's government was responsible.\n\nSo now it was May's turn.\n\nWhen she arrived at the Europa Building in Brussels on Thursday afternoon, May met with Nordic-Baltic allies, including the leaders of Denmark, Sweden, Latvia, and Lithuania. These countries understand the threat posed by Russia in their immediate neighborhood and gave May their backing.\n\nAt 7.15 p.m., May met her staunchest security allies in the EU -- Macron and Merkel. She updated them on the U.K.'s investigation into the nerve-agent attack, and it was this short meeting that provided the crucial template for the broader late-night discussions that followed.\n\nThe three leaders agreed that the EU must send \"a strong European message in response to Russia's actions,\" the British government said in a statement afterward.\n\nAll the EU leaders then gathered for dinner in the summit center, and at 8.30 p.m., the prime minister made her pitch.\n\n\"What happened in Salisbury on March 4 was not only a crime against the Skripals or the people of Salisbury,\" May said. \"It was an attack on the rules-based system and European values which all of us hold dear. The depth of outrage across Europe is a clear recognition of this.\"\n\nMacron and the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar supported her, arguing for tougher language to be included in the summit text. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki pushed for a \"strong response, one showing solidarity\" with the U.K. over the \"scary\" attack, he said later.\n\nAgain May met resistance from others. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras seemed the most uncomfortable. He spoke to Putin by phone for half an hour on Thursday, congratulating him on his re-election. An official said there was \"good chemistry\" between the two leaders and revealed that Putin had invited Tsipras to visit the Kremlin.\n\nDuring the dinner, the Greek premier questioned whether the leaders' summit was the right forum to go into a criminal investigation of this kind. He opposed hardening the language of the summit conclusions, and cautioned that the EU's declaration must not be so strong as to make sanctions inevitable.\n\nItalian premier Paolo Gentiloni also had doubts, according to some diplomats, along with Austria's chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who argued against recalling ambassadors from Moscow on the grounds that May had left the British envoy in place.\n\nShortly after the summit ended, Gentiloni told reporters he endorsed the EU's decision, but cautioned against an escalation or closing off the dialogue with Russia.\n\nThe debate over dinner was sober and intense, and lasted more than two hours without an agreement. To those in the room, it appeared that May and her two chief allies -- Macron and Merkel -- had agreed tactics beforehand.\n\nThe German chancellor, so often the linchpin of the EU, then made two interventions, arguing firmly that the bloc must not shy away from laying the blame where the evidence pointed: At the Kremlin door.\n\nThen at 10.41 p.m., European Council President Donald Tusk announced an agreement. He set out the key phrases in a tweet he posted while sitting at the dinner table: \"EUCO agrees with UK government that highly likely Russia is responsible for #SalisburyAttack and that there is no other plausible explanation.\"\n\nMay's officials were delighted -- and surprised. Persuading the EU to take such a line as a group of 28 individual countries can take months. The bloc even went further, taking the unprecedented step of recalling its ambassador to Moscow for talks on the crisis.\n\nBy Friday morning, several leaders were openly discussing how they would follow words with deeds, which could include expelling Putin's spies from their own territories. In his summing up, Tusk suggested some countries will announce their next steps on Monday.\n\n\"It's not the end of our actions,\" he said.",

                "body": "President tweeted he was considering veto over immigration\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he has signed a spending bill funding the federal government for the next six months, reversing a veto threat he made earlier Friday that shocked Washington after his administration had previously said he would approve the legislation.\n\nTrump's turnabout came after a meeting with Defense Secretary James Mattis, who advocated for the bill's increases in defense spending and wanted the relative certainty of six months of assured funding.\n\n\"My highest duty is to keep America safe. Nothing more important,\" Trump said at the White House. \"But I say to Congress: I will never sign another bill like this again.\"\n\nThe spending bill appeared to only be waiting for Trump's signature when he tweeted Friday morning that he was \"considering a VETO\" because the bill does not fully fund a wall on the Mexican border or create a solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a program protecting some undocumented immigrants from deportation that Trump chose last year to end.\n\nThe veto threat injected chaos into what appeared to be the end of a protracted struggle to settle on a funding plan for the federal government. A month of negotiations between Republicans and Democrats culminated in a deal to raise defense and domestic spending following a bruising fight that triggered a shutdown in January.\n\nTrump called it a \"ridiculous situation\" before handing over his podium to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to briefly discuss a trade deal with South Korea. Afterward, Trump said he wants the power to issue line-item vetoes on spending bills -- a power many presidents have demanded, and that Congress has never granted -- and that the Senate should eliminate the ability of a minority to filibuster legislation.\n\nThe federal fiscal year began Oct. 1.\n\nTop administration officials including Vice President Mike Pence and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney gave assurances on Thursday that Trump would sign the bill, which cleared both chambers of Congress that day.\n\nTrump said he had seriously considered vetoing the bill but \"because of the incredible gains we've been able to make for the military that overrode any of our thinking.\"\n\nA veto would have almost certainly triggered a partial government shutdown, the third since the start of the year, since many lawmakers left Washington after the legislation won final passage. Funding for the federal government was set to run out at 12:01 a.m Saturday.\n\n\"We wanted to include DACA in this bill, but Democrats wouldn't do that,\" Trump said.\n\nCongressional aides said that the White House had suggested a three-year extension of the DACA program in exchange for $25 billion in funding for the border wall, a proposal Democrats rejected. Democrats offered to provide the money but only if Trump agreed to provide DACA recipients with a path to U.S. citizenship, as he had in an earlier debate. The White House rejected the counteroffer.",

                "body": "As central bankers attempt to normalize policy, there is a risk carry trades will collapse.\n\nQuantitative easing saved us from the 2008 crash and jump-started a recovery. It also encouraged a build-up of one-sided risk in the financial system. Are markets and the economy ready for the exit?\n\nThe sudden rise in volatility in February and March showed that even with strong growth fundamentals, financial markets remain vulnerable. Since 2008, there have been seven flash crashes followed by sudden recoveries. Volatility has become binary, with markets swinging between periods of shock and calm. The VIX index traded at a median of 16 after the start of QE and at 18 before, but the spikes in volatility have become twice as frequent. It is the equivalent of swapping a stable drizzle rain with many days of scorching sun, at the price of occasional natural disasters.\n\nAs central bankers attempt to normalize policy, there is a risk that carry trades in financial markets will collapse, with a negative spill over to the real economy.\n\nCentral banks bought $21 trillion in government debt globally, pushing investors to search for yield in riskier markets. The result is a pyramid of trades dependent on stable interest rates: $12 trillion of government debt yields less than 1 percent and $11 trillion of corporate debt have yields near record lows. About $8 trillion of high-dividend and growth stocks trade at record high valuations, as cash-flows and growth rates are discounted at near-zero rates. At the top of the pyramid are strategies betting on stable volatility and asset correlations, which total up to $2 trillion, according to our estimates.\n\nWhile carry trades flourished, the architecture of financial markets has become increasingly fragile. In 1976, Hyman Minsky wrote that a crisis can develop when financial structures amplify rather than dampen an initial shock. Today, there are a number of negative feedback loops across strategies that use leverage, buy illiquid assets or own a large percentage of their asset class. A bank-loan exchange-traded fund issues listed shares, but it takes between 30 and 60 days to settle a loan sale in the secondary market.\n\nThere is also a systemic impact. ETFs own 3.9 percent of U.S. high-yield bonds, more than the inventory of all broker-dealers put together. Together with quantitative funds, passive strategies represent 60 percent of traded volume in equities, according to JPMorgan research. With tighter banking regulation limiting room for trading desks to absorb risk, markets can be caught in violent crosswinds when such strategies unwind.\n\nIn the February sell-off, junk bond ETFs lost around 13 percent of their shares outstanding. Like instantaneous redemptions, these events force the ETFs to sell bonds in the secondary market to redeem shares, accelerating a sell-off. As the Bank for International Settlements warned in a report issued earlier this month, \"the unique structures of ETFs might allow, or even encourage, less stable investment behavior by owners of these products.\" Short volatility strategies act similarly. By selling volatility and put options in good times, they keep equities and credit spreads within a narrow range. Lower volatility, in turn, encourages more investors to pile into the same strategies. In a sell-off, however, the mechanism works the other way around.\n\nThe result is increased fragility: If a flash-crash or an unwind of crowded trades can cripple markets during a global expansion, what will happen in a recession?\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve is normalizing policy rates, the ECB and BOJ remain the fulcrum for central bank balance sheets, making up half of global QE assets. This means it will be more difficult for them to exit without shocks. In turn, financial shocks can hurt economic performance: If the QE worked through a wealth effect on asset prices and consumption, falling markets could reverse it. The top 10 percent of U.S. earners -- who benefited most from rising asset prices -- accounts for a quarter of national spending, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while wage growth remains sluggish.\n\nSince the crisis, regulators focused on raising bank capital to withstand another crisis. The next lightning, however, is likely to strike elsewhere. To ensure a sustainable exit from QE and build a policy buffer against future shocks, central bankers need to fix the fragilities they have implicitly encouraged with low rates and stable forward guidance.\n\nBuilding a resilient market architecture means encouraging heterogeneity of strategies and long-term incentives among market participants, preventing negative feedback loops and promoting instruments that act as circuit-breakers in a crisis. These include convertible bank capital for banks, which help recapitalizing institutions in a crisis, and growth-linked debt for sovereigns, where coupons go down in a slowdown, reducing the need for austerity.\n\nUntil we fix fragility in the financial system, the risk of tail-events will remain high, hurting both markets and the economy. As a result, the likelihood of a full policy normalization will stay low. This explains the recent increased demand for haven assets including long-term U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds, Japanese government debt and emerging-market local currency debt.

But she's surprised the car didn't detect 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she pushed her bike across a road in Tempe, Arizona, around 10 p.m. on Sunday.\n\n\"We are as baffled as anyone else,\" Thoma Hall wrote in an email. \"Certainly, our Lidar is capable of clearly imaging Elaine and her bicycle in this situation. However, our Lidar doesn't make the decision to put on the brakes or get out of her way.\"\n\nVelodyne, which supplies lidar to many of the world's major auto and tech companies, is cooperating with federal investigators to determine what went wrong, Thoma Hall said. She said that the overall function of the self-driving system was the responsibility of Uber Technologies Inc., which was testing the Volvo XC90 model that struck Herzberg. Uber has halted its tests while the crash is being investigated.\n\n\"In addition to Lidar, autonomous systems typically have several sensors, including camera and radar to make decisions,\" she wrote. \"We don't know what sensors were on the Uber car that evening, if they were working, or how they were being used.\"\n\nShe said that lidar has no problems seeing in the dark. \"However, it is up to the rest of the system to interpret and use the data to make decisions. We do not know how the Uber system of decision-making works,\" she added.\n\nRecognizing pedestrians continues to be a challenge for autonomous technology, which will be part of the focus of the investigation. Thoma Hall suggested that those answers will be found at Uber, not Velodyne.\n\n\"We at Velodyne are very sad, and sorry about the recent Uber car accident which took a life,\" she wrote. \"David Hall, company CEO, inventor and founder, believes the accident was not caused by Lidar. The problem lies elsewhere.\"",

                "body": "Replacing McMaster with Bolton shows the president is shedding restraints and taking control.\n\nDonald Trump is becoming the president he always envisioned himself being -- and that many of the foreign-policy hands who opposed his candidacy always feared.\n\nSome critics view the removal of General H.R. McMaster as national security adviser, and his replacement by the longtime Republican hawk John Bolton, as proof that the president is looking for more \"Trumpist\" figures who will reinforce his inclination to deconstruct American global engagement. Actually, Bolton is not a full-throated supporter of Trump's America First agenda: He advocates American alliances and global involvement, and has offered very skeptical views of cooperation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRather, the personnel shift signals that Trump is taking command of his presidency, shedding the constraints at which he has increasingly chafed, and leaving the few remaining \"adults in the room\" increasingly isolated.\n\nLet's take these points in order. First, the past few weeks have shown that Trump is growing more comfortable with the presidency -- and that he is getting tired of taking no for an answer. When he was first elected, he acknowledged that he was initially taken aback by the scope and challenges of the presidency, and by the complexity of issues from North Korea to health care.\n\nAs a result, he was in many cases willing to defer to some of his more moderate or experienced advisers when they urged caution, particularly on foreign policy. Trump refrained from simply withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Act after a coterie of advisers and foreign leaders urged him not to. He bent to the advice of the Pentagon and McMaster in modestly escalating the war in Afghanistan, despite his great skepticism of the U.S. mission there. He did not rip up the Iran nuclear deal, as he had so many times promised to do.\n\nThere were a few issues where the president overruled nearly all of his key aides -- deciding to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, for instance -- but those were the exception rather than the norm.\n\nOne now gets the sense that Trump is done with this approach. He has -- at least by his own erratic standards -- settled into the job; he has grown tired of deferring to the people who work for him. He is thus moving more decisively to put his own stamp on policy and process alike.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has put in place policies such as aluminum and steel tariffs despite internal counsels of restraint (and despite opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill). He has also removed advisers that he clashed with, disliked, or who were urged upon him by the Republican establishment, and appointing aides more in sync with his views on key global issues.\n\nThis leads to the second point: in doing this, Trump is busting through -- or at least weakening -- the constraints that previously inhibited his foreign policy. Of all the factors that made Trump's actual policies, as opposed to his rhetoric, somewhat more moderate than one would have expected during his first year in office, the most important was that the president was simply outnumbered by advisers who fundamentally disagreed with him on a broad range of issues. From Nafta to the Iran nuclear deal to North Korea, those advisers generally played a moderating role -- walking the president back from potentially drastic departures, pushing him toward compromise, and softening his America First agenda.\n\nThis surely frustrated the president: Media reports indicate that Trump was often unhappy with the fact that so many of his advisers seemed intent on restraining his foreign policy instincts. And so Trump is now creating an internal climate more in line with his views.\n\nReplacing Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo at the State Department was a start. Trump thereby traded an adviser who had repeatedly urged caution -- and who had particularly angered Trump by arguing that the U.S. should remain in the Iran nuclear deal -- for one who is more of an Iran hawk and is generally closer to the president's positions. Replacing McMaster with Bolton is even more important.\n\nBolton isn't the unthinking warmonger critics sometimes imagine. But he is a harsh critic of international institutions such as the United Nations (despite once serving as America's representative to that body), he has generally hawkish views on North Korea, and he has repeatedly called for the U.S. to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. And now he occupies perhaps the most important advisory position in the national security establishment.\n\nThe national security adviser is not simply an adviser. He is the bureaucratic gatekeeper and the official charged with shaping the options that are presented to the president for decision. One would expect Bolton -- who also has a reputation for a take-no-prisoners approach to internal debate -- to use those aspects of his new position to empower rather than constrain some of Trump's more strident instincts. This will affect U.S. policy on an array of issues; it almost certainly bodes ill for the Iran nuclear deal as we approach Trump's May deadline for \"fixing\" or withdrawing from that agreement.\n\nFinally, all this means that Trump's remaining moderate advisers are fighting an increasingly lonely battle. Through the first 14 months of Trump's presidency, critics of the president (as well as some of his supporters) have seen Secretary of Defense James Mattis as the critical bulwark against many of the bad ideas they feared Trump would pursue. Although Mattis has, by most accounts, performed this role admirably, he had help in doing so. Tillerson was a bureaucratic ally --albeit a fairly weak one. And while Mattis and McMaster reportedly clashed -- including over McMaster's effort to generate military options for North Korea -- the former national security adviser was generally considered a fairly sober voice on most national security issues. Indeed, it was reportedly McMaster's reluctance to provide Trump with an avenue for withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal -- a stance he shared with Mattis, Tillerson and other key aides -- last July that began souring his relationship with the president.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, Mattis' job has become significantly harder. Both Tillerson and McMaster have been replaced; other establishment figures, such as economic adviser Gary Cohn, have also left the administration. Trump is still unlikely to fire his secretary of defense, even if he wanted to, because he presumably understands that doing so would provoke a bipartisan panic on Capitol Hill and precipitate an open break with Republicans whose support he desperately needs right now.\n\nBut on an array of issues, Mattis is likely to find himself a more isolated figure, cutting against the dominant trend of opinion among Trump's key advisers. Being Trump's defense secretary is probably an exhausting job under any circumstances; one wonders how long Mattis will want to keep it up now that the position has become that much harder.",

                "body": "Automation will dominate some fields. But people will want new things, and new industries will arise.\n\nPredicting the course of technological progress is extremely difficult. Just because worries about human obsolescence ultimately turned out to be misplaced in the Industrial Revolution doesn't mean that the same happy result must necessarily prevail this time around. So the persistent question about artificial intelligence -- or \"robots\" in common parlance - is whether they will make human workers obsolete.\n\nRecent rapid progress in machine learning -- a very powerful and flexible statistical prediction technique -- has raised worries that machines will soon be able to outperform humans at any conceivable task. Already, occupations that employ very large numbers of Americans, such as commercial trucking, are under threat. Workers displaced by machine learning may be able to find new, even more valuable things to do, as happened when industrial technology displaced craft manufacturers over a century ago, or they may not -- and even if they do, getting there may involve a long and bumpy road.\n\nIt's a rich topic, as I was reminded this week at a Bloomberg Ideas conference, where I sat on a panel discussing the economics of artificial intelligence. With all this uncertainty and fear, economists are naturally scrambling to look for evidence on the effects of recent waves of automation.\n\nSo far, the best known study seems to be a 2017 paper by Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo of MIT. Acemoglu and Restrepo find that between 1990 and 2007, places with more robots lost more jobs and saw lower wages. Much of the press has picked up on this study, and taken it as evidence that automation really is bad for workers.\n\nBut there are big caveats to Acemoglu and Restrepo's paper. The kind of robots they look at constitute only a small fraction of the automation technologies being deployed across the world today. Economists from the Economic Policy Institute looked closely at Acemoglu and Restrepo's results and found that investment in computers is associated with job gains rather than losses.\n\nAn accurate picture requires a very general definition of automation. Economists Katja Mann and Lukas Puttmann of the University of Bonn have a new paper in which they observe the march of automation-related technology by looking at patent records. The authors use text algorithms to classify patents into automation patents and others, using their broad definition of \"a device that carries out a process independently.\" This includes things like automated taco machines and hair dye applicators, but not hand-held scanners.\n\nIt's not clear that this is the best way of defining automation -- after all, using a hand-held scanner could involve only a little more human input than pressing the button to start an automated taco machine. But since there's no unique and satisfying definition of automation, Mann and Puttmann's method is probably as good as most. They find, unsurprisingly, that the share of patents related to automation has climbed steeply -- from 25 percent in 1976 to 67 percent in 2014.\n\nThe authors report that this increase in automation technology has not led to the loss of jobs overall -- in fact, probably the opposite. By linking patents with industries and industries with locations, they purport to measure the statistical effect of automation patents on local employment. They find that over a five-year period, automation patents routinely led to an increase in total employment as a percent of population.\n\nAssuming Mann and Puttmann have defined automation right, correctly linked it to specific locations, and chosen the right time period over which to study the impact, this means that automation is creating jobs. That could be because humans continue to find new tasks to perform in order to complement new machines, or it could be because automation leads to a boom that increases local labor demand. Either way, this research represents an important counterpoint to Acemoglu and Restrepo's paper.\n\nThere is one caveat, though -- Mann and Puttmann find that automation is associated with job loss in the manufacturing industry. Even as productivity in manufacturing has risen, demand for manufactured goods has not kept pace -- hence, workers in that industry have been replaced rather than complemented.\n\nA paper by economist James Bessen argues that this is a universal pattern. When an industry is young, automation doesn't displace workers, because people keep buying more and more of that industry's products. But when people eventually have enough of something -- couches, televisions, etc. -- automation can no longer increase an industry's aggregate size, and starts displacing workers instead.\n\nThis model implies that as long as we keep inventing new products and services, automation isn't going to make humanity obsolete. Only if the human race runs out of new desires will the robots take our jobs. So far, that shows no signs of happening. The prospect of automation threatening human usefulness remains firmly in the realm of science fiction.",

He said the German government stood by its criticism of Trump's \"unilateral\" measures.\n\n\"We confronted the question of whether there would be a trade war between the U.S. and Europe,\" Altmaier told reporters in the German capital. He said he made no counter-offers to the U.S. to secure an exemption on tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration opted to sidestep a trade conflict with the EU for now, while announcing levies worth $50 billion on Chinese imports. Expressing the free-trade stance of Merkel's new government, Hardt said it was crucial to prevent a \"race to the top\" on tariffs -- and that a trade conflict would translate into a \"lose-lose competition.\"\n\nThe EU has an opportunity to open a \"new dialogue\" with the U.S. on trade, even as Trump and his officials have singled out Germany's yawning surplus as unfair to the U.S. economy and its workers. Hardt, who held talks with U.S. officials in Washington two weeks ago, said there is \"strong support\" among U.S. lawmakers for a multilateral trade approach.\n\nOn China, Hardt expressed optimism that Beijing would eventually back the global trade regime, \"because they are exporters, and strong exporters are in favor of having easy trade relations and no trade wars.\"\n\nHardt, who is also a CDU member of the lower house of parliament, questioned Germany's responsibility for its trade deficit, saying the U.S. could invest more in infrastructure and education. German high-end goods such as luxury cars aren't in price competition with U.S. products, he added.\n\n\"It's a free and sovereign decision of every customer in the U.S. to buy a BMW and Mercedes and not a Chevrolet or Cadillac,\" he said.",

                "title": "Venezuelan Contender Would Seek Debt Restructuring, Adviser Says",
                "body": "Venezuela needs urgent debt relief and would look to give bondholders small payments in the short-term while pushing back maturities in order to allow the country to return to growth, according to the economic adviser of opposition candidate Henri Falcon.\n\n\"Venezuela's debt is in default and needs to be restructured in the nation's best interests to get relief in the short term,\" Francisco Rodriguez said in an interview on Thursday. \"We're going to propose very small payments in the first years of governance in order to extend payment periods until the economy recovers.\"\n\nUnder President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela has finally succumbed to an onerous debt load from the government and state-oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA. The OPEC nation is behind on about $2 billion of bond payments and its benchmark security due in 2027 is trading at just 31 cents on the dollar. The default, coupled with U.S. sanctions and an economy deep in crisis has sapped financing possibilities for Maduro's administration which has resorted to unorthodox measures like issuing a sovereign cryptocurrency. International reserves sit at $9.4 billion, down from $27.6 billion five years ago when Maduro took office.\n\nFor now, Venezuelan bondholders have remained patient as some interest payments have wiggled their way through complex chains and principal payments have largely been made. If a large enough group of creditors were to unite, they could demand immediate repayment of all foreign bond debt in a process called acceleration.\n\nRodriguez, a 48-year-old Harvard-trained economist who previously worked at Bank of America in New York and was chief economist at boutique investment firm Torino Capital until recently, said that there are informal talks with lenders, investors and even government officials but that nothing can be considered formal at this stage.\n\nWhile Maduro has overseen the collapse of the economy during his term, his government still maintains a core of support near 20 percent of Venezuelans either ideologically aligned with the government or financially dependent on the handouts including monthly food shipments in boxes called CLAPs. What's Falcon's response to that policy to woo disenfranchised voters ahead of the May 20 election? \"Dollarization.\"\n\nRodriguez says he's convinced that ditching the bolivar for the U.S. dollar would kick start the economy, return purchasing power to Venezuelans through the allotment of monthly subsidies to all and unite the various exchange rates ranging from 40,000 bolivars per dollar to 230,000 under one roof.\n\n\"The majority of countries that dollarize use all of their international reserves, Venezuela is interesting because you can do it with a third of them,\" he said. Rodriguez estimates an exchange rate of around 70,000 bolivars per dollar, but the rate would ultimately depend on inflation and the amount of reserves in the central bank's vault upon taking office.\n\n\"If we get to the central bank and nothing is there we'll have to look for external financing to implement dollarization like Ecuador did.\"\n\nAgainst the pleas of his ostensible allies, former governor Falcon officially kicked off his presidential campaign this week and is now stumping across Venezuela in his bid to bring an end to nearly two decades of socialist rule.\n\nWhile polls give the opposition candidate as much as a double-digit lead over President Maduro, Falcon remains a long shot. Not only is he squaring off against an autocratic incumbent that has extended his grip across nearly all the country's institutions, but also a boycott of the main traditional opposition parties that will undoubtedly sap him of votes.\n\n\"We have two enemies: Maduro and abstention,\" said Rodriguez.\n\nFalcon, 56, is a divisive figure. A former military man and ally of Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, he broke ranks with the government in 2010 as governor of Lara state. Hardliners view him as a traitor or a turncoat legitimizing a vote rigged in favor of Maduro. But Falcon presents himself as the ideal candidate to bridge a bitter divide, appealing to moderates who are sick of politics as usual and an economy in tatters.\n\nWracked by food shortages and hyperinflation, Rodriguez is confident the campaign will gain steam. Not voting on May 20 will ultimately give way to six more years of Maduro, Rodriguez says. Falcon is pledging to begin dismantling price and exchange controls immediately upon taking office.\n\n\"In three or four years, the Venezuelan economy can perfectly return to being worth $300 billion,\" the adviser said.",

                "body": "Facebook is facing criticism after Trump-tied firm took data\n\nElon Musk is hopping on the #DeleteFacebook digital bandwagon.\n\nThe chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. tweeted Friday that he wasn't aware there was a Facebook page for his rocket company. After being asked by a Twitter user to delete it, he responded \"will do.\"\n\nMusk wrote back to another user who shared a photo of Tesla's official page on Facebook and asked if it, too, should be deleted: \"Definitely. Looks lame anyway.\" Tesla's and SpaceX's Facebook pages vanished soon after.\n\nMusk is the highest-profile tech figure to join people who are expunging Facebook from their lives after it was revealed a firm that worked for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign had kept data from 50 million Facebook users even after telling the company it had destroyed the information. Facebook Inc. shares fell 1.1 percent to $163.10 at 1:31 p.m. Friday in New York and have slumped almost 12 percent since the revelation, and lawmakers are calling on Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to testify in front of Congress.\n\nIt's not the first time Musk has sparred with the social-media giant. Last year, Zuckerberg criticized Musk's pessimistic view that artificial intelligence is a threat to humanity. \"I just don't understand it,\" Zuckerberg said last August. \"It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.\"\n\nMusk responded, writing on Twitter: \"I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.\"\n\nIn 2016, a SpaceX rocket carrying a Facebook satellite exploded after launch. \"I'm deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX's launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook.\n\nToday, Musk also made fun of Sonos for not being as committed as he was to the anti-Facebook cause after the connected-speaker maker said it would pull ads from the platform -- but only for a week.",

That could coax some metal producers to restart unused capacity in Rust Belt states if infrastructure spending picks up.\n\n\"In Indiana they're going to be making a huge push to get things fired up,\" Thomas, a Zaner senior vice president, said Friday by phone.\n\nOne aluminum scrap trader agrees with the premise, but he says the other side of the coin is that suppliers could be the biggest losers. Marvin Polikov, a vice president at aluminum scrap trader Metal Exchange in St. Louis, also says companies need a lot of time before they can, and probably would, restart unused refineries.\n\nEither way, Polikov is advising the world to stay calm and see how it all pans out -- especially after the hysteria of Donald Trump's original import tariffs was later doused when the U.S. started doling out exemptions to some of its biggest metal suppliers.\n\nWhile Polikov hopes restraint will be the order of the day, he isn't hopeful. \"Human nature is to panic.\"",

                "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to reduce the trade deficit by slapping tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports will encounter strong headwinds from his own economic policies.\n\nTrump's tax cuts are helping buoy the U.S. economy with growth estimated to accelerate to 2.8 percent this year. U.S. consumer sentiment jumped to a 14-year high in March on higher disposable incomes, according to a University of Michigan survey last week. Those tailwinds are seen boosting imports to the fastest pace since 2011 as shoppers open their wallets wider for foreign products.\n\n\"Trump's new protectionist policies are in contradiction with the stimulative fiscal policies driving up the trade deficit,\" said David Dollar, a former U.S. Treasury attache in Beijing and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"The anticipation of the tax cuts and now the implementation of the cuts are stimulating the U.S. economy at a late point of the cycle so it is natural for the U.S. trade deficit to grow.\"\n\nTrump's announcement of broader tariffs directed specifically at China sent Asian equities tumbling as investors feared an escalating trade war. China called for dialogue, but also announced it would respond to earlier duties on metal exports with its own charges, on about $3 billion of U.S. exports, and said it would pursue legal action at the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe U.S. trade shortfall in goods with China surged 8.1 percent during the first year of Trump's presidency, reaching a record $375 billion, according to Commerce Department data. That stubbornly high deficit is \"out of control,\" Trump said on Thursday in Washington, and he wanted it to be cut by $100 billion.\n\nThe U.S. will impose 25 percent duties on targeted Chinese products to compensate for the harm caused to the American economy from China's policies, according to a fact sheet released by U.S. trade representative, which promised more detail in the next \"several days.\"\n\n\"The irony is that Trump's tax cut and the other policies, by increasing the fiscal deficit, lead to a significant increase in the trade deficit,\" said Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning Columbia University, in an interview in Beijing. \"What it has to do is to reduce its fiscal deficit, which is the opposite of what Trump has done in December and January.\"\n\nThe U.S.'s trade deficit is a macroeconomic phenomenon, and lowering it will have to be done using policies to boost production or contain spending, according to Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.",

                "body": "Peru's Vice President Martin Vizcarra will assume the nation's highest office Friday under pressure from politicians, investors and the public to end the political confrontation that forced out his predecessor, and clamp down on corruption.\n\nThe 55-year-old engineer-turned-politician is set to don the presidential sash and address the nation after midday in Lima, less than 24 hours after returning from Canada where he was serving as ambassador. Congress will first hold a vote to formally accept the resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who quit Wednesday amid allegations he sought to buy votes to avoid impeachment.\n\nKuczynski clashed with the opposition controlled Congress for much of his 20 months in power as the Carwash bribery scandal ensnared him along with former presidents, politicians and businessmen. Vizcarra now has the opportunity to reset relations with the opposition and spur a recovery in South America's sixth largest economy.\n\n\"Political noise is going to subside as Congress doesn't have the strength or will to continue with this tension,\" said Elmer Cuba, a partner at Lima-based Macroconsult. \"They've said they will support Vizcarra. I'm very optimistic.\"\n\nA mild-mannered, former governor from the south of Peru, Vizcarra joined Kuczynski's campaign as an adviser in 2015 and was elected first vice president in July 2016. He quit as transportation minister in May last year after a spat with lawmakers over an airport contract and was appointed envoy to Canada in October.\n\n\"We need to support Vizcarra for the sake of governability and we have to rebuild trust because the population demands it,\" said Segundo Tapia, a lawmaker with opposition party Popular Force.\n\nVizcarra's first task will be to form a cabinet to accompany him through 2021 when his term ends. He told El Comercio Thursday that may take 10 days.\n\nGoverning party lawmaker Gilbert Violeta said maintaining Finance Minister Claudia Cooper would send a good sign to investors and recommended the president includes figures approved by political parties to reduce the risk of confrontation between the legislative and executive branches.\n\n\"This obstructionism by Congress caused serious problems and didn't allow governability over the last year and a half,\" Violeta said by phone from Lima. \"We have faith things will change. They have to.\"\n\nCuba, who is also a central bank director, said that economic growth should accelerate each quarter this year.\n\nVizcarra's honeymoon won't last, given the \"poisoned\" politics, and early elections are the most likely scenario, Eileen Gavin, an analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, wrote in a note Thursday\n\nVizcarra takes office with Peruvians dismayed by politics, and with good reason. His five predecessors as president are all under investigation for money laundering, corruption or human-rights abuses. One is in prison, one has just been released and Peru is seeking the extradition of another from the U.S. Prosecutors have requested an order barring Kuczynski from leaving country while he's investigated.\n\nKuczynski, a 79-year-old Wall Street veteran and former finance minister, beat a first attempt at impeachment in December after the revelation that a firm he owned took money from Brazilian builder Odebrecht SA, which doled out hundreds of millions in bribes across the region. His escape was narrow enough to embolden opponents to make a second attempt. Allegations this week he sought to reward politicians in exchange for retaining power finished his career.\n\nStill, lawmakers are also held in low regard, with an approval rating of 14 percent in an Ipsos survey this month. Hector Surichaqui, a 32-year-old Uber driver from Lima, said the president's first act should be to dissolve Congress and call new parliamentary elections.\n\n\"We need new representatives who aren't linked to all this corruption,\" he said.",

                "title": "Escalation With Russia Just Became More Likely",
                "body": "Despite a propaganda blitz meant to shift the blame for the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the U.K. earlier this month, Russia looks set to face bruising consequences. The newfound unity among European Union leaders on the matter and the appointment of fierce Russia hawk John Bolton as President Donald Trump's national security advisor are potential precursors of collective Western action against Russia.\n\nThe difficulty lies in figuring out how far that action could go without releasing President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin from any remaining trace of civilized restraint. Risk aversion may still prevail at the end.\n\nMindful that the Skripal case is essentially about the use of a chemical weapon on foreign territory, official Moscow decided, after a brief period of hiding its collective head in the sand, to push back hard against the U.K. government's conviction that it was behind the poisoning. On March 21, the foreign, defense and trade ministries held a conference for foreign ambassadors in Moscow, claiming Russia did not produce the toxic agent named by the U.K. government and that since its formula had been published by the Russian whistleblower Vil Mirzayanov, anyone could make it, including Western nations. It crowned two weeks of denials and alternative versions offered by state-owned media and officials in a pattern familiar from the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in July, 2014. As then, Moscow has worked to confuse rather than convince, at the same time questioning the formal right of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to help the U.K. with independent analysis.\n\nThat behavior hasn't boosted Moscow's credibility with European heads of state. While Greece, Italy and several other countries weren't inclined to jump to conclusions in the run-up to Thursday's EU summit, the final wording was harsh. The European Council, made up of EU national leaders, said it \"agrees with the United Kingdom government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible and that there is no plausible alternative explanation.\"\n\nThis is a rare success for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May who, thanks to Brexit, isn't a popular figure with fellow EU leaders. May owes it to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is back as a fully fledged leader now that Germany has a stable government. Merkel shepherded the Council when it introduced sanctions on Russia following the Crimea annexation and the MH 17 incident, and she appears to be doing it again.\n\nThe precise nature of the response isn't clear yet. The EU has recalled its ambassador in Russia \"for consultations\" and more measures are expected next week. \"It's much harder than during the Cold War,\" Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov said. \"There were some rules back then. Now everyone is so tough that I'm not optimistic.\" Borisov also said he asked for definitive proof of Russia's involvement -- but added that \"what's important is that despite Brexit, the U.K. and EU showed they are one and the same.\" That's the same spirit that resulted in Russia sanctions the last time around.\n\nThe pressure from Merkel to take a united stand and the help she gets from Russia's unfriendly neighbors create a window of opportunity for Russia hawks in the U.S. administration to achieve, for the first time since 2014, a consensus on more punishment for Russia. Coincidentally, with Bolton's appointment, the hawks' influence in the Trump administration has just been boosted.\n\nPredictably, foreign ministry official Vladimir Yermakov cited the erroneous claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction as a precedent for the Skripal-related accusations against Russia. Well, Bolton is an unrepentant advocate of the U.S. military response to these claims. He has also called for a stronger response to the Skripal poisoning than diplomat expulsions. And if his predecessor H.R. McMaster was considered tough on Russia and part of a camp inside the administration pushing Trump to ignore his instinct to \"get along with Russia,\" Bolton's views are even more extreme: According to his previous public statements, he doesn't believe one can make any kind of deal with Putin and other authoritarian rulers because they can never be held to their commitments.\n\nThe question is whether even Merkel and the strengthened U.S. hawks can put together a convincing response. Relatively soft, personalized sanctions against Putin friends and state-owned companies were largely exhausted in previous years. Now, only a list of far stronger options remains open: Sanctions against Russian government debt, restrictions on its energy exports, an end to the NordStream-2 pipeline project to supply more Russian gas directly to Germany, an attempt to get Russian banks removed from the Brussels-based Swift transfer-facilitating system.\n\nThese moves are risky. They could prompt an asymmetric response from the Kremlin -- perhaps even military action somewhere the West doesn't quite expect. I've never believed Putin capable of raising the stakes so high that an all-out war against the Western alliance becomes a real possibility. But given his record of seeking to assert Russia's power rather than work out mutually acceptable rules, it doesn't seem far-fetched to me that Putin might make a surprise move in the Middle East or even in Ukraine in response to tougher economic sanctions. Post-Communist countries in Europe also have things to fear from him -- if not all-out military attacks, then all kinds of subtler subversion.\n\nPushing for a united European response to the Skripal case is a no-brainer for May who needs to show Britons both authority and solidarity against an external threat. It might even make Brexit talks a little easier by showing continental Europeans that they have an enemy in common with the U.K. But most EU leaders are too risk-averse to be pushed into an escalation with Russia. Even Merkel hasn't been responsive to demands that NordStream-2 be terminated. Trump, for his part, has proved remarkably resistant to all attempts to force his hand on Russia.\n\nThat's a lot of inertia for Russia hawks to overcome on both sides of the Atlantic. Real -- and admittedly dangerous -- action against Putin is only possible if the chemical weapons situation acquires a dynamic of its own and inaction becomes untenable without loss of face. The discussion at the EU summit and Bolton's appointments are two steps in that direction.",

                "body": "One retailer under pressure from Amazon plus a grocery store under pressure from Amazon does not equal a solution.\n\nShares of Target Corp. and Kroger Co. jumped on Friday morning amid speculation they were in talks to merge. It would be a mammoth deal, creating a company with a combined market value in excess of $50 billion and annual revenue of almost $200 billion should it occur. CNBC later said there's no truth to the reports, but interestingly, Target and Kroger held onto some of their gains for much of the morning, suggesting there may be something to a combination that's attractive to investors on both sides.\n\nEach company has something the other needs. Kroger has been lacking in formulating a plan for adapting to the e-commerce grocery push heralded by Amazon.com Inc.'s takeover of Whole Foods Market Inc. As for Target, it's been making strides in digital but needs a more differentiated and significant grocery operation. That Target sees groceries as a clear battleground was made clear by its decision to buy delivery startup Shipt Inc. last year. Combined, the two companies would have significant scale in groceries and household goods. But scale doesn't mean much unless you do something worthwhile with it.\n\nTarget's grocery shortcomings aren't new. It's had years to fix this on its own, but still seems to be grasping for a strategy, as Gadfly has noted. Efforts to improve its supply chain and increase organic offerings were smart, but that alone isn't going to defend Target's grocery business from encroachments by German giant Lidl, discounter Aldi and Amazon. Target's ability to capitalize on the Shipt acquisition and seize a large share of the grocery-delivery market remains to be seen.\n\nAs my Gadfly colleague Sarah Halzack has noted, it's puzzling Target hasn't made more progress in groceries given that CEO Brian Cornell was previously the head of PepsiCo Inc.'s food business before joining the retailer in 2014. He wouldn't be buying new ideas with an acquisition of Kroger, he would be buying a bigger grocery business and thousands of brick-and-mortar locations. Attempting a deal of this magnitude also risks leaving the combined company saddled with debt and crippling its ability to make necessary investments in innovation.\n\nShould Target offer a 30 percent premium to Kroger's unaffected price, it would be looking at a $42 billion transaction, including the grocer's more than $15 billion in net debt. There are ways to make the math work on a takeover, but still -- ouch.\n\nA juicy premium would be ideal for Kroger investors tired of seeing the stock rocked by disappointing earnings and Amazon fears. But barring some questionable decision-making at Target, Kroger would do better to focus on finding an e-commerce deal akin to Walmart Inc.'s acquisition of Jet.com to bring on board more digital expertise. Kroger's $400 million offer for Boxed Wholesale, which sells household products in bulk, was reportedly rejected because it was lower than the startup's valuation.\n\nThe need to come up with a viable e-commerce grocery strategy is real.

Hong Kong-based WH is suffering the most because its U.S. arm, Smithfield, is the world's largest pork producer. WH acquired the company for $4.73 billion in 2013.\n\nU.S. pork shipments to China totaled $1.1 billion last year, according to the National Pork Producers Council. While an exact breakdown by supplier wasn't immediately available, it's likely that most of that meat was from Smithfield. The U.S. producer sent 280,000 metric tons of pork to China in 2016, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Thomas Jastrzab.\n\nA representative for Smithfield declined to comment on the tariffs.",

                "title": "The Great 20th Century Dance Companies Face an Existential Crisis",
                "body": "When legendary choreographers such as Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, and Mark Morris cease to create new works, what happens to the troupes they've assembled and the legacies they've forged?\n\nChoreographer Mark Morris just finished creating a new dance in February. And, if it's anything like the roughly 150 works that made him a darling of the performance world, it will be breathtaking. But this particular piece of modern dance won't be presented next season. In fact, it won't be performed for years -- maybe 20, possibly 30. It's intended to give the Mark Morris Dance Group fresh material long after its innovative director is gone.\n\nMorris, 61, isn't in ill health. But the idea to save some works for the future came up when Nancy Umanoff, the executive director of his 38-year-old company, was exploring ways to preserve the choreographer's legacy. That includes not only his body of work, but also a popular school, numerous outreach programs, and the seven-studio Mark Morris Dance Center -- which helped anchor Brooklyn's downtown arts district. In 2017 the company had revenue of $5.5 million from performances.\n\nOn hearing about the preservation concept, Morris was immediately excited. Or almost immediately. His first reaction, he says, was, \"What? Are you trying to kill me?!\"\n\nLike many visionary choreographers, he founded his troupe with a particular aesthetic, and his dancers perform only his work. It's a company model -- single choreographer, founder-led -- in use since the early 20th century pioneers of modern dance created it. It gave choreographers consistent dancers, studio space, and organizational support in an era when modern dance, led by artists such as Martha Graham, was busting up conventions with new genres of movement. But on the way to the 21st century, dance lost its prominence, as well as its funding and media attention. And when Graham's generation began to die, single-choreographer companies started to feel like one-artist museums. In the past decade, major companies such as Mark Morris and Paul Taylor Dance Company and smaller troupes like Elisa Monte Dance and Battery Dance have had to face an existential crisis.\n\nSuch groups are expanding their structures and missions, but for the successful artists who built them decades ago, doing so means making major changes to the way they've always operated. For some, it means passing the baton. The best-case scenarios emerge with input from the one person -- the founder -- who usually (and understandably) doesn't want to talk about her own mortality. Still, avoiding the problem only increases the risk that one's work will no longer be performed and philanthropic supporters will walk away.\n\nThe issue is crucial, because maintaining dance is unlike any other form of preservation. A play or symphony can be forgotten for decades, then performed with a valid interpretation by a director or conductor. But a choreographer's work can be lost if dancers don't teach and perform it. Video and notation can only do so much.\n\n\"If it's not done and it's not seen, it's not getting passed on,\" says arts management consultant Sharon Gersten Luckman, who was executive director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for 16 years. \"People have to be keeping it alive and doing it.\"\n\nAiley's is one of the few companies that's managed to evolve smoothly. In his case, in 1989, he appointed Judith Jamison, a star dancer, to succeed him while he was alive. With the help of the board, she in turn appointed a successor while still on the job, having expanded the company and its financial support.\n\nThen there were Graham and Merce Cunningham. Graham opened her studio in 1926. After her death in 1991, a power struggle for artistic direction ensued. When her heir, Ron Protas, was ousted, he sued to prevent the company from using Graham's property, including her name, technique, dances, and accompanying sets and costumes. Many issues were quickly resolved, but some took years. Each of the 181 dances was judged individually. During the period of uncertainty, some funders disappeared. Had Protas been given the rights to her dances, some of the greatest modern works in the field would have been unavailable to the troupe; two pieces still are. But today the group is thriving, touring, and commissioning new work.\n\nDecisions were reached more carefully about how to carry on the legacy of Cunningham, who died in 2009 at age 90. The board and management interpreted his statements to close associates -- and later in public -- to mean that his company, formed in 1953, should close after his death. Although a huge loss for the field and public, that wish was honored in 2011. The Merce Cunningham Trust lives on to maintain the dancer's technique and to license works to qualified companies and schools.\n\nFoundations have since stepped up their interest in seeing company leaders forge a viable path, says Umanoff of the Mark Morris Dance Group: \"There is a lot of pressure from funders to make a decision.\" She hit on the idea of future dances after reading about Katie Paterson's \"Future Library.\" The Scottish multimedia artist's long-range project involves a forest planted in Norway in 2014 to provide paper for as-yet-unpublished novels. A writer each year will contribute a work until 2114, and it will be held in trust for publication at that time.\n\nMorris's concept is shaped by a parameter he also follows today: No company but his own may dance his work. (He makes exceptions for universities and ballet and opera companies.) \"I've seen my work done by other dancers. I've coached it. I've rehearsed it,\" he says. \"And then I watch it, and ... that's not the dance I want to see.\" His aesthetic, frequently lauded for its musicality, is balletic yet contemporary. It's highly precise, yet it allows the dancers to come across as self-aware individuals rather than people moving as they were told to. Outside dancers often nail the precision, but not the élan.\n\nMorris's rule will keep his work pure, but it reduces the options. If his choreography can't be danced by others, the only way to fully preserve it is to ensure his company continues to perform. Saving dances for the future offers a way to sustain the troupe by ensuring supply and encouraging demand. If Morris keeps stashing away works, the company will be able to offer presenters and audiences the allure of premieres for years to come. The process, however, requires extra time and funding. The sets and costumes are designed, but not built. Detailed videos and information are archived for dancers who won't have Morris around to answer questions.\n\nModern dance legend Paul Taylor's vision for sustaining his company, established in 1954, is also rooted in giving audiences something new, even if not by his own design. Already in his 80s, Taylor announced in 2014 that the 18-member company, though still performing his work, would commission repertory from leading dance makers and present classics of modern dance.\n\nThe move has given it a broader purpose -- to preserve the past, present, and future of dance. Says Richard Chen See, a former Paul Taylor dancer: \"Even the Royal Shakespeare Company does more than Shakespeare.\"\n\nThe new direction came from Taylor, says John Tomlinson, the company's executive director. Tomlinson was so shocked when Taylor suggested the plan that he didn't work on it at first. But Taylor was serious. To cover the added costs of commissioning and presenting others' dances, Taylor donated Robert Rauschenberg artworks from his collection to the company. Four were auctioned at Sotheby's for $6.3 million.\n\nWith Taylor leading the change and being a part of the rollout, the company avoided naysayers and second-guessers. The risk is more than reputational: Funders could turn skittish or find a vision less compelling without a founder's approval. \"You can confuse every stakeholder,\" warns Michael Kaiser, chairman of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the University of Maryland. \"You can cause disruption on the staff, board, dancers, and audience.\"\n\nPerhaps the most important impact of Taylor's decision was that it redefined the role of the next artistic director. What the company doesn't need -- and had been fearful of not finding -- is another Paul Taylor, a brilliant choreographer of galvanizing vision. Now, as a repertory company, it needs a curator, who may or may not choreograph, but who'll engage and excite audiences, as well as maintain Taylor's dances. That person has yet to be identified.\n\nCompanies should avoid postponing a transition plan until after a founder is gone, according to a report by the Bridgespan Group, a nonprofit management consulting firm. The report, Making Founder Successions Work, looked at about 300 transitions at a variety of nonprofits and conducted interviews at about 30. The research showed that when a founder stays on to guide a successor selected from within the organization, the transition is significantly more successful than in any other transition, such as when a founder makes a clean break.\n\nIn the best cases, according to the study, four main conditions need to be in place: The founder must be capable and willing to engage; the board must see the value in the founder's continuing role; that role must be clearly defined; and the successor must be willing to work with the founder.\n\nThat's all fine in theory, but an artist such as Graham would have had none of it, says Janet Eilber, one of her former dancers who's now artistic director of the Martha Graham Dance Company. \"I don't think she thought of a world without herself,\" Eilber says. \"She was all about making astonishing art.\"\n\nChoreographer Elisa Monte, another former Graham dancer, founded her own company in 1981. She was more practical than Graham when, in 2008, she tapped her successor, Tiffany Rea-Fisher, one of the company's principal dancers. Rea-Fisher had also been writing grants and organizing the archive. Her phone conversation with Monte about the leadership role was so unexpected that she almost hung up. \"I didn't know what to do or say. So I said, 'OK, I have to go,' \" she recalls.\n\nThe two soon talked, and the process was textbook. In 2010, Monte presented her decision to the 12-member board, which hired a consultant to create a three-year transition plan that allowed stakeholders to see Rea-Fisher in a different role, with Monte's approval.\n\nRea-Fisher interprets dance as a vehicle for radical community service. In 2013 she and two dancers visited Dickinson, N.D., to lead workshops at an Indian reservation, senior centers, and other sites. By their fourth visit to Dickinson, company members had visited 30 organizations.\n\nJonathan Hollander, founder of Battery Dance in Lower Manhattan, has gradually changed his mission over the past 40 years. He reduced the emphasis on his own choreography while shifting toward international travel with Dancing to Connect, his movement-therapy workshop for refugees and victims of violent conflicts. All his performers are trained as teachers and choreographers, creating a pipeline of leaders to ensure that his cultural diplomacy will continue. He wants the ensemble ethos of Battery Dance to shape who's at the top in the future. \"It may be a somebody, or somebodies,\" he says.\n\nThe model of one artistic voice leading a company for the sake of that voice may be dying out. Although Morris says he's comfortable with his troupe dancing work by other choreographers, he's confident his stockpiling plan will succeed in generating continued interest for his company. \"I'm not exactly a Robert E. Lee equestrian statue,\" he says.",

Organizers of rallies at parliament and the ruling Law & Justice Party's headquarters said they expect as many as 6,000 participants.\n\nLaw & Justice, which has vowed to return Poland to its Christian roots, took up the issue again this week, after a 2016 plan to implement a near-total abortion ban failed in the face of demonstrations that attracted more than 100,000 people. The Polish Catholic Church weighed as well on Wednesday, saying that prolonged parliamentary proceedings were a source of concern.\n\n\"There are six countries in the world where the church has reached its goal and abortion is totally banned,\" said Bozena Przyluska, one of the organizers of the march. \"Women are dying there in illegal abortions or sit in prison for attempting them. We can't allow that to happen.\"\n\nNils Muiziecks, the Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe rights watchdog, urged Polish lawmakers to reject the bill.

                "title": "U.S. Metal-Tariffs Showdown at WTO to Shake World Trade Order",
                "body": "WTO has never ruled on a dispute on national-security concerns\n\nMove over Russia, Ukraine and Saudi Arabia. The U.S. looks set to join the group of countries embroiled in disputes at the World Trade Organization involving curbs imposed on national-security grounds.\n\nChina said it would complain to the WTO about U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs on steel and aluminum after failing to win an exclusion, which Washington gave to others such as Canada, Australia and the 28-nation EU. The U.S. levies stem from probes by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross under a little-used part of a Cold War-era American law.\n\nThe Geneva-based WTO has never ruled on a dispute involving trade restrictions justified on national-security grounds and has never had a case centering on steel and national security. A legal fight over Trump's metal tariffs could shake the global commercial order, according to Robert Zoellick, who served as U.S. trade chief under President George W. Bush.\n\n\"Here's the risk: The WTO decides, well, the EU or whoever brings action is right, this isn't really national security,\" Zoellick said in Brussels earlier this month. \"But then what happens when Wilbur Ross or somebody else says 'wait a minute. Those people in Geneva can decide what is in America's national security? Should we be part of the WTO?' Or, the reverse, the WTO says 'well, we let countries decide their own national security.' Then you've created a very big loophole.\"\n\nFour national-security cases are currently working their way through the WTO's complaints system. Two involve Russia and Ukraine, which have imposed commercial curbs on each other as the Ukrainian government battles rebels in the eastern part of the country, and the other two unite the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in defending an embargo against neighboring Qatar after allegations it supports terrorist groups.\n\nArticle 21 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- the WTO's less-muscular predecessor for almost 50 years until 1994 -- is included in the current rules. The provision says that nothing can \"prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.\"\n\nThe article then offers three specifications relating to nuclear materials, arms trafficking and \"war or other emergency in international relations.\"\n\nIn 1962, U.S. President John Kennedy's administration invoked the security exception when imposing a trade embargo against Cuba in the run-up to the Cuban missile crisis. In the mid-1980s, the administration of then President Ronald Reagan invoked Article 21 to justify a ban on U.S. trade with Nicaragua (part of Reagan's anti-communist policy to isolate the Sandinista regime running the Central American country).\n\nThe issue arose again in 1996 when the EU challenged extraterritorial aspects of the U.S. Helms-Burton Act tightening sanctions against Cuba.\n\nThe Trump administration has claimed the WTO has no authority to rule on matters related to national security. Such a U.S. reaction to China's planned complaint could encourage other countries to try to exploit a perceived national-security loophole and provoke a wave of trade protectionism.\n\nWill Trump Turn His Trade Guns on the WTO?: QuickTake Q&A\n\nAs a candidate, Trump said the WTO was a \"disaster\" and threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the organization. He has already frozen years of talks on a trans-Atlantic market-opening agreement, pulled out of a trans-Pacific trade accord and demanded changes to a 24-year-old commercial pact among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. That has left European policy makers defending the liberal economic order.\n\nThe Trump administration is keeping up the pressure on the countries exempted from the metal-import tariffs, pledging to review the waiver by May 1. A more permanent exclusion will depend on the status of \"discussions of satisfactory long-term alternative means to address the threatened impairment to U.S. national security,\" the White House said.\n\n\"These guys are playing hard ball,\" Zoellick said. \"And that goes to the core question of how will the international system operate if the United States is no longer playing a systemic role.\"",

Appetite for crypto-assets has cooled somewhat since market leader Bitcoin failed to return to its January highs, they explained.\n\nThe comments signal that the ICO is going mostly according to plan for Pavel Durov, the self-exiled Russian entrepreneur who founded the encrypted-chat app with his mathematician brother Nikolai in 2013 and now boasts 200 million users from Iran to Brazil.\n\nFor a deeper look into the world's biggest initial coin offering, click here.\n\nThe firm, registered in the British Virgin Islands, is finding enough interest among a global pool of investors who have been rocked by a volatile token market and whose skeptics say they doubt the Durovs can meet their goal to speed transactions processing toward a level of Visa or Mastercard.\n\nTelegram raised $850 million from large investors last month, selling rights to virtual coins called Grams at $0.38 apiece, according to a filing. The second round is targeting another $850 million at $1.33 apiece this month, according to the company documents seen by Bloomberg News. Telegram didn't respond to Bloomberg inquiries seeking comment.\n\nThe company is seeking to build is own blockchain network with Gram built-in, enabling much faster transactions speed than rival networks run for Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's raising funds to build this network, rent servers, boost the number of users and pay operating expenses, the documents say.\n\nThe impact of Telegram's ICO will be \"a double-edged sword,\" said Darren Franceschini, chief executive officer of Blockchain Technologies Consulting in Canada.\n\n\"It will show that there is room for established businesses to join this space with a capital raise of their own,\" he said. \"It will unfortunately also provide a new sense of possibility amongst others when it comes to their raising capabilities that may further saturate the market.\"\n\nDemand in the ICO's second round is lower than for the first, and some investors were given extra time to produce the funds, two of the people said.\n\nEarlier this week, a Russian regulator said that Telegram must provide its encryption codes to the Federal Security Service within 15 days, under anti-terrorism laws, and may block the messenger should it fail to comply. Telegram had just lost a bid before Russia's Supreme Court to continue denying access.",

Copper and aluminum hit fresh three-month lows and mining majors including Glencore Plc and Rio Tinto Group dropped in London. Gold rallied as investors flocked to haven assets.\n\nWorsening trade tensions put the LME's index of six base metals on course for its longest string of weekly losses since November 2015, compounding fears that a sustained spell of strong global growth may stall. Manufacturing gauges showed signs of strain this week, while in the U.S., higher interest rates and import tariffs could increase costs for consumers driving the country's economic resurgence, according to Colin Hamilton, managing director for commodities research at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n\"We're in the third year of a pretty consistent recovery in global industrial activity,\" he said by phone from London. \"Now I'm just a little bit more fearful that we're past the peak in the cycle.\"\n\nNickel dropped 0.6 percent to $13,115 a ton at 1:39 p.m. in London, tracking heavy losses in Chinese steel and iron ore futures. Copper was down 0.5 percent, paring earlier losses after orders to withdraw metal from the LME rose by the most in almost 13 months. Zinc was little changed, rebounding from three-month lows struck on Thursday.",

Se propone sumar lo obtenido mediante el reciclaje a su producción existente proveniente de la extracción.\n\nLa revolución de los vehículos eléctricos generó un aumento en la demanda de materiales para baterías, lo cual hizo subir los precios y desató una carrera por conseguir nuevas fuentes de abastecimiento. Dado que los costos en alza y una mayor competitividad presionan los márgenes de la explotación minera, reciclar el metal de las baterías usadas va camino de convertirse en un recurso cada vez más importante, estimulado por normas gubernamentales que se proponen mantenerlas lejos de los vertederos, según Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\n\n\"En la planta piloto esperamos probar que mejora verdaderamente el margen neto\", dijo el director de operaciones Mike Tamlin en una entrevista telefónica. \"Las cifras son mucho mejores que si se lleva a cabo la extracción primaria de un mineral\".\n\n\"Es imprescindible que el mundo recicle para que las baterías no nos ahoguen, y además tiene el potencial de producir componentes a un costo más bajo\", dijo Tamlin este jueves. \"Al mismo tiempo, siempre vamos a necesitar que ingresen nuevos materiales\". Neometals es socia en la mina de litio australiana Mt.

La empresa china Tianqi Lithium Corp., que construye en la actualidad la planta de procesamiento de litio más grande del mundo, contempla llevar a cabo trabajo de investigación y desarrollo para reciclaje, dijo Phil Thick, el gerente general de la unidad australiana de la compañía productora, en una entrevista el lunes.\n\nNeometals podría no tomar la decisión de invertir en la construcción de una planta de reciclaje hasta 2019, en tanto probar y refinar el proceso requiere más trabajo. \"Fabricar la batería implicó revolver una serie de elementos\", dijo Tamlin. \"Retornarlos a su estado original exige mucho trabajo, necesitamos una buena solución química y eso es lo que estamos desarrollando\".\n\nPóngase en contacto con nosotros y contrate nuestro servicio Bloomberg Professional.",

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is on a three-week visit to the U.S. and met with Trump at the White House.\n\nFlying between New Delhi and Tel Aviv ordinarily takes nine hours because planes are routed over the Arabian Sea, flying west over the Horn of Africa to avoid Saudi Arabia and north across the Red Sea to reach Israel.

                "title": "Republicans Are Turning a Blind Eye to Bad Policy",
                "body": "The most striking thing about how President Donald Trump chose his new national security adviser, John Bolton, and new director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, isn't about either of them personally, although neither is well suited to the honest-broker role that their position calls for. Nor is it that Trump seems to have hired both of them because he liked watching them on television. That's a deeply flawed reason to hire anyone, to be sure, but we're accustomed to how Trump hires people based on superficial criteria.\n\nWhat is striking is that both are essentially within the mainstream of the Republican Party on policy approaches that ended in disaster during the last Republican presidency. Bolton was part of the George W. Bush administration as it prepared for and fought the Iraq War; Kudlow hasn't been in government for years, but he was a cheerleader for Bush's policies as the economy plunged into a terrible recession. Neither of them was discredited as a result, because Republicans have collectively decided that their policies in 2001-2008 were correct, regardless of outcome.\n\nThis is ... unusual. Democrats after the Jimmy Carter years pretty much exiled everyone in that White House from further influence within the party; Bill Clinton wouldn't even hire Carter people who had survived with excellent reputations. Democrats after 1968 went through a bitter fight over foreign policy, with most of those who supported the Vietnam War inside the Kennedy and Johnson administrations losing their place in the party and the entire foreign-policy establishment overturned. And Eisenhower Republicans rejected Hoover economic approaches. In other words, parties usually deal with major policy failures by ridding themselves of those held responsible.\n\nElectorates have very short memories, and they pay way more attention to their task of throwing out the current rascals than checking on who the new rascals will be. Parties don't want to repeat their mistakes, presumably for straightforward good-governance reasons and in accord with the electoral incentive to try to make voters happy.\n\nThe truth is many Republicans, including governing professionals such as Bolton, just don't see the Iraq War as a policy disaster. I don't think that's quite true on economic policy, but in that area, they've managed to convince themselves that the party out of office was responsible.\n\nIn some ways, the traditional party reaction to policy failure can be a mistake, with parties freezing out talented people who just happened to be there when things went wrong. The best approach is almost certainly a middle ground, in which the party takes a good, hard look at how things went awry and who should be discredited. But there's not much evidence that's happened for Republicans. It's just one of the many things suggesting normal party incentives aren't working properly for the party. And that leaves them much less prepared to govern than they should be ... Trump or no Trump.\n\n3. Paul Starr on the current threat to U.S. democracy. My general sense is that the threat is real, but that we're better off thinking of democracy as a continuum rather than democracy and authoritarianism as alternatives. Either way, strong support for democracy is warranted.\n\n4. Geoffrey Skelley has a recent history of House retirements.\n\n5. Jack Goldsmith and Maddie McMahon at Lawfare on how the Robert Mueller investigation is supposed to end. Specifically, they argue against a Starr Report model.\n\n6.

                "body": "Se avecina la guerra comercial total, los mercados quedaron notificados y se evita el cierre del Gobierno estadounidense. A continuación, algunas de las cosas de las que los mercados van a estar hablando hoy.\n\nRepresalias de China\n\nHoras después que el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, impuso aranceles sobre US$50.000 millones en importaciones de China como respuesta a supuestas violaciones de la propiedad intelectual, China presentó impuestos sobre US$3.000 millones en importaciones de carne de cerdo, aluminio reciclado, caños de acero, frutas y vinos de EE.UU. La Casa Blanca también declaró una exención temporaria de esos impuestos para la Unión Europea y otros países, con lo cual quedó claro el énfasis contra China. Esta táctica tan directa podría tener consecuencias generalizadas y duraderas, se advierte en los comentarios. Con sus considerables tenencias de bonos del Tesoro estadounidense y su mercado exportador cada vez más grande, China tiene muchas palancas con las cuales influir sobre EE.UU. Aunque hasta ahora los analistas consideran medido el accionar de Pekín, puede que esta tome más medidas.\n\nRaciones de guerra\n\nLas acciones quedaron en la primera línea de una posible guerra comercial y se desplomaron los índices accionarios de todo el mundo. El índice Stoxx Europe 600 caía por tercer día consecutivo luego de que varias referencias bursátiles, desde Tokio hasta Shanghái, se desplomaron mucho más de 3 por ciento. En los mercados de bonos, se liquidaron abruptamente los de la periferia de Europa, mientras que los bonos del Tesoro estadounidense aguantaron; los rendimientos de la nota con vencimiento en 10 años se aferraron a la base de 2,8 por ciento. La decisión de Trump de reemplazar al asesor de Seguridad Nacional de la Casa Blanca, H.R. McMaster, por John Bolton podría sembrar el caos en los mercados dada la postura de línea dura de este último contra Irán.\n\nAlivio en el Senado\n\nLos senadores de EE.UU. mantuvieron funcionando el Gobierno al aprobar este viernes por la madrugada un proyecto de ley de US$1,3 billones que aumenta el gasto militar y nacional y fortalece la revisión de antecedentes para los compradores de armas de fuego. La votación, que terminó con 65 votos a favor contra 32, llegó después que los conservadores republicanos objetaron el crecimiento del gasto y plantearon la posibilidad de que la votación se frustrara después de la medianoche y así cerrara el Gobierno. El director de presupuesto de la Casa Blanca, Mick Mulvaney, dijo a los periodistas que el presidente Trump firmaría la medida en tanto esta financia sus prioridades. Pero no todos quedaron contentos con el resultado. \"Apesta\", dijo el senador John Kennedy, un republicano por Luisiana que se opuso al proyecto y contempló obligar a que cierre el Gobierno atrasando la votación. \"No se pensó para nada en sumar más de un billón de dólares a la deuda\".\n\nMercados golpeados\n\nEl índice Topix de Japón se hundió 3,6 por ciento. Los futuros de EE.UU. retrocedían 0,6 por ciento a las 5:55, hora de Nueva York, luego de que el índice S&P 500 cerró con una baja de 2,5 por ciento, la más pronunciada en seis semanas. En Europa, el índice Stoxx 600 bajaba 1,6 por ciento a las 5:57 y caían todos los grupos industriales. Avanzaban los bonos de Gobiernos con mercados desarrollados; el rendimiento de los bonos del Tesoro estadounidense con vencimiento en 10 años caía un poco, a 2,81 por ciento. Los futuros del petróleo avanzaban 0,4 por ciento y el oro subía 1 por ciento.\n\nUna de espías\n\nPuede que pronto echen a los espías rusos de Europa. Algunos países dijeron que evalúan decretar expulsiones y los líderes de la UE se alinearon con el Reino Unido en sus acusaciones contra el Kremlin por el envenenamiento de un ex doble espía con un agente neurotóxico. La alemana Angela Merkel dijo \"hablamos el mismo idioma, pero de ser necesario también reaccionaremos juntos con las mismas medidas\".\n\nPóngase en contacto con nosotros y contrate nuestro servicio Bloomberg Professional.",

                "title": "For Tesla, Cars + Cash + Credit + Convertibles = Crunch Time",
                "body": "Without faster Model 3 production, Elon Musk's money machine will run low on juice.\n\nOpinions differ on the exact nature of Tesla, ranging from struggling car manufacturer to tech pioneer to something akin to the second coming. Regardless, it is undoubtedly one thing: a money machine.\n\nI don't mean that in the sense of Tesla making a lot of money; more that it is a machine for the raising and consumption of money.\n\nAll companies are this to one degree or another, of course; it's just that Tesla Inc. is more at the \"another\" end of things. Reliably negative on free cash flow, Tesla depends on a smorgasbord of external funding, from equity raising to vehicle deposits to high-yield bonds to securitized leases to negative working capital. And that smorgasbord rests, of course, on Tesla's famously gravity-defying stock price and faith in CEO Elon Musk.\n\nWhich is why these four charts deserve more than a glance from even the most ardent Muskovite:\n\nWe're just over a week away from knowing whether or not Tesla has hit its (much reduced) target for producing 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter. The signs thus far aren't good, which also raises doubts about the 5,000-a-week target for the end of June.\n\nHitting these targets matters for the Tesla money machine on three fronts.\n\nFirst, reducing that risk-laden reliance on negative working capital and getting a return on the money already spent on production lines relies on producing more cars. Second, analysts currently expect Tesla to burn through $2.7 billion of cash this year -- and analysts tend to be optimistic on this stuff. Third, when Moody's rated that bond Tesla sold last August, it was assuming 300,000 Model 3 deliveries this year, which now looks far out of reach.\n\nIn other words, Tesla's money machine will almost certainly need to raise more this year due to the Model 3's problems -- but those same problems undermine the pitch for selling more equity or debt.\n\nThis is happening against a backdrop of rising interest rates. Tesla's debt has jumped in recent years, especially after it took on SolarCity Corp.'s obligations. Interest expense more than doubled in 2017 and reached the astounding level of one-third of gross profit in the final quarter of 2017:\n\nAt the same time, Tesla is moving closer to a maturity wall, with $3.7 billion of bonds and credit lines needing refinancing by the end of 2020.\n\nSome $1.7 billion of that consists of three convertible bonds falling due between this coming November and the next one. Almost half of it -- inherited from SolarCity -- is hopelessly out of the money, with conversion prices starting at $560 (Tesla closed Thursday at $309 and change). The rest of it, a $920 million convertible due next March, sports a conversion price of just under $36o; still underwater but within sight of the surface.\n\nConverting that last one to equity would dilute Tesla's free float by 2 percent. But that could be more palatable than the alternative of replacing it with a straight bond.\n\nAs of now, those three bonds pay a weighted-average coupon of just over 1 percent, or about $18 million a year. All else equal, assuming they were all refinanced at spreads similar to where Tesla's 2025 bonds trade now, but factoring in the forecast increase in Treasury yields, that would jump to 7 percent, or $120 million. Putting that in context, Tesla's entire interest expense last year was $471 million.\n\nA rebound in the stock price would take much of this pain away, of course. Half those convertibles would transform into equity and Tesla could simply issue more shares in general (as Musk's new pay package encourages it to do anyway) or more debt, even at higher rates.\n\nGetting there, though, needs one thing above all else: A steady stream of Model 3s. Cranking up the money machine depends on cranking up that production line. And given Tesla's mounting burdens, that needs to happen soon.",

                "body": "Consumer prices were up 2.2% in February from a year ago Core prices up for a fifth month to fastest since 2012\n\nCanadian inflation picked up more than analysts expected in February to the fastest in more than three years as signs point to price pressures continuing to build.\n\nConsumer prices accelerated to an annual pace of 2.2 percent in February, the most since 2014, from 1.7 percent a month earlier. Economists had anticipated a 1.9 percent increase. Core prices -- which exclude more volatile items like energy and are considered a gauge of inflation pressures -- inched higher for a fifth month to 2.03 percent, which is the fastest since 2012.\n\nThe budding inflation could add pressure on the Bank of Canada -- which has kept the expansion going with low interest rates -- to keep hiking borrowing costs to more normal levels.\n\nInflation running close to the central bank's 2 percent target suggests an economy operating near capacity, and investors are anticipating at least two more rate increases this year, after the Bank of Canada hiked borrowing costs three times since July. The central bank has been forecasting inflation will hover at about 2 percent over the next couple of years.\n\n\"Inflation is BAAAACK, but its not yet a scary monster, being essentially in line with what the Bank of Canada actually wanted to see,\" Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors.\n\nThe Canadian dollar jumped higher on the report, and was up 0.6 percent to C$1.2861 per U.S. dollar at 9:02 a.m. in Toronto trading.\n\nStatistics Canada cited higher prices for gasoline, cars, and mortgage interest costs as main contributors to annual inflation. The minimum wage increase in Ontario in January also continue to have an impact, at least with restaurant prices which were up in the province 6.6 percent from a year ago. Nationwide, restaurant prices were up 4 percent.\n\nEven with inflation around its target, the central bank has been warning there still may be slack in the economy, particularly in the labor market. The pick up in prices also comes at a time when the economy is slowing, another reason to be cautious for the Bank of Canada.\n\nStatistics Canada also reported on Friday that retail sales grew 0.3 percent in January, weaker than economists had forecast. Coupled with continued uncertainty around U.S. trade policy and a slowdown in the housing market, the Bank of Canada may look past the inflation numbers for now, according to Krishen Rangasamy at National Bank of Canada in Montreal.\n\n\"The central bank may stick to its loose stance for another few months,\" Rangasamy said in a note to investors.",

The document specifies for the first time when those exclusions will run out, adding to pressure for a deal to be reached on the North American Free Trade Agreement around the same time.\n\nA White House statement said Trump will decide by May 1 \"whether to continue to exempt these countries from tariffs, based on the status of discussions.\" Mexico has said it needs a deal by the end of April, or that talks might as well stretch past the country's summer election, and then U.S. midterm elections this fall.\n\nCanada and Mexico continue to push for permanent exemptions from the tariffs, which have been set at 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum. Canada is the leading source of U.S. imports of steel and aluminum. Steel is closely tied to the auto sector, one of the core disputes in Nafta in which there's been progress recently.\n\nRead more about how Trudeau is trying to save Nafta after a win on tariffs\n\n\"The United States is continuing discussions with Canada and Mexico,\" along with the European Union, South Korea and others, \"on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of steel articles from those countries,\" Trump's proclamation said.\n\nTrump pledged to apply them unless \"I determine by further proclamation that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means\" to address \"threatened impairment\" of the steel sector.\n\nThe move comes after recent signs for optimism on Nafta talks. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said this week \"there seems to be a certain momentum around the table\" and that \"a win-win-win deal is not only possible but likely.\" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Wednesday the countries are \"finally starting to converge\" on the critical issue of auto sector rules, but warned Thursday time was running out.\n\n\"I believe that substantial progress is being made but we are quickly running out of time if we are going to have this congress vote on a final passage,\" Lighthizer said during a Senate hearing on Thursday in Washington.",

The Senate voted early Friday morning to approve final passage.\n\nWhite House budget director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that Trump would sign the measure because it funds his priorities.\n\n\"Let's cut right to the chase. Is the president going to sign the bill? The answer is yes. Why? Because it funds his priorities,\" he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin delivered a summary of the bill to President Donald Trump at the White House Wednesday afternoon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky joined the meeting, which included Vice President Mike Pence, by telephone.\n\nBoth Ryan's office and the White House released statements afterward saying the president and the two congressional leaders discussed their support for the legislation.

                "body": "It looks a victory for aggrieved bondholders. Aviva Plc has had enough bad press and has kicked controversial plans to cancel its preference share class into the long grass.\n\nThe decision isn't entirely charitable. The British insurer may also have been influenced by the fact that likely cost of issuing new perpetual debt was beginning to tick up.\n\nBut this is far from the end of the story. Thanks to Solvency II, a set of European Union rules adopted two years ago, preference shares will have no purpose after 2026. They won't count as permanent capital, so insurers will want to cancel them.\n\nAviva is going to have to pay a higher price to do that than it looks it was hoping to get away with. Regulators aren't going to make a special U.K. exception for what is now an orphan asset class.\n\nUpper Tier II non-callable cumulative dividend-paying perpetuals -- like those Aviva wanted to cancel -- are a relic in the age of bail-in additional Tier I capital. Regulators these days want bondholders to be at risk of losing their capital along with equity holders.\n\nThe private wealth managers who have been happily filling up pension and trust funds with high-coupon legacy bonds, in a world of very low interest rates, have done their clients a disservice.\n\nAfter Lloyds Banking Group Plc won its legal battle to cancel its enhanced capital notes, the message should have been clear: if the coupon looks too good to be true, it probably is, at least for individual investors.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has made sure that the new AT1 debt can't be sold to individuals. It should have acted on preference shares at the same time.\n\nAviva hasn't handled this well -- especially given it was going to set precedent for its peers in the insurance industry. Burying a landmine of this size in its annual results runs contrary to the lofty values the insurer espouses in its mission statement. All the more so when it looks like a naked attempt to grab 200 million pounds ($282 million) from one group of investors.\n\nRunning up the white flag now won't save Aviva from lawsuits from aggrieved preference shareholders who sold their holdings in the rout after the insurer's initial announcement. Nor does it leave ordinary shareholders in a better situation: at some point the insurer will have to pay to cancel the securities.\n\nIn Aviva's defense, it was put in this position by its regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the FCA. Both would have been told how Aviva was going to handle the retirement the preference shares, so there should have been no surprise. Their silence over how the replacement of these securities should be handled is deafening.",

                "title": "Small SUVs Will Hog the Spotlight at the New York Auto Show",
                "body": "It's fitting, therefore, that next week's New York International Auto Show will host the brand's biggest effort to shine this year. Cadillac will unveil the XT4 Tuesday, March 27 at an exclusive pre-show party. The tiny crossover will share the same platform as the Chevrolet Malibu and will be among the first to utilize Cadillac's forthcoming hybrid and electric technologies.\n\nThe XT4 will undoubtedly make a splash. The glitzier brands that would normally steal Caddy's thunder -- Aston Martin, Bentley, Ferrari, McLaren and even Volvo's new Polestar, among others -- showed everything they've got weeks ago at the Geneva Motor Show.\n\nThis means that Cadillac, Acura, Lincoln and Lexus will have a chance to make a real impression in New York. As in years past, manufacturers will make their marks with compact, luxury SUVs. This year, however, the case can be made that the NYAS will offer a pivotal moment for the hybrid and electric versions in that lucrative segment. Acura will show a redesigned RDX. Lincoln will flaunt an Aviator, mostly likely in hybrid form. Lexus will introduce to the UX to the U.S. Volkswagen will show a new 5-passenger SUV.\n\n\"The world is interested in new, small SUVs, and you will see plenty of plug-in hybrid versions,\" said Joe Wiesenfelder, the executive editor for Cars.com. The challenge for brands such as Cadillac and Lexus, he said, will be playing catch-up to other brands that have long produced quality products\n\n\"With more competition, there's less room for error, and Cadillac and Lexus haven't had a hit in a while,\" Wiesenfelder said.\n\nCadillac and other domestic manufacturers will have to contend with Jaguar's all-electric I-Pace and BMW's X4, X2, and X3 SUVs. If any of those have a hybrid component as well, the segment will be stuffed. (On the other side of the spectrum, props go to Mercedes-Benz. The brand will bring its iconic gas guzzler, the AMG G63, aka the G Wagon, to the U.S. for the first time.)\n\nHyundai will zip into New York with an all-electric version of its Kona SUV. In European tests, the larger of its two battery packs was good for almost 300 miles of range. That's Tesla territory. The electric version is also likely to make more horsepower and torque than the gas-powered Kona currently available in the States.\n\nThe real star of the show will likely be Toyota's all-new RAV4 SUV. In 2017, a long-in-the-tooth RAV4 still outsold every vehicle in America, save for a few pickups. In short, there's not much for Toyota to gain when it unveils the new version of its compact cash machine next week, but there's plenty to lose. Expect a sportier design, better mileage on its hybrid system and enough trim options to confound even the most diligent car shopper.\n\nAlso on tap in the everyman SUV space is a new Forester from Subaru. The vehicle is almost as popular as its sibling, the Outback, and remarkably similar in size, shape and specs. Now that the company has a legitimate SUV, look for Subaru to give the Forester more of its own identity.\n\nThose wandering over to the Nissan stand will find crowds of people who actually need to buy a car, rather than seed an Instagram feed. The marque will unveil an all new Altima sedan, a dad-jeans car if there ever was one; then again, there are a lot of dads. Americans bought more Altimas than Audis last year -- nearly 255,000 in all. Sober shoppers can expect racier lines and possibly, all-wheel drive, a rare feature in a family sedan.\n\nPerhaps the week's biggest wild card will come from Kia, which plans to unveil a new iteration of its K900 super sedan. You may recall this car from a Lebron James endorsement and a Super Bowl ad. It was the Korean company's play for the 1 percent -- or at least the 5 percent -- and it flopped spectacularly. Kia rebounded with the Stinger GT sport sedan, which does a very capable impression of its German rivals.\n\nAn auto show wouldn't be complete without a concept car or two. Genesis will show one that's rumored to be a plug-in hybrid.\n\nNo car show would be complete without some bling: Porsche will show the new 911 GT3 RS with \"Weissach Package\"; Audi will show an as-yet unnamed \"sport vehicle\"; and Jaguar will debut a \"high-performance\" model that the brand has left rather undefined before its Tuesday debut. Even Cadillac will show a CT6 V-Sport -- a performance-tuned version of the sedan, similar to an AMG from Mercedes-Benz or BMW's M cars.\n\nThese will attract attention and applause from marque devotees. They'll be sexy and fast. Still, these days, tiny SUVs have them all beat.",

While there still may be a tempering in the pace of investment, spending continues to be supported by firmer global economic growth and lower tax rates.\n\nThat was also the message from Federal Reserve policy makers this week. In their statement accompanying a quarter-point increase in interest rates, officials said \"recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings.\" Still, they posited that the \"economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.\"\n\nThe sizable jump in February's figures reflected increases in categories including primary metals, fabricated metal products, machinery and electrical equipment and appliances. That could also reflect possible efforts by businesses to place orders before Trump administration tariffs on imported steel and aluminum took effect. Investors and economists will watch data including durable goods and trade closely in coming months for any indications of an impact from the tariffs and other trade and retaliatory measures.",

It's a different kind of a war but in a trade war appeasement could lead to more and more demands.\"\n\nTrump Thursday instructed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to levy tariffs on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports. China responded today to the earlier Trump levies on steel and aluminum with tariffs on about $3 billion of imports from the U.S., and said it has a \"comprehensive plan\" in place for the second salvo.\n\nBut Stiglitz, a Columbia University economics professor, said China is anyway in a better position to withstand the storm than Trump should a full-blown trade war unfold. That's because it has the tools and resources to help those adversely affected by the fallout from a trade war while the U.S. does not, he said.\n\n\"It's sitting on $3 trillion of reserves that it can use to help those adversely affected,\" he said. \"In the United States we don't have an economic framework that is able to respond to the particular places that will be affected by a trade war.

While Apple and Ireland appeal the decision, regulators demanded that Ireland hold the money in escrow until the process is complete. The appeal may take as long as five years.\n\nThe commission sued Ireland in October for failing to collect the taxes quickly enough. The money, which was initially due by Jan. 3, 2017, will be collected in the second quarter of this year, the Irish government has said. In December, the EU indicated that it could drop the lawsuit if the money was collected.\n\nEarlier this month, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. won the contract to act as custodian for the cash.",

Today's laparoscopic surgeons use high-definition cameras to look inside patients' bodies, but even the older primitive version Moll used blew his mind. \"Wow,\" he recalls thinking. \"This has to be a better way of doing things.\" He withdrew from his residency and began working on medical devices.\n\nMoll, 66, is best known for the da Vinci Surgical System, a large industrial robot that surgeons operate, using electronic hand controls and a video monitor. The device, the top-selling surgical robot, is used in laparoscopic surgeries in thousands of hospitals and retails for about $2 million. Its success has propelled creator Intuitive Surgical Inc., the company Moll founded in 1995, to a market value of about $50 billion. Thanks to Moll's work, robotic surgery is now commonplace, but he argues that it can be improved because it still depends on the precision of a surgeon's hands. Moll believes that robots, powered by machine-learning algorithms and operating autonomously, are already capable of performing simple medical procedures. And after seven years of working in secret to prove it, he's ready to take the first big step.\n\nMoll's new robot, the Monarch Platform, features a pair of arms with a long, blue tube attached, allowing a doctor to steer a camera and other surgical implements deep inside a person's body. This is a new kind of surgical scope, which Moll showed off to a Bloomberg Businessweek reporter earlier this month at the headquarters of Auris Health Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. On March 22, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told Auris it had cleared the device for use under a doctor's control in human lungs. The company says it will be used to diagnose and eventually treat lung cancer.\n\nThe robot can be operated manually, using a controller modeled on the one used for Microsoft's Xbox video-game console. That's what the FDA approved, though Moll thinks the Monarch will also be able to work without human aid. \"It's not science fiction,\" he says. \"It's sort of like self-driving cars. People used to wonder if it was going to be five or 10 years. No, no, no: It's going to be 18 months.\"\n\nAlthough Auris was spun out of Columbia University research in 2007, much of the Monarch technology comes from an earlier Moll startup,Hansen Robotics. Hansen's ill-fated system aimed to use robotic catheters to eliminate the need for open heart surgery, but it proved too expensive when compared with the cardiac stent, a competing technology that became popular around the same time.\n\nMoll left Hansen in 2010, and the following year became the chief executive officer of Auris, which at the time was working on a robotic approach to eye surgery. The company struggled to win FDA approvals. \"They get touchy when you talk about inserting tools in the eye and controlling them with robots,\" Moll says. So he acquired the ailing Hansen and adapted its probe for lung cancer diagnoses. The company has raised about $500 million from such investors as Lux Capital and Mithril Capital Management, controlled by billionaire Peter Thiel.\n\nInvestors were impressed by Moll's willingness to bring Silicon Valley sensibilities to a field in which excellence largely remains a matter of fine motor skills. \"The thing that everyone remembers is the control system,\" says Peter Hebert, a partner with Lux and an Auris director, referring to the Xbox-style controller. \"It's totally unique.\"\n\nMoll says he focused on lung cancer for two reasons. It's the deadliest cancer, killing 1.7 million people a year globally, according to the World Health Organization. (That's double the next-highest total, for liver cancer.) And it's the perfect proving ground, he says, for medical robots.\n\nThe Auris CEO blames lung cancer mortality rates partly on a current screening method's reliance on a manual bronchoscope, which has a limited range of motion and looks like something you might use to check your car's oil level. The Monarch can navigate nimbly through the lung, which looks a little bit like a network of tunnels, and the procedure doesn't require much decision-making beyond knowing where to turn.\n\nNo medical regulator in the world has approved fully robotic surgery, so for now surgeons who sign up for Auris's pilot program will drive the bot. The doctor guides the scope through the lung, starting in the trachea, with a video screen to help navigate. A camera view is on the screen's left side, and a CT-scan-created map and turn-by-turn directions are on the right. Auris tracks the probe's precise location, in part, by comparing data from the camera view to the 3D map, and by using an electromagnetic sensor that works a bit like a miniature GPS. The idea is to collect data after every surgery and feed it back into the navigation software, improving it over time.\n\nOnce the doctor reaches the suspect tumor, identified on the screen with a target, a needle can be run through the snake and used to take a tissue sample. Though the stakes were considerably lower, this reporter was able to drive the probe into a plastic lung after a two-minute training session, using the Xbox-style controller and a simulated version of the machine on an iPad.\n\nMoll says amateurs won't be able to safely perform lung biopsies anytime soon, but argues that the robots, operated under the watch of a surgeon, can do the driving for simple diagnostic procedures. While there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about efforts to automate delicate medical treatment, some surgeons seem receptive. \"I went in a skeptic,\" says Alexander Chen, a pulmonologist at Washington University in St. Louis who performs about 150 scope procedures in patients' lungs each year. But in a test on a cadaver, the Monarch offered more control and reached deeper into the lungs than surgeons' wrists can, says Chen, now an Auris consultant.\n\nQuestions remain, Chen acknowledges, about how well the Monarch will perform. \"There are a lot of moving parts,\" he says, and more research is needed to truly understand the robot's impact. But, he adds, \"This is one of the most novel things in a while, and that gets me excited.\"",

                "body": "Bloc's leaders release sharply worded statement in Brussels\n\nEuropean Union leaders demanded a permanent EU exclusion from U.S. President Donald Trump's metal-import tariffs and kept alive a threat to retaliate, highlighting persistent risks of a trans-Atlantic trade war.\n\nCiting national security, Trump on Friday imposed duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum while granting a five-week waiver to the EU, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Australia and South Korea. An exclusion for those countries beyond May 1 will depend on the status of \"discussions of satisfactory long-term alternative means to address the threatened impairment to U.S. national security,\" the White House said.\n\nThe EU's heads of government responded with a sharply-worded statement expressing \"regrets\" that Trump imposed the metal tariffs at all, saying the measures fail to address the root problem of overcapacity and insisting Europe has already offered the U.S. \"full cooperation\" to help re-balance the global market.\n\n\"These measures cannot be justified on the grounds of national security, and sector-wide protection in the U.S. is an inappropriate remedy for the real problems of overcapacity,\" the bloc's 28 national leaders said in the statement released on Friday in Brussels.\n\nThe EU has spent the past several weeks scrambling for a waiver from the U.S. metal tariffs while warning that a failure to gain one would lead to a tit-for-tat response on 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion) of imports of U.S. goods including Harley-Davidson Inc. motorcycles, Levi Strauss & Co. jeans and bourbon whiskey.\n\nThe EU also said that, without an exemption, it would file a complaint to the World Trade Organization against the Trump administration and introduce \"safeguard\" actions to prevent metal shipments from other parts of the world to America from being diverted to the European market and flooding it. China announced it would complain to the WTO after failing to win any exclusion from the U.S. metal levies.\n\nThe statement by EU leaders \"takes note that shipments of steel and aluminum from the European Union have been temporarily exempted from such measures, and calls for that exemption to be made permanent.\" It also cites the EU's right \"to respond to the U.S. measures as appropriate and in a proportionate manner.\"",

                "body": "The chill winds sweeping across Britain's high street have touched its strongest player: Next Plc.\n\nThe retailer reported its second consecutive fall in annual pre-tax profit before exceptional items after what it described as its most difficult period in 25 years.\n\nBut it maintained its guidance for the current financial year despite recent arctic weather.\n\nThere were a couple of niggles. Net debt has increased to just over 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) from 861 million pounds last year, while inventories also climbed by almost 9 percent. Meanwhile, Next is still forecasting a decline in margins this year due to the transfer of sales from stores to online.\n\nThat is a concern, even as Chief Executive Officer Simon Wolfson forecasts that the squeeze on consumers should start to ease this year.\n\nBut Next deserves credit for tackling head on the plethora of issues it faces as a mature retailer, with a large store base, and significant exposure to the clothing and home furnishing sectors.\n\nIt is already reshaping its real estate portfolio, and expects to renegotiate leases on 29 stores this year, which should result in a 22 percent reduction in rental costs. Another 10 smaller units will close.\n\nThese actions seem to be paying off. The company was in the habit of stress testing its stores against a 6 percent deterioration in like-for-sales, but in its most recent analysis it increased this to a 10 percent sales drop. It found that at the deeper level of sales decline, there's a cash drain of as much as 19 million pounds within 15 years.\n\nHowever, leases will expire in all but 10 stores within that time, so it should be able to exit underperforming properties before they become too much of a drag.\n\nNext is also taking other steps, such as putting services and restaurants in its larger stores. While there is a question mark over whether some additions -- for example, a car showroom in Manchester -- represent the right fit, at least it is doing something.\n\nSimilarly, it is trying to improve its online operations, as rivals have eroded some of its advantage. By far the most profitable part of its Next Directory business is its credit customers. It is exploring offering credit in store. This is risky, but it's a step worth taking.\n\nShares on Friday rose more than 6.5 percent. Next trades on a price to earnings ratio of around 12 times, a premium to M&S, which is just under 10 times.\n\nWhile both retailers are under pressure as customers age and consumer taste change, Next's premium is deserved.\n\nIt is being proactive, but as it's taking incremental steps its actions shouldn't be too much of a jolt to the business.\n\nM&S Chairman Archie Norman is also making changes, such as appointing a new food head on Thursday. But those alterations risk significant profit gyrations from, for example, resetting prices in food, big capital investment in infrastructure and potential write-offs of past spending.\n\nNext is by no means perfect. But the likes of Toys \"R\" Us failed because they didn't try to adapt to shifting consumer habits. Next's actions might not pay off, but nobody can accuse it of standing still.",

He's having to practice what he preaches.\n\nThe Swiss lender's chief executive officer saw his pay fall for last year after shareholder uproar against his proposed remuneration. Thiam received 9.7 million Swiss francs ($10.2 million) for 2017, including long-term awards from previous years, according to the bank's compensation report published on Friday. That's 5 percent less than a year earlier.\n\nThe bank said that Thiam's compensation would \"return to levels in line with the expected improvement\" in the bank's performance.\n\nCredit Suisse posted a third consecutive loss in 2017, driven by a writedown of tax assets in the U.S., with the firm's struggles keeping executive pay in the spotlight. Thiam asked shareholders to stick with the bank, promising higher capital returns from next year.\n\nThe bank's executive board waived 40 percent of its short-term and long-term bonuses to quell criticism from shareholders last year. Swiss laws introduced in 2015 require companies listed in the country to give shareholders a binding vote on board and executive pay.\n\nAt Credit Suisse, Thiam is struggling to make the same amount as at his previous job as CEO at Prudential Plc, where he earned 11.8 million pounds ($16.6 million) in 2014. And he lags behind local rival Sergio Ermotti at UBS Group AG, who received 14.2 million francs last year.\n\nStill, Thiam is earning more than many of his European peers.\n\nING Groep NV abandoned a plan to boost CEO Ralph Hamers's pay after fierce criticism from Dutch leaders including Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra.\n\nDeutsche Bank CEO John Cryan, who is also leading his bank through a restructuring, earned 3.4 million euros in total compensation last year. The bank's management board will waive its bonuses for a third year running, meaning the CEO of Europe's biggest investment bank hasn't seen a penny of variable compensation since he took the job in mid-2015.\n\nCredit Suisse announced on Friday that it had sounded out investors and implemented changes to its compensation policy. The bank dropped capital metrics for its short-term incentives and increased the importance of the bank's cost targets as an incentive. It introduced new components for the long-term incentives including return on tangible equity.\n\nThiam's proposed pay reflects \"his strong performance\" against several measures, \"while also recognizing that the group is still in a transition phase,\" the chairman of the compensation committee, Kai S. Nargolwala, said in the report.\n\nNargolwala said in his first letter to shareholders that he had met with 26 investors covering 40 percent of the shareholder base to discuss the compensation framework after the investor mutiny.\n\nThe overall compensation pool for the executive board fell 4.3 percent to 69.9 million francs, reflecting the cut in long-term incentives from last year, according to the report. Bonuses climbed 50 percent and are awarded based on metrics like the bank's CET1 ratio and adjusted pretax profits. The bonus pool for the bank as a whole rose three percent to 3.2 billion francs.",

Still, the company expects retail margins in the fiscal year to fall mainly as a result of lower like-for-like sales.\n\nNext shares rose as much as 3.5 percent to 4,791 pence in early London trading.\n\nNext's results reflected rare stability amid a retail sector that has been in turmoil. A slowdown in consumer spending resulted in weak sales updates from home-improvement company Kingfisher Plc, fashion retailer Ted Baker Plc and suit seller Moss Bros Group Plc this week. Amid a surge in sourcing and labor costs, as well as the relentless rise of Amazon.com Inc., Toys \"R\" Us Inc.'s U.K. arm and electronics retailer Maplin both collapsed in February.

Stocks plunged led by Boeing Co. amid concerns a trade war is brewing and U.S. exporters and consumers may end up being hurt. Trump argued his aim is to level the playing field after years of intellectual property theft by China. The decision marks the end of decades of constructive engagement with Beijing.\n\nFriday is also set to see the U.S. introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum although it intends to initially shield a list of allies. That may not be able to pacify Group of 20 finance chiefs who used talks in Argentina to warn against protectionism.\n\nRead More:\n\nPresident Xi Jinping went with the continuity candidate in selecting Yi Gang to run the PBOC. The new governor first joined the central bank in 1997 and served as deputy since 2015 to the now departed Zhou Xiaochuan. Yi immediately promised to keep to Zhou's reform path and will face the challenge of cleaning up the nation's finances without crashing the world's second largest economy. But he ultimately knows that the state will be in charge and in that regard, investors will need to closely monitor Liu He, Xi's economic adviser who was elevated to Vice Premier status. Three days after Yi's appointment, the PBOC increased the cost of short-term loans to commercial lenders.\n\nRead More:\n\nPowell chaired his first meeting of the Fed's policy-setting committee as it boosted interest rates for the first time this year. It also forecast a steeper path of hikes in 2019 and 2020, citing an improving economic outlook, yet continued to project a total of three increases this year. Powell indicated in setting policy he will be driven more by the behavior of the economy than by the models and theories which motivated his predecessors. For now, Bloomberg economist Carl Riccadonna reckons his Fed is \"proceeding with a similar sense of gradual deliberation\" as Janet Yellen's.\n\nRead More:\n\nThe Bank of England moved closer to raising interest rates as early as May after keeping its benchmark at 0.5 percent this week.",

                "body": "GlaxoSmithKline Plc withdrew from the bidding for Pfizer Inc.'s consumer-health unit, the second potential buyer to do so this week, in a development that leaves the U.S. drugmaker with dwindling options to dispose of the business that's valued at as much as $20 billion.\n\n\"While we will continue to review opportunities that may accelerate our strategy, they must meet our criteria for returns and not compromise our priorities for capital allocation,\" Glaxo Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley said in a statement Friday. Shares of the U.K. drugmaker surged as much as 5.9 percent in London, their biggest intraday gain in four years.\n\nLondon-based Glaxo made a final bid Wednesday that could value the U.S. giant's over-the-counter treatments at about $15 billion to $20 billion, people familiar with the matter said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Pfizer, based in New York, could pursue a potential spinoff of the unit or hold on to it, the people said, after Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc also pulled out of the process.\n\nGlaxo's Walmsley has been shaking up the drugmaker, focusing on developing promising new drugs. The consumer division has experienced pressure on prices as drugstores and other retailers vie to get shoppers. Glaxo's investors balked last year when Walmsley mentioned interest in the Pfizer unit, fearing that it might endanger the U.K. drugmaker's dividend.\n\nThe purchase \"would have been too expensive,\" Oddo & Cie analyst Sebastien Malafosse said in a telephone interview. \"Such an amount would have put GSK's dividend at risk.\"\n\nPfizer said in an emailed statement that it's evaluating potential strategic alternatives for the business, which include a spinoff, a sale or other transaction, or retaining the business. The company expects to make a decision in 2018.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. and other online retailers also pose a significant challenge in consumer health, offering low prices and home delivery. Bayer AG cited an \"Amazon effect\" last year on its consumer unit last year, saying that as bricks and mortar stores closed, Internet sales were slicing into its share.\n\nThe conditions have prompted some companies to try to shed their consumer divisions. Merck KGaA has been exploring options -- including a sale -- for its consumer-health unit since September. The company has promised a decision by the end of the first half.\n\nPfizer's business sells popular brands such as the pain reliever Advil and the dietary supplement Centrum. A purchase by Glaxo would have been complicated by its joint venture in consumer health with Swiss drug giant Novartis AG, which has been reluctant to dive further into over-the-counter health products, the people said.",

                "title": "Your Spoiler-Filled Preview of the New Season of Billions",
                "body": "For filmmakers who want to dramatize the finance industry, one of Wall Street's main appeals is that most people don't understand how it works. In The Big Short, actress Margot Robbie explains subprime mortgages while sipping champagne in a bubble bath. Other movies -- Margin Call and Wall Street come to mind -- use fast-talking men in power suits screaming into cell phones to accomplish their exposition.\n\nTypically, very little of the actual mechanics of working in finance ever come into play. (To be fair, it would be hard to dramatize an earnings call, and to be clear, nobody should try.)\n\nWhen Showtime's Billions first aired two years ago, one of its initial draws was that it talked the talk. The story was woven around a surprisingly sophisticated debate about the parameters of insider trading, and the show gave a fairly accurate depiction of a hedge fund's workplace culture, with analysts and traders and managers and compliance officers. There were even Bloomberg Terminals.\n\nYes, an improbable drama pitted U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti) against high-flying hedge fund manager Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis), replete with loaded guns, S&M clubs, and private jets. But the tools, jargon, and financial mechanisms that entered into the narrative as plot points always brought the show back to the real world.\n\nIn Billions' third season, which will premiere on Sunday, March 25, that verity is occasionally overwhelmed by a labyrinth of interpersonal drama. When the season begins, Rhoades is ascendant. His wife Wendy (Maggie Siff) has come back to him, and his path to the governorship appears to be secure. Axelrod has been indicted, and, after posting bail, holes up in a very large apartment in New York to plot revenge.\n\nThe show's creators wisely seem to have decided that the mano-a-mano grudge match between Rhoades and Axelrod has run its course, at least for the first five episodes provided for review. Instead, characters from the supporting cast -- most notably Taylor, the gender-neutral math whiz played by the excellent Asia Kate Dillon -- take the spotlight.\n\nWith the exception of a slightly uncomfortable altercation in a steam room, the novelty of Taylor's non-binary gender has been left in the dust of last season, and they emerge as a full-fledged character with a singular plot line.\n\nTaylor has been appointed chief investment officer of Axelrod's firm, Axe Capital. Axelrod, though, isn't out of the picture. He's just behind the scenes, leaving Taylor torn between running a multibillion-dollar fund and playing interference with its nominal boss. (This is Taylor's firm, but it's still Axelrod's money.)\n\nThe show, meanwhile, manages to include a dizzying amount of \"insider\" signaling to those in the know. We see artwork by Ellsworth Kelly, Jasper Johns, John Baldessari, Pablo Picasso, and Robert Motherwell spread across apartments and office suites.\n\nAnd then there are the locations. It's as if Billions picked up where Sex and the City left off: Characters have milkshakes at the Vaselka Diner, go to the Russian and Turkish Baths in the East Village, play ping pong at Wang Chen's Table Tennis Club on the Upper West Side, and munch on bialys at Kossar's on the Lower East Side. New York's fine-dining establishments are also checked off: We see action in Daniel, at which the restaurant's real-life owner Daniel Boulud makes a slightly awkward cameo. Can a Billions tour bus be far behind?\n\nThere are also moments -- perhaps too many for comfort -- where the show turns its back on plausibility. An entire episode is devoted to whether or not Axe Capital employees can stomach quants in the office, as if they'd never heard of James Simons's Renaissance Technologies, or read Flash Boys. \"First it makes things better for you. Then it destroys you,\" says one of Axe Capitals ostensibly cut-throat traders, of trading algorithms. \"This is how computers take over the world.\"\n\nThere's also an ongoing plot line that involves a \"counter-intel team\" hired by Axelrod, which manages to launder money and hack into the network of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency's database to alter the subject of a raid.\n\nAnd while the de-emphasis on the battle between Rhoades and Axelrod is welcome, the sheer number of subplots that take its place can feel almost Dickensian, as if everyone in Bleak House were given a Maybach and a trading portfolio.\n\nFor the most part, though, these quibbles are possible only because so much of the show seems credible. The characters might be larger than life, but the world of high finance -- amorphous, abstract, and global, in the real world -- is, in Billions' universe, as real as it gets.",

                "title": "This $55,000 Desktop UFO Tells the Time, Weather, Your Quirky Taste",
                "body": "Well, what we've got for you here is a little non-traditional to say the least. MB&F and L'Epée 1839 have teamed up yet again, and I think it's safe to say that this is their most ambitious creation yet. Having previously made a handful of clocks, including Balthazar, Melchior, and Arachnophobia, the two are pushing things further this time around with The Fifth Element, a desktop weather station that includes a clock, barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer. And oh yeah, the whole thing is \"piloted\" by a little alien. Like I said -- non-traditional.\n\nThe Fifth Element was inspired by mid-century desktop weather stations, though you might never guess that from looking at it. This station takes some functional elements of those originals, but reimagines them aesthetically and pushes the boundaries technologically. When fully assembled, The Fifth Element includes over 500 components, measures 376mm across by 209mm high (14.8 x 8.2 inches), and weighs 15 kilograms (over 33 pounds). It's not small. The main structure is made of solid brass and looks like a UFO with four pods, each of which contains one of the instruments. They can be taken out of the base, stood up on their own, and then reassembled in whatever configuration you might like.\n\nAt the core of The Fifth Element is the clock (and here you see it arranged on top). It is 124mm across and 92mm high (4.9 x 3.6 inches) and features familiar MB&F styling, specifically in terms of the typography. Powering it is an in-house L'Epée movement that has an eight-day power reserve and a vertical architecture that allows you to better see the key components, including the escapement. There are 161 parts in the movement and it has an Incabloc shock system so that you don't disturb its performance when taking it in and out of the base station. The finishing is all to the same standards you'd expect from an MB&F watch and there's plenty of volume to play with here.\n\nThe three other modules are similarly styled, though without the mechanics revealed. There is a barometer that shows the air pressure, a thermometer that shows the air temperature, and a hygrometer that shows the ambient air humidity. While you might not need these measurements when you can just pull out your phone and open Dark Sky, there's something very appealing about these analog devices. If you're already into mechanical watches, this isn't much of a stretch, really. You'll notice here that each has a little legs too, so you can display them on their own.\n\nSitting on the base of the weather station is a solid bronze alien. He's perched there as the \"pilot\" of the UFO and L'Epée 1839 engineered a special clockwork mechanism that can rotate him around the base of the weather station at the push of a button. Also, the alien's name is Ross. Because of course it is.\n\nAs usual, MB&F have succeeded in creating an object that none of us actually need, but many of us will need. It's mechanically complex, endlessly charming, and a great example of thinking about horology in a fun way that isn't bound by typical conventions. I definitely wouldn't argue with having one of these sitting on my desk (though I think I'd need a bigger desk). I cannot wait to see this thing in person soon at Baselworld.\n\nThe Fifth Element is a limited edition of just 54 total pieces, with 18 being made in each of the three colors (black, silver, and blue). It is available right now and retails for CHF 52,000 (without VAT). For more, visit MB&F online.",

                "body": "The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is on the verge of mopping up local dollars for the first time since a trading band was introduced in May 2005, as the currency slides toward HK$7.85 per greenback.\n\nThe local currency was at HK$7.8491 against the dollar as of 3 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA's move would tighten liquidity and raise rates in the city, ending an era of ultra-cheap money that made Hong Kong the least affordable housing market in the world and sent the stock market to a record high. The Hong Kong dollar has been on a downtrend over the past year as ample liquidity prevented local rates from catching up with those in the U.S., prompting traders to borrow the local currency to buy the dollar.\n\nUnder the currency peg, the rates have to eventually converge. That started to happen last year when the HKMA sold additional debt, but the effect was temporary. By shrinking the monetary base, direct purchases of the Hong Kong dollar should exert a much larger upward pressure on rates. That would be a drastic change for Hong Kong, which has never had to defend the weak end of its currency band thanks to strong inflows.\n\nHere's a QuickTake Q&A on the Hong Kong dollar.\n\nSince the global financial crisis in 2008, about $130 billion to $140 billion of funds have entered Hong Kong, with inflows intensifying over the past few months, Paul Chan, Hong Kong's financial secretary, told reporters on March 5.\n\nCaught between U.S. easing and steady economic growth in China, Hong Kong saw interbank liquidity swell to records -- in the starkest contrast, 100 times its pre-crisis levels. In the Bank for International Settlements' measure of the gap between economies' credit-to-gross domestic product ratios and their long-term trend, Hong Kong came first, indicating unusually rapid debt growth in recent years.\n\n\"Actually it's good for Hong Kong if some hot money leaves, because then the pace of interest-rate normalization would be more ideal,\" Hong Kong's Chan said.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive Norman Chan said on March 8 that the HKMA would step in when the exchange rate reached HK$7.85 and that there was \"no need to worry.\" He said it wasn't true that the authority doesn't want to see a weaker exchange rate, and that it didn't have any plans to issue extra Exchange Fund Bills. His comments sent the Hong Kong dollar down past HK$7.84 versus the greenback that day, extending its weakest level since 1984.",

Both Bolton and new Secretary of State pick, Mike Pompeo, are more hawkish than their predecessors. Each has advocated regime change in Iran and North Korea.\n\nAnd with China's ambassador explicitly warning of a trade war, annoying China may not be the best way for Trump to forge a united front on North Korea ahead of the proposed summit with Kim.\n\nThe plot to reverse Brexit | The U.K.'s anti-Brexit movement is sensing for the first time that it can win. Tim Ross and Kitty Donaldson profile Chuka Umunna, the 39-year-old Labour member of Parliament leading the effort, and reveal how, with intelligence on the negotiations supplied by EU officials, it's lobbying lawmakers to defeat the final deal a weakened Prime Minister Theresa May puts to a vote in October in order to force a new referendum.\n\nDisillusioned Eastern Europe | Protesters who jingled their their keys in the main square in Slovakia's capital for three weeks to demand the government's ouster got their wish yesterday: The president named a new leadership after protests over a journalist's murder prompted the resignation of three-time Prime Minister Robert Fico. The shakeup is the latest example of the increasing volatility in Europe's east, with its nations clashing with the EU over the rule of law and its citizens taking to the streets to oppose graft and misuse of power.\n\nAbe's diminished charm | After 16 months of warm words, lavish gifts and rounds of golf, Japan's Shinzo Abe may be discovering the limits of personal rapport with Trump as the U.S. leader reshuffles his administration and upends his North Korea and trade policies. The blows come at a sensitive time for Abe, who's caught up in a land-sale scandal.\n\nFacing farmers' fury | Pushing back against claims that his ruling party is \"on the back foot,\" Indian leader Narendra Modi is pulling out all the stops to win the southern swing state of Karnataka and smooth his way to re-election in 2019. But the vote is said to turn on the vote of 8 million farmers, many of them furious with Modi's government over its rural failures.\n\nTurkish clampdown | Already the world's leading jailer of journalists, Turkey is squeezing the last remaining independence out of its battered media by widening the radio and television censor's powers to include the Internet. As Benjamin Harvey reports, the moves come as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in power for 15 years, prepares to cement his control with elections next year that will abolish the post of prime minister and codify what is essentially one-man rule.\n\nAnd finally... A commercial airliner flying to Tel Aviv crossed through the skies of Saudi Arabia for the first time yesterday, ending an era during which a direct route was impossible because of Middle East tensions. Air India flight 139 took off from New Delhi and passed over Oman before entering Saudi airspace. The seven-hour flight landed in Tel Aviv shortly after 10 p.m.",

                "body": "Beijing -- Bloomberg today announced that it will add Chinese RMB-denominated government and policy bank securities to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, once several planned operational enhancements are implemented by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and Ministry of Finance. The addition of these securities will be phased in over a 20-month period starting April 2019.\n\nWhen fully accounted for in the Global Aggregate Index, local currency Chinese bonds will be the fourth largest currency component following the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen. Using data as of January 31, 2018, the index would include 386 Chinese securities and represent 5.49% of a $53.73 trillion index.\n\n\"Today's announcement recognizes China's continued efforts over recent years to enhance access to the world's third-largest bond market,\" said Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Chair of the Working Group on U.S. RMB Trading and Clearing. \"It is a testament to China's firm commitment to financial reforms and the pace of change taking place in its bond market, and another important step for China's integration with global financial markets.\"\n\nIn order to be considered for inclusion in the Global Aggregate Index, a local currency debt market must be classified as investment grade and its currency must be freely tradable, convertible, hedgeable, and free of capital controls. Ongoing enhancements from the PBoC have resulted in RMB-denominated securities meeting these absolute index rules.\n\nAdditional enhancements are required prior to the planned inclusion date to increase investor confidence and to improve market accessibility. Among these are: the implementation of delivery vs. payment settlement, ability to allocate block trades across portfolios, and clarification on tax collection policies. Should progress on these enhancements be delayed, China's inclusion in the Global Aggregate Index and other Bloomberg Barclays Indices may also be delayed.\n\n\"Bloomberg's inclusion of RMB-denominated bonds in the most widely-used fixed income benchmarks represents a pivotal development for investors around the world,\" said Henry M. Paulson, Co-Chair of The Working Group on U.S. RMB Trading and Clearing. \"China's new position in international bond portfolios will pave the way for robust market activity and support continued financial reforms.\"\n\n\"The Chinese interbank bond markets continue to evolve, and Bloomberg will reflect the maturation of this asset class in our global benchmarks,\" said Steve Berkley, Global Head of Bloomberg Indices. \"Following our introduction of the China Aggregate index in 2004 and the +China indices in 2017, the official inclusion of RMB-denominated securities in the Global Aggregate Index reflects the next natural step expected by global investors.\"\n\nIn addition to the Global Aggregate Index, Chinese RMB-denominated debt will be eligible for inclusion in the Global Treasury and EM Local Currency Government Indices starting April 2019.\n\nThe planned inclusion of the Chinese market in the Global Aggregate, Global Treasury, and EM Local Currency Government Indices will be phased in over a 20-month period, starting in April 2019 with a scaling factor of 5% and increasing in 5% increments each month. Bloomberg will review the speed of implementation on an annual basis, per the company's governance process.\n\nBloomberg will create ex-China versions of the Global Aggregate, Global Treasury and EM Local Currency Government Indices for index users who wish to track benchmarks that exclude China. Bloomberg will also offer to create customized capped versions of the indices for investors looking to limit exposure to China.\n\nBloomberg provides an independent, transparent approach to indexing for customers across the globe.

                "title": "Trump Takes Hawkish Turn in Picking Bolton as Top Security Aide",
                "body": "Some Bolton positions conflict with Trump's campaign promises\n\nPresident Donald Trump is taking a sharply hawkish foreign-policy turn with the appointment of John Bolton as national security adviser, ditching moderates and installing an inner circle that championed some of the policies he derided on the campaign trail.\n\nThe announcement that the mustachioed Bolton will replace H.R. McMaster next month came a week after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and named CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace him. Bolton and Pompeo have advocated regime change in Iran and North Korea, while Tillerson has said he would keep up the diplomacy until the first bombs fell, no matter the crisis.\n\nThe appointment marks a jarring shift for Trump, who promised on the campaign trail to \"shake the rust off\" American foreign policy and focus on his \"America First\" message: get out of costly overseas wars and spend money at home instead of abroad.\n\nMost of Trump's confrontations overseas have centered on trade, or a sense of injustice over America's share of the burden ensuring global security and prosperity. But that could change under Bolton and Pompeo.\n\n\"With Bolton's appointment, you've got the most conservative ideological and hawkish foreign policy advisers in recent memory at time when toughness is required but so is pragmatism and flexibility,\" said Aaron David Miller, a former adviser at the State Department. \"He knows the government well, but smoothing over differences was never John Bolton's forte.\"\n\nThe shifting views of the Trump Cabinet comes at a crucial time, weeks ahead of foreign policy decisions that could reshape the U.S. role in the world for decades.\n\nOn May 12, Trump must decide whether to recommit to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. By the end of May, he has pledged to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. And the U.S. will formally move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv the same month.\n\nThe staffing change comes as the president faces tough decisions on whether to punish\n\nRussia. His security advisers discussed on Wednesday a list of options to\n\npresent Trump, including fresh sanctions, closing consulates and expelling\n\npeople from the U.S., according to two people familiar with the matter. Trump\n\nhas been asking aides what allies -- including France and Germany -- are doing\n\nin response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the UK.\n\nBolton, a proponent of the 2003 Iraq war, has remained unrepentant in his view that ousting Saddam Hussein was the right move, saying only that the U.S. bungled the aftermath of the campaign.\n\nTrump, by contrast, repeatedly condemned the decision to invade Iraq during his campaign. Earlier this month, he told a group of donors in Florida that the invasion was \"the single worst decision ever made\" and that it amounted to \"throwing a big fat brick into a hornet's nest,\" according to a recording obtained by CNN.\n\nLike Pompeo, Bolton has argued that the Iran nuclear deal should be torn up and says a Trump-Kim meeting will be mainly useful as a way to expose Kim Jong Un's desire to keep his nuclear weapons.\n\nNorth Korea has already made clear what it thinks about Trump's new national security adviser, once calling him \"human scum\" and a \"bloodsucker.\" That was after Bolton called for the overthrow of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il.\n\nIn the years since Bolton stint from 2005 to 2006 as ambassador to the United Nations, he has served as a Fox News contributor and senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute and worked in the Washington office of the law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP. He has also been a frequent behind-the-scenes visitor to Trump in the Oval Office and had campaigned openly to replace McMaster in recent weeks.\n\nBolton downplayed the significance of his past public statements in an interview with Fox News shortly after the appointment was announced, saying he would defer to the president's judgment.\n\n\"I've never been shy about what my views are,\" Bolton said. But, he added, that \"now is behind me, at least effective April 9, and the important thing is what the president says and what advice I give him.\"\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter late Thursday night, Bolton said, \"I look forward to working with President Trump and his leadership team in addressing these complex challenges in an effort to make our country safer at home and stronger abroad.\"\n\nThe move installs Trump's third national security adviser in 14 months. McMaster joined the administration a year ago after Trump fired his predecessor, Michael Flynn, for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with Russia. An Army lieutenant general, McMaster has traveled with Trump to several countries and helped craft the president's national security approach to North Korea, Afghanistan, Iran and other global hot spots. Hours after his departure was announced, he received a standing ovation at a Washington dinner hosted by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump had initially considered Bolton for secretary of state, and later offered him the job of Tillerson's deputy -- a position he turned down. Bolton had also been considered for the national security adviser job after the ouster of Flynn, and though Trump chose McMaster, the president went out of his way to praise Bolton, saying he \"had a good number of ideas that I must tell you I agree very much with.\"\n\nThe appointment also allows him to pull Bolton into his inner circle without risking a confirmation battle in the Senate, where Bolton would face near universal opposition from Democrats and wariness from many Republicans. Bolton couldn't win confirmation to the post as U.N. ambassador under Bush, so he only received a temporary recess appointment to the job.\n\n\"John Bolton has demonstrated throughout his career he is an extremist and reckless partisan with little regard for U.S. values or allies,\" said Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. \"I am concerned about what advice he has given the president thus far and how he will use his official position to skew America's national security in the future.\"\n\nThe change was welcomed by Republicans. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida applauded Bolton as \"an excellent choice who will do a great job.\"\n\nAssociates close to Bolton argue that while he believes in the credible threat of force, he values diplomacy above all. Critics frequently describe him as a bull in a china shop, and his appointment as ambassador to the UN in 2005 was seen as a Bush administration gesture of disrespect to the institution.\n\nWith the picks, Trump is also making a bet that he won't alienate the millions of conservatives weary of the now 16-year war in Afghanistan and the high cost of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\n\"He is an operator who has worked the Washington scene for decades, and played a long game to win over Trump,\" said Richard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"If I were sitting in North Korea or Iran, I would buckle up for a wild ride. Even if Bolton is actually more pragmatic than he pretends to be, opponents of the U.S. are going to view American diplomacy with extra suspicion from now on.\"",

                "title": "Trump Country in Greatest Peril as China Tariffs Risk Trade War",
                "body": "Rural areas vulnerable to retaliation against farm products\n\nTrump Country looks to be hit hardest as China strikes back against new tariffs the U.S. president announced Thursday.\n\nU.S. agriculture and the president's rural political base are in China's sights as it weighs retaliation after Donald Trump slapped tariffs on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nIn its initial counterstrike, China announced a 25 percent levy on U.S. pork imports -- a heavy blow to Iowa, the top pork-producing state and a political battleground that swung to Trump in 2016 after going for Democrat Barack Obama in the previous two elections.\n\nFor Trump, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and on steel and aluminum imports are the fulfillment of pledges he made in his campaign to crack down on perceived trade abuses. Those promises likely helped him win key states including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe administration has offered exemptions on the steel and aluminum tariffs to some countries, and on Thursday night announced that it would at least initially shield allies, including Europe, Australia, South Korea, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nBut the president risks broader damage to the economy and to his political standing if the tit-for-tat with China escalates into a trade war, an outcome investors worried was growing more likely, sending stocks tumbling.\n\n\"We do not want a trade war with the United States or with anybody else. But we are not afraid of it,\" Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted to the U.S. embassy's Facebook page. \"If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will certainly fight back and retaliate. If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday fell 724 points, almost 3 percent, its biggest drop in six weeks.\n\nVoters' perceptions of the economy are always crucial to the political strength of a president and his party. Trump in particular has staked his success on the strength of the economy, repeatedly promising stronger growth and crediting his policies for improvements.\n\nHe recognized the electoral impact of trade as he signed the tariff order. \"It's probably one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons,\" Trump said at the White House.\n\nTrump's order calls for 25 percent duties on targeted Chinese products to compensate for what the White House says is harm caused to the American economy by China's policies, according to a fact sheet released by the U.S. Trade Representative. The proposed product list will include goods in the aerospace, information and communication technology and machinery industries. USTR will announce the proposed list within \"several days,\" according to the fact sheet.\n\nChina has plenty of leverage over the Farm Belt voters who helped elect Trump. He captured 61 percent of the vote in U.S. rural areas and small towns, according to exit polls. The Asian nation is the most important foreign customer for U.S. agriculture; China purchased about one-third of the entire U.S. soybean harvest last year.\n\nAny hit to agricultural producers' earnings would be especially painful as falling commodity prices already are hurting rural America. U.S. farm income is forecast to drop 6.7 percent this year to its lowest level since 2006, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that assumed normal trade relations with China.\n\n\"Were farmers faced with falling prices for the exports and higher prices at home because of the import tariffs, the popularity of the tariffs would diminish quickly,\" Mike Jakeman, a global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said by email. \"This is a high-risk strategy for the U.S. administration and one that is likely to weaken, rather than strengthen, the global economy.\"\n\nWhile some lawmakers welcomed Trump's get-tough approach, those with constituencies most vulnerable to Chinese countermeasures urged caution. U.S. farmers and manufacturers braced for retaliation.\n\nRural lawmakers' anxiety over the possibility was clear as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.\n\nRepublicans including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, which is also the nation's biggest soybean-producing state, raised concerns about Chinese retaliation against American farmers. Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, also expressed his displeasure at the potential impact on rural areas.\n\n\"Our farmers and ranchers want to be able to export the goods that they are producing here in the United States,\" Bennet said. \"They don't need sympathy; they need the administration to act responsibly.\"\n\nLighthizer acknowledged farmers could bear the brunt of retaliation.\n\n\"The most vulnerable sector of the economy are the ones who export and farmers are a very sympathetic group,\" Lighthizer said.",

                "title": "Trump Fundraiser Offered to Help Lift Sanctions on Russian Firms",
                "body": "Elliott Broidy, a top fundraiser for President Donald Trump, offered last year to help a Moscow-based lawyer get Russian companies removed from a U.S. sanctions list.\n\nBroidy made the offer after an inquiry from Andrei Baev, an energy lawyer at Chadbourne & Parke LLP, both men acknowledged in statements to Bloomberg News this week. In a proposal sent to Baev shortly before Trump's January 2017 inauguration, Broidy sketched out a potential campaign to influence top U.S. officials, according to a person with knowledge of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe plan never went forward, Broidy and Baev said, and no such lobbying took place. But the discussions are a striking illustration of how Russians' efforts to escape sanctions led them to seek political allies close to Trump. Broidy, a Los Angeles money manager and deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a written statement to Bloomberg that he didn't offer to \"personally\" set up meetings with top U.S. officials for Baev's clients. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"From the beginning I made it clear that while I would consider trying to help the firm build a team and to put them in touch with some experts, I am not a lobbyist and didn't plan on becoming one,\" Broidy said in a statement. \"I also made clear from the beginning that any arrangement we reached would need to be in full compliance with U.S. law. We never made any agreement, and the project never went anywhere. I never contacted any U.S. officials on behalf of Chadbourne or its clients and never had any contact with Chadbourne's clients.\"\n\nBloomberg News received two separate documents this week purporting to be versions of the January 2017 proposal. The documents, both of which were labeled drafts, were sent from similar email addresses using the name LA Confidential. Bloomberg couldn't verify the authenticity of the documents, which are identical except for proposed fee amounts and minor formatting differences.\n\nLA Confidential has been distributing unflattering emails and documents about Broidy to media outlets in recent weeks. Broidy said the documents were stolen from his computer servers and, in some cases, altered or combined with fabrications. People close to Broidy said many stolen emails were deleted from his server, making it difficult to determine whether documents were tampered with before being leaked to the media.\n\nA fixture in Republican fundraising circles for decades, Broidy is a staunch supporter of Israel and has business interests in the Middle East. During the presidential campaign, he served as a vice chairman of Trump's joint fundraising committee.\n\nBroidy, who supports the blockade of Qatar, has accused agents of that gulf state's government of hacking his computer servers and orchestrating the media leaks. Previous disclosures from LA Confidential described a scrapped proposal for Broidy to help a Malaysian businessman under U.S. criminal investigation. Another set of documents detailed his advocacy work in Washington in support of the United Arab Emirates, where a private security firm he controls has a government contract.\n\nEarlier: Trump Fundraiser's Email Breach Shows Risks Before Midterms\n\nLee Wolosky, an attorney for Broidy at Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, sent a letter this week to Qatar's embassy in Washington citing \"irrefutable forensic evidence tying Qatar\" to the theft of his emails and threatening \"legal remedies.\"\n\nBroidy's \"baseless accusations are just more diversionary tactics by him,\" a spokesman for the Qatari embassy said Tuesday. \"Qatar has not engaged in any of the activities alleged by Mr. Broidy.\"\n\nWith law degrees from institutions in Russia and California, Baev has worked for corporate law firms in the U.S., London and Moscow, according to his LinkedIn profile. At the time of his discussions with Broidy, he was the managing partner at Chadbourne's Moscow office.\n\nIn a telephone interview Tuesday from Moscow, Baev said an investment banker introduced him to Broidy in New York in the summer of 2016 during discussions about an unrelated transaction.\n\nTrump's election a few months later signaled a potential rapprochement with Russia. As the inauguration approached, several global law firms were exploring work they could do to help companies and individuals subject to U.S. sanctions, Baev said. Prompted by \"a possible instruction from one of my corporate clients,\" Baev said, he reached out to Broidy as well as another potential Washington consultant.\n\nBaev declined to identify the client and said he was never retained to pursue the matter. He previously had done work for large Russian energy companies, including Lukoil Pjsc and Kremlin-controlled Gazprom Pjsc, according to a 2015 article in a U.K. legal publication.\n\nAbbe Lowell, then a U.S.-based partner at Chadbourne, also took part in the firm's internal discussions about sanctions work, Baev said. Chadbourne has since become part of the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, where Lowell's clients now include Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law.\n\nDan McKenna, a spokesman for Lowell and Norton Rose, said in an email that Chadbourne didn't do any work to remove Russian companies from the U.S. sanctions list.\n\nRemoving a company or individual from the U.S. sanctions list is an interagency process designed to reduce political influence, said Erich Ferrari, a Washington lawyer specializing in sanctions.\n\n\"It's absurd to think that someone's political connections could get a sanctioned person off the list,\" Ferrari said. \"Once someone is sanctioned, they become politically toxic, and you don't find a lot of people in Washington who are willing to stick their neck out for a sanctioned party.\"\n\nThe purported drafts of the proposal viewed by Bloomberg contain a \"road map\" that includes meetings at the highest levels of the Trump administration and with lawmakers who oversee foreign affairs. Shown a copy of one version of the document, Broidy said some details about fees were inaccurate, but he didn't comment on the contents of the \"road map.\"\n\nBaev said the potential client ended up hiring another firm and senior management at Chadbourne wasn't supportive of the project. Baev later moved to a different firm.",

                "body": "Omnibus bill makes money available, without mentioning project\n\nThe battle over designating money for the Northeast Corridor rail project is finished, but the war over funding it goes on.\n\nThe $1.3 trillion spending measure approved by the House on Thursday doesn't contain direct financing for the Gateway rail tunnel and bridge project linking New Jersey and New York City after President Donald Trump made his firm opposition clear to Republicans in Congress.\n\n\"It gives Donald Trump the decision on Gateway,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said of the bill on Fox News.\n\nBut advocates for the project say that the White House and Republican leaders are mistaken if they think New York and New Jersey got shut out.\n\nNew York Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader and a champion of the plan, said there's a \"firm\" $540 million for Gateway through money allocated to Amtrak for capital improvements and in formula grants that New York and New Jersey officials have agreed to use for the project.\n\n\"I would bet now that the president sees that Gateway is happening that they're not going to stand in the way,\" Schumer told reporters Thursday at the Capitol.\n\nThe Department of Transportation said in a statement Thursday that the spending bill, headed for final passage by the Senate, \"removes preferential treatment for the New York and New Jersey Gateway projects.\" The statement also said that the department reviews all federal grants to Amtrak and the president appoints its board members.\n\nThe comments highlight a broader disagreement about the role of the federal government in funding large infrastructure projects like Gateway, with the Trump administration arguing that New York and New Jersey must provide more \"skin in the game,\" and local officials arguing that states don't have the resources to build big projects on their own.\n\n\"States and the private sector must play a role, but only the federal government has the tax base and funding capacity to underwrite these major new infrastructure upgrades,\" said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a civic organization representing scores of corporate chief executives.\n\nThe $30 billion Gateway program encompasses several projects, including a new $12.7 billion rail tunnel under the Hudson River to supplement a failing, century-old tunnel and a new Portal Bridge over the Hackensack River. The link between New Jersey and Manhattan for New Jersey Transit and Amtrak is critical to the Northeast Corridor, which runs from Boston to Washington and carries more than 750,000 passengers daily.\n\nGateway advocates had sought $900 million in directed money for the projects in the spending bill, but Trump pressed congressional leaders to remove language specifically steering funds to the program. The administration declared victory, saying there's no reference to Gateway in the bill.\n\nBut Schumer and other Gateway proponents pointed to $650 million in additional financing allocated to Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account, saying with that level of funding, Amtrak can commit at least $388 million directly to Gateway. There also is $153 million that will flow to the two states by formula, plus $2.9 billion in discretionary grants for which projects sponsors can apply.\n\n\"This is going to be a good way to get the project started,\" said Mike Friedberg, executive director of the Coalition for the Northeast Corridor, a group of transportation advocates and businesses. \"Once you start it, you're going to see the need.\"\n\nStill, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao wants more state funding on the grounds that almost all proposed money for the tunnel would come from the federal government through either loans or grants, crowding out other projects. New York and New Jersey officials dispute that and say they had a deal, forged during the Obama administration, for the federal government to fund half the cost, a deal the Trump administration doesn't acknowledge.\n\nTom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, a New York urban policy group, said both sides can claim victory with the spending bill because there's no specified funding for Gateway but enough money to keep the program going for now.\n\n\"It kind of takes the heat out of this particular flashpoint and says, 'Let's have a conversation about what is the federal role in infrastructure, what is the local role, what are the mechanisms we want to do to fund these?\" he said. \"All of that can now be discussed.\"",

                "body": "Government measures to attract investment include tax benefits\n\nWhen it comes to tech startup hubs in Southeast Asia, entrepreneurs sometimes look past Malaysia to the lure of Singapore's vibrant financial center or Indonesia's attractiveness as the region's largest economy.\n\nThey shouldn't, said a former Microsoft Corp. executive who's now in charge of driving the country's digital economy. Policy makers are serious about developing the sector that created more than 170,000 new jobs and contributed 18.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2017, said Yasmin Mahmood, chief executive officer of government agency Malaysia Digital Economy Corp.\n\nMDEC's initiatives to encourage entrepreneurs to set up shop in the country of 32 million people span new immigration policies and tax incentives, Yasmin said in an interview in Singapore Tuesday. Malaysia grants a one-year visit pass for tech entrepreneurs based overseas and up to a decade of tax exemption for startups, including those that are fully foreign-owned, she said.\n\n\"We are open for the world to come and play,\" said Yasmin, who held management positions in the Malaysian offices of Dell Corp. and Microsoft before joining MDEC in 2014. \"The private sector is going to lead the digital economy and the government is going to be the wind beneath their wings.\"\n\nSuch measures have helped technology companies generate total revenue of $13 billion in 2017, up 8 percent from 2016, she said.\n\nStill, Malaysia lags behind its neighbors in drawing investments. Singapore attracted $7.2 billion in tech startup capital from 2012 through September 2017, the most in Southeast Asia, according to CB Insights. Indonesia pulled in $4.6 billion, while Malaysia got $1.3 billion during the same period.\n\nThere are some wins. CXS International, a workforce and talent analytics platform, relocated its headquarters from Norway to Malaysia, while Vickers Venture Partners, a Singapore-based VC firm, opened its office in Kuala Lumpur in February.\n\nGerman entrepreneur Jonathan Weins co-founded healthy food delivery app Dahmakan in Malaysia and the startup is part of a growing number that are expanding beyond Malaysia.\n\nKuala Lumpur-based iFlix, co-founded by serial entrepreneurs Patrick Grove and Mark Britt, offers a cheaper alternative to Netflix tailored to customers in emerging markets and has expanded across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Since its inception in Malaysia in 2015, Carsome, a used-car online platform, has entered Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore.",

                "body": "Social media site has grown into a colossus of political ads Digital media projected to get 20% of campaign ad spending\n\nPolitical consultant Mark Jablonowski predicts that Facebook Inc. won't lack for political ads during this year's campaign season despite the rancor caused by Russian election meddling and a massive data leak.\n\n\"For the time being, people are still on Facebook, and political advertisers want to advertise where their constituents are,\" said Jablonowski, partner and chief technology officer at DSPolitical, a digital ad firm that serves Democrats.\n\nFacebook has grown into a colossus in campaign spending, serving up a rich bounty of intimate data that is used to target potential voters from among its online audience of more than 200 million monthly users in the U.S. Campaign spending on Facebook and other digital media will rise to an estimated $600 million this year, compared with about $250 million in 2014, the last congressional election year without a presidential contest. That's roughly one-fifth of the money expected to be spent on campaigns this year and Facebook is poised to get three-fifths of that.\n\nYet Facebook's role in American elections is under intense scrutiny amid revelations that the data of millions of users was obtained by a political consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump. The firm, Cambridge Analytica, had siphoned data from some 50 million Facebook users as it built an election-consulting company that boasted it could sway voters in contests all over the world.\n\nMore: Zuckerberg Summoned by Congress as Lawmakers Fume Over Data Leak\n\nAnd questions remain about how Russia used the platform to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. An indictment by Special Counsel Robert Mueller described a multiyear effort by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian outfit, and others to shape American opinions, including by impersonating Americans on Facebook, Instagram, Google's YouTube and Twitter Inc. About 150 million users saw posts from a St. Petersburg-based troll farm whose main purpose was to push Kremlin propaganda, and 11 million users saw ads it purchased.\n\nMembers of Congress want Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to testify about the scandals, even after he broke days of public silence to outline steps to prevent a recurrence and to suggest that more regulation may be appropriate.\n\nMore disclosure about ad sponsors is \"a first step,\" said Larry Noble, general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based policy group dedicated to strengthening democratic processes. \"Let's find out who's paying for these ads.\"\n\nUnderstanding the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Story: QuickTake\n\n\"We may be at the beginning of a close look at the internet, and a public realization that it's not just the kid in the bedroom blogging about something,\" Noble said.\n\nAsked about the potential impact of the scandals on Facebook's campaign revenue, spokesman Andy Stone referred to public statements by company executives pledging to protect user data. Facebook is testing advertising-transparency tools in Canada and will bring them to U.S. users by the summer, Stone said.\n\nThe company generated more than $40 billion in revenue from all sources last year.\n\nJablonowski, the Democratic consultant, said regulations may dim but won't seriously dent, Facebook's appeal as an advertising vehicle for campaigns.\n\n\"There will be additional scrutiny and additional hoops that advertisers will have to jump through that I'm sure will cause some political advertisers not to spend as much,\" he said.\n\nDean Petrone, president of Go Big Media, a Washington-based firm that works with Republican candidates and political action committees, or PACs, on digital media, said he still expects robust digital ad spending by clients.\n\n\"There's no expectation in our industry that we see any candidate, campaigns or PACs slowing down in their online advertising, whether that be through Facebook or any other channel,\" he said. \"Regardless of the stuff that's popping up in the news.\"\n\nDigital media's share of campaign ad spending will exceed half the portion taken by local television stations, the traditional heavyweight of campaign spending, according to ad-tracking firm Borrell Associates. More money's flowing into digital media, and also into cable TV, in part because it can target a defined audience better than TV broadcasts, according to Borrell.\n\nDigital spending is \"real easy and it's real cheap. And you can test it for almost nothing,\" said Kip Cassino, an executive vice president at Borrell, who estimates that Facebook accounts for about three-fifths of digital campaign spending.\n\nIt stands out for ease of use: Trump digital campaign manager Brad Parscale tried out 100,000 different messages in 2016 as he built an operation that raised the candidate's profile -- and millions of dollars in campaign donations.\n\nTrump last month named Parscale to be campaign manager for his 2020 re-election bid. The hiring signals that the campaign is likely to be a digital-first -- or at least digital-heavy affair, that will once again leverage Facebook and other social media to galvanize the president's followers and raise money.\n\nAd buying platforms, including Facebook's and those created by Alphabet Inc.'s Google, allow buyers to send millions of ads with little oversight, said Chris Nolan, whose firm Spot On has been buying online ads for Democratic campaigns since 2008.\n\n\"The only thing you need right now to buy political ads on the internet is a credit card and a web browser,\" Nolan said.\n\nThe Kantar Media/CMAG ad-tracking unit projects growth in campaign spending on local broadcast TV spending this year too, but at a slower pace than digital. The company estimates $2.4 billion will be spent this year on broadcast TV, up from $2.1 billion in 2014.\n\n\"For now, TV is still king,\" said Steven Passwaiter, a vice president at Kantar/CMAG.\n\nBI Primer: Content Security Woes Drag Profit as Instagram Grows\n\nRetirements from House and Senate seats have created competitive races, and three dozen governor's races -- including an expensive one in Illinois pitting wealthy candidates -- will add to the totals.\n\nThe spending shift comes as lawmakers, investigators and regulators scrutinize social media's role. The Federal Election Commission advanced new regulations for online advertising disclosures for the first time since 2006. The rules would require disclaimers identifying the sponsors of online, mobile and other forms of digital advertising, offering alternative rules. A public hearing is scheduled for June.\n\nU.S. senators including Democrats Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Mark Warner, of Virginia, are pressing for more accountability from Facebook and other companies after revelations their platforms were used by shadowy Russian groups that sought to sway the 2016 election.\n\nFacebook, after stressful hearings before Congress last year, has promised what Zuckerberg called a \"major ads transparency effort.\" Among reforms: Facebook will require political advertisers to include a disclosure of their identity that can be accessed when users viewing ads click on a box.\n\nThat response is insufficient, according to Warner. He said that political ads sold online should be subject to the same rules as ads sold on TV, radio and satellite, where sponsors must be identified.\n\n\"Facebook has taken some first steps,\" Warner said. \"But I still believe that legislation will be necessary in order to address the kind of disinformation campaign the Russians executed in 2016.\"",

                "body": "McMaster Ousted Days After His Briefing to Trump on Putin Call\n\nPresident Donald Trump made a snap decision to oust H.R. McMaster as national security adviser, moving as the administration weighs tough actions against Russia and acting far sooner than many White House aides expected.\n\nMcMaster's departure had been the subject of intense speculation in recent days, yet most administration officials thought it wouldn't come for weeks. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said just a week ago that the two men had a great working relationship.\n\nBut Trump changed all that on Thursday evening, abruptly replacing McMaster with John Bolton, a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and proponent of the 2003 Iraq War best known for his hawkish views.\n\nThe move was announced by Trump on Twitter so quickly on Thursday afternoon that many of the president's top aides didn't know it was coming.\n\nEven by the standards of Trump, it was a turbulent day that left staff frustrated and demoralized. Earlier, the president rattled markets by imposing tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports, saw one of his top lawyers in the Russia probe quit in frustration and watched Congress struggle to try to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nThe ride isn't over: Sunday brings a \"60 Minutes\" interview with porn actress Stormy Daniels, who is expected to say she slept with Trump just months after his wife Melania gave birth to their son in 2006.\n\nThe McMaster move also means Trump is heading into talks with North Korea with a new national security team, having also just sacked his top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Trump's tariffs meanwhile risk alienating one of the most important countries to the success of those talks, China -- which retaliated early Friday with $3 billion in levies on imports from the U.S.\n\nMcMaster's exit also comes as Trump faces tough decisions on whether to punish Russia for the attempted assassination of a former spy in the U.K. His security advisers discussed on Wednesday a list of options to present to the president, including fresh sanctions, closing consulates and expelling Russians from the U.S., according to two people familiar with the matter. Trump has been asking aides what allies -- including France and Germany -- are doing in response to the attack, conducted with what the U.K. says was a Soviet Union-designed nerve agent.\n\nEarlier this week, McMaster briefed Trump for a call with Vladimir Putin and didn't warn against offering congratulations on the Russian leader's election win, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nWritten guidance prepared for the president by White House advisers ahead of Tuesday's phone call explicitly cautioned against complimenting Putin. But in a verbal briefing he personally delivered to Trump before the call, McMaster didn't emphasize what not to say about the election, said the people, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump likely didn't read the written guidance before speaking with his Russian counterpart, and he ended up offering good wishes to Putin on his re-election. That congratulatory message -- uttered as the U.S. considers a tougher stance toward Moscow -- prompted sharp criticism from senior Republican lawmakers and intensified tensions among White House aides involved in Russia matters.\n\nMcMaster's omission may not have made much difference. By the time the call was set up at Trump's request, two of the people said, most of the president's advisers widely believed their boss wanted to congratulate Putin and would have ignored any advice to the contrary.\n\nThe administration's stance toward Russian President Vladimir Putin had been the source of friction between McMaster and Trump. Last month, McMaster echoed the sentiments of top U.S. intelligence officials who told Congress that Russians are targeting the 2018 elections with potential cyber attacks and efforts to sow political division.\n\n\"The evidence is now really incontrovertible and available in the public domain, whereas in the past it was difficult to attribute,\" McMaster said on Feb. 17, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted a Russian \"troll farm\" and its operators for an alleged covert social media campaign to influence the election.\n\nMcMaster called the Russian actions as described in the indictment a \"sophisticated form of espionage.\"\n\nTrump rebuked him on Twitter, saying McMaster \"forgot\" to say that the results of the election weren't changed by the Russian meddling -- something the indictment didn't address -- and that the only collusion was between the Russians, Clinton and Democrats.\n\nDuring his 30-minute call with Putin Trump didn't mention such sensitive issues as the U.K. poisoning or ongoing concerns over Russian interference in U.S. elections. He conducted the conversation while alone in the White House residence, though some Trump aides were on the line. There has been some second-guessing in the White House that Trump was left without the proper staffing support at his side for this call.\n\nSenator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, assailed Trump's outreach to the Russian leader.\n\n\"An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\" McCain said in a statement Tuesday. \"And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country's future.\"\n\nLater, the Washington Post reported that written guidance for Trump had advised him not to congratulate Putin.\n\nMcMaster, an Army lieutenant general, had been the focus of recent speculation that he would soon leave as Trump reshaped his foreign policy team. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was said to be in consultations with Pentagon officials about finding a command that would have allowed McMaster to obtain a fourth star. In a statement released by the White House after his departure was announced, McMaster said he would retire from the military this summer.\n\nLater Thursday night, after Trump announced his replacement, McMaster attended a dinner for visiting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Washington and received a standing ovation after former Florida Governor Jeb Bush pointed him out in the crowd from the stage.",

                "body": "After Donald Trump fired the first shots in what may be an extended trade war, Chinese President Xi Jinping made clear he's going to wait before unleashing his country's formidable arsenal in response.\n\nChina's plans for reciprocal tariffs of $3 billion on products from pork to wine represent a tiny fraction of its U.S. imports. Crucially, the Commerce Ministry said those were in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, and said it has a plan to act further on the planned levies on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports that his administration announced Thursday.\n\nXi has a lot at stake in his next move. Fresh off securing the power to rule indefinitely, he must look strong to reassure his 1.4 billion citizens that China won't back down to a global challenge. At the same time, he wants to avoid an escalation that could tank China's debt-laden economy and undermine the Communist Party's legitimacy.\n\nThat means measures that will hurt Trump politically rather than inflict more damage on the global economy. After all, while Xi could stay in office for life if he wants, there's a chance Trump might not even finish his four-year term.\n\n\"They will want to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze until it gets so loud that the administration is willing to do a deal that doesn't hurt China too much,\" said James McGregor, China chairman of the consultancy APCO Worldwide, which advises foreign companies. \"They will strategically go after important industries, important companies, important trade groups so that their representatives in Washington raise hell.\"\n\nTrade War, Day One. Economic Casualties: Still Zero\n\nFor Xi, a key question is whether Trump is simply looking for applause lines at campaign rallies or if the moves represent a fundamental shift in the U.S.-China ties. Sectors subject to Trump's tariffs include aerospace, information and communication technology and machinery: all areas that Xi's government has identified as key to China's development strategy.\n\nChinese officials have repeatedly said they want to resolve disputes through dialogue, even though they're ready to fight a trade war. Xi has a daunting list of domestic structural economic problems to tackle, ranging from slowing growth to property bubbles to high leverage in state-owned enterprises.\n\nFurther complicating matters for Xi are shifts in Trump's team, including the ouster of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and H.R. McMaster as national security adviser. His replacement, John Bolton, has called for revisiting U.S. policy toward Taiwan -- a red line for Beijing.\n\nBolton's World View: Bomb Iran, OK to Strike North Korea First\n\n\"A lot depends on how the Chinese are reading this,\" said Dennis Wilder, former senior director for Asia at the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration. Xi may send stronger signals to Washington if he assesses that U.S. is taking a harder line on China, Wilder said, adding that scenario is \"domestically more dangerous\" for him.\n\nXi has a plethora of tools to deploy. China can tie up imports in red tape at the border, slap export taxes on goods heading to the U.S. and put tariffs on crops like sorghum and soybeans grown in some politically important farming states. China can also make like difficult for U.S. companies, including blocking the likes of Boeing Co. and Cisco Systems Inc. from accessing a procurement market it says is worth 3.1 trillion yuan ($490 billion).\n\nEven without those harder measures, stocks took a beating on Friday. Equity indexes from Tokyo to Shanghai tumbled more than 3 percent after the S&P 500 Index fell 2.5 percent, the most in six weeks. Boeing dropped more than 5 percent, while Cisco Systems dropped 2.8 percent.\n\nGadfly: Has Beijing Brought a Knife to a Trade War Gunfight?\n\nSo far, China has signaled it can take more pain than Trump. Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador in the U.S., said Thursday: \"If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer.\"\n\nEven so, some analysts think China will wave the white flag. Recent statements from Premier Li Keqiang and Liu He, Xi's top economic aide, indicate that China is ready to open up the services sector, address U.S. concerns on technology transfer and do more to protect intellectual property, according to Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.\n\n\"China's policy makers have made it clear that they are not ready for a full-blown trade war,\" he wrote Friday. \"Therefore, the most likely outcome is that China will concede.\"\n\nXi's big advantage for the moment is complete control over the government and state-owned companies that dominate China's economy. Moreover, many American companies will also be looking to fight the Trump administration because they see the Chinese market as more important than the U.S., said APCO's McGregor.\n\nU.S. companies \"are beholden to shareholders, not to the United States,\" he said. \"Globalization has untethered multinationals from having to look after the United States, and China knows that.\"",

                "body": "The plot to stop Brexit is gaining strength, and the European Union is helping.\n\nTim Ross and Kitty Donaldson report today how the campaign for a second referendum is finally getting organized. And it's getting good access to EU officials, giving campaigners useful intelligence on the Brexit process.\n\nChuka Umunna, a slick 39-year-old Labour member of Parliament, is leading the effort to bring together a ragtag of anti-Brexit groups. Well-known politicians, activists and professional campaigners gather each week at a secret location in London where they try to figure out how to engineer a referendum that would give Britons a chance to rethink.\n\nWhile EU officials know they must tread lightly to avoid appearing to meddle in British affairs, they are meeting with the campaigners and providing helpful insights into the process. On March 6, a day before the EU published its draft plan for how it would approach the next phase of Brexit talks, Umunna already knew some details of what the document would say. The text would make clear that if the U.K. changes its mind on its negotiating red lines, the EU would change its position, too.\n\nThat's become known as the \"evolution clause\" and is seen as an attempt to nudge the U.K. toward changing its stance and opting for a closer post-Brexit relationship than the one Prime Minister Theresa May is heading for.\n\nSince the start of the year, European leaders have lined up to tell Britain that it is free to change its mind. And while the EU continues to take a hard line in negotiations, Umunna says that officials have made clear privately that they would agree to pause the Brexit process to allow time for a new referendum, or, perhaps another election, if necessary. \"If a crisis is precipitated and there were a general election, or a new national poll, we would be granted the time to do that,\" he says.\n\nLeaders Meet | Theresa May went to Brussels for the leaders' summit and urged them to work with her to create a \"new dynamic in talks, to work together to explore workable solutions.\" She hailed the transition deal, after leaders dined on pan-fried scallops with artichokes and seaweed coulis, rack of lamb and iced lemon parfait. Brexit was overshadowed by other news, mainly U.S. tariffs and Russia - follow our unfolding coverage of that story - but is due to be back on the agenda on Friday when EU leaders will sign off on the negotiating guidelines and the transition deal.\n\nDe La Rue's Blues | Shares of British passport maker De La Rue Plc got whacked after the company confirmed it had lost the contract to make the new blue passports that have become a symbol of post-Brexit Britain. Worth remembering is that the U.K. didn't have to leave the EU to get its beloved blue passports back.\n\nOctober Deadline | Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he'd prefer to wait until October to get a good deal on the Irish border than get \"any deal\" in June. October is the deadline the European Commission is working towards to get the overall withdrawal treaty agreed.\n\nDaiwa's Man in Frankfurt | Daiwa Securities Group will name Manabu Takahashi to lead the securities firm's business in the EU after Brexit, Takahiko Hyuga reports. Japan's second-largest brokerage selected Takahashi - who currently heads its Geneva branch - as the chief executive for its new Frankfurt operation, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nPoland Pleased | Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland is satisfied with the outcome of Brexit talks so far. \"We've met our goals,\" he said in Brussels. A traditional U.K. ally, Poland's priority was securing the rights of Poles in Britain and it's not too worried about trade. It's also quite keen to pick up any financial services business that might have to leave London as a result of the split.\n\nOn the Markets | The Bank of England held rates but signaled that investors have it right when it comes to the likelihood of an interest-rate hike in May. The pound strengthened 0.03 percent to $1.4124 early on Friday.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats had an unfortunate start to the EU summit. They issued a triumphant press release saying leader Vince Cable had secured a joint statement from eight liberal EU prime ministers backing his bid for a second referendum. Within hours the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe denied they had done any such thing.\n\nThey supported Cable and his party, but no statement was issued, and in any case they were there as party leaders and not as prime ministers.\n\nBut to be fair, at least one of those present, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, was pretty supportive: \"If some way or another the U.K. would decide to change its position it will be highly welcome I think by every one of the liberal prime ministers and my impression is of almost everybody in the European Union.\"",

                "title": "Wynn's Pain Is Rivals' Gain With Macau Facing a Shakeup",
                "body": "Could there be a future where the only American big gun in Macau is Sheldon Adelson?\n\nThat might not be so far-fetched. Steve Wynn, battling allegations of sexual misconduct, has sold his remaining 8 million shares in Wynn Resorts Ltd., eliminating one of the last ties to the casino company he founded. Wynn Resorts then issued 5.3 million new shares to Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd., giving it an estimated 5 percent stake.\n\nGalaxy, helmed by Hong Kong tycoon Lui Che-woo, is one of six casino licence holders in Macau. Two are held by Wynn Resorts 1 and Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corp. 2 , while the remaining three are all with members of the Ho family. There's SJM Holdings Ltd., owned by ailing octogenarian Stanley Ho; MGM China Holdings Ltd., run by his daughter Pansy; and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd., managed by son Lawrence.\n\nThe licenses were bitterly contested when Stanley Ho lost his monopoly of more than 40 years in 2002 -- Macau, a special administrative region like Hong Kong, is the only place in China where casinos are legal. President Xi Jinping's 2014 crackdown on excessive spending scared off high rollers, but Macau is booming again, with casino revenue growth surging the most in four years in January.\n\nGalaxy getting a chunk of Wynn Resorts could spell the start of consolidation in the former Portuguese enclave. My colleague David Fickling has suggested Malaysia's Genting Bhd. may even want a look in.\n\nBoth Galaxy and Wynn Resorts, which gets about 75 percent of its revenue from Macau, cater to high-end players, so it's possible Lui may push for a bigger stake.\n\nWynn Resorts could also do with the cash. According to Daiwa Securities Group Inc., it faces significant capital requirements resulting from legal settlement costs and expansion plans in Boston and Las Vegas. \"To us, this provides a strong indicator Wynn Macau will likely raise its dividend,\" analysts led by Jamie Soo wrote in a note Thursday. Wynn Macau is a giant ATM, generating around $700 million of cash last year.\n\nIn addition, having lost its key man, Wynn Resorts is trading at a discount, and that could put it in play.\n\nSome streamlining may be a good thing. Macau's six licences are set to expire between 2020 and 2022, so it's an opportune time for any operator to consolidate its position. There may be more permits doled out in future, and some could potentially go to mainland Chinese firms so far left out of the party.\n\nDevelopers including China Evergrande Group and China Vanke Co., for example, are cash rich and keen to invest in tourism.\n\nWynn Resorts, unlikely to want to relinquish control, could net as much as $6 billion if it were to sell a 22 percent stake in Wynn Macau to Chinese investors, based on a 20 times forward EV-to-Ebitda multiple, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Margaret Huang and Kristy Hung. Selling to a Chinese investor would also position Wynn more favorably with regulators in Beijing when its Macau casino license comes up for renewal.\n\nWhichever way the chips fall, one thing is certain. Wynn's pain will be rivals' gain.",

                "title": "It Pays to Be Loved by Tesla. Ask Elon Musk.",
                "body": "What does Elon Musk's utility function look like? Yesterday Tesla Inc. shareholders approved a comically large pay package designed to keep Musk employed as Tesla's chief executive officer. When we last talked about this pay package I mentioned how superfluous it seems to be. If Musk hits all of his revenue and earnings targets over the next 10 years, and grows Tesla to be worth $650 billion, then he could make more than $50 billion from his new package. But if Musk grows Tesla to be worth $650 billion over the next 10 years -- whether or not he hits those revenue and earnings targets -- then he will make more than $130 billion just from the Tesla shares he already owns. The extra $50 billion on top of the $130 billion would be nice, I guess, but ... how? Like what will he do with it? Buy more flamethrowers?\n\nYou can sort of see Tesla's reason for giving him the extra $50 billion: He doesn't need to be CEO to keep his existing shares, which are worth billions of dollars, but he does need to stick around in management to get the extra $50 billion. It's designed to keep him at his job, \"a sum so large it might just ensure that Musk's array of other passions and esoteric side projects won't steal too much time from his work at Tesla.\" But what's in it for Musk? He is fabulously wealthy now. If he stayed at Tesla without this pay package and made Tesla worth $650 billion, he would be ridiculously, world-historically wealthy. If he stays at Tesla with this pay package and makes Tesla worth $650 billion, then, you know, same. He has tethered himself to Tesla in exchange for amounts of money that, while comically large to me or you or the average billionaire, are still quite small compared to his existing fortune in most relevant states of the world. I sort of don't understand why Tesla is paying him in money, or rather shares, both of which are things he has a lot of. They should promise to, like, send him to Mars (and bring him back), or make him immortal, or something. I guess that is hard to commit to.\n\nReally what Tesla is doing here is not motivating Musk with money, but expressing -- awkwardly but earnestly -- its love for him. That is hard to do in thoughtful ways. What do you get a man who has everything? How do you buy a thoughtful gift for a billionaire aficionado of rocket ships and sports cars and flamethrowers? At some point, the only way to express your love for him is with more money, even if that's the last thing he needs.",

Venugopal told the Supreme Court the unique digital identity program, called Aadhaar, \"an enabler\" to ensure food and other subsidies reach the poor and prevent rampant siphoning of welfare funds.\n\n\"Right to life is not merely a right to animal existence,\" Venugopal said in the Supreme Court on Thursday. \"It is a right to live with dignity, food and livelihood. If you have no food and shelter, where is the question of privacy of these people?\"\n\nThe Aadhaar program, which has assigned a unique 12-digit number after collecting iris, fingerprint and face scans of over one billion Indians, is key to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Digital India' push. It will become the single identifier for all schemes and services ranging from free food and subsidies to opening bank accounts and using mobile phones.\n\nThe court will be decide whether pushing the system's adoption into uses spanning buying a phone, getting utilities connected or conducting financial transactions online violates a citizen's privacy. The government claims Aadhaar is saving billions of dollars by better targeting beneficiaries of subsidized food and cash transfers but critics point to privacy concerns, unfair exclusions and data leaks.\n\nLawyer Shyam Divan, representing one of the petitioners, said that once the 12-digit number is linked to various services, the scheme offers the government a web of information about each individual and lays a framework for real time surveillance.\n\nA ruling last August holding privacy a fundamental right was a shot in the arm for activists. The government maintains that the laws on Aadhaar data collection and use ensure that there is minimum \"invasion of privacy.\"\n\nIn defending the security of the database, the attorney general focused on its physical, rather than digital safety.\n\n\"Our data center has walls that are 13 feet high and 5 feet thickness. We have various safety precautions,\" Venugopal told the court.\n\nThe five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra also asked Venugopal to address the concerns of denying welfare funds in case of issues with the bio-metric database financial exclusions.\n\n\"If finger prints of a pensioner of 85 or 90-year-old is not working, where will he go?\" asked Justice D.Y. Chandrachud.\n\nThe government argues the scheme has provision for exceptions for special classes of people. The hearing will continue in the coming weeks.",

Gold's up 1.8 percent this week, heading for the biggest gain since the period to Feb. 16. It surged 1.6 percent on Wednesday after the Fed signaled the pace of tightening won't accelerate this year.\n\nInvestor interest in bullion is regaining momentum as the trade fight stokes concerns global growth will slow, hurting risk assets including equities and industrial commodities such as steel. On Friday, a few hours after President Donald Trump instructed Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to impose levies on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports, the Asian country's Commerce Ministry announced plans for reciprocal tariffs.\n\n\"It's been a good week for precious metal bulls, with multiple factors supporting the yellow metal,\" said Jordan Eliseo, chief economist at Australian Bullion Co. \"As it often does, gold rallied after the Fed pushed through with their anticipated rate hike, whilst the troubling rhetoric around tariffs, and the sharp sell off in risk assets, is also providing some safe-haven demand.\"\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.6 percent this week, while equity markets in the U.S. and Asia tumbled after the tariffs were announced. While there'd been concern among some investors the Fed may favor four hikes in 2018, the bank's guidance signaled policy makers are still sticking at three.\n\nThere are other signs that gold is being favored again. Holdings in exchange-traded funds backed by bullion have expanded to the highest level since 2013, while traders and analysts in a Bloomberg survey are the most bullish on the metal's outlook in almost two months.",

                "title": "Powell Disses Dots Again as He Stresses Limit of Fed's Knowledge",
                "body": "Bill Gross discusses President Donald Trump's tariffs, the recent stock market selloff, and Fed's policy.\n\nJerome Powell dissed the dots when he was a Federal Reserve governor. Now he's doing the same as central bank chairman.\n\nIn his first press conference since taking over as Fed chief, Powell advised investors against reading a lot into the central bank's dot-plot projection for interest rates in 2020, saying policy makers \"don't have the ability to see that far into the future.\"\n\nHe also minimized the significance of the economic forecasts that form the backdrop for the Fed's rate expectations, noting on Wednesday that they were predictions of individual policy makers and not sanctioned by the Federal Open Market Committee. Powell contrasted that with the \"one decision\" the central bank made at the meeting, to raise the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point.\n\n\"He definitely downplayed the dots,\" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist for JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, referring to the constellation of rate forecasts that the central bank portrays as dots on a graph. The Fed began publishing them under then-Chairman Ben Bernanke in January 2012, a few months before Powell joined the Board of Governors.\n\nDespite Powell's comments, investors remain \"fixated\" on the dot plot and what it might mean for policy, Feroli said. While the Fed stuck -- barely -- with its median projection of three interest-rate increases this year, it also forecast a steeper path of hikes in 2019 and 2020, based on officials' median projections.\n\nHow the Fed communicates its intentions is critical for the conduct of monetary policy. If the central bank surprises financial markets, investors may respond in ways that hurt the economy. Case in point: the 2013 taper tantrum, when long-term bond yields shot up after Bernanke unexpectedly suggested scaling back the Fed's bond purchases.\n\nPowell has long stressed the uncertainty surrounding the Fed's assessments of the economy and the forces affecting it -- a point he made repeatedly in his kick-off press conference.\n\nIn an appearance at a monetary forum in New York in February 2016, Powell pointed to \"shortcomings\" in the dot plot, though he acknowledged it was helpful to investors.\n\nBecause the rate projections are anonymous and aren't tied to individual economic forecasts, \"there is no easy path to the identification of a committee reaction function\" -- how policy makers will respond to movements in the economy, he said.\n\nThe quarterly chart also doesn't distinguish between voting and non-voting members of the FOMC and at times can look outdated due to changes in the economic outlook in the interim, he added.\n\nParadoxically, Powell's latest attempt to soft-pedal the Fed's projections comes just as they're coming more in line with those of some Wall Street economists. In their latest forecasting round, policy makers raised their outlook for economic growth and inflation while lowering their prediction for unemployment.\n\n\"The committee's views are evolving in line with the data and financial conditions,\" Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists Jan Hatzius and Spencer Hill said in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\nPowell is not the first Fed chief to complain of the market's focus on the dot plot. In her first press conference as Fed chair in 2014, Janet Yellen cautioned against looking to the projections for guidance on Fed policy.\n\nShe later though embraced them as her fellow policy makers came around to her view that continued low interest rates were needed to nurture the economic recovery.\n\nOne big way that Powell could improve Fed communications would be to work on coming up with a consensus FOMC forecast for the economy and policy, along with indications of how the committee would react if its economic expectations turned out to be wrong.\n\nThe Fed tried that back in 2012 but failed. The U.S. central bank has \"a very large committee and attempting to craft a consensus view of the outlook including a path of policy proved to be extremely challenging,\" Powell's predecessor Yellen told an economic conference in Frankfurt last year.\n\nThe process was further complicated because it was conducted against the backdrop of Fed asset purchases, so officials had to come together on both the rate path and the outlook for bond buying, she said.\n\nSince then, the FOMC has agreed on a plan to gradually unwind its asset purchases, in one of Yellen's last decisions as central bank chair.\n\nThe FOMC actually did make a forecast of sorts in the statement it issued just before Powell's press conference.\n\n\"The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,\" the committee said.\n\nIt was a phrase that seasoned Fed watchers don't recall the FOMC using before in a communique and one that Feroli said carried hawkish implications for policy. Yet it was \"highly overlooked\" by investors obsessed with the dots.",

                "title": "Senate Averts Shutdown by Passing $1.3 Trillion Spending Bill",
                "body": "Trump plans to sign domestic and military spending increase\n\nThe Senate narrowly averted a government shutdown by passing a $1.3 trillion spending bill early Friday that increases military and domestic spending and strengthens background checks for gun buyers.\n\nThe 65-32 vote came after Republican conservatives objected to the higher spending and Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky held open the possibility that he'd delay the vote past a Friday midnight deadline that would have triggered a cloture.\n\nThe House approved the bill Thursday, and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters that President Donald Trump would sign the measure, saying it funds his priorities.\n\nThe final vote capped a week of all-night bargaining sessions and repeated delays before the measure was introduced Wednesday night. The bill, funding the government through September, attracted bipartisan support while conservatives complained about growing budget deficits and a lack of time to review the 2,232-page measure. Republicans praised an $80 billion increase in military spending while Democrats highlighted an additional $63 billion in domestic spending.\n\nSenator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican who opposed the bill and flirted with the prospect of forcing a government shutdown by delaying a vote, said the price tag was too high.\n\n\"It sucks,\" Kennedy said of the spending measure. \"No thought whatsoever to adding over a trillion dollars in debt.\"\n\nPaul did not follow through on his suggestion that he might delay the proceedings, relenting late Thursday night. \"I'm still strongly opposed, but if you don't have the votes at some point you do have to acknowledge defeat,\" he said.\n\nThere was, however, a brief drama that threatened to keep the chamber from voting when Senator James Risch, an Idaho Republican, objected that one of the provisions in the massive piece of legislation renamed a wilderness preserve in his state for Cecil Andrus, a Democratic governor of Idaho and secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter. Andrus, who died last year, and Risch were political rivals.\n\nThe measure, H.R. 1625, includes $1.6 billion for border security, including money for fencing and levees, though that's only a fraction of the $25 billion that Trump wanted to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe bill has a provision creating incentives to bolster reporting by federal agencies to the database for gun-buyer background checks, as well as $21 billion for infrastructure projects and an additional $4 billion to combat opioid addiction.\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles to reaching the agreement was the status of funding for a Hudson River tunnel between New York and New Jersey. Advocates, mainly Democrats and Republicans representing the two states, argued it is one of the most important infrastructure projects in the U.S. But Trump has insisted on removing money for the project, known as Gateway, from the spending plan.\n\nThe spending agreement omits language steering money to the Gateway project, although the project could get about half the funds supporters are seeking -- $540 million -- through other accounts, according to Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat. Additional funding would be available to the project through Amtrak and grants that don't require approval from the Department of Transportation, Schumer and other Gateway advocates said.\n\nThe legislation includes several provisions in response to recent mass shootings. In addition to incentives for reporting to a database for gun-buyer background checks, it permits the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research the causes of gun violence, after more than 20 years of restrictions that prevented the agency from doing so.\n\nAlso included is $75 million this year to train teachers and school officials to respond to attacks, pay for metal detectors and other equipment, and create anonymous systems for reporting possible threats to schools. Between 2019 and 2028, $100 million a year would be provided.\n\nThe bill would contain funding to combat Russian interference in this year's elections, and it would provide more than $600 million to build a new rural broadband network.\n\nAlso included is a modification to the new tax-cut law passed last December that was sought by some agricultural groups. The current law contains a provision that promoted sales to farm co-ops at the expense of grain companies. In exchange, Democrats won a provision bolstering low-income housing tax credits.\n\nWith members of Congress focused on campaigning for November elections, the spending bill is likely to be the last major piece of legislation until then.",

                "body": "Karnataka election to turn on the vote of 8 million farmers For Congress it's matter of survival, while BJP eyes 2019 poll\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is pulling out all stops in his campaign to win the southern Indian state of Karnataka as he works to halt the opposition's momentum and smooth his way to re-election in 2019.\n\nHis Bharatiya Janata Party has deployed influential political leaders, boosted its social media campaign and held extra public gatherings to deepen its footprint in the south and wrest one of the last big states from the Congress Party, which would all but wipe the 132-year-old political organization from India's electoral map.\n\nFollowing a tough fight in his home state of Gujarat, defeats in three key by-elections last week and the desertion of an ally from his ruling coalition, Modi's standing in the electorate appears weakened. Adding to his woes, Modi's other allies are restive, while opposition parties have ramped up their campaign against the government, pushing for a no-confidence motion against the coalition.\n\nThe BJP was \"on the back foot\", analysts led by Sonal Varma at Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a note on Wednesday. These \"political vulnerabilites\" led Nomura to assign a 25 percent probability of an early federal election -- possibly in the last quarter of 2018.\n\nThe developments in the lead up to the May election in Karnataka highlight \"emerging cracks\" in BJP's popularity and an improvement in the opposition strategy, said Shailesh Kumar, Asia director at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. \"The road to 2019 will now change, with Modi going further on Hindu nationalism.\"\n\nTo maintain his aura of invincibility, Modi needs a win in Karnataka, a state that's swung from party to party since 1985.\n\n\"This will be BJP's biggest-ever campaign in the state,\" said S. Prakash, a spokesman, adding his party is exploring all strategies, including targeting voters at the booth level to snatch power from Congress party in Karnataka. \"We messed up in the past but things have changed -- we want to keep the winning streak unabated.\"\n\nAs many as 700,000 BJP volunteers have been deployed to 56,000 polling booths to woo voters, adding 7.5 million people to its membership base. Star campaigners from other states -- including Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath -- have been called in to boost the campaign, said Prakash. The party has pledged to spend one trillion rupees ($15 billion) on irrigation in five years, improve law and order, boost infrastructure and provide a corruption-free administration if it comes to power, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, it's targeting the Congress-led government over corruption and the breakdown of law and order and highlighting Modi's efforts to increase support prices for crops and his promise of doubling farmer's income by 2022.\n\nAlthough Karnataka is India's IT hub, the outcome of the election mostly lies with Karnataka's 8 million farmers.\n\nWhile there is still significant support for BJP in small town and cities, rural discontent may prevent it from gaining a majority in 224-member assembly. The Congress party under Chief Minister K. Siddharamaiah will also fall short of majority. Two opinion polls predict a hung assembly, leaving Janata Dal (Secular), led by former prime minister H. D. Deve Gowda, as kingmaker.\n\nThe regional Janata Dal (Secular) could go with either party, although it is more comfortable with BJP, said Narendar Pani, a professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru. \"JD (S) speaks the language of people and has a connection on the ground.\"\n\nFarmers' fury with the BJP is not good omen for the Hindu nationalist party. Addressing a rally in February, Modi said farmers are his 'top' priority and explained that 'TOP' means \"Tomato, Onion and Potato.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether his message is cutting through.\n\n\"The BJP government is for rich people, not for us. They don't understand our problems,\" said Anil Kumar, 38, a farmer in Kempalingana Pura, describing how he lost 100,000 rupees last year when he didn't get a decent price for his tomato crop. \"When we face any problem, JD(S) people come to us and help us,\" he said, indicating his vote will go to the regional party.\n\n\"Congress has an edge clearly,\" said Harish Ramaswamy, political analyst and professor of political science at Karnataka University. \"For Congress it's a question of survival and for BJP it's making inroads into southern states and would be a moral boost for 2019 elections.\"\n\nThe party, headed at the federal level by Rahul Gandhi, is working hard to hold Karnataka -- its last slice of power, along with the northern state of Punjab -- and generate momentum for four other assembly polls later this year.\n\nIt's promoting its local achievements, including a free rice program, free milk and eggs in schools, free bus passes for students, direct fund transfers to farmers who grow rain-fed crops and waivers of loans from co-operative banks.\n\n\"Our budget for campaign is several time larger than what it was last time,\" said Brijesh Kalappa, a spokesman for Congress. \"A victory in the state means Congress has become rejuvenated, become stronger,\" to face the 2019 elections.\n\nStill, Modi remains the BJP's trump card, especially among young voters. \"We have faith on Modi,\" said Muniraju M. R., 28, a driver in Maskal. \"BJP will come to power with a full majority and the whole state will prosper.\"",

You can always tinker around the edges, and the question is whether putting lipstick on a pig is really going to make a difference here. I think the answer to that's clearly no.\" -- March 20 on Fox News.\n\n\"The inconvenient truth is that only military action like Israel's 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein's Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor, designed and built by North Korea, can accomplish what is required. Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.\" -- March 2015 in a New York Times op-ed titled \"To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran.\"\n\n\"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current 'necessity' posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first.\" -- Feb. 28 in a Wall Street Journal commentary titled \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First\". He added: \"Given the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute.\"\n\n\"How do you know the North Koreans are lying?

We're just supposed to sit there, is that the answer? I don't buy it. I am a free trader but I don't think that means just getting pounded into the ground when another country does not abide by the commitments it made.\" -- March 22 on Fox News.\n\n\"It is high time to revisit the 'one-China policy' and decide what America thinks it means, 45 years after the Shanghai Communique. Mr. Trump has said the policy is negotiable. Negotiation should not mean Washington gives and Beijing takes.\" -- January 2017 in the Wall Street Journal, where he also advocated for closer military ties with Taiwan.\n\n\"The recent Russian presidential election was a chance for #Putin to practice election meddling on his own elections so he can do it better elsewhere. We need a long term strategy to deal with countries like #Russia and #China with long standing rulers.\" -- March 21 on Twitter.\n\n\"It's an act of defiance. It's saying to London and the other western capitals, 'what are you gonna do about it?' Well, I think there should be a very strong answer to that.\" -- March 15 on Fox News, regarding the poisoning (allegedly by Moscow) in the U.K. of a former Russian spy.\n\n\"Rather than striving to recreate the post-World War I map, Washington should recognize the new geopolitics. The best alternative to the Islamic State in northeastern Syria and western Iraq is a new, independent Sunni state.\" -- November 2015 in a New York Times op-ed, with Bolton referring to such a state as \"Sunni-stan.\"\n\n\"The U.S. ought to abandon or substantially reduce its military support for Iraq's current government. Despite retaining a tripartite veneer of Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Shiite Arabs, the capital is dominated by Shiites loyal to Iran.\" -- June 2017 in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlso in the Wall Street Journal, on Syria: \"The Trump administration must take a clear-eyed view of Russia's intervention. The Syrian mixing bowl is where confrontation between American and Russian forces looms,\" he said. \"Russia's interference, particularly its axis with Mr. Assad and Tehran's mullahs, critically threatens the interests of the U.S., Israel and our Arab friends.\"\n\n\"Putting too much pressure on Pakistan risks further destabilizing the already volatile country, tipping it into the hands of domestic radical Islamicists, who grow stronger by the day.\" -- August 2017 in the Wall Street Journal, referring to U.S. accusations that Pakistan provides a safe haven for the Afghan Taliban and other groups.\n\nBolton added the U.S. should address the question of China in its South Asia policy, holding Beijing \"accountable for the misdeeds that helped create the current strategic dangers.\"",

                "title": "China's Saving Its Own Bacon in Trump Trade War",
                "body": "Has Beijing brought a knife to a trade war gunfight?\n\nThat's certainly the way it looks at first glance. Plans to slap levies on $3 billion of U.S. goods affect about 2 percent of China's imports from the country, compared to the roughly 10 percent of trade in the opposite direction that will be penalized under the U.S.'s plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion of goods from China.\n\nThe restrictions will barely be noticed in China itself. There'll be a 25 percent levy on pork imports from the U.S., but that trade represented just 165,736 metric tons last year -- about 13 percent of China's offshore pork intake, and 0.3 percent of consumption that runs to about 55 million tons a year.\n\nA 15 percent tariff will be levied on fruit, nuts, wine and ethanol, which together amount to another $1 billion or so a year, while the same rates will be levied on, respectively, aluminum scrap and steel pipe.\n\nIn dollar terms, the restrictions on recycled aluminum will probably be the most significant -- but considering that China has been trying to eliminate most imports of non-ferrous scrap anyway, they'll largely be accelerating an ongoing process rather than reversing any trend.\n\nBigger categories of imports such as soybeans ($13.8 billion), cars and auto parts ($13.6 billion), aircraft ($12.6 billion) and integrated circuits ($8.7 billion), have largely been spared.\n\nIf you take that as a sign of weakness, think again. As Gadfly and others have argued, the likeliest outcome of a trade war is that participants blow themselves up rather than inflict damage on the enemy. By imposing a few largely cosmetic penalties that hit hardest on industries -- agriculture and primary metals -- that have supported President Donald Trump's trade policies, Beijing is firing a warning shot but not truly going on the offensive.\n\nStructurally, China is in the stronger position, with exports to the U.S. (mobile phones, clothing, computers, toys) that are much more dominant as a share of American imports and hit directly at the hip pockets of consumers.\n\nKeeping its powder dry while posing as the real free trader in the dispute will put Beijing in a strong position for the diplomatic battle that lies ahead. That's what should really worry Washington.",

                "body": "Rival casino operator gains strong position in event of sale\n\nSteve Wynn sold his remaining 8 million shares in Wynn Resorts Ltd., swiftly eliminating one of his last ties to the casino company he founded.\n\nSeparately, in a surprise step, Wynn Resorts sold 5.3 million newly issued shares of common stock to Galaxy Entertainment Group. Ltd., giving the competing Macau casino operator an estimated 5 percent stake in the company, according to a statement Thursday.\n\nThe twin moves hint at the future of Wynn Resorts, post-Steve Wynn, who stepped down in February following allegations of sexual misconduct. The Las Vegas-based company is under investigation by casino regulators in Nevada, Macau and Massachusetts, all of whom have the power to revoke the company's casino license or order Steve Wynn to divest his shares. The sales eliminate the latter option.\n\nThe sale of new shares to Galaxy, one of only six casino license-holders in Macau, positions that company as a potential suitor if Wynn Resorts were up for sale.\n\n\"This is a unique opportunity to acquire an investment in a globally recognized entertainment corporation with exceptionally high quality assets and a significant development pipeline,\" Galaxy Entertainment Group Vice Chairman Francis Lui said in a statement.\n\nThe new shares were sold at $175 each, Wynn Resorts said, for a total of about $927.5 million. The company plans to use the proceeds to repay an $800 million loan it took out to settle a longstanding feud with Universal Entertainment, one of its original investors.\n\nSteve Wynn sold his remaining shares to two institutional investors who already hold Wynn Resorts stock, a spokesman said. His shares also went for $175 each, or $1.4 billion. The transaction followed the earlier sale of 4.1 million shares, also announced Thursday.\n\nSince stepping down, Steve Wynn settled a six-year fight with his ex-wife Elaine Wynn, giving her the right to vote and sell her roughly 9 percent stake in the company.\n\nThe company also settled its fight with Universal, agreeing to consult with that company's casino in the Philippines. Under new CEO Matt Maddox, several long-serving members of Wynn Resorts' board have left the company.",

                "body": "Well, if he's serious, here's another potential trade target: uranium. In January, the administration imposed tariffs on solar equipment being shipped into the U.S. A little over a month later, Trump announced taxes on steel and aluminum imports. U.S. uranium companies are fighting for similar relief as America's nuclear power generators increasingly turn to supplies overseas to fuel their plants.\n\nThe uranium suppliers are invoking the same section of the Trade Expansion Act that the Trump administration used to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. If they're successful, America's nuclear power generators could face higher costs for uranium imports that account for almost 90 percent of their total supplies.\n\n\"The uranium issue is certainly something that would appeal to the Trump administration,\" said Bryan Riley, director of the National Taxpayers Union's Free Trade Initiative in Washington. \"Their willingness to impose restrictions on steel and aluminum based on national security allegations that were thin at best would lead me to think they are looking for other industries making similar claims.\"\n\nA trade group for the U.S. nuclear industry fired back on Thursday, warning that utilities are already struggling to deal with \"depressed\" power markets, competition from cheap natural gas and the onslaught of renewable energy. \"The potential remedies of the petition may put even more units at risk for premature closure,\" the Nuclear Energy Institute said by email.\n\nMeanwhile, a potential trade war with China already poses a threat to uranium supplies, said Dan McGroarty, founder of rare-earth minerals consultancy Carmot Strategic Group. \"We're new to the trade war business -- maybe it will happen -- but I'm kind of worried about that if it would hit uranium.\"\n\nTo be sure, Trump may decide to steer clear of the uranium debate. The uranium sector doesn't employ a ton of people, and Wyoming -- where much of fuel is domestically produced -- already supports Trump, said Kevin Book, managing director at the research and analysis firm Clearview Energy Partners LLC in Washington.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Thursday that its Bureau of Industry and Security is still reviewing the petition from uranium producers. The White House has meanwhile already proposed increasing the department's budget, in part to support the enforcement of \"fair and secure trade.\"",

They have said one issue is whether bias against Donald Trump played a role.\n\nSome of the documents being sought in Goodlatte's subpoena have already been turned over, but not all. He also wants more information on possible law enforcement abuses of federal surveillance warrants.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said last Friday night that he had made the decision to fire McCabe -- less than two days before the deputy director was to retire -- based on a recommendation from the bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility.\n\nThe office said that McCabe had not been forthcoming about authorizing discussions with a reporter regarding a pending investigation.\n\nGoodlatte, in his letter to the Justice Department on Thursday, said the office's recommendation to dismiss McCabe \"appears to be based, at least in part,\" on events related to the investigation surrounding Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\n\nNadler, in response, said the department had been \"transmitting new documents to the committee every two weeks since late last year.\"\n\n\"It seems that this subpoena is intended to speed up that production to pivot the discussion back to Hillary Clinton and divert attention from the chaos surrounding the Trump administration and allegations involving the Trump campaign,\" said Nadler, in a statement.\n\nTrump, who had been attacking McCabe for months on Twitter, applauded his firing. In his own statement, McCabe attributed his dismissal to an effort by the administration to discredit him, in part because of events he witnessed and the role he played after Trump's firing of James Comey as FBI director.\n\n\"This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally,\" McCabe said in the statement.",

                "body": "Ruling coalition is seen likely to win the March 24 vote Creation of a Senate is part of 2016 constitution changes\n\nIvory Coast President Alassane Ouattara appears set to tighten his grip on power as the world's biggest cocoa producer votes for a Senate for the first time in its history.\n\nWith the opposition boycotting Saturday's vote for two-thirds of the 99-member chamber and Ouattara appointing the remainder, the ruling coalition Rally of Houphouetists for Democracy and Peace, named after the country's founding father, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, should dominate the new chamber.\n\n\"The Senate is a further way for the executive to assign political posts to the coalition's allies, especially those who haven't had the opportunity to be ministers or mayors,\" Ousmane Zina, a political analyst at the University Alassane Ouattara in the central city of Bouake, said by phone.\n\nSince his appointment as president in 2011 following a military intervention that ousted Laurent Gbagbo over his refusal to acknowledge defeat in a November 2010 vote, Ouattara, 76, has consolidated his power base. He's overseen an economy that's expanded 8 percent last year, and led his ruling coalition to a comfortable win in 2016 parliamentary elections, taking 167 of the 255 seats.\n\nLawmakers have given strong support to the president's policies, with more than 94 percent of deputies approving the 2018 budget in December. The National Assembly is headed by former rebel leader Guillaume Soro, whose troops fought against Gbagbo's in 2011.\n\nCreating a Senate was one of the main changes of a constitutional reform that was approved in a 2016 referendum. The opposition will boycott the election because it says the electoral commission is dominated by Ouattara supporters and the Senate will create a system of patronage. Police intervened to end a small protest by opposition supporters in the commercial capital, Abidjan, on Thursday.\n\nThe election is indirect, with an electoral college of municipal and regional councilors casting votes.\n\nThe Senate represents regional authorities and Ivorians living overseas, according to the constitution. The appointed Senators will be chosen from among former heads of public bodies, ex-prime ministers and high-profile personalities.\n\n\"The Senate will be a marginal player at best,\" Amaka Anku, Africa analyst at New York-based Eurasia Group, said in an emailed response to questions. \"Though the new constitution does afford the Senate a say in legislation, the National Assembly gets the final say where there is disagreement between the two chambers.\"\n\nAfter Senegal scrapped its Senate in 2012 to save money, Ivory Coast's move to establish the chamber is seen by some as wasteful. The election has sparked little interest among Ivorians, many of whom don't really understand the purpose of a Senate, said Francis Akindes, a sociologist based in the commercial capital, Abidjan.\n\n\"There's a strong feeling that the Senate will only mean additional public expenses, and that this money could have been used for social expenditures instead,\" he said.",

                "body": "It's also the most China-dependent economy in developed world\n\nAs the U.S. and China move toward an all out trade war, Australia finds itself between a rock and a hard place.\n\nAs a close ally of the U.S. and the most China-dependent economy in the developed world, the $1.3 trillion economy has a lot to lose as the world's two biggest trading nations lock horns.\n\n\"Australia is in a very awkward position between the U.S. and China,\" said Roland Rajah at Sydney-based think tank the Lowy Institute. Rajah previously worked at the Asian Development Bank and Australia's central bank. \"Risks of escalating economic tensions between these two is a big concern.\"\n\nChina buys 35 percent of Australian exports, equivalent to about 8 percent of gross domestic product, and dominates iron ore shipments and education. Already, in response to the Turnbull government's announcement of measures to try to thwart Chinese political influence, Beijing is reportedly seeking to discourage students from studying Down Under by warning about safety risks.\n\nEducation is a significant export, and it's not much of a stretch to imagine China could undertake far more disruptive measures in the event Australia sided with the U.S. in a trade war. Education exports to China were worth A$9 billion in the year through June 2017, up 260 percent in a decade. As for tourism, almost 1.4 million Chinese visited Australia in 2017 and pumped a record A$10.4 billion into the economy, up 14 percent from 2016.\n\nAustralia's economic reliance on China is stark -- most countries with a similar or larger proportion of exports to the world's No. 2 economy are developing nations.\n\n\"As a trading nation Australia has a lot to lose from an all out trade war,\" said Andrew Charlton, director of consultancy AlphaBeta in Sydney and one-time economic adviser to former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. \"Whether we are exempted from specific protections or not, the deterioration of the global open trading system will harm our future.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump overnight instructed his trade representative to levy tariffs on at least $50 billion of Chinese imports, citing allegations the nation violates U.S. intellectual property. Hours later, China announced reciprocal measures on $3 billion of imports from the U.S., including products from steel to pork. It said it will also pursue legal action against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization.\n\nEarlier, China's ambassador to Washington Cui Tiankai said accusations of intellectual property violations were \"groundless.\" Cui warned \"if people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer.\"\n\nFor Australia, the economic relationship is not just about shipping metals. While China's thirst for these hasn't waned, it's now complemented by demand for everything from tourism to wine and vitamins. Indeed, 8 percent of China's imports from Australia were consumer goods in 2016, the most recent full year when data is available, compared with just 2 percent in 2013, while the share of minerals has fallen to 56 percent from 62 percent over the period.\n\nCuriously, most countries that trade heavily with each other tend to be in close geographic proximity. Australia stands out in that regard, given it's 4,000 miles from Beijing; the only other countries so distant with a major trade relationship are, curiously, China and the U.S.\n\nSpeaking in Hong Kong earlier this week, Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo criticized rising protectionism. He noted the U.S., in opening its markets to China, had welcomed and facilitated China's emergence as a major economy and helped lift hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty. The minister added that China had made \"major adjustments\" to be part of the rules-based trading system.\n\n\"Protectionism not only doesn't work, but in fact is shooting yourself in the foot,\" Ciobo said in his speech. \"It is wealth-destroying, and does not deliver either the prosperity or certainty its proponents claim.\"",

                "body": "The president's new national security adviser has made his agenda quite clear.\n\nIf you want to get a sense of just how the next national security adviser, John Bolton, fits into Washington's foreign policy ecosystem, consider his lobbying last year against the Iran nuclear deal. The details here tell us a lot about how President Donald Trump's next national security adviser understands America's place in the world.\n\nTrump of course campaigned against the deal and publicly bemoaned the fact that he was required to keep certifying Iran's compliance with it. But a hasty exit from it carried its own risks. Could America effectively impose secondary sanctions on foreign banks and companies without cooperation at least from allies? The White House risked embarrassment since the intelligence community had determined Iran remained in compliance.\n\nSo eventually Trump settled on the current U.S. strategy: threaten to walk away unless America's European allies agree to address its weaknesses, namely its sunsets, Iran's missile programs and the weak inspection regime.\n\nEven that strategy did not go over well inside the Washington establishment, or for that matter with Trump's former secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. The argument was that the deal was working, so why rock the boat?\n\nNot everyone agreed. Bolton wanted to rock the boat.\n\nWith the help of his long-time collaborator, Fred Fleitz, Bolton crafted a policy paper on how to exit the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal title of the agreement intended to secure international monitoring of Iran's nuclear development in exchange for lifting certain sanctions against the regime. An exit would be more involved than just announcing America's withdrawal.\n\nBolton urged the Trump administration to pursue a diplomatic and political strategy that presented a paper on findings on how Iran was in breach of the agreement. He called for coordinating the decision with allies, but leaving Russia and China (two countries that negotiated and agreed to the deal in 2015) out of these consultations until the last minute.\n\nBolton also laid out options that come very close to regime change. He urged the White House to encourage discussions in Congress to consider pressing allies to end landing and docking rights for Iranian vessels and aircraft; demand Iran pay U.S. court orders in favor of the victims of terrorism; announce U.S. support for Iran's democratic opposition; and provide assistance to Iranian minority groups such as the Balochis, Khuzestan Arabs and Kurds as well as \"internal resistance among labor unions, students and women's groups.\"\n\nWhite House officials at the time told me that Bolton briefed Trump on the plan (he has had access to Trump since his campaign in 2016). But eventually the president went with the strategy to try to fix the Iran deal instead of killing it altogether. Next month, when Bolton comes into his new job, he will have a chance to make his case again to the president -- this time as national security adviser.",

Last month, people familiar with the matter said China was studying the impact of restrictions on U.S. soybeans, used to feed the Asian country's more than 400 million pigs.\n\nAnalysts at New York-based investment bank Vertical Group highlighted U.S. pork as an \"easy target\" for China. Domestic wholesale Chinese pork prices tumbled to the lowest since 2015 in March, with any recovery expected to take time due to an expansion in its industry.",

She claims she was tricked into agreeing to the arrangement that requires her to keep silent about the alleged liaison.\n\nMcDougal claims she had a 10-month relationship with Trump starting in 2006, when he was already married to his third wife, Melania Trump, who had given birth to their son Barron earlier that year. Trump was the host of NBC reality show \"The Apprentice\" at the time.\n\nCommon Cause, a non-partisan watchdog group, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission last month, claiming that AMI's payment to McDougal violated the Federal Election Campaign Act. The $150,000 sum is described in the complaint as an undisclosed, illegal corporate contribution to the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 election.",

Investors have sought out haven assets such as the yen and Treasuries. Also moving are the shares of a diverse range of companies from pig breeders to wine companies as investors assess how industries spanning communication technology to aerospace in China will be impacted by planned U.S. tariffs.\n\nHere's a look at some of the key moves in global markets so far:\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 2.5 percent as of 12:55 p.m. in Hong Kong, with broad-based declines across sectors. Technology, materials and industrial shares have taken the brunt of the selling for now.\n\nJapanese shares suffered the worst of the losses in Asia trading, exacerbated by the strong yen, with the Nikkei 225 Stock Average falling more than 4 percent and the Topix index down about 3.5 percent. Both indexes broke through their average levels over the past 200 days, often considered a technical support.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down about 3 percent, bringing this week's decline to around 5 percent. China's Shanghai Composite fell over 3 percent.\n\nOn Thursday in the U.S., all of the major benchmark indexes closed down over 2 percent, heading back toward the lows seen in February.\n\nRead more on how equity bulls are in revolt\n\nRead more on how the Trump trade has been ripped up by tariff trauma\n\nThe yen, which often is sought after in times of market stress, broke through the 105 level against the dollar for the first time since November 2016.\n\nAs stocks sold off during the U.S. session on Thursday, Treasuries climbed and those moves extended on Friday in Asia. The U.S. 10-year yield fell to 2.8 percent.\n\nAustralian government bonds followed their U.S. peers higher, with 10-year yields coming off five basis points.\n\nInvestors also sought refuge in China's bond market.\n\nTreasury Wine Estates Ltd., the maker of Penfolds Grange, has vinyards in California and got about 44 percent of earnings from the Americas last year. The company is expanding its presence in Asia and some expect it to be the largest contributor to earnings next year.\n\nCompanies related to farming are climbing in China. They may benefit if the tariffs on U.S. pork and fruit stem imports of those products.",

                "body": "Battery costs and mass manufacturing seen driving price drop\n\nElectric cars may be cheaper than their petroleum counterparts by 2025 if the cost of lithium-ion batteries continues to fall.\n\nSome models will cost the same as combustion engines as soon as 2024 and become cheaper the following year, according to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. For that to happen, battery pack prices need to fall even as demand for the metals that go into the units continues to rise, the London-based researcher said on Thursday.\n\nThe clamor to roll out electric vehicles has grown louder as countries and companies race to clean up smog in their cities and hit ambitious climate goals set by the Paris Agreement. U.K. lawmakers started an inquiry into the market in September, probing the necessary infrastructure and trying to determine whether to bring forward the 2040 deadline to end the sale of gasoline and diesel cars.\n\nWith incentives, the U.K. could lower its automotive trade deficit by 5 billion pounds ($7 billion), the Green Alliance reported. The World Wildlife Fund said that phasing out diesel and petrol cars earlier could add an extra 14,000 jobs to the industry. In separate reports this week, both groups urged Britain to bring forward the ban on petroleum-fueled cars to 2030.\n\nChina, the world's biggest polluter, is looking to lead the world in electric-vehicle adoption with the government implementing production quotas aimed at increasing sales. The billionaire founder of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Li Shufu, bought a 7.3 billion euro ($9 billion) stake in Daimler AG last month.\n\nThe expected increase in mass manufacturing of lithium-ion storage should help drive battery prices to as low as $70 a kilowatt hour by 2030, BNEF said. Battery packs averaged about $208 a kilowatt hour in 2017, squeezing profit margins and representing some two fifths of the total costs of electric vehicle.\n\n\"Electric vehicle sales will continue to ramp up in the coming years but battery prices still need to decline further for real mass market adoption,\" said Colin McKerracher, transport analyst at BNEF. \"If battery material costs keep rising sharply this could push back the crossover point.\"",

                "title": "These Are the Farm Commodities China May Target in Trade Dispute",
                "body": "Now that President Donald Trump has announced punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, attention has switched to possible retaliatory measures. U.S. agriculture is a clear and obvious target.\n\nU.S. farmers export more produce to China than any other country. By hitting commodities such as soybeans and pork with tariffs, China would also be singling out products grown in the American rural heartland, a key constituency that helped elect Trump. Here's a brief rundown of what may be at risk.\n\nThis humble oilseed is of huge importance to China, where it's used as animal feed and in a wide variety of foods and household goods. The soybean trade is also vital to U.S. farmers: a third of their production, valued at $14 billion annually, goes to China, according to the American Soybean Association.\n\nTargeting soybeans is clearly on the mind of the Chinese government. This week an editorial published in the Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party, railed against alleged soybean dumping.\n\nShould China pull the trigger, the implications for U.S. soy farmers could be severe. \"The tough line the administration is taking on China will lead to retaliation that will cost many farmers their livelihoods,\" the soybean association said Thursday.\n\nYet despite plenty of supply from Brazil and Argentina, China is such a big consumer that it's unlikely to be able to entirely wean itself off U.S. soy. The country's imports are projected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to rise to a humongous 100 million metric tons in the next crop year -- that's more than a quarter of total current global production.\n\nThe U.S. exports about a fifth of its pork production, and China -- the world's largest consumer of the meat -- is among the largest buyers. The U.S. shipped about 309,000 metric tons to China last year, USDA data show. Combined with Hong Kong, it ranks second, behind Mexico, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.\n\nU.S. pork could be an \"easy target,\" according to a report this week by analysts at Vertical Group. China's purchases have waned in recent months as its domestic hog herd expands and pig prices drop. More broadly, the country has ambitions to become more self-sufficient. In 2013, Smithfield Foods Inc., the U.S. pork producer that's also the world's largest, was acquired by Hong Kong-based W.H. Group Ltd.\n\nThe fiber represents another massive trade flow from the U.S.: exports of raw cotton fetched $5.8 billion last year, government data show. China was the top destination after Vietnam.\n\nStill, the cotton market is less concerned about possible duties than it is about the overall threat posed by a trade war, according to Peter Egli, the Chicago-based director of risk management for Plexus Cotton Ltd. Disruption in the soybean trade could spur U.S. farmers to grow more cotton instead, increasing supplies and curbing prices, he said.\n\nChina is the largest market for U.S. alfalfa hay, accounting for about 44 percent of total shipments over the past three years. Hay exports comprise a big part of agriculture in California, Washington and Idaho.\n\nThe growth in shipments to China has been driven by changing production practices in the country's dairy industry. An increasing number of dairy cows are being raised by large, modern farms that prefer imported hay and commercial feed. The Chinese government last year announced a plan to promote the planting of hay to increase domestic supplies by 2020.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping's government has already begun an investigation into imports of American sorghum. Prices of the grain, which is commonly used to feed livestock, have been on the slide recently amid uncertainty surrounding China, said Tim Lust, chief executive officer of Lubbock, Texas-based National Sorghum Producers.",

                "body": "A measure tucked into the massive spending bill passed by the House Thursday lays out new rules for international data requests by law enforcement, giving tech companies an easier way to navigate conflicts between government demands and customer privacy expectations.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. and trade groups representing companies such as Google and Apple Inc. applauded inclusion of the provision in the $1.3 trillion spending bill that is headed toward a final vote in the Senate. Passage may end a Supreme Court case that had pitted Microsoft against the Justice Department in a fight over emails stored on a server in Ireland.\n\nThe Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or CLOUD Act, which was tacked on at the end of the 2,232-page spending bill, makes clear that U.S. warrants apply around the world and clarifies what data the government can access. It sets up a new process for providers to challenge U.S. warrants and notify foreign governments so they can object.\n\nThe measure also puts in place new rules for American companies when they receive information requests from foreign governments. The U.S. would be able to make agreements with other nations governing access. It would supersede the 1986 law at the heart of the Supreme Court case.\n\n\"Today is an important day for privacy rights around the world, for international relations and for building trust in the technology we all rely on every day,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union and privacy groups opposed the CLOUD Act, arguing it would undermine privacy and human rights around the world. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said it \"contains only toothless provisions on human rights\" and represented \"legislative malpractice.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice has supported a prior version of the CLOUD Act, and industry trade groups including BSA - The Software Alliance, the Consumer Technology Association and the Information Technology Industry Council applauded its moves toward becoming law.\n\nThe Supreme Court case, which was set for a decision by June, stemmed from the government's use of the 1986 law to seek emails from an unidentified account kept on Microsoft's server in Ireland. The Justice Department says the messages would provide evidence of drug trafficking.\n\nDuring arguments in February, some justices suggested they would prefer letting Congress address the issue rather than resolving it based on a statute that predates the World Wide Web.\n\n\"If Congress takes a look at this, realizing that much time and innovation has occurred since 1986, it can write a statute that takes account of various interests,\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said. \"And it isn't just all or nothing.\"\n\nAs a formal matter, the new law might not make the dispute legally moot, but it would give the justices even more incentive to sidestep the issue, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law.\n\n\"I think the justices would be in a big hurry to kick the case back to the lower courts to consider what effect, if any, the CLOUD Act has on the underlying dispute,\" Vladeck said.",

She described intellectual property as the \"lifeblood of our companies.\"\n\nHewson, who Trump introduced as \"Marillyn Lockheed,\" stood beside the heads of Raytheon Co., Leidos Holdings Inc. and General Atomics as the president signed an executive memo instructing U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to levy tariffs worth at least $50 billion against Chinese imports. Trump handed Hewson the pen he used for the signing.\n\nOther companies, including 20 of the biggest retailers such as Walmart Inc., had urged against the trade brinksmanship. U.S. stocks tumbled the most in six weeks after the president's tariff announcement.\n\nAs the world's largest defense company, Lockheed is no stranger to espionage threats. Su Bin, a Chinese national also known as Stephen Bin, was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 after pleading guilty to directing Chinese hackers to sensitive documents at major U.S. defense companies. The hackers claimed to have stolen 65 gigabytes of data related to Boeing Co.'s C-17 cargo transport, while also targeting Lockheed's F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters.\n\nDefense contractors, which had benefited from the so-called Trump Trade last year, were caught in the market downdraft from the threatened tariffs. Lockheed shares fell 2.5 percent, while Raytheon dropped 2 percent, Leidos lost 2.3 percent. Boeing, seen as vulnerable to the economic fallout of rising trade tensions, plummeted 5.2 percent.",

                "body": "Resources revenue share seen smaller than historical averages\n\nAlberta is looking beyond its oil industry as it works to end years of red ink. Still, a recovery to balanced budgets is a long ways off.\n\nCanada's top oil-producing province on Thursday projected a narrower budget deficit next year, despite declining revenue from non-renewable resources. While it expects that revenue stream to rebound in future years, by the time the province returns to balanced budgets in six years, it will mark a smaller share of the government's revenue than historical averages.\n\nIn its budget for the fiscal year ending in March 2019, Alberta doubled down on measures to wean the province's economy off its dependence on oil and gas extraction after the recent downturn in the sector plunged the government's finances into deficit. It's extending a 30 percent tax credit for equity investments in certain Alberta businesses and a 10 percent tax credit for some capital spending in manufacturing, processing and tourism infrastructure.\n\n\"For too long, Alberta has been locked in a cycle of boom-and-bust spending that tracked the price of non-renewable resource spending,\" Finance Minister Joe Ceci said in a prepared speech to the province's legislature. The new budget is built to increase entrepreneurs' access to capital, strengthen the technology sector and attract investment to the petrochemical industry, he said.\n\nThe government is pointing to growth in other parts of the economy as a sign that its efforts are gaining traction. Retail sales rose 7.5 percent last year, and manufacturing shipments increased 14 percent. Alberta led all provinces, with economic growth of 4.5 percent in 2017. The government is projecting 2.7 percent growth this year. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate 2.4 percent growth, second only to British Columbia.\n\nOverall, the province projects its budget deficit will narrow to C$8.8 billion ($6.8 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. That's down from C$9.1 billion in the current fiscal year. It's also narrower than the C$9.7 billion the province estimated in its three-year plan released about a year ago.\n\nThose projections include a 16 percent drop in resources revenue to C$3.8 billion as Alberta's energy producers suffer from a shortage of pipeline space that has widened the discount for their crude compared to U.S. grades.\n\nThe government forecasts resource revenue will bounce back in the following year, but said that by the 2023-2024 fiscal year it will represent only 16 percent of total revenue. That's below the 23 percent average over the last two decades and less than half of a high of 37 percent in the fiscal year ended in 2006.\n\nThe government sees the budget coming into balance in the fiscal year ending in March 2024, almost a decade after the oil crash pushed it into deficit. By the time it reaches balance, the C$56 billion in net debt the province has accumulated will represent about 12 percent of Alberta's gross domestic product.\n\nOther key budget details and projections released Thursday include:\n\nKey economic and energy-industry assumptions include:",

                "title": "Trump Legal Team Shakeup Could Strain Cooperation With Mueller",
                "body": "President Donald Trump's attorneys have approached Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team with cordiality and cooperation. But that may not last.\n\nThe departure of Trump's lead lawyer, John Dowd, means that many important decisions are likely to be revisited. Those include whether Trump will talk with prosecutors, how to handle requests to interview administration insiders and how to respond to efforts by investigators to probe into Trump's business.\n\nThe new-look legal team mulling those issues now includes Joseph diGenova, a combative lawyer who argued repeatedly on Fox News that the probe grew out of a secretive plot among FBI agents to frame the president.\n\n\"It appears that with the hiring of diGenova, the president has decided that he wants to play hardball,\" said Robert Bennett, who represented President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\nWhat would such a tonal shift look like? It's possible that Trump and his lawyers, instead of volunteering documents and allowing staffers to sit for interviews as they have done, could battle records requests, seek to discredit potential witnesses and step up a media battle against the probe. That could slow investigators if they're forced to seek court orders requiring the White House to honor subpoenas.\n\nBennett, a partner at Hogan Lovells, said that in hiring diGenova, Trump may be looking to take a page \"right out of Roy Cohn's playbook.\" Cohn, who represented and mentored a young Donald Trump, was famous for playing extremely aggressive offense.\n\nTrump has already begun to take the gloves off. He referred to the special counsel by name for the first time on Twitter in recent critical tweets. Until this weekend, he had labeled the probe as a \"witch hunt\" without calling out Mueller himself.\n\n\"Donald Trump is like many clients I've represented over the years, who've been very successful and don't like to be told what to do,\" said Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor who has defended Trump in the news media. \"They're genuinely not used to listening to anybody. Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't.\"\n\nDershowitz rejected any speculation that he might join Trump's defense team, after a Trump tweet this week that quoted him. \"I want to maintain my independence,\" said Dershowitz, who has represented Claus Von Bülow, Leona Helmsley and O.J. Simpson. \"I like what I'm doing.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers have kept a more even tone than their client has. Longtime Trump lawyer Marc Kasowitz viewed Mueller positively, as a seasoned professional who wouldn't let politics dictate charging decisions, when he put together Trump's defense team last summer, a person familiar with the matter said. Another lawyer representing Trump, Jay Sekulow, said in a statement Thursday that the legal team would continue its cooperation with Mueller's office.\n\nTo the news media, Kasowitz has been more willing to throw punches. He's known for his pugilistic style in his comments on behalf of clients, including Trump.\n\nRegardless, the reshuffle could rattle a guiding principle that Dowd and fellow lawyer Ty Cobb appear to have expressed for both the public and their famously difficult client: That cooperation with Mueller would help wrap up the probe.\n\nDowd, a former Marine, and Sekulow led talks with Mueller to negotiate terms of an interview between the president and special counsel. Dowd was deeply versed in the facts of the case. He and Cobb oversaw the tens of thousands of pages of documents that had been handed over to Mueller.\n\nDowd's exit was prompted, people familiar with the matter say, partly over his pique at the arrival of the sharp-elbowed diGenova earlier this week. Kasowitz is now expected to help reorganize the legal team to make sure everything is in the right place, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nKasowitz himself was the first Trump lawyer to sit down with Mueller last year, this person said, so an expanded role for him could add continuity. But it's too early to determine whether he would return to actively managing the president's defense, the person said.\n\nQuickTake: Can Trump Dismiss the Special Counsel? Not Exactly",

McMaster with John Bolton, a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, in the latest shakeup of his administration.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor,\" Trump said in a tweet. \"I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.\"\n\nMcMaster's exit comes as Trump is reshaping much of his national security team ahead of planned talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks. Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on March 13, saying the two had disagreed on the Iran nuclear deal and other matters of foreign policy.\n\nBolton, who has worked as a lawyer, Fox News contributor and senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute in the years since he served as President George W. Bush's representative at the UN in 2005-2006, had become a frequent behind-the-scenes visitor to President Donald Trump and had campaigned openly to replace McMaster in recent weeks.\n\nBolton's appointment marks another step to the right as Trump swaps out foreign policy moderates with far more hawkish advisers. Tillerson, who like McMaster had defended the Iran deal and counseled diplomacy with North Korea, was fired March 13; Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo, who has pushed for a much harder stance against the two countries, is set to replace him.\n\nMcMaster joined the administration a year ago after Trump fired his predecessor, Michael Flynn, for lying to the vice president about contacts with Russia. An Army lieutenant general, McMaster has traveled with Trump to several countries and helped craft the president's national security approach to North Korea, Afghanistan, Iran and other global hotspots.\n\nTrump and McMaster had also clashed during his tenure, which included the dismissal of several aides from the National Security Council.\n\nTrump publicly rebuked McMaster in February, saying in a tweet that his national security adviser had neglected to defend his 2016 victory when discussing U.S. claims that Russia meddled in the election.",

                "title": "Trump's Plan to Punish the U.S. Economy",
                "body": "In threatening trade war with China, the president seems to have no idea what's at stake.\n\nOne thing to understand about President Donald Trump's proposed new tariffs on China is that they are, in the first instance, a tax on U.S. producers and consumers. The revenue they'll raise won't come from China, but from the pockets of Americans who'll have to pay more for Chinese goods.\n\nImposing this tax requires a strong justification, or at least an intelligible rationale. The Trump administration offers neither. It's true that the U.S. has legitimate trade grievances with China, but there are much better ways of resolving them.\n\nThe White House says it will impose tariffs on $50 billion (or maybe $60 billion) of China's annual imports to the U.S. Not quite yet, though: Details will follow in 15 days, and there'll be 30 days for comments before any tariffs take effect. At the same time, the Treasury has been given 60 days to come up with new restrictions on investment by Chinese firms in the U.S.\n\nMaybe Trump hopes these threats will lead China to make trade concessions and he will not need to actually put these tariffs in place. Conceivably, it could work out that way: Premier Li Keqiang said this week China will open its economy further, do more to protect intellectual property, and restrain its efforts to get foreign investors to transfer technology. If China follows through, that might be enough for Trump to declare victory and move on to his next adventure.\n\nThe danger is that Trump actually believes his own bombastic rhetoric about winning a trade war -- that the time for talking is past, that China's promises are worthless, and that the administration will keep raising taxes on U.S. producers and consumers until the trade deficit with China is eliminated. That would be a lunatic growth-killing plan even if China didn't retaliate. If China did push back, and raised tariffs of its own against U.S. exports, the impact on both countries' growth would be worse.\n\nEven if it doesn't come to that, the other great cost of Trump's approach is the threat it poses to the rules-based system of liberal trade -- one designed and built over decades by none other than the U.S.\n\nThe president may be deluding himself that he can change China's behavior merely by bullying. A far better plan would be to bind an increasingly powerful China into this system as a matter of mutual advantage. This is a multilateral effort, involving the European Union and Japan, and it would be made more difficult by the unilateral rule-bending (or -breaking) that the Trump administration is proposing. How wise is it, really, to tell China, \"Do as you're told: Might is right\"?\n\nOn intellectual property and technology transfer, China is widely agreed to have done some rule-bending of its own. That does need to be addressed -- and the existing system provides ways to do so. Oddly enough, the Trump administration acknowledges as much; it announced this week that the U.S. would launch a new case at the World Trade Organization on China's rules for licensing technology, and it has also relied on the expertise of CFIUS, the committee on foreign investment, to block deals on national-security grounds.\n\nStarting a trade war, however, is another matter entirely. That's a plan with a likelihood of high casualties for both sides. No one is arguing that Trump lacks the authority to prosecute such a war. But he, and the American public, should be aware of what's at stake.\n\n--Editors: Clive Crook, Michael Newman.\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg View's editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net .",

                "body": "President Donald Trump is frustrated over trade imbalances and the theft of intellectual property by China. His proposed tariffs aren't likely to remedy the situation, and could make it worse.\n\nTrump on Thursday ordered tariffs on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports, with the proposed product list set to include items in aerospace, information and communication technology and machinery. Some people are talking about the pronouncement as if building a wall against the encroaching Chinese tide might be new or effective. Not so: The U.S. has been throwing obstacles in front of its largest trade rival for decades and has complained about intellectual property theft for just as long.\n\nFor years, the U.S. has used Section 301 of the Trade Act to target foreign IP infringement. While that part of the law doesn't specifically focus on intellectual property issues, the provision has become the umbrella for an annual report card on how countries protect IP. Being placed on the U.S. trade representative's Special 301 Watch List is a slap on the wrist for countries. After that, there is the Priority Watch List, considered even more severe.\n\nMostly, it's an embarrassment to be on either list, and countries tend to tighten IP enforcement in order to be delisted. This happened to Taiwan in the early 2000s because of music piracy, and spurred the government there to implement tougher measures including the introduction of an IP court. It has since been dropped from the list, and the U.S. can point to Taiwan as a case study in effective use of Special 301. Not that it always works this way.\n\nChina has been on the Priority Watch List since at least 2006. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has been named a Notorious Market\" by the U.S. trade representative, and tends to shed crocodile tears every time it does. Beijing doesn't seem particularly embarrassed, nor in a great hurry to be delisted. So this particular carrot and stick doesn't appear to be effective.\n\nBeyond Special 301, the U.S. doesn't have a lot of options when it comes to enforcing intellectual property rights outside its borders. One of them is to ban imports of infringed items, a process that is currently left to the U.S. International Trade Commission in a cumbersome process that requires litigation and lengthy court cases. Samsung Electronics Corp. and HTC Corp. have both been subjected to this process through suits brought by Apple Inc., but it's not very efficient or effective.\n\nEven the ITC is helpless when products are developed in China for use internally. Huawei Technologies Co. looks set to get kicked out of the U.S. -- for security reasons, not IP -- and there's not a lot of other Chinese technology products being sold in the U.S. either, which is why implementing tariffs as a measure to spur IP enforcement looks like the wrong tool for the job. You can't tariff a product that's not even being imported, and it doesn't make practical sense to tax items unrelated to the IP being stolen.\n\nIn addition to tariffs, Trump has directed the Treasury Secretary to propose new investment restrictions on Chinese companies to safeguard technologies. This seems unnecessary. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which is chaired by the Treasury Secretary, already monitors and rejects foreign investments. It acts in secret and rarely explains its decisions. And while it doesn't have the power to veto deals, it makes recommendations to the president. Trump rejecting Broadcom Corp.'s takeover of Qualcomm Corp. is proof that this mechanism works.\n\nEnunciating restrictions in writing may not change the end result, but it would give China something concrete to rail against and provide ammunition for Beijing to escalate this trade war.\n\nClearly, Trump is itching for action. But while swinging a large hammer will make a lot of noise, it might not get the job done.",

                "body": "Business groups warn of higher prices from China retaliation\n\nIndustry trade groups and companies quickly vowed to push back against President Donald Trump's decision to order tariffs on Chinese goods and try to limit the number of products that are included.\n\nBroad-based tariffs will likely translate into higher prices in U.S. stores because a vast amount of items used by American consumers -- including Under Armour leggings, Bath & Body Works shower gel and Samsonite luggage -- are sourced from Chinese- or Hong Kong-based companies and factories.\n\nU.S. retailers and their lobbyists have grown increasingly vocal in recent days as the president telegraphed his decision. Walmart Inc., Macy's Inc. and more than 20 other retailers sent a letter to Trump earlier this week urging him to reconsider the idea.\n\n\"We will continue engaging with congressional leadership and the administration to advocate for an approach that doesn't negatively impact American jobs, jeopardize economic growth and increase the cost of living for American families,\" Matthew Shay, president and chief executive officer of the National Retail Federation, said in a statement Thursday after Trump announced his decision levy tariffs on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nThe retail group is pleased that consumer products weren't at the top of the list the White House initially targeted and will work to identify products that may be at risk for tariffs, said David French, senior vice president for government relations.\n\nThe technology industry trade group ITI said it will provide feedback during the 30-day comment period before the tariffs become final. That period begins once the office of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer designates a list of products that will face higher tariffs.\n\n\"These measures could violate international obligations and - more importantly - would punish U.S. consumers, businesses and workers for China's action,\" Dean Garfield, ITI president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this week, ITI led a coalition of 45 business associations that sent a letter to Trump urging him not to impose tariffs and risk triggering \"a chain reaction of negative consequences for the U.S. economy\" with Chinese retaliation.\n\nChinese ambassador to the U.S. Cui Tiankai said in a video posted on the embassy's Facebook page that while China doesn't want a trade war, \"If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer.\"\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which signed on to the letter from the business associations, said that while the administration is right to seek equity and fairness in the trading relationship with China, sweeping tariffs are not the answer.\n\n\"Imposing taxes on American consumers and job creators in the form of new tariffs is not the way to achieve those ends,\" the chamber said in a statement, adding that it \"looks forward to engaging the administration during this process to ensure the business community's voice is heard on U.S.-China trade matters.\"\n\nThe Consumer Technology Association welcomed Trump's decision to accept comments on the order to impose tariffs but warned that a trade war with China could affect the almost 2.5 million U.S. jobs associated with trade involving technology products.\n\n\"Unfair trade practices must be addressed, but the solution is not to put a new tax on U.S. businesses and force consumers to pay dramatically more to access the technology products they need,\" Gary Shapiro, the group's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.\n\nFreedom Partners, a group affiliated with billionaires Charles and David Koch, said Trump's order, coming after he authorized tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum earlier this month, will undermine the benefits from the tax overhaul enacted last December, harm the economy and kill jobs.\n\n\"Each time tariffs are levied, it's Americans who wind up paying the price, not other countries,\" Freedom Partners Executive Vice President Nathan Nascimento said in a statement. \"We should be working to expand upon the growth and relief borne from historic tax reform, not raising prices on those who can least afford it.\"\n\nRather than imposing tariffs, the administration should pursue a comprehensive approach that includes working with international partners to identify unfair trade barriers and practices China must change, setting deadlines for action and outlining the U.S. response to inaction, the Business Roundtable said.\n\n\"Unilaterally imposing tariffs or other restrictions without a long-term strategy to bring about reforms in China will only raise prices in America, make American companies and products less competitive, and harm U.S. workers and consumers,\" the group said in a statement.",

He was charged Wednesday after being taken into police custody for questioning by a special financial crimes unit. In France, charges are brought during an investigation, before a decision is made on whether the matter will go to trial.\n\nSarkozy, 63, served as head of state from 2007 to 2012, when he lost a bid for re-election. He placed a distant third in 2016 in the primary to be the candidate of the center-right Republicans in last year's election. The former president told TF1 that he would not seek to re-enter political life.\n\nSarkozy has been the target of several criminal investigations since he left office in 2012. In 2014 he was charged with influence-peddling for alleged efforts to have judges keep him informed about the state of play in some of the probes. An investigative judge decided in February 2017 to send him to trial on charges that he used false receipts to illegally exceed campaign-spending limits in his failed 2012 re-election bid. Both cases are still pending.",

New products and an improved customer experience are helping win back customers, he said in a statement.\n\n\"We now see a significant reversal of trend in North America,\" Parker said.\n\nThe results help send the shares up as much as 5.3 percent to $67.85 in late trading. The stock had climbed 3 percent this year through Thursday's close.\n\nThe world's biggest sports brand has spent a year trying to regain its foothold in its biggest market after an overly ambitious revenue target -- $50 billion by 2020 -- led to a buildup of U.S. inventory. The slump was worsened by store closures, competition from Adidas AG, and a fashion shift away from Nike's strengths -- like basketball shoes.\n\nNow the company says it's back on the upswing. Earnings also topped analysts' estimates last quarter. Excluding some items, profit amounted to 68 cents a share, compared with an average prediction of 53 cents.\n\nThe company's business overseas remained strong, with China growing 19 percent, excluding currency effects. Total revenue came in at almost $9 billion, outpacing the estimate of $8.85 billion.\n\nNike disclosed last week that it was reviewing allegations of improper conduct at the apparel giant. The news accompanied the abrupt resignation of two high-profile executives.\n\nTrevor Edwards, president of the Nike brand and once seen a likely successor to the 62-year-old Parker, stepped down from the role and will retire in August. And one of his direct reports, Jayme Martin, left the company last week.\n\nNike said this week that it acted swiftly when it heard of behavior problems among managers and executives.\n\n\"We take these issues very seriously and we were disturbed and saddened to hear of them,\" Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for the company, said on Wednesday. \"We are committed to a culture that reflects our values and are taking steps so that all our employees have a positive experience built on respect, inclusivity and empowerment.\"",

For now the administration says the levies will focus on three industries -- aerospace, information and communication technology, and machinery -- areas where the U.S. government perceives the Chinese have been unfair or where there is a large trade deficit.\n\nAutomakers still have reason to worry. In his televised address, Trump used cars as an example of China's unfairness by citing a 25 percent tariff on U.S. vehicles sold in China compared with only 2.5 percent on Chinese-made cars coming in. Trump also said he is concerned about protecting U.S. technology. Carmakers build electric vehicles in China and share that technology with Chinese partners.\n\nThe U.S. has an $8.9 billion surplus on cars with the Chinese but a $1.5 billion auto trade deficit overall when counting parts, according to data from the U.S. Census bureau.

                "body": "Shares have biggest-ever one-day swoon as cancer drug stumbles\n\nBlockbuster arthritis treatment Humira helped build AbbVie Inc. into a pharmaceutical-industry behemoth. Now investors are growing concerned about the drugmaker's second act.\n\nOn Thursday, AbbVie shares suffered their biggest-ever single-day slide, dropping 13 percent to $98.10 at 4 p.m. in New York, after the company's experimental lung-cancer drug Rova-T suffered a setback. The drop was the steepest among companies in the S&P 500 index as fears of a U.S.-China trade war sparked a wide-ranging selloff, and wiped nearly $23 billion off AbbVie's market value.\n\nAbbVie had hoped that the cancer treatment, acquired in the $5.8 billion takeover of Stemcentrx Inc. in 2016, would give it another potential blockbuster before Humira ever faces a significant competitive threat.\n\nHumira, protected by a virtually impregnable wall of patents, had $18.4 billion in sales in 2017, accounting for 65 percent of AbbVie's revenue. That imbalance has disturbed investors who want the drugmaker to find more viable candidates to fill the expected sales void when Humira is eventually exposed to rivals.\n\n\"The blockbuster model is that you have this stellar product and everyone loves it but it means one day you have to replace it,\" said Bloomberg Intelligence biotech analyst Asthika Goonewardene in an interview. \"AbbVie did this big song and dance that this could be the next big thing and now only two years later they have this setback.\"\n\nAbbVie isn't the only drugmaker being asked whether it's more than a one-hit wonder. Celgene Corp. and Gilead Sciences Inc. also became multibillion-dollar companies on the success of top treatments that made them darlings of investors and the envy of rivals. Now, the fortunes of all three may fade unless they can replicate past blockbusters.\n\nSpokespeople for AbbVie and Celgene didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Gilead spokeswoman Michele Rest declined to comment in an email.\n\nThe industry has often turned to mergers and acquisitions for fast fixes to fallow pipelines. But AbbVie said Thursday it wouldn't seek accelerated U.S. approval for Rova-T, highlighting the pitfalls of growing through takeovers in a business where promising experimental research often ends in failure.\n\nThe Stemcentrx deal was meant to be \"the cornerstone of AbbVie's solid tumor portfolio, which had in turn become a key element of the company's most important growth category, oncology,\" wrote Geoffrey Porges, a Leerink Partners analyst who has a market perform rating on the shares, in a note. \"The nature of the failure undermines the entire value proposition of Stemcentrx.\"\n\nNot all analysts were as pessimistic. While saying the data was disappointing, it's \"not that big of a deal from our valuation perspective,\" Y. Katherine Xu, an analyst at William Blair & Co. who has an outperform rating on the shares, said in a phone interview. Christopher Raymond, an analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co. who rates the shares overweight, said the selloff seemed like an overreaction.\n\nCelgene suffered a similar setback in October when a Crohn's disease drug it acquired failed in a late-stage trial. Since then, the company, which is preparing for the loss of exclusivity for its top-selling cancer drug Revlimid, has lost more than a third of its market value.\n\nInvestors are bound to ask whether AbbVie's stumble \"is another Celgene in the making,\" wrote Tim Anderson, global pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, in a note to clients. \"Sentiment may suddenly shift to the negative and stay there.\"\n\nEven drugs that make it to market can fall short of their commercial promise. Gilead, best known for its Hepatitis C drugs, acquired Kite Pharma Inc. for $12 billion in order to gain its novel cancer therapies. While its gene-based treatment Yescarta was cleared by regulators, sales have been slow as hurdles in the U.S. government reimbursement system stalled its uptake.\n\nSince Yescarta was approved on Oct. 18, Gilead shares have declined 5.6 percent.\n\nThanks to its patents, AbbVie has time before Humira faces any direct rivals, but regulators are eager to bring more rivals for costly biologic drugs to market and drive prices lower. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a speech this month that makers of biotechnology drugs and supply-chain middlemen have used complex pricing deals to lock out competitors.\n\nCriticism of high drug costs and a dearth of competition could pressure AbbVie and its peers, according to Dustin French, a health economist and associate professor at Northwestern University.\n\nAbbVie is \"not a well-diversified company,\" he said in an interview.",

With a global gas glut tightening faster than expected, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and its partners in a proposed British Columbia complex are closing in on a final investment decision.\n\n\"We've got this world-class resource that can produce at very low costs,\" said Jackie Forrest, senior director at the ARC Energy Research Institute in Calgary. \"I think eventually we'll see a project go forward. Economics always talk.\"\n\nLNG Canada -- an estimated C$40 billion ($31 billion) project backed by Shell, PetroChina Co., Korea Gas Corp. and Mitsubishi Corp. -- envisions an export facility in Kitimat that could eventually ship 26 million tons a year of super-chilled gas.\n\nThe twice-postponed final investment decision is now expected by the end of this year. The partners are already interviewing prospective engineering contractors and on Thursday the provincial government announced tax breaks and other cost-reducing measures to nudge the companies into formally committing to the project.\n\nThat development alone has the potential to ship a quarter of the gas currently produced in Western Canada, Forrest estimates. That's critical because the lack of an outlet to overseas markets means Canada's energy exports are sold almost exclusively into the U.S. at depressed prices.\n\nCanadian producers are hopeful. \"From what I can see, I think there's a lot of optimism that they'll make a positive final investment decision,\" said Cenovus Chief Executive Officer Alex Pourbaix, whose company extracts gas at its Deep Basin deposit straddling British Columbia and Alberta.\n\nA price-killing oversupply threw the economics of LNG exports from Australia to Russia to Mozambique into question in recent years. Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Bhd. and Chinese state-controlled producer CNOOC Ltd. canceled developments worth tens of billions of dollars last year, decisions that all but suffocated Canada's dream of becoming an LNG heavyweight.\n\nYet that glut may not be so big after all. With demand growing at the fastest pace since 2011, the projected oversupply is retreating, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Wood Mackenzie Ltd. sees the market for new gas suppliers opening around 2022, two years earlier than earlier estimates.\n\nProtectionist trade volleys could complicate which projects capture the opportunity.\n\nTellurian Inc. warned last week that steel tariffs could \"significantly increase\" the cost of its proposed $15.2 billion Driftwood LNG plant in Louisiana. Freeport LNG's project under construction in Texas is far enough along to escape the duties, but CEO Michael Smith said he worries that if the tariffs spark a trade war with China, the project could suffer because China is a potential long-term buyer of the gas.\n\nIn Houston, the energy capital of the Western Hemisphere, officials also voiced concerns about retaliation over the tariffs.\n\nLNG terminals \"are the types or projects that could be in jeopardy with these sanctions,\" said Bob Harvey, CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership, a pro-business civic group. \"China can simply go to Russia, Australia or the Middle East for their LNG.\"'",

New projects will also pay lower electricity rates in line with other industrial users, he said.\n\nIn B.C., manufacturers are exempt from sales taxes on production machinery and equipment. The new framework will extend that exemption to LNG projects, but the lost revenue will be subject to repayment once the project is up and running, according to a government statement.\n\nHorgan said the new terms were justified because under the existing framework, not a single project was likely to get built.\n\n\"After five years of talking about one, two, three, five LNG facilities, there are zero,\" Horgan said. With the changes, \"we may get one.\"\n\nShell and its partners Mitsubishi Corp., PetroChina Co. and Korea Gas Corp. are expected to make a final investment decision this year on whether to build an export facility in Kitimat in northern B.C. The project would allow Canadian gas to be shipped to Asian markets and could eventually reach 26 million tons a year in capacity.\n\nThe group, known as LNG Canada, welcomed the announcement in a statement, saying the new measures \"will be important\" in their effort in reaching a final decision.\n\nHorgan set a Nov. 30 deadline for Shell and its partners to formally greenlight the project in order to be eligible under the new rules.\n\nThe previous Liberal government under former Premier Christy Clark had set up a C$100 billion \"prosperity fund\" to collect taxes from an LNG industry it expected would grow to more than 20 developments. Not a single major one has moved forward and five have been canceled since then amid a global supply glut of LNG.",

                "body": "Market positioning shows most investors expect greenback drop\n\nDollar bulls may be a vanishing breed, but they're far from extinct.\n\nWith the greenback extending last year's slide into 2018, markets are broadly positioned for more weakness. That bias is seen in speculators' positioning in the futures market and in the money flowing into U.S. exchange-traded funds that invest in foreign stocks and don't hedge out currency swings.\n\nBut dollar bulls such as Sinead Colton are holding their ground, and should they prove right, the bears would face a painful squeeze. Colton, a global investment strategist at BNY Mellon Asset Management North America, expects the dollar to rebound against currencies such as the euro as the U.S. tax overhaul leads the American economy to outshine the euro region.\n\n\"What currencies tend to respond to is the rate of change in economic growth,\" said Colton, whose firm oversees $572 billion. \"So yes, the euro zone is expanding, but that pace of positive surprise has declined. And actually the U.S, given the tax-reform package, is starting to outpace it.\"\n\nThe Bloomberg dollar index sank 8.5 percent last year amid vibrant growth abroad and the prospect that other central banks would join the Federal Reserve in tightening policy. It's down 2.3 percent in 2018, partly on concern over U.S. budget and current account deficits.\n\nHowever, Colton expects euro weakness to take hold in the next three to six months as growth dynamics in Europe and the U.S. shift. Euro-area gross domestic product will probably expand 2.3 percent in 2018, compared with 2.8 percent for the U.S., according to forecasts in Bloomberg surveys.\n\nThe euro is her largest short position, while the dollar is the biggest bullish wager.\n\nThat's in contrast to the consensus of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, which predicts the euro will climb to $1.26 by the end of 2018, from about $1.23 on Tuesday in New York. Being bearish the dollar is the second-most-crowded trade across financial markets, after long bets on certain technology companies, according to a March fund manager survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research.\n\nColton has company in calling for a dollar comeback.\n\nThe currency is set for a boost because the Fed is probably going to signal a more aggressive path of rate hikes this week, according to Niall Coffey, chief investment officer of Avoca Global Advisors LLC.\n\nPolicy makers' latest quarterly forecasts will probably indicate a greater likelihood of 100 basis points of tightening in both 2018 and 2019, according to a March 14 research note from Coffey, formerly the chief foreign-exchange dealer at the New York Fed. In December, officials projected three quarter-point hikes this year, followed by about two in 2019.\n\n\"The U.S. dollar is likely to find support as the FOMC outlines a persistent policy tightening agenda,\" Coffey wrote.",

                "title": "Toys 'R' Us Founder Charles Lazarus Dies at 94",
                "body": "Debt, discounters, online rivals ultimately crushed the chain\n\nCharles Lazarus, who combined supermarket-style service with touches of whimsy in creating Toys \"R\" Us Inc., a longtime retail success that fought high debt and fierce competition and finally succumbed just last week, has died. He was 94.\n\nHe died Thursday in Manhattan, Michael Goldstein, a close friend who was the company's former chairman, said in a phone interview. Amy von Walter, a spokeswoman for Toys \"R\" Us, said the news adds to the chain's \"many sad moments\" recently, but she added that the company \"will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere.\"\n\nUnable to fend off rivals while saddled with more than $5 billion in debt, the company filed for bankruptcy in September 2017 and in recent days began closing down its U.S. and U.K. operations while attempting to reorganize and sell its remaining international units. The chain includes more than 1,600 Toys \"R\" Us and Babies \"R\" Us stores in 38 countries.\n\nFrom the first Toys \"R\" Us outlet, opened in 1957 in the Maryland suburbs near his hometown of Washington, Lazarus stuck to a winning formula of high volume, discounted prices and cookie-cutter predictability.\n\nAs much as anyone, he transformed the toy business from Christmas-focused to year-round. Delighted manufacturers ran proposed products by his company before committing to wide-scale production, according to a 1986 article in Atlantic Monthly magazine, which called Lazarus \"the person most responsible for loosening Santa's grip on the toy business.\" His strategy created the world's largest toy-store chain.\n\nLazarus led the New Jersey-based company -- now based in Wayne -- through its 1966 sale to Interstate Department Stores Inc. and through Interstate's bankruptcy in 1974, which resulted in Toys \"R\" Us emerging as the surviving company and going public in 1978.\n\nSince Lazarus stepped down as chief executive officer in 1994 and chairman four years later, the company has faced new competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. and from the rise of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which overtook it in U.S. toy sales in 1998.\n\nBain Capital LLC, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust took over Toys \"R\" Us in a $7.5 billion leveraged buyout in 2005. In 2009, the toymaker acquired FAO Schwarz and its flagship Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan. That store closed in 2015, a victim of rising rent.\n\nAs his chain expanded, Lazarus emphasized dependability over novelty. The 18,000-plus toys for sale at any given time were the same in each store. Decisions on which items to stock, and how to display them, were made at corporate headquarters.\n\n\"There's an enormous opportunity in America if you're willing to make a commitment to inventory,\" Lazarus said.\n\nLazarus added personal touches such as the backward R in the store's name -- \"to give the impression that a child wrote it,\" according to a company history -- and Geoffrey the Giraffe, the chain's mascot. Diapers were sold at deep discounts, encouraging parents to spend their savings on toys.\n\nLazarus earned more than $60 million in 1987, according to Forbes magazine, making him No. 1 in its ranking of highest paid executives. Stock options accounted for about $56 million.\n\nIn August 2013, Lazarus sold his duplex at 960 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan for $21 million to Peruvian billionaire Carlos Rodriguez-Pastor.\n\n\"If you're going to be a success in life, you have to want it,\" Forbes quoted him as saying in 1983. \"I wanted it. I was poor. I wanted to be rich.\"\n\nCharles Phillip Lazarus was born Oct. 4, 1923, in Washington, the son of Frank and Fannie Lazarus. From an early age he helped his father refurbish broken bicycles and sell them.\n\n\"I always wondered why we didn't sell new bicycles,\" he said. \"My father said it was because the big chain stores could sell them so much cheaper than we could.\"\n\nIn 1948, following military service during World War II as a cryptographer, he took over his father's store and replaced the bicycles with baby furniture. He switched again, to toys, to get customers to return more frequently.\n\n\"Toys are a great kind of thing to sell, because they don't last that long,\" he said.\n\nHe called his store Children's Supermart, with the Rs rendered backward. In the late 1950s, \"motivated by the success of emerging self-service grocery supermarkets,\" according to the company history, he adopted a similar model -- long lanes of products, carts for customers.\n\nWhen he opened his first toys-specific store, in Rockville, Maryland, he went with a shorter name, Toys \"R\" Us, to maximize the size of letters on the highway sign.\n\nIn 1966, with his four Washington-area stores totaling $12 million in annual sales, Lazarus sold the company to Interstate Stores for $7.5 million in cash, remaining as head of Interstate's toy division.\n\nHe opened 43 new store branches in the next eight years. Interstate didn't fare as well, filing for bankruptcy protection in 1974. When it emerged in 1978 as Toys \"R\" Us Inc., a public company, Lazarus was CEO.\n\nHis second marriage, to psychiatrist Helen Singer Kaplan, founder of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic in New York, made headlines upon her 1995 death from cancer at age 66.\n\nThe day before she died, Kaplan notified her husband by handwritten letter that she was exercising a provision in their marital agreement entitling her to $20 million should either declare an intent to divorce.\n\n\"Nothing personal,\" she wrote. \"I do not intend for you to leave the premises. It was only for the money for the kids\" -- she had three from her first marriage, while he had two from his -- \"and for the art.\"\n\nLazarus challenged Kaplan's deathbed claim, saying it lacked any true intention to divorce him. He battled Kaplan's children -- Phillip, Peter and Jennifer -- in court until 2000, when, according to a New York Daily News article, a Manhattan Surrogate Court judge dismissed the children's fraud claim against Lazarus.\n\nLazarus had two daughters, Ruth and Diane, with his first wife, Udyss, according to New York magazine. They divorced in 1979. He later married Joan Regenbogen, an interior decorator.\n\nLazarus's death as Toys \"R\" Us teeters on the brink of existence was \"surreal,\" said Goldstein, the company's former chairman. When Lazarus and Goldstein talked in recent months while Lazarus wasn't well, they would reminisce about \"having a good run,\" Goldstein said. He added that their only regrets were employees who would be losing their jobs, suppliers who would be losing their best customer and all the kids who won't grow up with Toys \"R\" Us.",

                "body": "Leaders meeting in Brussels for summit discussed proposed levy\n\nEuropean Union leaders cast doubt over plans by the bloc's executive arm to slap a 3 percent levy on the digital revenue of large technology companies, highlighting the challenges ahead in rallying support for such a tax.\n\nThe leaders, who gathered in Brussels for a two-day summit, discussed the European Commission's proposal for a levy that would increase taxes these companies pay by about 5 billion euros ($6.2 billion) a year. The bloc is seeking to raise money from an industry it says provides less than it should to public coffers.\n\nLarge U.S. tech companies have warned that such a tax could harm global business while the U.S. Treasury voiced its opposition to proposals that single out the sector. Some EU countries, too, cautioned that such initiatives should be taken at a global level and that the move could further strain trans-Atlantic ties.\n\n\"There's no point in Europe imposing a tax on itself that may only hand an advantage to countries that aren't in the EU or that are leaving the EU,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said before the summit, adding that the proposed rules target U.S. companies and would \"no doubt result in a reaction from the U.S.\" The tax should be dealt with at a more global level at the Group of 20 or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, he said.\n\nThe proposed levy represents an interim solution, according to the commission. Any skepticism, even by a small number of countries, could have significant implications since tax rules need the unanimous approval of all 28 EU countries before they can become law.\n\nFrance, Germany, Spain and Italy strongly support the initiative, according to a French official, who acknowledged that it would be complicated, but not impossible, to get unanimous support. Some countries including the Netherlands didn't support the intermediary nature of the proposal, according to the official, who asked not to be named because the talks are ongoing.\n\nThe tax would affect companies with global sales exceeding 750 million euros and total taxable annual revenue from digital services in the EU of more than 50 million euros. Digital firms in the bloc have an average effective tax rate of 9.5 percent, almost half that of traditional businesses, according to the commission.\n\nThe proposal comes amid renewed interest in technology companies, which are struggling to contain the fallout from a data security scandal that has raised the risk of a regulatory crackdown and sent their stocks plunging. At the summit, EU leaders warned Facebook that they take data security very seriously and that they expect it to respect national and European legislation. While no concrete action was taken, they promised to revisit the issue.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the leaders discussion confirmed their desire to work further for an effective and fair solution and said they would revisit the issue in June.",

                "body": "Deal to build civilian reactors could benefit U.S. compmanies\n\nA U.S. failure to build civilian nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia in order to discourage the kingdom from enriching uranium for purposes other than power generation may allow countries that lack nuclear proliferation standards to step in, Energy Secretary Rick Perry told lawmakers.\n\nPerry, testifying Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, was asked about reports the U.S. is considering a nuclear technology-sharing agreement that wouldn't prohibit the Saudis from enriching nuclear fuel into weapons-grade materials.\n\n\"I think its really important to look at each of these agreements not in a vacuum,\" Perry said, without confirming whether the U.S. was considering such a deal. \"I always remind people that the alternative is no good -- if Russia, China are who is going to be chosen to do the civil nuclear projects in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, there will be no oversight.\"\n\nEager to extend a lifeline to Westinghouse Electric Co., Exelon Corp. and other U.S. companies hurt by a domestic downturn in nuclear power plant construction, the Trump administration is currently in negotiations with the Saudi government as it seeks to build as many as 16 new reactors in the kingdom. Bloomberg first reported the White House was considering an agreement that lacked the so-called \"gold standard\" agreed to by the United Arab Emirates, prohibiting the enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear fuel and waste.\n\nRead a QuickTake on why oil-rich Saudi Arabia is turning to nuclear power\n\nSuch a deal has been criticized by influential lawmakers and nuclear proliferation experts, and recent remarks by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that the kingdom would develop a nuclear weapon if Iran did has further set off alarm bells.\n\n\"I think the proliferation dangers are so great that we should be able to wield all of the influence we have which goes way beyond just this one transaction to insist that same standards we applied to the Emirates,\" said Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on panel, who noted that he \"and many others\" would oppose a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia that allows enrichment of uranium. \"There should be no difference.\"\n\nPerry told senators that a U.S. deal with the Saudis would not only involve American workers and technology but also provide oversight by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nIn testimony before a House Armed Services panel Wednesday, Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, said the Saudis were unlikely to buy reactors from Russia because of the country's closeness with Iran, and that export reactors made by China and France have yet to operate and are behind schedule and over budget where they are being built.\n\nInstead, Sokolski said, reactors made by South Korea are most likely to win the bid, but since they contain American technical content, Korean officials believe they cannot export it to the kingdom unless the Saudis reach a cooperation agreement with the U.S.\n\n\"Washington has serious leverage over Seoul and what nonproliferation conditions it might chose to place on its Middle Eastern nuclear exports,\" Sokolski said in his written testimony. \"It would be remarkable if our government chose not to use this leverage.\"",

                "body": "Boeing Co. is heading for its biggest monthly decline in two years as U.S.-China tensions over tariffs threaten a wider trade war that would stifle demand for its airliners.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's plan for sweeping duties against China heightens uncertainty for Boeing, which is poised to generate a torrent of cash from a record commercial backlog. The Chicago-based planemaker would suffer if a trade war spills over into the global economy and hurts air-travel growth.\n\n\"There is a real element of unknown around this,\" said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. \"There is no way to spin this as positive. The question is whether this is a bigger issue potentially, or a minor speed bump.\"\n\nThe risk of broader economic fallout has knocked Boeing from its spot atop the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a perch it enjoyed last year and all the way through February. The shares were already under pressure in recent weeks as some investors locked in profits while others worried that rising strains on suppliers would endanger Boeing's plan to speed output of the 737, its biggest source of profit.\n\nBoeing fell 5.2 percent to $319.61 at the close in New York, bringing its decline in March to nearly 12 percent. That's the biggest drop on the Dow during the period, and erases the stock's late-February surge to a record $364.64.\n\nChief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg has said that the aerospace business's traditional boom-and-bust cycles have been muted as enormous travel demand in China and Southeast Asia acts as a counterbalance to European and North American trends.\n\nYet the current unprecedented growth spurt for the industry still isn't enough to tamp down worries among some investors of a trade-related recession.\n\n\"Our fear on a recession is that it could potentially come from a trade war triggered by U.S. tariffs,\" Douglas Harned, an analyst at Bernstein, said in a March 16 report. He deemed the risk greater to Boeing than tit-for-tat retaliation by China against Trump.\n\nChina is expected to take about 20 percent of commercial jets built by Boeing and Airbus SE as the nation's airlines grow rapidly to connect passengers to the 35 new major airports built between 2012 and 2017, he said. With both planemakers sold out of their narrow-body jets through the early 2020s, there is little risk of China canceling its Boeing orders because Airbus wouldn't be able to shoulder the load alone.\n\n\"We are not particularly concerned about Chinese retaliation against Boeing, because China needs the airplanes and Airbus is already stretched on capacity,\" he said. \"We could see a one-time long-term order move to Airbus as a message to the U.S., but we would not attach much significance to it as we expect balance over the long term.\"",

He sent similar demand letters to two banks -- City National and First Republic -- asking they preserve documents connected to the transaction.\n\nAvenatti also enclosed an email showing Trump attorney Michael Cohen used his Trump Organization email address in correspondence with a representative from First Republic. In the e-mail, the representative said funds had been deposited in Cohen's account.\n\nCohen has denied there was ever an affair and said he paid the $130,000 out of his pocket. He has said neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Clifford and he was not reimbursed for the payment.\n\n\"We intend on using all legal means at our disposal to uncover the truth about the cover-up and what happened,\" Avenatti said Thursday. \"When we are done, the truth will be laid bare for the American people.\"\n\nClifford filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles earlier this month seeking to invalidate the agreement so she could \"set the record straight\" and discuss her alleged relationship with Trump, which she said began in 2006 and continued for about a year. The lawsuit said their relationship included encounters in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and Beverly Hills, California. Trump married his current wife, Melania Trump, in 2005, and their son, Barron, was born in 2006.\n\nClifford has also offered to repay $130,000 she was paid for agreeing not to discuss the relationship and argued in court documents that the agreement is legally invalid because it was only signed by Clifford and Cohen, but was not signed by Trump.\n\nThe letter also charged that Cohen \"attempted to interfere\" with Clifford's ability to hire Avenatti as her attorney, but provided no additional details. Avenatti also noted in his letter on Thursday that Jill Martin, another Trump Organization attorney, had initiated an arbitration proceeding in Clifford's case, which the company said did in her \"individual capacity.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Trump Organization and City National Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

                "body": "New York (AP) -- CNN chief Jeff Zucker sharply attacked the network's rivals at Fox News Channel on Thursday, saying that it has become a propaganda machine that is \"doing an incredible disservice to the country.\"\n\nZucker spoke at the Financial Times Future of News conference two days after a former Fox military analyst quit, claiming he was ashamed at the way the network's opinion hosts were backing President Donald Trump. Zucker said that analyst, Ralph Peters, voiced what a lot of people have been thinking about Fox in the post-Roger Ailes era.\n\n\"What has happened to that network in the last 18 months, especially the last year, is that it has just turned itself into state-run TV,\" Zucker said. \"TASS has nothing on them,\" he said in reference to the Russian news agency.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from a Fox representative.\n\nFox has maintained its ratings lead with a prime-time opinion lineup led by Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. Together with MSNBC's left-leaning lineup, the two political talk networks are frequently the most popular destinations for viewers on cable television. Fox and MSNBC have been widening their lead in prime time over CNN, which recently announced that Chris Cuomo would join its prime-time lineup.\n\nZucker said that Fox has \"a handful of good journalists but they get lost in the propaganda machine.\"\n\n\"The idea that they are a news channel is really not accurate at all,\" he said.\n\nZucker's network has been on the receiving end of withering criticism from Trump during his presidency. He's repeatedly referred to CNN as \"fake news\" when he doesn't like its coverage. Zucker said Trump's criticisms are not going to stop CNN from doing its job of holding leaders accountable.\n\nBut he said the Trump has created an atmosphere of hostility toward reporters that has spread from the U.S. across the world.\n\n\"He doesn't even understand the danger he is creating for journalists and the danger he is creating for news organizations,\" Zucker said.\n\nHowever, he said the Trump administration has helped news organizations raise their games to cover what is going on.\n\n\"He has made American journalism great again,\" Zucker said.",

A cabinet reshuffle is due to start in the first week of April, as ministers who intend to run in the elections have to quit by April 7.\n\nOver the past few months, Meirelles has been testing the waters ahead of a possible presidential bid. Under his watch, Brazil's economy has gradually returned to growth, although unemployment remains stubbornly high. He has only around 1 percent of voter intentions, polls show.\n\nPresident Michel Temer said earlier on Thursday that he too is considering a presidential bid.",

                "body": "Washington (AP) -- He came, he saw, he got fired on Twitter. And now Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said farewell, with a parting plea Thursday to America's diplomats not to let anyone violate their integrity.\n\nTillerson did not mention his erstwhile boss, President Donald Trump, as he spoke to several hundred State Department workers who gathered at headquarters in Foggy Bottom to watch him depart. Nor did he directly address the icy manner in which he was terminated last week after one of the shortest stints by a secretary of state in recent history.\n\n\"This can be a very mean-spirited town,\" Tillerson said, eliciting laughter at first and then applause. \"But you don't have to choose to participate in that.\"\n\nWhen he arrived in the nation's capital last year, Tillerson made no secret of his unwillingness to play the Washington-style games that turn governing into blood sport: one-upmanship, aggressive public posturing, surreptitious leaking and even sabotage. Weeks into his tenure, the Texas oilman famously declared he wasn't big on press access, explaining, \"I personally don't need it.\"\n\nOthers in Trump's administration didn't see it the same way, and Tillerson quickly found himself on the receiving end of negative reports, leaks from his rivals and mounting speculation about his future until being abruptly fired last week, four hours after returning from Africa. Often at odds with the White House, he also lost the confidence and support of many of the State Department's 75,000 workers over his moves to cut the budget, leave key leadership positions vacant and downplay human rights and democracy-promotion as diplomatic priorities.\n\nStill, there was sustained applause for several minutes as he departed the marbled lobby of the Harry S. Truman Building, the same lobby where the former Exxon Mobil CEO introduced himself as \"the new guy\" in his hallmark Texas drawl 14 months ago. A few former staffers whose tenures were even shorter than Tillerson's also returned to see him off.\n\nThen Tillerson set off for his home in Texas -- \"a more familiar climate,\" Deputy Secretary John Sullivan joked, \"which I know suits him well.\" If the Senate agrees, he will soon be replaced by current CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who frequently bumped heads with Tillerson over Iran and other issues.\n\n\"Never lose sight of your most valuable asset, the most valuable asset you possess: your personal integrity,\" Tillerson says. \"Only you can relinquish it or allow it to be compromised. Once you've done so, it is very, very hard to regain it. So guard it as the most precious thing you possess.\"",

                "title": "If Russia Is Blackmailing Trump, Tell Investigators, Not MSNBC",
                "body": "The former CIA chief's insinuations on cable news play right into the president's hands.\n\nFor a few hours on Wednesday, America's worst fears about Donald Trump seemed to be confirmed: Someone who ought to know implied that the president was being blackmailed by Russia. Former CIA director John Brennan, who was in his post right up until Trump's inauguration, told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" panel that he thinks Trump is afraid of Russian president Vladimir Putin. \"The fact that he has had this fawning attitude towards Mr. Putin and has not said anything negative about him, it continues to say something to me that he has something to fear and something serious to fear,\" Brennan said.\n\nYes, this has been whispered by Democrats and implied by some in the media since the final weeks of the 2016 election. Hillary Clinton famously called Trump a Russian puppet. The opposition research dossier paid for by her campaign compiled these allegations from assorted Russian sources of the former British spy Christopher Steele. That Trump is owned by Putin has been a running punch line on late-night comedy shows.\n\nBut on Wednesday it was no joke. When pressed if he believed the Russians had something on Trump, Brennan answered, \"I believe the Russians would opt for things to do if they believed if it was in their interest and the Russians I think have had long experience with Mr. Trump and may have things they could expose.\" Was this blackmail material personal, Brennan was asked? \"Perhaps, perhaps,\" he responded.\n\nTrump's critics, understandably, jumped all over this. And Brennan is correct that Trump's sycophancy towards Putin is bizarre and troubling. Trump invites lurid speculation about Russian blackmail when he congratulates Putin on winning a faux election a few days after America's closest ally (not to mention the U.S. State Department) accused Russia of deploying a deadly nerve agent in an attempted assassination on British soil.\n\nBut Brennan is not just some talking head. He is a former CIA director who continues to have access to classified information. If the agency had reason to believe the incoming president in 2017 was vulnerable to Russian blackmail, Brennan would know it.\n\nThis is of course why Brennan's remarks got so much attention. He later clarified that was a false alarm. Thanks to good reporting from Matthew Rosenberg of the New York Times, we learned that Brennan was just speculating like the rest of us. \"I do not know if the Russians have something on Donald Trump that they could use as blackmail,\" he told the Times in a written statement.\n\nNow, a savvy reader might say that Brennan has to say that. Any evidence he may have seen as CIA director on this most sensitive of questions would still be highly classified. Brennan would be disclosing state secrets and breaking the law if he were to speak about this matter directly. Call it patriotic innuendo.\n\nBut this assumes that Brennan has no other way of getting this vital information to the people who most need it. Thankfully \"Morning Joe\" is not the only avenue open for those who may know the executive branch to be compromised. There is also an ongoing investigation now through which special counsel Robert Mueller will examine all of this. Why would Brennan insinuate publicly and tip off the president about what the CIA may or may not have?\n\nWhat's more, Brennan's speculations about blackmail are coming more than a year into Trump's presidency. This is after Trump's government has taken a much harder line on Russia than the president on everything from providing anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to enforcing the sanctions against Russians suspected in the detention and murder of Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who exposed the largest tax fraud in modern Russian history.\n\nA better explanation for Brennan's behavior is that he is now a part of the resistance. He is using his position as a former CIA director to wage a political war against the president. That's his right as a U.S. citizen. And Brennan has good reasons to oppose Trump. Angry over the leak of the opposition research dossier before he took office, the president compared the intelligence community to the Nazis. Trump has denigrated the work of the agency that Brennan headed on the vital assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election. .\n\nThat said, the former spy chief is also playing a dangerous game. It's bad enough that Trump is politicizing the intelligence community and eroding the public trust necessary for its institutions to function. Similarly, when Brennan uses his authority as a former CIA director to launch flimsy attacks on the president's legitimacy, he validates Trump's claim that the intelligence agencies are biased against him.\n\nSixty years ago, defenders of Senator Joe McCarthy excused his patriotic innuendo. The cause of opposing communist infiltration was too important to get hung up on proving some his public accusations. As we all know, of course, it backfired. In the end McCarthy tarnished his cause by alleging secret knowledge to impugn the loyalty of his targets. Brennan would do well to study this period. He may think he is standing up to a compromised president, but his public speculations only undermine the agencies he is trying to defend.",

                "body": "El máximo ejecutivo de Facebook Inc., Mark Zuckerberg, rompió el silencio sobre la crisis por el acceso de la firma de asesoría política Cambridge Analytica a los datos de usuario de la red social, esbozando los pasos concretos que la compañía está tomando para asegurar que no vuelva a suceder una filtración de este tipo. Los críticos no quedaron impresionados.\n\nEl multimillonario finalmente habló en una serie de entrevistas a los medios y en un blog, prometiendo determinar hasta qué punto las \"aplicaciones deshonestas\" están recolectando datos confidenciales en la red social. Zuckerberg dijo a CNN que Facebook informaría a cada uno de sus más de 2.000 millones de usuarios que puedan haber visto comprometidos sus datos personales.\n\n\"He estado trabajando para comprender exactamente qué sucedió y cómo asegurarme de que esto no vuelva a suceder\", escribió Zuckerberg en una publicación en su página de perfil de Facebook. \"Les prometo que trabajaremos en esto y crearemos un mejor servicio a largo plazo\".\n\nAl comprometerse a investigar si Cambridge Analytica aún conserva la información que obtuvo de una tercera compañía creadora de aplicaciones además de ampliar la investigación a otros desarrolladores que puedan haber incumplido las reglas de Facebook, Zuckerberg dio un paso en la dirección correcta, según legisladores, inversores y usuarios. Pero no fue suficiente para terminar con las críticas; algunos siguen escépticos en cuanto a que la compañía esté haciendo lo suficiente.\n\nLos legisladores todavía quieren que Zuckerberg testifique\n\n\"Esto no va a ser suficiente\", dijo David Cicilline, representante estadounidense del Partido Demócrata por Rhode Island, en una publicación en Facebook en respuesta a la declaración del máximo ejecutivo. \"Mark Zuckerberg tiene que testificar ante el Congreso\".\n\nEse sentimiento tuvo eco en otros legisladores de Estados Unidos y Europa, incluida la senadora Amy Klobuchar, demócrata por Minnesota, y el senador Richard Blumenthal, demócrata de Connecticut. \"Los mea culpa no sustituyen las preguntas y respuestas bajo juramento\", dijo Blumenthal, miembro del Comité de Justicia. \"El Congreso no ha logrado responsabilizar a Facebook y legislar sobre las protecciones a la privacidad, que son evidentemente necesarias\".\n\nAntonio Tajani, el presidente del Parlamento Europeo, dijo en Twitter que muchas preguntas siguen sin respuesta. \"Espero con interés que entregue más explicaciones ante los representantes electos de más de 500 millones de ciudadanos europeos\", dijo.\n\nLa ministra de Justicia alemana, Katarina Barley, dijo en una entrevista al diario alemán Funke-Mediengruppe que pedirá a ejecutivos de Facebook que proporcionen una explicación en persona. En declaraciones a los medios británicos, Matt Hancock, importante legislador del Reino Unido, dijo: \"no debería ser una empresa la que decida cuál es el equilibrio apropiado entre privacidad e innovación. Las grandes compañías tecnológicas deben acatar la ley y estamos fortaleciendo la ley\".\n\nEl miércoles temprano en Washington, ejecutivos de Facebook se reunieron en privado y durante casi dos horas con miembros del Comité de Energía y Comercio de la Cámara de Representantes de ambos lados del espectro político, según dos personas que asistieron a la reunión. Una pregunta clave era si podría haber otros, incluidos otros \"malos actores\", que podrían haber tenido acceso a los mismos datos que Cambridge Analytica obtuvo de más de 50 millones de perfiles de Facebook. Los empleados, hablando a condición de que no sean identificados, dijeron que los ejecutivos de Facebook reconocieron que la compañía no sabe qué tan ampliamente difundida podría estar esa información ni cuántas copias se hicieron.\n\nEn entrevistas el miércoles, Zuckerberg dijo que estaba \"abierto\" a testificar ante el Congreso, si es la persona adecuada para proporcionar la información que los legisladores necesitan. Pero no llegó a comprometer su comparecencia.\n\nLas acciones en Facebook llegaron a caer un 2,3 por ciento durante las operaciones previas a la apertura del mercado a las 7:04 a.m. en Nueva York, extendiendo la caída de esta semana a poco más del 10 por ciento. A las 13:23 perdían 1,6 por ciento.\n\nZuckerberg no vio el panorama general\n\nLas soluciones de Zuckerberg se centraron exclusivamente en los desarrolladores externos que han accedido a los datos de los usuarios de Facebook a través de herramientas de inicio de sesión. \"No reconocen que tienen problemas sistémicos\", dijo en una entrevista Brian Wieser, analista de Pivotal Research. \"Estos son solo los problemas que conocemos, pero tienen problemas continuos para administrar diferentes partes de su negocio\".\n\nLa compañía ideó pasos para resolver los problemas de los desarrolladores, pero \"para obtener el máximo reconocimiento del público y del mercado, debería haber un mayor énfasis en por qué ocurrió en primer lugar\", dijo James Cakmak, analista de Monness Crespi Hardt. & Co.\n\nEl máximo responsable de 33 años esperó varios días para responder a los informes noticiosos, incluso mientras crecía el frenesí. \"Todo el mundo está decepcionado de que él y Sheryl Sandberg no hayan salido a comentar esto de inmediato\", dijo Ivan Feinseth, director de inversiones de Tigress Financial Partners, al referirse también al director de operaciones de la compañía.\n\nPóngase en contacto con nosotros y contrate nuestro servicio Bloomberg Professional.",

                "body": "Visit comes after a deadly suicide bombing in Afghan capital\n\nA senior Afghan official said he was optimistic about reaching peace with the Taliban even as violence in the war-torn nation increases and the government appears to be losing more control of the country.\n\n\"I am much more optimistic than I was a year ago,\" Haneef Atmar, national security adviser to Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani, said Thursday in a briefing to reporters in Washington. \"The incentives that are being offered have been strengthened\" by the Trump administration's South Asia strategy, he added.\n\nAtmar was in Washington to meet National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and other U.S. officials. His visit comes a day after a suicide bomber killed 33 people and wounded dozens of others in an attack near Kabul University in the nation's capital, according to the Associated Press. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred during a holiday marking the start of the Persian New Year.\n\nAs a private citizen and a presidential candidate, Donald Trump criticized the U.S. role in Afghanistan. But in August, he authorized the Pentagon to deploy more troops to the country as part of a strategy encompassing several countries in the region, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. The move was presented as a shift away from \"nation-building,\" which Trump called a failure.\n\nRead a QuickTake Q&A on the difficulties of Trump's new strategy\n\nDuring a December visit to Bagram Air Base, the largest U.S. facility in Afghanistan, Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter that \"I believe with all my heart that Afghanistan will be free and America will be safe, and we'll WIN this fight.\"\n\nBut winning has been elusive in what has become America's longest war, started in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. Despite the Trump administration's shift in strategy, the situation on the ground in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate, with the Islamic State establishing a base in the northern part of the country and the Taliban expanding control.\n\n\"It's clearly important for the Afghan government to show appreciation for the administration's renewed commitment and to try to bolster that commitment,\" said Laurel Miller, a former acting special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan at the U.S. Department of State who now works at the RAND Corporation. \"But there's a very difficult set of facts on the ground that can't be ignored.\"\n\nEx-Afghan Leader Karzai Sees Russia as Key to Peace With Taliban\n\nThe war was already the longest in American history when the U.S. and its allies turned security over to the Afghan military in 2014. In February, Ghani offered to begin peace talks with the Taliban. The Taliban have responded to the offer with skepticism, calling on the U.S. to join the process.\n\nAtmar said the Afghan government has also reached out to Iran, Russia, China, India, Turkey and other \"key Middle Eastern actors\" on questions of counter-terrorism and peace and reconciliation. \"The success of these two strategies critically depend on these actors,\" he said.\n\nYet if carried out, that effort could complicate relations with the U.S., particularly given the Trump administration's focus on isolating Iran and the widening international criticism over Russia's behavior on issues from the 2016 U.S. election to accusations it used military-grade nerve agents to kill a former spy in the U.K.\n\nThe head of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, told a congressional committee in Washington earlier this year that Russia is attempting to limit the U.S. military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan and is causing \"friction among NATO partners.\"\n\nFormer Afghan President Hamid Karzai, however, has said he believes Russia can play a decisive role in ending the conflict.\n\n\"Russia can contribute massively to peace in Afghanistan,\" Karzai said in an interview with Bloomberg News last month.",

Aún así, no será posible evaluar el impacto en los costes hasta que el Gobierno de Estados Unidos proporcione más detalles sobre las normas impositivas para ver si países como Canadá y México quedan afectados, manifestó.\n\nSin una guerra comercial, la demanda de equipamiento agrícola podría seguir subiendo a medida que los agricultores reemplazan maquinaria vieja, dijo. En Estados Unidos, las ventas de maquinaria deberían mantenerse en los niveles actuales durante los próximos cuatro o cinco años, a falta de unas condiciones mejores de los precios, agregó.\n\nLas ventas de maquinaria en Latinoamérica podrían mantenerse sin cambios o ganar hasta un 5 por ciento este año, dijo.

La startup sí compartió resultados sobre dos encuestas electorales y datos agregados ocasionales sobre preferencias no políticas, pero dijo que también lo hace con otros socios.\n\n\"A la luz de las recientes acusaciones, hemos tomado medidas para terminar formal y completamente cualquier tipo de relación comercial con ellos\", dijo a Bloomberg el fundador y director ejecutivo de Pig.gi, Joel Phillips. \"Es obvio que si pudiéramos mirar hacia atrás y ver cómo esto iba a evolucionar, habríamos dicho 'no, es probable que estas no sean las mejores personas de las cuales recibir dinero'\".\n\nLa empresa de datos que ayudó a que el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, resultara electo está involucrada en investigaciones en varios países después de supuestamente haber obtenido los datos privados de 50 millones de usuarios de Facebook, provocando una dura reacción de consumidores de todo el mundo. El malestar se extendió a México cuando los ejecutivos de Cambridge se jactaron ante cámaras ocultas del canal británico Channel 4 de que operaban en el país.\n\nCambridge dijo a Bloomberg el verano pasado (boreal) que buscaba a un candidato presidencial mexicano a cuya campaña pudiera unirse antes de las elecciones de julio. La entonces vicepresidenta de desarrollo de negocios, Brittany Kaiser, dijo a Bloomberg que esperaba usar datos extraídos de Pig.gi para ayudar a un candidato y cliente mexicano.\n\nPero en diciembre, la ejecutiva dijo que Cambridge solo estaba administrando clientes comerciales en América Latina y que ya no buscaba clientes políticos. Kaiser, quien abandonó la firma, declinó hacer comentarios.\n\nEl debate sobre la actividad de Cambridge en México ha llegado a las páginas principales de los periódicos en un país inmerso en una elección controvertida y donde los escándalos de corrupción, acusaciones de compra de votos e informes de espionaje han sido parte del entorno desde hace mucho tiempo. Los medios locales han tratado de descubrir si la empresa de big data trabajó con partidos políticos mexicanos. Lorenzo Córdova, quien encabeza el Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE), dijo el miércoles que no tiene conocimiento de las operaciones locales de Cambridge.\n\n\"Probablemente tenían muchas ambiciones para hacer muchas cosas, pero hasta donde sé, desconozco si alguna vez se materializaron\", dijo Phillips de Pig.gi. El ejecutivo hizo hincapié en que ningún dato personal llegó a Cambridge. Los planes de la empresa de datos para desarrollar algoritmos para Pig.gi, o para adquirir información sobre los candidatos, nunca resultaron, añadió.\n\nPhillips reconoció que Cambridge todavía tiene alrededor del 1 por ciento de Pig.gi. Su hermano y cofundador Isaac dijo, sin embargo, que la aplicación había decidido dejar de publicar resultados de encuestas presidenciales en México y Colombia, después de descubrir que para hacerlo necesitaba registrarse ante los reguladores.\n\n\"No queremos involucrarnos en política\", dijo Phillips. La política \"en América Latina es potencialmente muy controvertida, muy explosiva aquí\".\n\nPóngase en contacto con nosotros y contrate nuestro servicio Bloomberg Professional.",

                "body": "The bidding war Pfizer Inc. hoped to stoke for its consumer health-care business -- which has been on the block since October -- hasn't materialized. British consumer-products maker Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, which only wanted a piece of it, on Wednesday announced it had terminated talks. GlaxoSmithKline PLC may be the only firm bidder for the unit now.\n\nThat doesn't mean Pfizer should hang onto the business in the hope conditions will improve. If Glaxo's offer is reasonable, then Pfizer should consider it. If not, then a spin-off is still very much a viable option.\n\nThe reasons for getting rid of the business remain strong.\n\nPfizer needs M&A to supplement a weak pipeline of newer and in-development drugs. And it's more likely than other big pharma firms to attempt a big consolidating deal. Any streamlining it can do, or cash it can raise, ahead of time will help. And splitting off this slower-growing business will flatter future revenue growth and profit margins.\n\nFew details are available about Glaxo's reported bid. But it may not be everything Pfizer hoped. Glaxo is constrained financially and by the fact that its consumer business is partially owned by Novartis AG. And Glaxo will almost certainly use the dearth of bidders to try to do this deal on the cheap.\n\nStill, even a weak bid could be preferable to keeping the business in limbo. A spin-off, meanwhile, is not as clean or immediately remunerative as a sale. But it's a good option that would net Pfizer both immediate return and long-term upside if it keeps a stake.\n\nPfizer's 2013 IPO of animal-health business Zoetis Inc. has been a smashing success, outperforming other U.S. spin-offs, which have themselves topped the broader market lately:\n\nSuch a track record should boost investor interest in a consumer-health spin-off. Pfizer's consumer unit generates nearly $3.5 billion in annual sales, owns blue-chip brands such as Advil, and is the fifth-largest consumer health-care business by global market share. It is more than capable of standing on its own. Liberated from Pfizer's many other priorities, it may even have a better chance of growing.\n\nIt's a buyer's market right now for consumer health-care divisions, with Merck KGaA shopping its own and potential purchasers scarce. Johnson & Johnson would have antitrust issues given its substantial overlap with Pfizer's business. Reckitt is constrained by its recent purchase of Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. The Procter & Gamble Co. is restructuring. And Sanofi is still digesting an expensive string of acquisitions. A spin-off would let Pfizer wait out adverse conditions and net an immediate return. It would also free the company from the need to continue investing in a business it doesn't want.\n\nThis process hasn't gone how Pfizer hoped. But it can still make the best of the tricky hand it was dealt.",

Centene made the business a key part of its growth strategy after years of offering private-sector versions of Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor.\n\nCentene said it's working with the state on fixing its doctor access shortage.\n\n\"We are disappointed that we have not achieved more at a faster pace,\" Marcela Hawn, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an email. \"We hold ourselves to high standards and we expect to have these issues corrected in very short order.\"\n\nCentene is also facing a lawsuit by customers, alleging the company misled customers in Washington about the number of doctors covered under its health plans. The company has said in response to the suit that its coverage is adequate.\n\nChief Executive Officer Michael Neidorff has used many of the strategies developed in its Medicaid business as Centene expands its Obamacare offerings, including limiting where its members can get care to hospitals and signing up doctors willing to accept lower reimbursement rates. While such strategies can lower patients' premiums, they can pose a challenge when people seek care if there aren't enough doctors or hospitals available.\n\nThe insurer in December had briefly been blocked by Washington regulators from selling 2018 health insurance plans. The halt was lifted when the company agreed to pay a $500,000 fine and take steps to ensure its customers have enough access to doctors and hospitals.",
