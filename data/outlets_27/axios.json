Another Beijing undergraduate called the ideology requirement \"stupid\" -- but said such classes have become more engaging, with debates and use of multimedia such as opera performances and student-made videos. State media has also touted other efforts, including rap music devoted to Marx and virtual-reality simulations of the Long March\".\n\nAs part of the massive government reorganization plan released earlier this week, China Daily writes that the party is establishing a new central leading group on education to:\n\nMy thought bubble: When I was a student in a Chinese university in the early 1990s, I remember similar complaints about the stupidity of the political study classes. But the Communist Party won't give up, and especially in the \"New Era\" under Xi in which party leadership of everything is the focus, we should expect intensifying efforts to force feed \"Xi Jinping Thought\" to students.",

To get this far, the U.K. has had to make big concessions that have upset pro-Brexiteers, namely on the rights of EU citizens coming to Britain, the rights of U.K. fishing fleets in U.K. waters and the role of the European Court of Justice. The U.K. has also ceded ground on the transitional arrangements for the 20 months after Brexit.\n\nMore important, recent talks have done nothing to break the deadlock over the future of the U.K.'s only land border with the rest of the EU, in Ireland. All parties say they want to keep the open border, which has been crucial to the 20-year peace in Northern Ireland since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBut to avoid a hard border, with border posts and passport and customs checks, either Northern Ireland or the whole of the U.K. would have to remain in the EU's Customs Union. The U.K., however, has ruled out both solutions, in a standoff that could capsize negotiations.\n\nAnd the border is just one of myriad issues -- spanning trade, financial regulations, worker restrictions and the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction -- that have yet to be addressed. To buy time, Prime Minister May could ask to extend the withdrawal date, but she would face a huge revolt from her party. She's more likely to propose a fudged deal, in which issues such as the Irish border are left to be resolved during the post-Brexit transition.\n\nThe bottom line: It's unlikely that the U.K. and European Parliaments, as well as those of the 27 remaining EU member states, will continue to accept May's procrastination. Negotiations have progressed thus far by kicking key issues down the road, but the road is fast running out.",

But beyond the numbers of Series C shares is that many LPs in Series A and B funds have been sitting on inflated paper valuations for more than four years (since general protocol is to mark to the most recent primary round).

Moreover, many employees have had inflated expectations of their own (no matter what 409a valuation is tied to their shares).\n\nBottom line: The long-hold unicorn trend can have investment consequences beyond the calculator's +/- function.",

Aggressive investments in higher education (such as the GI Bill), strong unions and ambitious scientific research helped workers innovate, adjust and prosper within the new global economy, which further fueled American global leadership.\n\nUnfortunately, this cycle has broken down. While trade and global engagement still make the U.S. wealthier as a whole, incomes have stagnated for most Americans as workers' leverage declined alongside union membership. Alliances, international organizations and trade deals have continued to secure world order, but the material benefits increasingly accrue only to a wealthy few, an imbalance that will not be helped by our education system's failure to meet global market demands.\n\nThe bottom line: International engagement paid off for Americans because our leaders made it pay off. As policymakers stepped away from their commitment to building workers' human capital and leverage with employers, the competitiveness of America's middle class declined. Any plan to resuscitate U.S. global leadership will thus require a return to internationalism's populist beginnings.",

This is about personal chemistry.\n\nLast week's WaPo story accelerated the end for McMaster, according to a source familiar. McMaster knew he was a dead man walking and didn't think there was much point sticking around for four months until the summer. But the timing -- and the decision of John Bolton -- took some senior officials by surprise. Trump met with Bolton at 3pm today and senior officials believe he made his final decision in the room. Trump informed McMaster of his decision in a \"cordial and respectful\" phone call after his Bolton meeting, according to the source. Key senior staff learned of the decision shortly after 5pm.\n\nA White House official told me:\n\nBolton is a veteran of the Reagan and both Bush administrations and a prominent neoconservative. One area where he and Trump contrast sharply is the Iraq War -- Trump has called the war a \"huge mistake\" while Bolton insists it was the correct move.\n\nWhile both are outspoken opponents of the Iran nuclear deal, Bolton has gone so far as to call for Iran to be bombed. He also wrote a WSJ op-ed last month headlined, The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.\n\nThough his time in the White House was far from smooth, McMaster is leaving on better terms than his predecessor, Michael Flynn, who was fired for lying about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. and has since pleaded guilty in the Mueller probe.",

He noted multiple times that Cox worked with DOJ ahead of the case and questioned why she hadn't brought hard data on exactly how many subscribers Cox would lose if it stopped broadcasting content from Time Warner-owned Turner.\n\nEarlier in the day, both sides laid out their primary arguments as they opened their cases:\n\nAnd they sought to undermine the foundation of their opponents' cases:\n\nOur thought bubble: There are potential holes in both sides' arguments. For example, AT&T's prediction that it can charge more for advertising after the merger isn't guaranteed. And the DOJ might struggle to convince Judge Richard Leon that Google and other tech players aren't all that powerful in this space.\n\nWhat we learned: Who some of the witnesses will be. The Justice Department confirmed it will call Sling TV Group President Warren Schlichting, as well as expert Carl Shapiro, in addition to Fenwick. AT&T confirmed it will call its CEO, Randall Stephenson, and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, and its economic expert. More witnesses are expected on both sides.\n\nWhat we didn't hear: Anything about Donald Trump's dislike for CNN and stated opposition to the deal. Leon previously ruled that AT&T couldn't access documents key to arguing political interference on the Justice Department.\n\nView from the room: There were high-profile attendees in the packed courtroom for both AT&T and the DOJ.",

But then they resumed their plummet.\n\nFinancials: The LIBOR rates, which are the interest rates at which banks lend to one another, have hit their highest levels since 2008, thus hammering bank stocks.\n\nTech-lash: Facebook shares continue to fall, amid calls for increased regulation that could impact broader social media ad models. Some tech hardware companies, like Apple, also are experiencing tariff-related drops.",

While the tariffs might compel China to improve its domestic treatment of American firms, they leave most of China's practices unaffected. Limitations on Chinese investment in the U.S. -- if carefully scoped and adaptable to Beijing's evolving toolkit -- would do more.\n\nThe risks: As the Trump administration seeks to secure U.S. technology against China, it must avoid making three mistakes:\n\nChina is sure to take action. Beijing could retaliate by imposing tariffs on key American producers that export to China, such as U.S. aircraft makers and soybean farmers. It could also stem the flow of Chinese tourists and students to the U.S., which would inflict economic pain on major cities and universities. And in a cynical bid to portray China as more rule-abiding than the U.S., Beijing might challenge Washington in the World Trade Organization.",

Beijing, which considers Taiwan to still be a province of China, is not pleased.\n\nThe big picture: Self-governing Taiwan is where the nationalist forces who lost the Chinese civil war to Mao set up shop in 1949. As part of a deal to establish formal relations with China in 1979, the US agreed to pantomime Beijing's \"One China\" policy, while also maintaining a robust trade relationship with the island that includes more than $25 billion in arms sales since then.",

A recent study called Global Carbon Budget reached a similar conclusion, finding that global emissions from fossil fuels and industry grew by 1.5% last year.\n\nQuoted: \"The significant growth in global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 tells us that current efforts to combat climate change are far from sufficient,\" IEA head Fatih Birol said in a statement.\n\nYes, but: The report nonetheless shows how the global economy is becoming less carbon-intensive. The economy in China, by far the world's largest emitter, grew by almost 7% last year but it's emissions grew by just 1.7% \"thanks to continued renewables deployment and faster coal-to-gas switching,\" IEA said.",

McMaster knew he was a dead man walking and didn't think there was much point sticking around for four months until the summer. But the timing -- and the decision of John Bolton -- took some senior officials by surprise. Trump met with Bolton at 3pm today and senior officials believe he made his final decision in the room. Trump informed McMaster of his decision in a \"cordial and respectful\" phone call after his Bolton meeting, according to the source. Key senior staff learned of the decision shortly after 5pm.\n\nA White House official told me:\n\nBolton is a veteran of the Reagan and both Bush administrations and a prominent neoconservative. One area where he and Trump contrast sharply is the Iraq War -- Trump has called the war a \"huge mistake\" while Bolton insists it was the correct move.\n\nWhile both are outspoken opponents of the Iran nuclear deal, Bolton has gone so far as to call for Iran to be bombed. He also wrote a WSJ op-ed last month headlined, The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.\n\nThough his time in the White House was far from smooth, McMaster is leaving on better terms than his predecessor, Michael Flynn, who was fired for lying about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. and has since pleaded guilty in the Mueller probe.",

                "body": "What's happening now: Emissions rose despite the expansion of solar and wind power, and displacement of coal by natural gas and renewables in some markets.\n\nThe big picture: The agency estimates that global energy demand increased by 2.1% last year, well above by the 2016 rate, with 40% of that growth coming from China and India alone.\n\nThe context: The IEA data is the second major report to show that the multi-year hiatus in emissions increases has ended. A recent study called Global Carbon Budget reached a similar conclusion, finding that global emissions from fossil fuels and industry grew by 1.5% last year.\n\nQuoted: \"The significant growth in global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 tells us that current efforts to combat climate change are far from sufficient,\" IEA head Fatih Birol said in a statement.\n\nYes, but: The report nonetheless shows how the global economy is becoming less carbon-intensive. The economy in China, by far the world's largest emitter, grew by almost 7% last year but it's emissions grew by just 1.7% \"thanks to continued renewables deployment and faster coal-to-gas switching,\" IEA said.",

They're not used to the North Korean style,\" he says.\n\nTrump is certainly not used to the North Korean style, and a former government official who has negotiated with North Korea says beginning talks at the top level adds a host of challenges:\n\nThe official said even before Trump, negotiations with North Koreans had been driven by the personalities in the room. Now, they'll be dependent on two big personalities, in Trump and Kim.\n\nWalsh says in his experience, conversations with the North Koreans are nothing like the bombastic statements that come out of North Korean state media.\n\nThese talks, assuming they go ahead, will be unlike any that came before them -- and skipping the lower echelons makes things less predictable:",

But they're warming to the idea of using it as leverage to put pressure on web and social media firms in specific cases.\n\nYes, but: Republicans drive the legislative agenda, and they remain wary of attempts to create blanket regulations for social media, including increasing their legal liability. \"They have an intermediary defense, that gets back to the discussion of what exactly are they,\" said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) \"It's not impossible for us to decide what, if anything, we want to do, but it certainly is more likely to get a better result if Facebook and the other social media companies will come to the table and work with us and talk frankly about the problem.\"\n\nThe gritty details: The Senate voted Wednesday to send the anti-trafficking bill to Trump's desk. That legislation says platforms will be liable if they knowingly facilitate sex-trafficking through content they host.\n\nComments from lawmakers indicate the result could be somewhere in the middle and targeted at specific issues. Outstanding concerns among lawmakers about platforms include:\n\nThe bottom line: These are not trivial threats for social media companies, who are trying to balance the need to better monitor content with free speech on their platforms.",

Dimon's compensation is calculated as $28.3 million when using the estimated fair value of his stock. But that compensation figure doesn't matter as much because it doesn't reflect what executives report in their personal income tax filings.\n\nWhy it matters: It's the highest pay package of any active corporate CEO from 2017, based on Securities and Exchange Commission documents that have been filed thus far. Dimon's compensation is also 1,818 times higher than what the average JPMorgan employee makes.",

John McCain, who said a U.S. president shouldn't be \"congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.\" And it was reported on Tuesday night that Trump's aides had explicitly warned him against congratulating Putin, writing \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE\" in his briefing materials.",

But the U.S. may vie to restrict the kingdom's uranium enrichment rights, under terms similar to the Iran deal's, which would would be a hard bargain to strike. While the U.S. needs to sell contracts to revitalize its nuclear industry, the Saudis can turn to other nations if the U.S. is unwilling to pursue an equitable arrangement.\n\nThe crown prince also faces headwinds from Congress on the Yemeni war, although the vote today to restrict U.S. aid to the Saudi-led coalition was voted down in Congress. Despite claims to the contrary, he will argue that withdrawing already-modest U.S. aid to the Saudi-led coalition, especially intelligence-sharing, will only exacerbate Yemen's humanitarian crisis, while doing nothing to end what Riyadh sees as a war of necessity to prevent Iran from advancing on the kingdom's southern border.\n\nThe bottom line: Prince Mohammed and Trump see eye to eye on many key issues, like containing Iran, but Trump is unlikely to make much progress on U.S. objectives, especially ending the Qatar embargo and furthering an Israel-Palestine peace plan (which the crown prince warned would be impossible",

Russia has exacerbated the situation by allowing Turkey's jihadist proxies to enter the city of Afrin in northern Syria, where they have threatened Kurds with beheading and committed other atrocities. Since Russia has bases in Afrin and controls the air space, nothing happens in the area without its acquiescence.\n\nWhat's next: Britain, France and other countries sympathetic to the Syrian people should call on the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to investigate criminal liability on the parts of Russia, Syria and Turkey. There are ways to work around Russia's obstruction, including the Arria formula -- named after Venezuelan diplomat Diego Arria -- which allows a UNSC member to convene a meeting in an adjoining chamber when the Council is unwilling or unable to do so.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump refuses to criticize Vladimir Putin and ignores human rights issues. Absent U.S. moral leadership, other countries should take the lead to strengthen the international system and restore ethics in international affairs.",

But the genuine popular support Putin enjoys should not be underestimated.\n\nIn some respects the race was even more unfair than usual. In past elections, approximately 25% of private sector workers and 38% of state sector workers experienced some form of political pressure from their employers to vote. The mobilization effort was far greater this time around. Putin also ran against a slate of historically weak candidates, even by Russian standards. Perhaps most important, the only serious opponent, Alexei Navalny, was banned from running.\n\nEven as Russia faces serious economic and social problems, voters were not all frog-marched to the polls: Putin remains authentically popular. Economic stabilization, Crimea's annexation and Russia's resurgence on the global stage have all generated a level of widespread support for Putin that was reflected in the vote totals. And while his approval fell sharply in big cities before the election, it would be a mistake to ignore these trends in Russian society.\n\nPerhaps most intriguing, a mysterious last-minute increase in registered voters gave Putin just over 50% of the vote. Of course, this means that 48% of registered voters either did not turn out despite the massive mobilization or voted for other candidates. Whether they stayed home out of apathy or in protest is uncertain.\n\nThe bottom line: While there's no question that Putin's reelection was engineered, his political dominance is propped up by real support as well.",

And yes, the energy has flipped from Republicans to Democrats on health care, and health care will be a rallying cry for Democrats in upcoming races. But that doesn't mean it's the only issue that matters.\n\nOur own polling shows that health care is among the top issues that registered voters want 2018 candidates to talk about. But other issues like the economy and jobs and immigration are high on voters' minds as well.\n\nIn interpreting the PPP poll, some have combined the \"very important\" responses with the \"most important\" responses. When you do that, more than 50% of voters say health care was important to their vote. That sounds impressive, but the same is true for many other issues, including the economy and jobs, immigration, North Korea, and some others.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\nThe bottom line: As the head of a leading health policy organization, of course I always root for health care to be as important as possible. But we cannot be sure that it was the top issue in Lamb's victory, or that it will be one in the coming elections, which will turn not just on issues but on other factors -- including the public's views of President Trump.\n\nAnd how important health care is will depend on how much, and how effectively, candidates campaign on the issue.",

These Rise of the Rest bus tours recently led to the creation of the Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, a $150 million fund to invest in startups outside of Silicon Valley.\n\nAnd JPMorgan Chase has committed $150 million to revitalize Detroit and $40 million to create opportunity on Chicago's South and West sides.\n\nWe need more business and civic leaders to join us in promoting policies to unleash America's full potential. Policies that incentivize investment in underserved communities, including ideas similar to Opportunity Zones in the new tax reform law, can encourage support for parts of America that continue to struggle with poverty and job growth.\n\nBy the numbers: In the past 10 years, the number of high-growth tech startups surged 47 percent and account for 1.5 million jobs [ITIF]. The number of businesses owned by women of color has increased 322 percent, representing more than 1.5 million firms, and an increase of 1-3 jobs per small business could alleviate all inner-city unemployment [State of Women in Business, ICIC].\n\nBut, but, but: More than 75 percent of all venture capital still goes to just three states, California, New York and Massachusetts [NVCA], and women of color receive less than 1 percent of all venture investment [#ProjectDiane].\n\nSilicon Valley has helped create enormous opportunities and innovations, in which America should continue to invest. But we also need to invest in places like Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis, Baltimore, and Atlanta. We need to support the entrepreneurs outside of coastal tech hubs who are starting and scaling the great businesses -- and job creators -- of tomorrow.\n\nBottom Line: Economic growth can't come at the expense of those who struggle to attract capital because of where they live or what they look like. By investing in underserved entrepreneurs, we can create inclusive growth that benefits everyone and ensures all communities are part of America's future.\n\nJamie Dimon is the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase.

But the U.S. may vie to restrict the kingdom's uranium enrichment rights, under terms similar to the Iran deal's, which would would be a hard bargain to strike. While the U.S. needs to sell contracts to revitalize its nuclear industry, the Saudis can turn to other nations if the U.S. is unwilling to pursue an equitable arrangement.\n\nThe crown prince also faces headwinds from Congress on the Yemeni war, although the vote today to restrict U.S. aid to the Saudi-led coalition was voted down in Congress. Despite claims to the contrary, he will argue that withdrawing already-modest U.S. aid to the Saudi-led coalition, especially intelligence-sharing, will only exacerbate Yemen's humanitarian crisis, while doing nothing to end what Riyadh sees as a war of necessity to prevent Iran from advancing on the kingdom's southern border.\n\nThe bottom line: Prince Mohammed and Trump see eye to eye on many key issues, like containing Iran, but Trump is unlikely to make much progress on U.S. objectives, especially ending the Qatar embargo and furthering an Israel-Palestine peace plan (which the crown prince warned would be impossible if the Embassy were moved to Jerusalem).",

According to current and former U.S. intelligence officials, the operation was focused on ISIS and al-Qaeda.\n\nWhat happened: Kaspersky announced a malware campaign called \"Slingshot,\" an advanced, persistent threat, indicating it may have state-backing, earlier this month. They said the malware was on thousands of devices in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, Turkey, and Yemen. Current and former U.S. intel officials told CyberScoop that Slingshot is a program that is run through the Pentagon's Special Operations Command.",

After the call, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked whether Trump felt the election had been free and fair, and said it wasn't up to the U.S. to \"dictate\" how Russia holds elections.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump is not alone in congratulating Putin -- leaders in France, Germany and elsewhere have done so this week, as Barack Obama did in 2012. But past administrations certainly have seen it as America's role to call balls and strikes when it comes to elections abroad, and weigh in when democratic institutions are being undermined. A departure from that approach would be welcomed not only by Putin, but other leaders of pseudo democracies around the world.",

While being secretly recorded by an undercover reporter, Nix and other CA executives discussed how they acted as a conduit between the Trump campaign and outside super PACs -- which is illegal under U.S. election law.",

These Rise of the Rest bus tours recently led to the creation of the Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, a $150 million fund to invest in startups outside of Silicon Valley.\n\nAnd JPMorgan Chase has committed $150 million to revitalize Detroit and $40 million to create opportunity on Chicago's South and West sides.\n\nWe need more business and civic leaders to join us in promoting policies to unleash America's full potential. Policies that incentivize investment in underserved communities, including ideas similar to Opportunity Zones in the new tax reform law, can encourage support for parts of America that continue to struggle with poverty and job growth.\n\nBy the numbers: In the past 10 years, the number of high-growth tech startups surged 47 percent and account for 1.5 million jobs [ITIF]. The number of businesses owned by women of color has increased 322 percent, representing more than 1.5 million firms, and an increase of 1-3 jobs per small business could alleviate all inner-city unemployment [State of Women in Business, ICIC].\n\nBut, but, but: More than 75 percent of all venture capital still goes to just three states, California, New York and Massachusetts [NVCA], and women of color receive less than 1 percent of all venture investment [#ProjectDiane].\n\nSilicon Valley has helped create enormous opportunities and innovations, in which America should continue to invest. But we also need to invest in places like Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis, Baltimore, and Atlanta. We need to support the entrepreneurs outside of coastal tech hubs who are starting and scaling the great businesses -- and job creators -- of tomorrow.\n\nBottom Line: Economic growth can't come at the expense of those who struggle to attract capital because of where they live or what they look like. By investing in underserved entrepreneurs, we can create inclusive growth that benefits everyone and ensures all communities are part of America's future.\n\nJamie Dimon is the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Steve Case is the Chairman and CEO of Revolution, Chairman of Case Foundation and Co-Founder of America Online.",

According to the European diplomat the U.S. team stressed that they are planning to continue negotiating until May 12th.",

                "body": "Why it matters: While these reforms have found support in the U.S., other Saudi initiatives, such as its involvement in the Yemeni Civil War, face serious pushback, especially from Congress.\n\nTop policy areas the crown prince's trip will address:\n\n1) Countering Iran: The Trump White House has taken a more aggressive rhetorical posture toward Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional adversary, than past administrations. As Trump continues to express his frustration with the Iran deal, Prince Mohammed may push for a more proactive effort by the U.S. to roll back Iran's influence.\n\n2) War in Yemen: Congress remains concerned about Saudi involvement in the devastating humanitarian toll of the Yemeni Civil War, which has resulted in nearly 15,000 civilian deaths, massive internal displacement, famine and a cholera outbreak. Despite a Saudi aid package rolled out early this year, Congress is considering two bills that would limit U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition, which could become a source of tension during the visit.\n\n3) Saudi nuclear energy: In a second likely source of friction with Congress, the Trump administration is hoping to sell nuclear reactors to the Saudis in a multibillion-dollar deal. But terms of that sale would be contentious: Nonproliferation proponents want a so-called Gold Standard 123 Agreement, which would prohibit enrichment; however, the Saudis view enrichment as their sovereign right, particularly in light of the Iran deal and the fact that only two of the 23 extant 123 agreements meet the gold standard.\n\n4) Vision 2030: Prince Mohammed plans to introduce reforms that will alter the traditional social contract between Saudi citizens and the state. His visits outside Washington will likely be geared toward investment, especially the question of where it will make the first stock offering of Aramco, the national oil company. But while regulators in the U.K. appeared eager to woo the crown prince to attract the listing, their counterparts stateside do not seem as enthused. Additionally, the high-profile purge of Saudi royals and businessmen on corruption charges last November created uncertainty about the Saudi investment environment that he will likely aim to dispel.\n\n5) Gulf diplomatic crisis: Relations between Qatar and the so-called Quartet -- a bloc comprising Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt -- have been badly strained since last June. The blockade, which arose from the Quartet's charge that Qatar sponsored terrorism and threatened their own internal stability, has riven the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Trump administration hopes to hold a summit later this year to bring the diplomatic row to a close, but this is unlikely without Saudi and Emirati buy-in.\n\nThe bottom line: U.S.-Saudi relations, which became frosty under Obama, have warmed under Trump, but critical diplomatic issues leave much work ahead.",

                "title": "What to expect from Saudi crown prince's Washington visit",
                "body": "Why it matters: While these reforms have found support in the U.S., other Saudi initiatives, such as its involvement in the Yemeni Civil War, face serious pushback, especially from Congress.\n\nTop policy areas the crown prince's trip will address:\n\n1) Countering Iran: The Trump White House has taken a more aggressive rhetorical posture toward Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional adversary, than past administrations. As Trump continues to express his frustration with the Iran deal, Prince Mohammed may push for a more proactive effort by the U.S. to roll back Iran's influence.\n\n2) War in Yemen: Congress remains concerned about Saudi involvement in the devastating humanitarian toll of the Yemeni Civil War, which has resulted in nearly 15,000 civilian deaths, massive internal displacement, famine and a cholera outbreak. Despite a Saudi aid package rolled out early this year, Congress is considering two bills that would limit U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition, which could become a source of tension during the visit.\n\n3) Saudi nuclear energy: In a second likely source of friction with Congress, the Trump administration is hoping to sell nuclear reactors to the Saudis in a multibillion-dollar deal. But terms of that sale would be contentious: Nonproliferation proponents want a so-called Gold Standard 123 Agreement, which would prohibit enrichment; however, the Saudis view enrichment as their sovereign right, particularly in light of the Iran deal and the fact that only two of the 23 extant 123 agreements meet the gold standard.\n\n4) Vision 2030: Prince Mohammed plans to introduce reforms that will alter the traditional social contract between Saudi citizens and the state. His visits outside Washington will likely be geared toward investment, especially the question of where it will make the first stock offering of Aramco, the national oil company. But while regulators in the U.K. appeared eager to woo the crown prince to attract the listing, their counterparts stateside do not seem as enthused. Additionally, the high-profile purge of Saudi royals and businessmen on corruption charges last November created uncertainty about the Saudi investment environment that he will likely aim to dispel.\n\n5) Gulf diplomatic crisis: Relations between Qatar and the so-called Quartet -- a bloc comprising Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt -- have been badly strained since last June. The blockade, which arose from the Quartet's charge that Qatar sponsored terrorism and threatened their own internal stability, has riven the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Trump administration hopes to hold a summit later this year to bring the diplomatic row to a close, but this is unlikely without Saudi and Emirati buy-in.\n\nThe bottom line: U.S.-Saudi relations, which became frosty under Obama, have warmed under Trump, but critical diplomatic issues leave much work ahead.",

The CBO examined how the law affected household incomes in 2014, the first year many of its key provisions took effect.\n\nThe bottom line: At least as far as this analysis goes, the ACA helped more people than it hurt. Whether you want to call it \"redistributing wealth\" or \"reducing income inequality,\" the ACA achieved it. Or, in CBO's words, the law \"made household income more evenly distributed.\"",

He talked at length about giving some drug traffickers the death penalty; he talked about \"sanctuary cities\" and made a pitch for the border wall; and he talked up a \"just say no\" type of TV ads to discourage young people from trying drugs.

In an earnings call last month, Musk said a Tesla would do a self-driven, cross-country U.S. run by July, and that he would make the capability available to customers at an unspecified later date.\n\nSelf-driving experts are urging renewed contemplation of when fully autonomous cars go on the road. Raj Rajkumar, head of the self-driving car lab at Carnegie Mellon University, suggested that success can make some autonomous teams complacent. \"Just because the vehicle drove itself fine for the past 10 miles does not mean that it can deal with all the conditions it will encounter during the next 10 miles,\" he told Axios in an email.",

But Trump officials want to use Tuesday's event to highlight the issue and put pressure on cities that don't comply with federal immigration law enforcement.",

For starters, Judge Richard Leon wants to hear from AT&T's competitors, and the government wants to show the hypocrisy of the telecom giant's arguments.\n\nWhat they're saying: Justice Department attorney Eric Welsh argued against an attempt by AT&T to keep out of the trial earlier statements from subsidiary DirecTV opposing the Comcast-NBCU merger, arguing they were related to a different case.\n\nLeon expressed interest in another main thread of the case: whether a telecom provider like AT&T would be competing with Silicon Valley powerhouses like Google or Facebook. He indicated he wants to hear more from a Google employee who was deposed by the DoJ about the importance of Time Warner content to its YouTube TV streaming service.\n\nThe judge also made it clear he was worried about witnesses from AT&T's competitors being allowed to testify in secret and AT&T keeping certain documents confidential. He said weighing a \"case of this magnitude\" in closed court isn't consistent with the premise of a trial.\n\nWhat's next: There will be more evidentiary arguments on Tuesday. Opening arguments are scheduled for Wednesday and, according to AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli, will be attended by the chief executives of both AT&T and Time Warner.",

The rulings come amid concerns by GOP that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overstepped its authority when issuing a new congressional map.\n\nThe backdrop: The nation's high court had rejected a similar request last month to block the ordering of a new map, after the state Supreme Court gave lawmakers and Gov. Tom Wolf (D) more than three weeks to agree on one, which they failed to do.\n\nWhy it matters: Early analysis of the new districts said elections will be more competitive and it would likely put several Republican-held seats in play for Democrats. Democrats who are hoping to defeat Republican incumbents in this year's midterm elections and take control of the House.\n\nThe latest: The U.S. Supreme Court in January issued a temporary hold on ordering the state legislature to redraw its excessively partisan congressional map.\n\nThe latest: The Virginia Supreme Court is reviewing a racially-charged case regarding the 2011 redrawing of the states' House of Delegates district lines.\n\nThe latest: A federal court will hear oral arguments on March 20 that seek to toss out the current legislative and congressional maps crafted by state Republicans.",

                "body": "\"The Channel 4 News report contained conversations between Cambridge Analytica senior executives and an undercover reporter posing as a Sri Lankan businessman. The report is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.\n\nCambridge Analytica held a series of meetings with the undercover reporter to discuss philanthropic, infrastructure and political projects in Sri Lanka. While outlining the company's services as a data-driven communications and marketing agency, a senior Cambridge Analytica executive clearly set out the principles which govern its work and said the following to the undercover reporter:\n\n\"We're not in the business of fake news, we're not in the business of lying, making stuff up, and we're not in the business of entrapment... There are companies that do this but to me that crosses a line.\"\n\nDespite this clear statement, the undercover reporter later attempted to entrap Cambridge Analytica executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. After several meetings discussing ostensibly legitimate projects, the reporter unexpectedly and suddenly turned the conversation towards practices such as corruption and the entrapment of political figures.\n\nAssessing the legality and reputational risks associated with new projects is critical for us, and we routinely undertake conversations with prospective clients to try to tease out any unethical or illegal intentions. The two Cambridge Analytica executives at the meeting humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions. They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again.\n\nWe use meetings like this to make an informed decision about those whom we should or shouldn't engage with, in line with the guidance laid out by Section 9 of the UK Bribery Act 2010. The company's practice is for staff to gently de-escalate the conversation before removing themselves from the situation.\n\nHowever CEO Alexander Nix acknowledges that on this occasion he misjudged the situation:\n\n\"In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case. I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose.\n\n\"I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff. I should have recognised where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica is a high-profile company. While we work for clients from all sides of the political mainstream across many countries, some do not want it known that they are using a professional political consultancy. We understand this, and allow our clients to work with us discreetly. This is not unusual in the industry.",

These sanctions are part of U.S. efforts to punish his regime. Maduro's government launched the world's first state-issued cryptocurrency last month in hopes of boosting its plunging economy and circumventing U.S. and European financial sanctions.",

                "body": "Why it matters: The law -- called the renewable fuel standard that requires refineries to blend biofuels into gasoline -- is a textbook example of how regulations create winners, losers and unintended consequences.\n\nThe level of attention President Trump has given to this policy is remarkable given the chaos emanating from him in the West Wing. It reflects the important competing interests of corn farmers in Iowa and refiners in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"He's taking a very personal involvement in it,\" Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the most influential congressional backer of the policy, told me in an interview last week. \"When you have the president himself, you don't need to worry about the chaotic conditions at the White House.\"\n\nTrump and his top advisers have been meeting in recent months with companies that refine oil and those that produce corn ethanol, as well as their allies in Congress to find elusive middle ground over the mandate's compliance costs.\n\nGritty details:\n\n\"The last six months have been about RINs and most people have no idea what that is and why we are talking about RINs,\" said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, a coalition of ethanol companies.\n\nGrassley tweeted to Trump late last week: \"I want to shake what u might be planning abt a RINS cap for a short period. It will be CATASTROPHIC to ethanol.\"\n\nThat prompted responses on Twitter like \"How many of you even know what RIN is ? Without goggle ? [sic] LOL\" and \"What is RINS cap?\"\n\nThis arcane fight is a classic battle for market share. Corn ethanol's share of the fuel market is growing and testing some refiners' ability to comply with the mandate. Nearly every gallon of gasoline now has 10% ethanol blended into it.\n\nWhen Congress created the mandate in 2005 and expanded it in 2007, lawmakers predicted increasing gasoline demand and decreasing oil production. On both fronts, the opposite occurred: Oil production skyrocketed and demand for gasoline leveled off. Companies are fighting for their piece of a stagnant transportation fuel mix.\n\n\"It is now a battle about winners and losers,\" PBF Energy CEO Tom Nimbley told me at an energy conference in Houston earlier this month. \"It's a fight over money and market share.\"\n\nOther oil companies, ranging from giants Shell and BP to independent refiners like Andeavor, are better situated to comply with the mandate. That's either because they've had a long-standing ability to blend ethanol with gasoline or because they changed their strategy over the last decade to do so.\n\n\"Some people do long-range planning better than others,\" said Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, whose members represent all parts of the oil and refining sectors. \"That's what we call free-market competition.\"\n\nNimbley said his company hasn't been able to change its operations to blend ethanol due to infrastructure and geographical constraints.\n\n\"It's an expedient argument to say 'you just don't have the right business model,' \" Nimbley said. \"That's just not factual. That's just the hyperbole that gets into this situation.\"\n\nWhile refineries and ethanol companies battle it out over the mandate's compliance costs, the third goal Congress had in mind of combating climate change is lost in the noise. Lawmakers envisioned biofuels made from plant material that's cleaner than corn ethanol to develop. That hasn't happened.\n\nFor context:\n\n\"We had high expectations,\" said Henry Waxman, a former California Democratic congressman who helped pass the 2007 bill. \"But we are very much disappointed by the way this law has worked out.\"\n\nWhat's next: More tug-o-war. Grassley and other Republicans representing corn-producing states sent a letter to Trump Thursday requesting another meeting to talk about Cruz's proposal to cap RINs. Lawmakers are also working on legislation. That remains a long-shot because ethanol policy divides the Republican Party controlling Congress.",

The key example is cars: The European Union has a 10 percent tariff on all cars, including those manufactured in America, and China hits all foreign-made cars with 25 percent tariffs. But the U.S. only charges 2.5 percent for foreign cars we import.\n\nTrump and ascendant nationalist economic advisor Peter Navarro think this is wildly unfair. So the president wants Congress to pass a bill to let him raise tariffs to reciprocal levels, according to three sources with direct knowledge.\n\nTrump's idea would effectively break the WTO. One of the core WTO principles -- which has underpinned globalization and trade for 70 years -- is an idea called \"most favored nation status.\" Countries that belong to the WTO have all agreed to charge the same tariff rate for imports from all other WTO members.\n\nThis is probably dead-on-arrival in Congress: Most Republicans on the Hill are free-traders and nearly universally opposed to Trump's tariffs. They won't get behind this. And a source familiar with Trump's legislative affairs team's thinking says such a bill has little chance of success. Trump, however, thinks the idea is a no-brainer. He mused aloud to staff in an Oval Office meeting last week, \"Who could be against reciprocal?\"\n\nWhy it matters: Trump is just getting started on his hardline trade mission. Gary Cohn and Rob Porter were among the few in the White House who would fight for free trade policies. Once they're gone, the most influential voices on trade will be economic nationalists (with the possible exception of Larry Kudlow; we'll have to wait and see if he'll start off his tenure as chief economic advisor by going to war with the president over trade.)\n\nWhat else to watch for: Aggressive tariffs against China. As Politico first reported, when Trump's team presented him with a package of tariffs that would target the equivalent of $30 billion a year in Chinese imports, Trump told them he wanted even bigger tariffs.",

One of the core WTO principles -- which has underpinned globalization and trade for 70 years -- is an idea called \"most favored nation status.\" Countries that belong to the WTO have all agreed to charge the same tariff rate for imports from all other WTO members.\n\nThis is probably dead-on-arrival in Congress: Most Republicans on the Hill are free-traders and nearly universally opposed to Trump's tariffs. They won't get behind this. And a source familiar with Trump's legislative affairs team's thinking says such a bill has little chance of success. Trump, however, thinks the idea is a no-brainer. He mused aloud to staff in an Oval Office meeting last week, \"Who could be against reciprocal?\"\n\nWhy it matters: Trump is just getting started on his hardline trade mission. Gary Cohn and Rob Porter were among the few in the White House who would fight for free trade policies. Once they're gone, the most influential voices on trade will be economic nationalists (with the possible exception of Larry Kudlow; we'll have to wait and see if he'll start off his tenure as chief economic advisor by going to war with the president over trade.)\n\nWhat else to watch for: Aggressive tariffs against China. As Politico first reported, when Trump's team presented him with a package of tariffs that would target the equivalent of $30 billion a year in Chinese imports, Trump told them he wanted even bigger tariffs.",

Anat Agron, research fellow at the Middle East Media Research Institute, told Axios they \"totally condone women participating in jihad.\"\n\nVeryan Khan, editorial director of the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC), told Marie Claire magazine: \"There's a priority for the Islamic State to attract females because it offers stability. If you want people to see you as a nation, a legitimate state, it's important to attract females and have them start families...It's not like women are an afterthought. This is a strategic move.\"\n\nAs the New York Times has reported, some women with ties to extremist groups have been known to guilt men into fighting:\n\nIt is worth noting that women are also taking an increasingly active role in fighting extremism, with the YPJ, an all-female Kurdish force that has battled ISIS, being a particular notable example.",

A loss would keep the legal status quo, while likely raising more questions about whether it pursued a weak case because Trump hates CNN.\n\nFor AT&T: This could help AT&T compete with the likes of Amazon and Netflix by winning original content like Game of Thrones and Westworld from HBO to juice its DirecTV offerings. It also gives the combined company a path to compete with Facebook and Google in the digital advertising market.\n\nFor Trump: AT&T won't argue at trial that the DoJ is suing to block the deal for political reasons -- but the question will still loom.\n\nFor the media business: An AT&T victory would mean media companies would have a much better shot of consolidating, both vertically and horizontally.\n\nFor the advertising business: The merger will give the combined company AT&T's robust consumer data set and Time Warner's digital advertising infrastructure to create a data-driven advertising business that will try to compete with the likes of Google and Facebook, which collectively take over 60% of digital ad dollars in the U.S.\n\nFor the entertainment business: Approval could set a precedent for how telecom companies can leverage content they own for their streaming services.\n\nFor Silicon Valley: Judge Richard J. Leon will decide whether he buys AT&T's argument that competitors need to be able to scale to take on Google and Facebook. And the trial is also a test of vertical mergers, a favorite acquisition strategy of big tech companies.",
