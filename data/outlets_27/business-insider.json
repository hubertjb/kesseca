                "title": "If you think Facebook can manipulate you, virtual reality's going to be a whole new ballgame",
                "body": "It is anticipated that advertising through virtual reality will come into play as early as this year, enabling advertisers to more effectively manipulate consumers.\n\nAs Facebook users around the world are coming to understand, some of their favorite technologies can be used against them. It's not just the scandal over psychological profiling firm Cambridge Analytica getting access to data from tens of millions of Facebook profiles. People's filter bubbles are filled with carefully tailored information -- and misinformation -- altering their behavior and thinking, and even their votes.\n\nPeople, both individually and as a society at large, are wrestling to understand how their newsfeeds turned against them. They are coming to realize exactly how carefully controlled Facebook feeds are, with highly tailored ads. That set of problems, though, pales in comparison to those posed by the next technological revolution, which is already underway: virtual reality.\n\nOn one hand, virtual worlds hold almost limitless potential. VR games can treat drug addiction and maybe help solve the opioid epidemic. Prison inmates can use VR simulations to prepare for life after their release. People are racing to enter these immersive experiences, which have the potential to be more psychologically powerful than any other technology to date: The first modern equipment offering the opportunity sold out in 14 minutes.\n\nIn these new worlds, every leaf, every stone on the virtual ground and every conversation is carefully constructed. In our research into the emerging definition of ethics in virtual reality, my colleagues and I interviewed the developers and early users of virtual reality to understand what risks are coming and how we can reduce them.\n\n\"VR is a very personal, intimate situation. When you wear a VR headset ... you really believe it, it's really immersive,\" says one of the developers with whom we spoke. If someone harms you in VR, you're going to feel it, and if someone manipulates you into believing something, it's going to stick.\n\nThis immersion is what users want: \"VR is really about being immersed ... As opposed to a TV where I can constantly be distracted,\" one user told us. That immersiveness is what gives VR unprecedented power: \"really, what VR is trying to do here is duplicate reality where it tricks your mind.\"\n\nThese tricks can be enjoyable -- allowing people to fly helicopters or journey back to ancient Egypt. They can be helpful, offering pain management or treatment for psychological conditions.\n\nBut they can also be malicious. Even a common prank that friends play on each other online -- logging in and posting as each other -- can take on a whole new dimension. One VR user explains, \"Someone can put on a VR head unit and go into a virtual world assuming your identity. I think that identity theft, if VR becomes mainstream, will become rampant.\"\n\nVR will be able to collect data on a whole new level. Seemingly innocuous infrared sensors designed to help with motion sickness and alignment can capture near-perfect representations of users' real-world surroundings.\n\nFurther, the data and interactions that give VR the power to treat and diagnose physical and mental health conditions can be used to hyper-personalize experiences and information to the precise vulnerabilities of individual users.\n\nCombined, the intensity of virtual reality experiences and the even more personal data they collect present the specter of fake news that's much more powerful than text articles and memes. Rather, immersive, personalized experiences may thoroughly convince people of entirely alternate realities, to which they are perfectly susceptible. Such immersive VR advertisements are on the horizon as early as this year.\n\nA person who uses virtual reality is, often willingly, being controlled to far greater extents than were ever possible before. Everything a person sees and hears -- and perhaps even feels or smells -- is totally created by another person. That surrender brings both promise and peril. Perhaps in carefully constructed virtual worlds, people can solve problems that have eluded us in reality. But these virtual worlds will be built inside a real world that can't be ignored.\n\nWhile technologists and users are cleaning up the malicious, manipulative past, they'll need to go far beyond making social media healthier. As carefully as developers are building virtual worlds themselves, society as a whole must intentionally and painstakingly construct the culture in which these technologies exist.\n\nIn many cases, developers are the first allies in this fight. Our research found that VR developers were more concerned about their users' well-being than the users themselves. Yet, one developer admits that \"the fact of the matter is ... I can count on my fingers the number of experienced developers I've actually met.\" Even experts have only begun to explore ethics, security and privacy in virtual reality scenarios.\n\nThe developers we spoke with expressed a desire for guidelines on where to draw the boundaries, and how to prevent dangerous misuses of their platforms. As an initial step, we invited VR developers and users from nine online communities to work with us to create a set of guidelines for VR ethics. They made suggestions about inclusivity, protecting users from manipulative attackers and limits on data collection.\n\nAs the debacle with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica shows, though, people don't always follow guidelines, or even platforms' rules and policies -- and the effects could be all the worse in this new VR world. But, our initial success reaching agreement on VR guidelines serves as a reminder that people can go beyond reckoning with the technologies others create: We can work together to create beneficial technologies we want.",

The update, the constant complaints of people not being able to find me, plus the Rihanna poll...no bueno,\" Teigen wrote to her almost 10 million Twitter followers on Saturday morning.\n\nThe \"Rihanna poll\" she mentions is a reference to a huge controversy earlier this month, as Snapchat ad appeared to make light of Chris Brown's assault on the singer in 2009. \"Shame on you,\" said Rihanna, as she slammed Snapchat for allowing the ad in the first place. Snap, the app's parent company, soon apologized, but shares of the company dipped 4% following her post.\n\nAs far as the complaints of people not being able to find Teigen on Snapchat, that's a reference to the widely-panned app redesign, which was intended to make it easier to use -- but also made it harder to find photos and updates from celebrities and influencers, critics say.\n\nTeigen is just the latest celebrity to quit the app. Back in February, Kylie Jenner announced she had quit Snapchat, too: \"Sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad,\" she tweeted to her 24.5 million followers. Following Jenner's tweet, stock in Snap dipped 8%, giving its market cap a $1.3 billion haircut.\n\nWe've reached out to Snap for comment and will update if we hear back. Snap stock is currently flat in after-hours trading.",

                "body": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nSo far, they've introduced in-house fashion and home brands, bought large-scale retail companies like Bonobos to bolster numbers and build a portfolio, partnered with TV celebrities like Ree Drummond to reach target demographics on home goods, and now, they're launching a new online-only bedding and mattress brand.\n\nThe catch is that the new products won't be available on Walmart.com.\n\nAllswell Home, the newest of Walmart's ventures, is a separate, online-only \"startup\" that Walmart hopes will stand on its own without the conglomerate's name obviously attached. Allswell takes aim at a more affluent female customer base who's interested in trend-driven, one-and-done styles for the bedroom -- and its slightly higher price points differentiate it from what a typical Walmart customer would be used to.\n\nAllswell's site and its offerings are structured in a way that's different from your typical bedding brand. Instead of sorting by individual product, Allswell sorts by curated collections of bedding in different styles, with the ability to add a mattress to your purchase at the end. All of the products from whatever collection you choose, including pillows and duvet inserts, are added to your cart, and you'll have to go through and remove the items you don't want.\n\nThe idea is that you'll be able to quickly and easily purchase everything you need in one go. However, you can only mix and match from different sets by adding the full offering to your cart, and removing the superfluous items.\n\nEach set generally includes a duvet cover, sheet set, throw pillows, and throw blanket, along with the inserts. If you are also looking for a mattress, you can choose from \"The Softer One\" or \"The Firmer One.\" Either mattress adds an additional $855 onto your order.\n\nCustomers can choose from the following bedding sets, before customizing their orders and removing unnecessary items:\n\nNew American setAllswell Home\n\nThis set gives off a clean, crisp midcentury modern vibe. It comes with a percale sheet set, linen duvet cover, two throw pillows, two linen Euro shams, and a herringbone throw. The inserts offered with this set include a mattress cover, two Euro sham pillows, two standard pillows, and a duvet comforter. The full cost of this set, including inserts, is $1,210 -- with individual items ranging from $50-$350 (the linen duvet cover being the most expensive).\n\nThis set has a feminine touch with gentle pink and mint pastel accents. It comes with a textured coverlet quilt, two throw pillows, a woven fringe throw blanket, a percale duvet cover, percale sheet set, and percale Euro shams. The inserts include two standard pillows, two Euro sham pillows, a duvet comforter, and a mattress cover. The full cost of this set with the inserts is $1,106. Items range in cost from $22-$240 (the cotton textured coverlet costing the most).\n\nThough it's filled with varying textures, this set is the most minimalist (and most affordable) of them all. It comes with a cotton waffle weave coverlet, a cotton and wool throw, a percale duvet cover, and a percale sheet set. The inserts include two standard bed pillows, a duvet comforter, and a mattress cover. The full cost including inserts is $980, and items rage from $85 to $300 (with the most expensive item being the cotton waffle coverlet).\n\nAs its name suggests, this set gives off a \"well traveled\" vibe. It comes with a linen striped duvet cover, a percale sheet set, two textured throw pillows, a herringbone throw blanket, and two percale Euro Shams. The inserts include two standard pillows, a duvet comforter, two Euro sham pillows, and a mattress cover. The full cost of the set is $1,206, with items ranging from $50-$350 (with the striped linen duvet cover costing the most).\n\nShop the Globally Inspired set here.\n\nThe team behind Allswell gave me the chance to check out some of their hero products, including the percale sheets and the linen duvet from the \"New American\" bedding set.\n\nI've tested out a good number of sheets, but have always remained loyal to linen for its breathability. I tend to \"sleep hot,\" meaning I need fabrics that keep me feeling cool and comfortable, and the percale sheets did just that. I've actually never bought percale sheets before, so I didn't realize how crisp they were -- but I really love that feeling. It's kind of like waking up in a luxury hotel room after you've accidentally fallen asleep on yesterday's cool white poplin button down.\n\nAs for the linen duvet, I'll admit that I have some... mixed feelings. The down duvet insert that I have at home is from Ikea, and is sized full/queen. I usually order queen-sized duvet covers knowing that they'll allow for an extra few inches of room since my comforter is just slightly undersized. However, the queen size cover from Allswell was way too big for my comforter -- by at least a full foot of extra fabric. Thankfully, I have a bed frame that makes it easy (and still aesthetically pleasing) to tuck in the bottom of my comforter, so I was able to hide the extra fabric -- but I would suggest ordering a size down if you have an in-between insert or if you don't buy the insert directly from their site.\n\nThe quality of the linen duvet, though, was excellent, and I like the navy piping detail around the trip. I washed it to soften it up before putting it on my bed, and I could easily tell how well it would wear over time. It wasn't necessarily better, but I'd say this duvet is at least as good as the luxury brands you may already be familiar with, like Brooklinen and Parachute, and at a comparable price.\n\nIf you're in need of a complete bedroom refresh, I definitely suggest checking out Allswell for a one-and-done experience. It's not the place I'd shop if I were just looking for a new pair of sheets or a throw blanket, but if I needed to furnish a bare bedroom, it would be my first stop.\n\nIf you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

But if it does happen, each Spice -- Emma \"Baby\" Bunton, Victoria \"Posh\" Beckham (née Adams), Geri \"Ginger\" Horner (née Halliwell), Melanie \"Scary\" Brown, and Melanie \"Sporty\" Chisholm -- will each net a reported $14 million. That's enough to make anyone really really really wanna zigazig ah. Except maybe Posh Spice.\n\nIn their late-90's heyday, the Spice Girls earned up to $75 million a year, according to Rolling Stone. Their first tour in 1998 grossed $60 million in its American leg alone, and a brief reunion tour in 2008, snagged the group another $70 million.\n\nAll these years later, some members could use the extra pocket money more than others.

                "body": "Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon distanced himself this week from the data firm Cambridge Analytica amid an outcry over its misuse of Facebook data, which compromised the personal information of roughly 50 million users.\n\nBannon, the former head of President Donald Trump's campaign, said he \"doesn't remember\" buying the data, even though he was serving on the firm's board at the time. He instead blamed \"the Cambridge guy,\" referring to former Cambridge University professor Aleksandr Kogan, the researcher at the center of the scandal.\n\n\"I didn't even know about the Facebook mining,\" Bannon said during a conference hosted by The Financial Times in New York on Thursday. \"That's an issue between Cambridge [Analytica], the professor, and Facebook.\"\n\nBut former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie, who oversaw research at the company at the time it acquired data from Facebook, disputes that assertion.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Wylie said Bannon\"approved the data-collection scheme we were proposing\" and even had authority over the company's CEO Alexander Nix.\n\n\"We had to get Bannon to approve everything at this point,\" Wylie continued. \"Bannon was Alexander Nix's boss. Alexander Nix didn't have the authority to spend that much money without approval.\"\n\nThe acquisition of Facebook data cost the firm nearly $1 million, according to The Post.\n\nWylie doubled down on his claims in a tweet on Friday, saying \"Bannon knew\" about the firm's activities, particularly as it relates to its work during the US election. The tweet was accompanied by a photo of what appears to be a July 2014 letter from former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani's law firm addressed to Bannon, Nix, and Rebekah Mercer, the conservative megadonor who helped finance the company.\n\nThe letter appears to have been sent in response to a request for guidance regarding \"the participation of Cambridge Analytica, LLP, a foreign corporation, and of foreign nationals in connection with United States elections for federal, state and local government office.\"\n\nThe law firm said it would first explain the law, the regulations and other \"relevant precedents\" before offering guidance.\n\nIt began by saying that US law currently prohibits \"contributions, donations, expenditures, independent expenditures, and disbursements by foreign nationals,\" and added that \"of greater concern\" was the \"participation by foreign nationals in decisions involving election-related activities.\"\n\nWylie's tweet included only the first page of the alleged letter. It is not publicly known what else was contained in the document with regard to specific guidance.\n\nAlthough it's unclear whether Bannon knew exactly how the data was collected, it appears unlikely, given the extent of his involvement with Cambridge Analytica, that he was completely unaware of the purchase of Facebook data.\n\nBannon was one of the key players involved in the formation of the firm in 2013.\n\nDuring Thursday's conference in New York, he even bragged that he coined the name of the company.\n\n\"It's a stroke of genius,\" he said.\n\nFrom June 2014 until he signed on to lead the Trump campaign in August 2016, Bannon served as Cambridge Analytica's vice president. Trump would later hire Bannon to serve as his chief strategist in the White House.\n\nThe Trump campaign hired the data analysis firm to lead its digital advertising efforts in June 2016.\n\nCambridge Analytica has come under fire in the last week since reports disclosed how the firm harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users without permission and used that data to target them with personalized political ads.\n\nFacebook CEO has since apologized for what he described as \"a breach of trust.\" The social media platform has suspended Cambridge from buying ads or using its services and Alexander Nix has been suspended amid an investigation by British lawmakers into the company's practices.",

                "title": "Elon Musk's new Tesla pay package could make him $55.8 billion  --  and it's a case study in what's wrong with executive compensation",
                "body": "The gigantic pay package is emblematic of what's wrong with executive compensation practices and helps explain why inequality keeps getting worse.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but $106 billion seems like a lot of money.\n\nHeck, for me, $106 million is a good chunk of change. I could be motivated to do a whole lot of stuff for a mere $106 million. I bet you could too.\n\nThe board of directors at Tesla, however, don't think like you and me -- and neither, it turns out, do the company's shareholders.\n\nYou might have missed it amid all the uproar over the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, but Tesla shareholders this week approved a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk. Even if you did hear about it, you probably didn't realize just how massive or outrageous the pay package is.\n\nLong story short: Tesla's shareholders agreed with the company's board that $106 billion wasn't enough money to encourage Musk to take the company's valuation to new heights. They figured he needed another $55.8 billion, an amount that is itself equivalent to the annual gross domestic product of Bulgaria.\n\nMusk's payday is emblematic of just how broken executive compensation is this country. But it also offers a window into how inequality in this country has gotten so bad and why it keeps getting worse.\n\nThe payday Tesla shareholders approved for Musk on Wednesday consists of 20.3 million stock options that are subject to certain performance targets. Using a complex formula, the company estimated the value of the options, which have a 10-year lifespan, at $2.6 billion. That amount would be generous enough -- it amounts to $260 million a year, after all, a heady salary for most CEOs -- but it vastly understates the potential value of the options.\n\nThe way Musk's pay package is structured, his windfall will increase exponentially with each milestone the company hits.\n\nTesla divided the options into 12 different tranches of equal numbers of shares. Each tranche only vests if the company meets certain operating results and its market capitalization reaches certain levels. Each market capitalization milestone is separated by $50 billion. The first tranche of options can vest when Tesla's market capitalization reaches $100 billion, the second at $150 billion, the third at $200 billion, and so on.\n\nThose targets will be tough to meet, no doubt. But the way Musk's pay package is structured, his windfall will increase exponentially with each market capitalization milestone the company hits.\n\nTesla estimated that if only two of Musk's group of options vest, and he doesn't sell them until after both of them do, he'll realize about $1.4 billion in value from them. If four of his tranches vest -- and, again, he doesn't sell until all of his options are vested -- Tesla estimated he'll see $6.3 billion in value from them. If all 12 tranches vest -- and he doesn't sell before they do -- the total value of his options would be $55.8 billion, according to the company.\n\nEven dividing that by the 10-year life of the options, that would still amount to a jaw-dropping payday of $5.6 billion a year.\n\nHere's another way of looking at Musk's potential windfall. For his first two groups of options to vest, Tesla's valuation will have to hit $150 billion, up from about $51 billion today. His own windfall from that gain would amount to about 1% of that rise in valuation. But his share of the increase would go up with Tesla's market capitalization.\n\nFor all 12 tranches to vest, the company's market capitalization would have to hit $650 billion. Tesla investors, of course, would be ecstatic if it got that high. But Musk's windfall would amount to 9% of the total increase in Tesla's valuation. That's a pretty steep commission in my book -- no matter how much of a gain investors would have seen.\n\nNow, you can argue that if Musk is able to drive Tesla to the operating and valuation targets laid out in his pay package, it will be worth it to give him such an outsized portion of the company's stock gains. After all, it's a huge mountain that the company would have had to climb.\n\nTesla has struggled for years with with profitability and production. It's currently producing only a small fraction of the number of its Model 3 car -- the vehicle on which Musk has basically bet the company -- than it expected. So its chances of achieving even half of the goals set out for Musk seem unlikely at best.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders explaining the award, Tesla's directors said they intentionally gave him a tough challenge.\n\n\"Our aspirations may appear ambitious to some, and impossible to others, and that is by design,\" the board members said in the letter. \"We like setting challenging, hard-to-achieve goals for ourselves, and then focusing our efforts to make them happen. This is why we based this new award on stretch goals and why we gave Elon the ability to share in the upside in a way that is commensurate with the difficulty of achieving them.\"\n\nThe directors designed Musk's award to ensure his interests are aligned with shareholders, they said. After Musk received a similar structured grant in 2012, Tesla's market capitalization increased 17 times, they noted.\n\n\"We believe [Musk's] prior award was instrumental in helping Tesla achieve the objectives laid out in the original Tesla Master Plan and the tremendous stockholder value that was created as a result,\" they said.\n\nLet's set aside the question of whether the goals in Musk's new pay package are achievable -- or whether they're even appropriate for him to focus on. The idea that Musk needs a $55.8 billion incentive to achieve all of them is laughable on its face.\n\nThe theory behind giving executives stock awards is to allow them to benefit from the company's success, and thereby align their interests with those of shareholders. The assumption is that the executives generally don't hold much in the way of the company's shares, so they wouldn't otherwise benefit from a rising stock price. We can argue about how well that theory holds up in practice, and the incentives it creates for executives, but that's the basic idea.\n\nBut that theory just doesn't apply to Musk. He already holds a huge stake in Tesla. As of the end of last year, he owned 33.6 million shares of the company's stock, and held another 4.2 million options that could be exercised within 60 days. All told, that amounted to nearly 22% of the company's outstanding shares.\n\nBecause of that stake, Musk was already going to benefit if Tesla's valuation went up. And not in a small way.\n\nMusk was already going to benefit if Tesla's valuation went up. And not in a small way.\n\nIn fact, the value of that stake alone will go up by an $17.5 billion if Tesla's market capitalization hits $150 billion -- the second milepost in his new pay package -- taking into account the dilution the company expects. If Tesla's market capitalization goes all the way up to $650 billion, that stake would appreciate by $106 billion, again taking expected dilution into account.\n\nIn other words, Musk already had a $106 billion incentive to hit the top valuation target in his new pay package -- even before being granted the new shares. Sure, he'd have to hold on to his current shares, but to see that $106 billion windfall he wouldn't even have to hit any of the operating targets set out in his new package. Maybe I'm naive, but I would think that $106 billion is more than enough of a reason to get him to drive Tesla to that valuation.\n\nIf it's not, then maybe Musk isn't the right guy to be running Tesla. I admire Musk and what he's trying to build with Tesla and SpaceX and all of his other projects. But I'm sure there are plenty of capable CEOs out there who would be more than willing to take on the challenge of leading Tesla to that kind of valuation for a lot less than $106 billion -- much less the $161.8 billion, which is the total Musk stands to gain between his existing stake and his new pay package. For goodness sakes, it's a CEO's job to be driving longterm shareholder interest anyway -- no matter how much the CEO is paid.\n\nIn crafting this new pay package, Tesla board members said they actually did take into account Musk's current stake in the company. But they didn't explain why the expected appreciation of that stake alone wasn't enough to encourage him to achieve the goals they set out for him.\n\nInvestors have the most to lose from Musk's new pay package. If and as Tesla's stock appreciates, their share of the gains will get smaller and smaller.\n\nBut they'll lose out in other ways that are often not appreciated, especially since options and other stock awards are often treated as a trivial, non-cash expense that's more than accounted for by dilution.\n\nEach share awarded to Musk represents an opportunity cost for the company. It's a share that the company itself could have sold to the public to raise money for its own treasury. That's not a small consideration for Tesla, given that it has has repeatedly had to raise money to fund its operations.\n\nWhat's more, assuming Tesla is around long enough, it will almost certainly do what nearly every other company that hands out stock awards does -- buy back those shares to soak up dilution and shore up its stock price. To do that, it will have to use actual cash that could have gone to other other, arguably better uses, whether that's paying other employees, expanding its operations, or paying out dividends.\n\nOne would have hoped that given such costs -- and the ridiculous size of this award -- Tesla investors would have put their collective foot down. But no. While investors representing 27% of the company's shares did vote against the pay package -- a not insignificant amount -- the vast majority of the rest backed it.\n\n\"We believe the final plan is well-aligned with shareholders' long-term interests,\" T. Rowe Price, a big mutual fund company told Bloomberg in an article Tesla's board sent to shareholders to encourage them to vote for the package.\n\nSuch support is not unexpected. The big mutual fund companies often rubber-stamp executive pay and other initiatives proposed by corporate boards. Most are happy to go-along to get-along, and many of those mutual funds are eager to stay on good terms with directors in hopes of winning their business elsewhere.\n\nIt's hard to have sympathy for such shareholders. They, after all, are the ones that approved Musk's pay package. They ought to reap both the benefits and consequences of that decision.\n\nUnfortunately, though, Tesla shareholders aren't the only ones who stand to lose from Musk's outrageous pay package.\n\nCorporate boards and their advisors typically justify their executive pay decisions by looking at the pay given to executives at what they consider to be their peer companies. Because of what's been called the Lake Wobegone effect -- where every company considers their executives to be above average -- boards typically pay their managers above the average rate. With everyone looking at everyone else, executive pay gets ratcheted ever upward.\n\nThanks to that effect, you can expect corporate boards at other companies to look at Musk's pay package and figure they need to up the pay of their own executives to astronomical levels also. So, thanks to Tesla setting a new bar for executive pay, stakeholders at other companies are likely to lose out as well.\n\nBut the phenomenon of ever-increasing executive compensation does more than affect corporate investors and shareholders. It's also played a significant role in the growth in inequality in this country. Even as executive pay has soared over the last several decades, the pay of average workers has stagnated.\n\nThat's not just a coincidence. CEO pay has increased almost in inverse proportion to the decline in the power and membership of labor unions, one of the forces that had previously helped to keep it in check and tilt companies' economic spoils toward their employees.\n\nBecause so much of executives' pay these days comes in the form of shares of their companies, and share prices are tied in large part to companies' profits, executives see their pay rise as their companies' bottom line improves. And one sure way to better the bottom line is to hold down costs -- most notably labor costs.\n\nTesla is a case in point. Even as it was preparing its gargantuan pay package for Musk, the company was fighting off union efforts to organize its Bay Area factory workers, who reportedly get paid well below the industry average even while living in one of the most expensive regions in the United States.\n\nFree market absolutists dismiss the danger of rising inequality, arguing that in a capitalist economy, you need to offer outsized gains to spur risk taking, innovation, and entrepreneurship. But the types of outsized gains Musk and other executives are seeing now are arguably way past what's needed to encourage such ends.\n\nAnd on the flipside, rising inequality is antithetical to democracy. It's tied to a whole host of social ills. And it's linked to slow economic growth and financial and political instability. Indeed, the last time the United States saw this much inequality was right before the Great Depression.\n\nBut, hey, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Elon Musk really does need the lure of another $55.8 billion on top of the $106 billion he'd already see to give him the motivation to drive Tesla to new heights.\n\nAfter all, shouldn't a CEO who's shooting for the stars have a payday that's equally lofty?",

The live-in campus was the brainchild of Oracle co-CEO Mark Hurd as part of his Class Of program.\n\nHurd was inspired to create the program by a dinner he had with his daughter and her friends a few years ago. They had just graduated from college, landed sales jobs and were rooming together. They were chattering about their lives which consisted of selling stuff and partying.\n\n\"They had this infectious enthusiasm and I thought we should do the same thing at Oracle,\" Hurd told Business Insider. People inside Oracle's legendary competitive salesforce were not happy with the idea at first. Hiring untrained college grads was a big change for the software giant who had \"historically hired from competitors,\" he said.\n\nUndeterred, in 2013, Hurd began to hire thousands of college graduates to sell Oracle's cloud. He had to figure out how to train them and support their career growth until they could handle territories and clients on their own.\n\nToday, the grads spend a few weeks in training, are tasked with cold-calling, then they shadow sales people. It takes three years of graduated training and work to get their own territories.\n\nThen he decided Class Of employees need state-of-the-art facilities and help with affordable housing.\n\nSo in 2015, the story of this Oracle campus began, when Hurd hopped on a plane with Oracle founder Larry Ellison to Austin, and they walked along the river in search of the spot for the live-in campus.",

                "body": "On the application, he says he would have sold Dropbox for $1 million after taxes in the first six months, if someone had made the offer. Now, his stake in Dropbox is almost certainly worth billions.\n\nIn 2007, an MIT graduate named Drew Houston was trying to get his startup, Dropbox, off the ground.\n\nHe didn't have another co-founder because the person who had agreed to work with him had to back out. Houston had been programming since age 5, and he was trying to get Y Combinator to invest in his file storing and sharing startup.\n\nY Combinator is one of Silicon Valley's premiere startup incubator programs, offering early-stage companies some of their first investment funding, and access to mentors and experts. For Houston, it was one of Dropbox's best bets to make it big.\n\nHe told Y Combinator he was determined to see the idea through...although if someone offered him $1-2 million for Dropbox after six months of work, he'd have trouble walking away.\n\nIt's a good thing no one made Houston that offer, because now he's worth much more than that. On Friday, Dropbox held its long-awaited IPO, and had a huge pop in first-day trading. Now, it's worth about $20 billion -- and Houston's 25.5% ownesrship of Dropbox almost certainly makes his stake in the company worth billions.\n\nHere's the application Houston submitted to Y Combinator's Paul Graham back then.\n\nFrom Dropbox:\n\nY Combinator Funding Application Summer 2007 Application deadline: 12 midnight (PST) April 2, 2007.Please try to answer each question in less than 120 words.We look at online demos only for the most promising applications, so don't skimp on the application because you're relying on a good demo.We don't make any formal promise about secrecy, but we don't plan to let anyone outside Y Combinator see these applications, including other startups we fund.We recommend you save regularly by clicking on the update button at the bottom of this page.

Dropbox synchronizes files across your/your team's computers. It's much better than uploading or email, because it's automatic, integrated into Windows, and fits into the way you already work. There's also a web interface, and the files are securely backed up to Amazon S3. Dropbox is kind of like taking the best elements of subversion, trac and rsync and making them \"just work\" for the average individual or team. Hackers have access to these tools, but normal people don't. There are lots of interesting possible features. One is syncing Google Docs/Spreadsheets (or other office web apps) to local .doc and .xls files for offline access, which would be strategically important as few web apps deal with the offline problem.# For each founder, please list: YC username; name; age; year, school, degree, and subject for each degree; email address; personal url (if any); and present employer and title (if any). Put unfinished degrees in parens. List the main contact first. Separate founders with blank lines. Put an asterisk before the name of anyone not able to move to Boston for the summer. dhouston; Drew Houston; 24; 2006, MIT, SB computer science; houston AT alum DOT (school i went to) DOT edu; --; Bit9, Inc (went full time to part time 1/07) - project lead/software engineer Although I'm working with other people on Dropbox, strictly speaking I'm the only founder right now. My friend [redacted], a great hacker, Stanford grad and creator of [redacted] is putting together a Mac port, but can't join as a founder right now as a former cofounder of his started an extremely similar company. My friend and roommate i from MIT is helping out too, but he works with me at Bit9, and a non-solicit clause in my employment contract prevents me from recruiting him (and the VP Eng explicitly told me not to recruit him.) In any case, I have several leads, have been networking aggressively, and fully intend to get someone else on board -- either another good hacker or a more sales-oriented guy (e.g. the role Matt fills at Xobni). I'm aware that the odds aren't good for single founders, and would rather work with other people anyway.# Please tell us in one or two sentences something about each founder that shows a high level of ability. Drew - Programming since age 5; startups since age 14; 1600 on SAT; started profitable online SAT prep company in college (accoladeprep.com). For fun last summer reverse engineered the software on a number of poker sites and wrote a real-money playing poker bot (it was about break-even; see screenshot url later in the app.)# What's new about what you're doing? Most small teams have a few basic needs: (1) team members need their important stuff in front of them wherever they are, (2) everyone needs to be working on the latest version of a given document (and ideally can track what's changed), (3) and team data needs to be protected from disaster. There are sync tools (e.g. beinsync, Foldershare), there are backup tools (Carbonite, Mozy), and there are web uploading/publishing tools (box.net, etc.), but there's no good integrated solution. Dropbox solves all these needs, and doesn't need configuration or babysitting. Put another way, it takes concepts that are proven winners from the dev community (version control, changelogs/trac, rsync, etc.) and puts them in a package that my little sister can figure out (she uses Dropbox to keep track of her high school term papers, and doesn't need to burn CDs or carry USB sticks anymore.) At a higher level, online storage and local disks are big and cheap. But the internet links in between have been and will continue to be slow in comparison. In \"the future\", you won't have to move your data around manually. The concept that I'm most excited about is that the core technology in Dropbox -- continuous efficient sync with compression and binary diffs -- is what will get us there.# What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get? Competing products work at the wrong layer of abstraction and/or force the user to constantly think and do things. The \"online disk drive\" abstraction sucks, because you can't work offline and the OS support is extremely brittle. Anything that depends on manual emailing/uploading (i.e. anything web-based) is a non-starter, because it's basically doing version control in your head. But virtually all competing services involve one or the other. With Dropbox, you hit \"Save\", as you normally would, and everything just works, even with large files (thanks to binary diffs).# What are people forced to do now because what you plan to make doesn't exist yet? Email themselves attachments. Upload stuff to online storage sites or use online drives like Xdrive, which don't work on planes. Carry around USB drives, which can be lost, stolen, or break/get bad sectors. Waste time revising the wrong versions of given documents, resulting in Frankendocuments that contain some changes but lose others. My friend Reuben is switching his financial consulting company from a PHP-based CMS to a beta of Dropbox because all they used it for was file sharing. Techies often hack together brittle solutions involving web hosting, rsync, and cron jobs, or entertaining abominations such as those listed in this slashdot article (\"Small Office Windows Backup Software\" - http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/04/0336246).# How will you make money? The current plan is a freemium approach, where we give away free 1GB accounts and charge for additional storage (maybe ~$5/mo or less for 10GB for individuals and team plans that start at maybe $20/mo.). It's hard to get consumers to pay for things, but fortunately small/medium businesses already pay for solutions that are subsets of what Dropbox does and are harder to use. There will be tiered pricing for business accounts (upper tiers will retain more older versions of documents, have branded extranets for secure file sharing with clients/partners, etc., and an 'enterprise' plan that features, well, a really high price.) I've already been approached by potential partners/customers asking for an API to programmatically create Dropboxes (e.g. to handle file sharing for Assembla.com, a web site for managing global dev teams). There's a natural synergy between Basecamp-like project mgmt/groupware web apps (for the to-do lists, calendaring, etc.) and Dropbox for file sharing. I've also had requests for an enterprise version that would sit on a company's network (as opposed to my S3 store) for which I could probably charge a lot.# Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most? Carbonite and Mozy do a good job with hassle-free backup, and a move into sync would make sense. Sharpcast (venture funded) announced a similar app called Hummingbird, but according to [redacted] they're taking an extraordinarily difficult approach involving NT kernel drivers. Google's coming out with GDrive at some point. Microsoft's Groove does sync and is part of Office 2007, but is very heavyweight and doesn't include any of the web stuff or backup. There are apps like Omnidrive and Titanize but the implementations are buggy or have bad UIs.# For founders who are hackers: what cool things have you built? (Include urls if possible.) Accolade Online SAT prep (launched in 2004) (http://www.accoladeprep.com/); a poker bot (here's an old screenshot: https://www.accoladeprep.com/sshot2.gif; it's using play money there but worked with real money too.)# How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? There's a joke in here somewhere.# What tools will you use to build your product? Python (top to bottom.) sqlite (client), mysql (server). Turbogears (at least until it won't scale.) Amazon EC2 and S3 for serving file data.# If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written? 3 months part time. About ~5KLOC client and ~2KLOC server of python, C++, Cheetah templates, installer scripts, etc.# If you have an online demo, what's the url? Here's a screencast that I'll also put up on news.yc: http://www.getdropbox.com/u/2/screencast%20-%20Copy.html If you do have a Windows box or two, here's the latest build: http://www.getdropbox.com/u/2/DropboxInstaller.exe# How long will it take before you have a prototype? A beta? A version you can charge for? Prototype - done in Feb. Version I can charge for: 8 weeks maybe? (ed: hahaha)# Which companies would be most likely to buy you? Google/MS/Yahoo are all acutely interested in this general space. Google announced GDrive/\"Platypus\" a long time ago but the release date is uncertain (a friend at Google says the first implementation was this ghetto VBScript/Java thing for internal use only). MS announced Live Drive and bought Foldershare in '05 which does a subset of what Dropbox does. Iron Mountain, Carbonite or Mozy or anyone else dealing with backup for SMBs could also be interested, as none of them have touched the sync problem to date. In some ways, Dropbox is for arbitrary files what Basecamp is for lightweight project management, and the two would plug together really well (although 37signals doesn't seem like the buying-companies type). At the end of the day, though, it's an extremely capital-efficient business. We know people are willing to pay for this and just want to put together something that rocks and get it in front of as many people as possible.# If one wanted to buy you three months in (August 2007), what's the lowest offer you'd take? I'd rather see the idea through, but I'd probably have a hard time turning down $1m after taxes for 6 months of work.# Why would your project be hard for someone else to duplicate? This idea requires executing well in several somewhat orthogonal directions, and missteps in any torpedo the entire product. For example, there's an academic/theoretical component: designing the protocol and app to behave consistently/recoverably when any power or ethernet cord in the chain could pop out at any time. There's a gross Win32 integration piece (ditto for a Mac port). There's a mostly Linux/Unix-oriented operations/sysadmin and scalability piece. Then there's the web design and UX piece to make things simple and sexy. Most of these hats are pretty different, and if executing in all these directions was easy, a good product/service would already exist.# Do you have any ideas you consider patentable? [Redacted]# What might go wrong? (This is a test of imagination, not confidence.) Google might finally unleash GDrive and steal a lot of Dropbox's thunder (especially if this takes place before launch.) In general, the online storage space is extremely noisy, so being marginally better isn't good enough; there has to be a leap in value worthy of writing/blogging/telling friends about. I'll need to bring on cofounder(s) and build a team, which takes time. Other competitors are much better funded; we might need to raise working capital to accelerate growth. There will be the usual growing pains scaling and finding bottlenecks (although I've provisioned load balanced, high availability web apps before.) Acquiring small business customers might be more expensive/take longer than hoped. Prioritizing features and choosing the right market segments to tackle will be hard. Getting love from early adopters will be important, but getting distracted by/releasing late due to frivolous feature requests could be fatal.# If you're already incorporated, when were you? Who are the shareholders and what percent does each own? If you've had funding, how much, at what valuation(s)? Not incorporated# If you're not incorporated yet, please list the percent of the company you plan to give each founder, and anyone else you plan to give stock to. (This question is as much for you as us.) Drew# If you'll have any major expenses beyond the living costs of your founders, bandwidth, and servers, what will they be? None; maybe AdWords.# If by August your startup seems to have a significant (say 20%) chance of making you rich, which of the founders would commit to working on it full-time for the next several years? Drew# Do any founders have other commitments between June and August 2007 inclusive? No; I've given notice at Bit9 to work on this full time regardless of YC funding.# Do any founders have commitments in the future (e.g. have been accepted to grad school), and if so what? No. Probably moving to SF in September# Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? Will any be working as employees or consultants for anyone else? Drew: Some work was done at the Bit9 office; I consulted an attorney and have a signed letter indicating Bit9 has no stake/ownership of any kind in Dropbox# Was any of your code written by someone who is not one of your founders? If so, how can you safely use it? (Open source is ok of course.) No# If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, feel free to list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. One click screen sharing (already done pretty well by Glance); a wiki with version-controlled drawing canvases that let you draw diagrams or mock up UIs (Thinkature is kind of related, but this is more text with canvases interspersed than a shared whiteboard) to help teams get on the same page and spec things out better (we use Visio and Powerpoint at Bit9, which sucks)# Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered. (The answer need not be related to your project.) The ridiculous things people name their documents to do versioning, like \"proposal v2 good revised NEW 11-15-06.doc\", continue to crack me up.",

                "body": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nBetterBack\n\nTake it from someone with two slipped discs in her spine -- sitting at a desk all day is no walk in the park. In fact, sometimes my back is in so much pain that an actual walk in the park is no walk in the park, either.\n\nAccording to the American Chiropractic Association, half of all working Americans experience some form of back pain -- including the youngest rung of the workforce. That means the \"aching backs\" we used to hear about from our parents now often apply to us, too.\n\nThis is often a result of the poor posture that desk jobs cause us to develop. I know for a fact that I'm not the only 26-year-old with bad posture, but there aren't quite as many people my age who also suffer from severe and chronic back pain.\n\nIn addition to things like stretch, yoga, chiropractic treatment, physical therapy, and massage, I've tried a ton of different ergonomic chairs, quite a few back rests, seat cushions, balance balls, etc. to combat the constant stress on my back that's caused by my slipped discs and generally terrible posture. After dumping way too much money into treatments that didn't help much, I found one thing that has worked for me -- a $60 product you might have seen on \"Shark Tank\" by the name of the BetterBack.\n\nBetterBack\n\nThe BetterBack isn't particularly pretty, and yes, its name is a little gimmicky, but it is extremely effective at reducing back pain. It looks almost like a harness, with a soft pad that sits behind your back and a connected set of straps that are placed over your knees as you sit. It uses the tension from the straps to correct your posture and relieve pressure from improper spinal alignment, effectively eliminating discomfort.\n\nThis is going to sound really dramatic, but hear me out: The Better Back has had a drastic impact on my quality of life at work.\n\nAfter attempting so many ineffective and expensive treatments and testing out so many products to help my back, I honestly never thought that I'd be able to feel \"normal\" again, or that I'd ever experience what it was like to have zero pain in my spine. But the first time I tried the Better Back, it completely eliminated the buzzing discomfort I was so (frustratingly) accustomed to, which was usually at its worst when sitting at my desk.\n\nWhen I try to describe to people the sense of physical relief it gave me, I pretty much come up short of words. And for a writer and someone who generally just talks too much, that's an extremely rare occurrence for me. I'm talking like, angels singing in a choir from above, children throwing flowers at your feet, suddenly a whole new person type of pain relief -- I hope that gives you somewhat of an idea.\n\nThe company suggests that you use the Better Back for about 15-30 minutes a day to help correct posture and re-train your body's sitting position -- but I just tend to keep mine on all day. Plus, because it folds up neatly into a built-in zippered pouch, it can also be easily transported for use at home or on airplanes.\n\nYou don't need to have a diagnosed spinal injury for the BetterBack to help out your discomfort. It wasn't necessarily invented to help severe spinal problems -- it just happened to make an extra significant difference for me because of the intensity and persistence of my pain. But if it helped me as much as it did, I can only imagine how helpful it would be to others who experience general discomfort from misaligned posture.\n\nIf you suffer from back pain, particularly as a result of sitting at your desk all day, I cannot recommend the BetterBack enough.\n\nIf you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

In 2016, \"Stranger Things\" quietly became a phenomenon through word of mouth, with no major advertisements before it made its debut on the streaming service.\n\nNow, Netflix is starting to decide what it thinks will be the next big show.\n\nIn January, Netflix announced that in 2018, it would increase its marketing budget by 50% to $2 billion. So that's why you definitely didn't miss \"Altered Carbon,\" the first freshman series Netflix put major marketing behind.\n\nBut there are a bunch of other shows that might have slipped under your radar, and we collected 29 of our favorites.",

                "title": "The Fed just raised interest rates  --  here's how it happens and why it matters",
                "body": "The Fed adjusts the interest rates that banks charge to borrow from one another, which is eventually passed on to consumers.\n\nWhen we borrow and then pay back with interest, it's how banks make money.\n\nThe cost of borrowing, known as the interest rate, can make a big difference in which credit card you choose or whether you get one at all.\n\nBut if your bank wants to make it more expensive to borrow, it's not as simple as just slapping on a new rate, as a grocer would with milk. It's something controlled higher up, by the Federal Reserve, America's central bank.\n\nIn 1977, Congress gave the Fed two main tasks: keep the prices of things Americans buy stable, and create labor-market conditions that provide jobs for all the people who want them.\n\nThe Fed has developed a toolkit to achieve these goals of inflation and maximum employment. But interest-rate changes make the most headlines, perhaps because they have a swift effect on how much we pay for credit cards and other short-term loans.\n\nFrom Washington, the Fed adjusts interest rates with the hope of spurring all sorts of other changes in the economy. If it wants to encourage consumers to borrow so spending can increase, which should help the economy, it cuts rates and makes borrowing cheap. To do the opposite and cool the economy, it raises rates so an extra credit card seems less and less desirable.\n\nThe Fed often adjusts rates in response to inflation -- the increase in prices that happens when people have more to spend than what's available to buy.\n\nFor most of this economic recovery, inflation hasn't really picked up. That's expected to soon change, thanks to a jolt from the federal government in the form of tax cuts. Inflation even gave investors reason to panic last month when the monthly jobs report showed the fastest growth in average hourly earnings since 2008.\n\nThe data was later revised lower, however, showing that inflation isn't accelerating as quickly as feared.\n\nSo for now, the Fed is not exactly raising rates to fight inflation, though it expects prices to rise. That's why the big question for Wednesday's decision was whether Fed officials would add one more rate hike to their projection for the year, bringing the total to four.\n\nThe projection was left unchanged, but raised for 2019 and 2020.\n\nBanks don't lend only to consumers; they lend to one another as well.\n\nThat's because at the end of every day they need to have a certain amount of capital in their reserves. As we spend money, that balance fluctuates, so a bank may need to borrow overnight to meet the minimum capital requirement.\n\nAnd just as they charge you for a loan, they charge one another.\n\nThe Fed tries to influence that charge -- called the federal funds rate -- and it's what the Fed is targeting when it raises or cuts rates.\n\nWhen the fed funds rate rises, banks also hike the rates they charge consumers, so borrowing costs increase across the economy.\n\nAfter the Great Recession, the Fed bought an unprecedented amount in Treasurys to inject cash into banks' accounts. Over $2 trillion in excess reserves is now parked at the Fed. (There was less than $500 billion in 2008.)\n\nIt figured that one way to pare down these Treasurys was to lend some to money-market mutual funds and other dealers. It does this in transactions known as reverse repurchase operations, which involve selling the Treasurys and agreeing to buy them back the next day.\n\nThe Fed sets a lower \"floor\" rate on these so-called repos.\n\nThen it sets a higher rate that controls how much it pays banks to hold their cash, known as interest on excess reserves. This acts as a ceiling, since banks won't want to lend to one another at a rate lower than what the Fed is paying them -- at least in theory.\n\nIn December, when the Fed most recently raised rates, it set the repo rate at 1.25% and the interest on excess reserves at 1.50%. With the 25-basis-point increase expected Wednesday, the new floor repo rate would become 1.50% and the ceiling 1.75%.\n\nThe effective fed funds rate, which is what banks use to lend to one another, would then float between 1.50% and 1.75%.\n\nWhen the Fed raises rates, banks are less incentivized to lend, since they are earning more to park their cash in reserves. That reduces the supply of money and raises its price.\n\nAfter the Fed lifts the fed funds rate, the baton is passed to banks.\n\nBanks first raise the rate they charge their most creditworthy clients -- such as large corporations -- known as the prime rate. Usually, banks announce this hike a few days after the Fed's announcement.\n\nThings like mortgages and credit-card rates are then benchmarked against the prime rate.\n\n\"The effect of a rate hike is going to be felt most immediately on credit cards and home-equity lines of credit, where the quarter-point rate hike will show up typically within 60 days,\" said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.\n\nHigher rates have already hit the housing market. Mortgage rates, though still low by historical standards, are on rise at a time when the inventory of affordable houses is low.\n\nBut there's potentially good news for savers as banks start to raise deposit rates.",

When you are a virtuoso, people will pay a premium for your knowledge and skills. It takes effort and good daily habits to become a virtuoso:\n\nLiving off 80% or less of your income will leave you with an excess you can use to build wealth.\n\nOnce you have forged the habit of living below your means, you can save your excess income and then invest it so that it will grow. This growth can compound every year, and in later years can accelerate until it's quite substantial.\n\nMany of the self-made millionaires that I write about in my books had multiple streams of income, often devoting a decade or more to each revenue stream until it began to pay dividends. Once the revenue stream became self-sufficient, they moved on to building the next revenue stream, then the next one, and so on.\n\nThese multiple income streams generate cash flow that can come to the rescue when economic downturns or other things outside of our control negatively impact one or more sources of income. Plus, you can invest the extra money, which leads to increased compound growth of your investments.\n\nThere are no shortcuts to building a strong foundation for financial success. Hard work, persistence, consistency, patience, and good habits are all fundamental to building wealth. It takes many years to build a strong foundation, but the longer it takes, the stronger it will be.",

                "body": "The game was Curry's first after missing six games due to an ankle injury.\n\nGolden State Warriors star Stephen Curry had to exit the team's game on Friday night after suffering a potentially serious knee injury.\n\nThe Warriors announced after the game that they had initially diagnosed Curry with a sprained MCL in his left knee, but the full extent of the injury would not be known until he undergoes an MRI on Saturday.\n\nThe incident came in the third quarter of the Warriors game against the Atlanta Hawks. Warriors center JaVale McGee went up in an attempt to block an opposing shot, lost control in the air, and came down hard on Curry's left knee.\n\nCurry was slow to get up, and limped around the court, apparently testing his leg, and was quickly disappointed with the results.\n\nCurry had already been absent from the Warriors lineup the previous six games due to an ankle injury, with Golden State going just 2-4 in his absence despite a wealth of other All-Stars on their roster. Should Curry miss extended time, it throws a massive wrench into the Warriors plans of waltzing to their second consecutive championship.\n\nDepending on the results of Curry's MRI on Saturday, the Warriors may soon need to find a way to win without their star centerpiece if they want to repeat their 2017 run through the postseason.",

                "title": "How the founder of Edible Arrangements turned a fruit basket no one knew they wanted into a $600 million business",
                "body": "Farid explained the benefits and challenges of being an immigrant, and how it's shaped him.\n\nTariq Farid was only 13 when his family moved from Pakistan to Connecticut. He started working at a flower shop to make money. And at 17, he opened his own.\n\nFarid is the founder and CEO of Edible Arrangements. He cornered a market that no one knew even existed: baskets of fruits carved to look like giant flower bouquets.\n\nToday, his business has 900 franchises across nine countries, bringing in more than half a billion dollars in sales each year.\n\nIt hasn't all been easy. He's had to contend with everything from disgruntled franchisees to conspiracy theories and racist online trolling.\n\nBut his unwavering optimism has pushed him through struggles from the very beginning.\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nTariq Farid: No one thought it would be successful. The way I did it was that I made some arrangements and started to send them out to come customers of ours in the flower business, and they would call back and say, \"This is great. When can I order one?\" And then I went and ran to a bank and I said, \"Look, I got this great idea. I sent it to customers and they want to buy multiple of them, and they want to know when to send it. I just need $120,000 to open a store.\" And I got denied.\n\nThey looked at it and said no one really does this, and the ones who did do it were struggling with it. And so we just bootstrapped it, just started it on the side of our flower shop with about a 600-square-foot location. We laid the tiles ourselves, bought the counters ourselves, did everything we could.\n\nAnd on the first holiday, three days before Easter, 28 orders came in. Back then we didn't have a process on how to do it. We used to do everything manually. Took us all day, but it was an amazing hit. Twenty-eight doesn't sound like a lot, but when you just start and you don't have much of a budget, it was really cool.\n\nRichard Feloni: How many are you cranking out now? How big has the company gotten?\n\nFeloni: How did you know how to get that working? I know that someone had to explain to you what a franchise even was, right?\n\nFarid: I've been very lucky in a way that when opportunities knock, I don't sweat it. I don't get worried about how we're going to do this or how we're going to do that. People used to say, \"You fake it really well!\"\n\nWhat happened was we had a tiny little store and a person came to Connecticut to visit his mom and he saw the arrangement at the house. And he walked into the store and he said, \"Hey, I want to buy a franchise. Are you franchising?\" I hadn't even thought about franchising, so I said, \"Of course we're going to franchise! Where do you want to do it?\" And he said Boston.\n\nAnd because that was a customer walking in, and I always believe that you give the customer what they want, we did it. And that's the secret to success, is that you always look at things from the customer's point of view. That was my first franchise customer. I went into the Yellow Pages and found someone who knew how to franchise and he guided me through it, and we registered our first franchise and started selling franchises about a year later.\n\nFeloni: You started this when you were 30, but you started your first business when you were 17?\n\nFarid: Yeah, started my first flower shop when I was 17. I didn't know much about business. If I knew a lot, I probably wouldn't have done it! So I was really dumb about what would happen. You just kind of dive in and you figure it out along the way.\n\nFarid: That's right. A-13 year-old kid with his family, and came from a very poor family. We ended up getting lucky that my father was able to get a visa because my uncle came here. My father worked as a machinist and I remember he was getting about $8 an hour, and then he was working at McDonald's as his part-time job, and then he would work on the weekends at Burger King. So franchising was always in the family.\n\nEverybody helped. I would shovel snow, cut grass, rake leaves, and everything. Then I got a paper route.\n\nThere was a flower shop on my route that my brother and I used to deliver papers to, and we just asked them one day -- on a really cold day in the winter -- asked them, \"Hey, are you looking for some help?\" And the owner was Charlie Farricielli -- Farricielli's Flowers in West Haven, Connecticut. Charlie was one of those amazing neighborhood people. He turned around and said, \"Yeah, kid. Come on down.\"\n\nI would help people put flowers in their car, ring things up, make some bouquets, and clean up the shop, and that's where I learned the flower business when I was 13. And at 17, I opened my first flower shop.\n\nAnd I saw this man in action, where for him customers were everything and a lot of times it was just survival. You're a small business owner and you do whatever needs to be done.\n\nSo that's where I got the first bug of entrepreneurship. And I didn't know it was called entrepreneurship. I thought I was just opening up a flower shop. It just snowballed from there. Whenever an opportunity came, we would take it. When a second flower shop needed to be opened, we just opened it. We figured out how to do it against all odds.\n\nFeloni: What was the experience like going from Pakistan to a new life in Connecticut? What was that like as a family, and for you personally?\n\nFarid: When you're a 12 or 13-year-old, you're not really thinking. You're thinking you're going somewhere. Wherever you are, it doesn't matter how poor you are, and that's life.\n\nBut when we came here, things were very different. My parents struggled, but it was also so much better, and especially for my mother. I used to remember my mother said that her life started when she came here. My great-grandfather had come here as a laborer back at the turn of the century, and there was a lot of stories about America, the people in America, and the opportunity. And she just lit us up at that point. She'd say, \"OK, time to get busy. Get out there and do stuff. Go do whatever you need to do because I've heard that you can make it here, so go make it.\"\n\nFeloni: As you were building the Edible Arrangements business, how did you figure out a way to make what may have seemed like a novelty concept that could work in a small, boutique setting, and turn it into a huge, sustainable business?\n\nFarid: I worked at the flower shop between 13 and 15. Back then, if you really did good in school you could get a piece of paper that told you you could get a job, and I used that to get work at Burger King. And at Burger King I learned about branding. What I saw was that everything was systematic. And the day I turned 16, I got a job at McDonald's, because I always wanted to work there.\n\nThe concept for me, even when I was working at the flower shop at 13, was that it was all about the customer. And the other thing is branding. Even when we had our flower shop I made a logo -- I tried to act as a brand.\n\nBut when we did Edible, that's when all those years of experience gave me the opportunity to create a real brand. We spent the first six or seven months creating a logo, and I was lucky enough that I had worked with someone whose brother was a designer, and he designed our logo. The logo is the same one today, and I think I got for $1,100. It was designed by a person who probably would charge hundreds of thousands of dollars these days!\n\nAnd so I think it's the brand. But I never dreamed that I would have 600 stores. I think there was an Inc. article in 2001 and I said, \"We'll have 35 locations, but 35 perfect locations, really executed right, in five years.\" And in those five years, we opened 500 as we were trying to do the perfect 35.\n\nThe dream wasn't really big, that we were going to open thousands of these. But when you can do one, or two, or 10 right, then it's easy to replicate as long as you're taking care of every process. The thing about Edible is not only does it have to taste great, but it has to look amazing. It has to be delivered on time. You have to handle the logistics of it so that a customer experience is what makes them keep coming back.\n\nFeloni: When did you make that shift from, \"Let's just have 35 locations,\" to wanting hundreds?\n\nFarid: I felt that there wasn't a challenge or boundary, especially as the internet came around, with what technology allowed you to do. And 1999, 2000 was like this magical time where anybody that was in technology was now using it to bring products to customers through the web. I saw this opportunity and point of sale was becoming easier. Before that, creating networks and all those things was really expensive. If you wanted to have 10 or 15 locations, connecting them required very complex and expensive systems. Now it wasn't.\n\nFor me, the \"aha\" moment came as we were building those first five or 10 locations and people started coming to us from California.\n\nPeople would tell me, \"Do you really want to go to California? You should really grow out within Connecticut and maybe New York or New Jersey.\" And I told them it's a five-hour flight but we're connected with them all the time through the internet, and that I don't think it's a challenge anymore. So people came to us. People came to us from Dubai and said, \"Hey, can we open there?\" I said, \"Sure!\" And within the States, we were able to hire more people as more franchisees joined. That's how you expand. Because once we planted the flag in California, that's when other people in there came to us, and then the stores just kept growing.\n\nFeloni: It was a domino effect. And when you had requests coming from other countries, it was almost like, \"Why not?\"\n\nFarid: That's right.\n\nFeloni: When you're saying that you always wanted to have each of these locations be perfect, what happens now when you're scaling? How are you able to keep that in mind, and what were some of the challenges that arose there?\n\nFarid: There are always challenges. I think in any business, people are the ones that make it or break it. So I think first it's getting the right people. People ask me, \"Why didn't you do corporate stores? Why did you franchise?\" Number one, I couldn't get the money to do corporate stores. It was very debt-intensive and everything. But a person comes in and says, \"Hey, I like what you're doing and I want to do that in Waltham, Connecticut,\" or, \"I want to do that in New Jersey,\" and we always felt that they're just like us.\n\nWe're small business owners and we know the neighborhood we're in. We know what the challenges are. Franchisees have to have that same passion and that's what happened. In our concept, it was really selecting the right people who kept making us grow.\n\nMy passion has always been for small business owners because I think they're magical. They not only are working in that neighborhood, but they're living in that neighborhood. They're looking to make their community better and because they're part of that community. And that was the secret to our success, that we always looked for that right person and then they would, of course, hire the right people.\n\nI always hoped that they would do it like the way Charlie did it. As a-13 year-old, we would jump through hoops for this guy because he was just an amazing guy who worked harder than anyone, he loved his customers, and he had a successful business. I think that's what we have. We have very connected franchisees in our community.\n\nFeloni: In 2010, 170 franchisees filed a lawsuit because they were unhappy with the way that you changed the new terms of service. What happened there?\n\nFarid: I feel that every five years, a person has to do what I would call a \"soft boot,\" and every 10 years you have to do a \"hard boot.\" You have to really look at your concept and you have to really change it around. In 2008, we were coming up to our first 10-year anniversary and we were doing well, and I felt that we had to look internally and change. The world was changing. The iPhone and all these things that were happening that were connecting the customer -- it was moving a lot faster than it used to move.\n\nSo with that, we started to push some initiatives out there that didn't make people happy. And it's difficult to get along in a family, let alone a franchise concept, so of course you're going to have disagreements. We had close to 900 stores at that time, so we had a certain number of franchisees that had issues and we worked through them.\n\nWe're going through that change one more time. We're in the middle of our next 10 years. It's gone by so quickly where now we have to evolve again. All around us, it's the world of Amazon now. It's not only digital, but lucky for us that people are going more towards natural products and fruit, so we are now launching a smoothie concept. We're putting yogurt in smoothies because we have fruit, and that same fruit can be used to make juice bars and all these things. So there's a business opportunity and it's another hard boot.\n\nFeloni: Were there lessons from the first hard reboot that you're going to take to this upcoming second one to make it go a little easier?\n\nFarid: I don't think change is ever easy. I can sit here and say, \"Oh yeah, it'll be easy.\" Change is never easy, be it in your personal life or in business. And it's even harder in business because my partners in franchising are 900 entrepreneurs. They're 900 people just like me. The best part of franchising is that if you can convince these 900 franchisees of something, you'll move mountains. And at the same time, convincing them takes a lot because these are 900 different personalities. That's what makes them successful. So with that, it's never going to be easy, but it has to happen. We have to keep changing.\n\nFeloni: Were there communication lessons, maybe, that you learned from the first time, where you can bring the franchisees in easier to your plan?\n\nFarid: Of course. I think the first thing is you have to be clear about where you're going. That doesn't mean you won't be misunderstood. I used to always say that you have to think five years ahead of where you are, and that's my job, the job of a CEO or franchisor.\n\nWhen our franchisees have just finished implementing a change, I'm already thinking of something new to do, and then I start to communicate that. This whole smoothie concept and what we're calling Edible-To-Go, this discussion has been going on for five, six years, and now we're finally starting to do it. It takes a while, so you have to first have that soft communication, and you have to communicate often.\n\nWhat's worked really well for me is you have to make yourself available. Every one of my franchisees has to have my number on speed dial so they can call me and just go over things.\n\nFeloni: Any franchisee throughout the world could contact you?\n\nFarid: Of course. They're my customers, they're my partners -- of course. And not every conversation goes good, but that's how it's supposed to be.\n\nFeloni: And do you think that you maybe didn't communicate as well as you could have in the first reboot, but that it seems clearer now that you need to give them more leeway with it?\n\nFarid: Well, no. Anyone that starts a business, and anyone in franchising, you will never get it perfect. You won't get 100% of the people. So when they're talking about 175 franchisees, that's out of almost a thousand stores. So you're always going to have that risk and when you want to change, you're going to risk that there's going to be some people who are going to disagree. But you don't stop, especially when you know that it's beneficial in the long run and you need to do it. I hope it never happens again, but at the same time it's part of business.\n\nFeloni: In 2013, you established your foundation and were very active in philanthropy. Then in 2014, there were allegations of money going to Hamas from the foundation. You tried to ignore it, but you actually had to release a public statement on that. What happened there?\n\nFarid: I think there'll always be groups of people, especially when you have this element of Islamophobia, and they look at people and judge people by their color or their origin or something of that sort. There'll always be someone who says something either without checking in with you or trying to get some validation.\n\nWe were giving money to organizations within the States and these are organizations that other brands were giving money to, as well. Giving back to the community is a very, very important thing in my family, especially in a country that gave us so much. And when these things came up, even the Anti-Defamation League came out with a statement that said that none of these things is true.\n\nI've faced these kind of remarks and discriminatory things before. But when you measure that to the success you've gotten on the other side, it's insignificant.\n\nBut at the same time, you have to address them. You have to make sure you take them on, and you tell people everything is transparent, that everything is right in front of you. You can't just accuse someone of something. And not only was none of that true, but I was willing to address any of those accusations with anyone who made them.\n\nFeloni: You said you've faced that type of thing before.\n\nFarid: I don't think it's been as much being an American Muslim as much as it's been being a minority sometimes. As a minority, when we came here in the beginning, I don't address it because there were maybe 99% of the people who had open arms and were amazing. I mean, there were the Charlie Farriciellis who were helping you to succeed, so it would be disingenuous of me to spend a lot of time on all of this discrimination.\n\nNo, I've been blessed with so much, you're supposed to share in that, especially when others have shared their time and their wealth and their resources. And I am built by many people who gave their time and gave their resources, and encouraged me, so I think that part has only gotten stronger, this desire to do a lot more to do in giving back and everything.\n\nWhen I was young, I faced some of these things, but it's nothing compared to the success that I've gotten. It's been an amazing journey.\n\nFeloni: So you see it as a distraction?\n\nFarid: I think it's no different than a bump in the road. I think you can't let it get to you.\n\nJust imagine being an immigrant who, one, parents can't afford to dress them well because they're poor, and second, you wear the wrong sneakers and you're not the hip person, your English isn't that good, and you're intimidated. And then you come to this country where things are so much more sophisticated than where you grew up. I mean, we grew up on a farm, so we didn't have anything. We didn't have a car. My grandmother's house didn't even have electricity.\n\nMy mother used to share stories that she got her first pair of shoes when she was seven years old, and on a rainy day she wouldn't wear them. She would go barefoot because she didn't want her shoes to get dirty. So when you come from that background, a lot of these things are insignificant.\n\nAnd when you face a lot of these things, you also see there's so much more to do. And you don't get intimidated by it -- you don't turn around and stop doing stuff.\n\nA lot of times people attack you because they want to call something out that is not true or they want to say something to discourage you. And people asked me [after the Hamas accusations], \"Oh, does this mean you're going to stop giving?\" I said, \"No, no, no. This means we give more. We do more.\"\n\nFeloni: So you double down on it then?\n\nFarid: Yeah, you have to. Why? Because I didn't stop a long time ago when people said something like, \"Go back to your country.\" I'm like, \"I am in my country. This is my country.\"\n\nMy mother used to say, \"You have to leave the world a better place. You have to do your part. As you go, you have to leave a legacy behind. If not for other people, at least for your children.\" She left an amazing legacy for us, and I have to do better.\n\nFeloni: Were your parents able to see you reach your level of success?\n\nFarid: My mother wasn't able to. My mother passed away in 2005. She was my first employee when I did the flower shop, and I would leave her at the shop in the morning and I would go to high school. She would watch the shop, and for the first two years my mother was the true superhero in our family and she did everything.\n\nShe passed away just when the company started to take off, and so she was never really -- for someone who was instrumental in the success of her kids, and we came here because she was following her grandfather's dream of coming here, she wasn't really able to see it. But I'm sure she's looking down, smiling at what she was able to help us do.\n\nFeloni: Did you incorporate more of your family into your business as well?\n\nFarid: My daughter has just joined. She's a brilliant young lady, so hopefully she'll be running it one day.\n\nFeloni: How old is she?\n\nFarid: She's 24. It's an amazing feeling when your next generation comes in and they're more passionate than you at saying, \"OK, I want to do this, I want to do that. I want to take it to the next level.\" And she's as smart as her grandmother. She's brilliant and doing an amazing job.\n\nFeloni: Do you want to keep this a family company?\n\nFarid: I would like my family to be involved. I think I will do my part, pass the baton, and see what they want to do. My philosophy is that you always give businesses to your children. I hope that now it's in the family DNA, this whole entrepreneurship and businesses thing. My daughter's a lot smarter than me and I think she will probably take it to whole new heights.\n\nFeloni: Did you ever feel that when you encountered a challenge in the business that you had to reassert your leadership among your team to get them back on track or not be distracted?\n\nFarid: You have to lead. I'm a very hands-on CEO and owner of the company. I haven't stopped working any less than what I used to do before. And for me, I've always said opportunity is what you chase and risk is what you mitigate. So when you look at it, you don't get defined by the 1% or 2% of the issues. You get defined by the 98% of the success.\n\nIt's the people that are saying they're loving it and the experience they have. And when you see opportunity, you just jump in and you figure it out.\n\nI did this a long time ago when we had no money, when we couldn't get a loan, when most people told me it won't work because we cut fruit, put it on sticks, and put it in a basket? How's that going to work? We were doing this from scratch. That's when it was really difficult. Now it's not difficult.\n\nIt's not about asserting things -- you have to jump in first and you have to guide where guidance is needed. I spend a lot of time learning these days because this next generation is brilliant.\n\nFeloni: The satirical website The Onion said Edible Arrangements defies capitalism, because how can you keep selling fruit arranged like flowers all over the world, constantly? On a serious note, how do you keep a demand going?\n\nFarid: When I saw that article in Onion, I was honored! I wanted to say,\"Hey, thank you, especially if you think we're that good that we could keep creating demand.\"\n\nIt's not easy. There's a lot of work involved. We've spent millions of dollars in the last 20 years building a brand. Every one of those products has to be executed properly. And I'll tell you what The Onion can learn from this: When you have someone who leaves their job and says I want to open a franchise, and takes their life savings and goes and opens a store on Main Street in a town in the US, that's a force to contend with. That is magical. Because they're going to work very hard to protect it, and they're going to take care of every customer.\n\nThe magic was with us when I opened my first flower shop with $6,000 borrowed from my father's boss, and it was in a place that had gone out of business. But being that underdog, wanting to just make sure it works, it worked.\n\nWe are 900 owners that have put their life savings into this and we're going to make this successful. And people will give me credit. People will look at it like, \"You started this.\" But no, it's 900 people that started this.\n\nFeloni: Something that's been key to you that we talked a bit before is this idea of the American Dream. And there are plenty of people who are pessimistic in the country now, saying that the American Dream can't exist. What would you say to that? What would you say to an immigrant entrepreneur who is trying to make it?\n\nFarid: A lot of these immigrants are coming from very little means, so I think for them just being here, there's the start of the American Dream, of being able to provide for their family. I'm proof that if you want to work hard, you want to work smart, you want to turn around and take care of your customer, you want to do it the right way, that it's alive and well, and it's been alive and well.\n\nAnd I've heard this many times. I mean, I've been in business since I was 17 years old, and along the way in the late '80s I heard it. People would say that the American Dream may not be there or it's dead. But we were doing well. We had three shops and we were opening our fourth one.\n\nFeloni: The pessimism's nothing new.\n\nFarid: I think there's a certain amount that is. If you want to focus on pessimism, if people want to focus on negativity, then you get negativity and you only stay within negativity. But if you want to focus on what you can do not only to better yourself but to better your community and to better the people around you, then you will do that.",

                "body": "73% of respondents polled by MSN said that they agreed with Dick's decision to stop selling assault-style rifles.\n\nWhile Dick's Sporting Goods faced boycott threats after taking a stance on gun control, data suggests that the initial wave of anger hasn't been backed by action.\n\nOn February 28, Dick's Sporting Goods announced it would no longer sell assault-style weapons and would stop selling guns to people under the age of 21. The backlash was swift, with employees saying they were quitting the stores and customers threatening to boycott.\n\nThe company wasn't surprised by the negative reactions.\n\n\"This issue transcends our company's bottom line,\" CEO Ed Stack wrote in an od-ed in The Washington Post on Wednesday. \"We suspected that speaking out would have a negative impact on our business. But this was about our values and standing up for what we think is right.\"\n\nHowever, it doesn't look like the anger will actually have much impact on sales.\n\nAverage daily traffic to Dick's actually increased by 0.3% in the two weeks after the retailer announced its new gun policies, according to inMarket data. While the company announced earlier in March that sales dropped in the fourth quarter, the quarter ended before Dick's announced its new gun policies.\n\nThe reason that Dick's traffic hasn't taken a hit seems to be, quite simply, that most people don't care.\n\nIn a poll conducted by our partner MSN, 73% of all respondents said that they agreed with Dick's decision to stop selling assault-style rifles. What's more, the majority of Republicans -- 57% -- agreed with the decision.\n\nWhen Dick's announced its new policy, the company was careful to link its decision to the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, and to emphasize it would still sell certain guns. This clarity helped the company avoid much of the potential backlash, John Paluszek, executive producer of corporate responsibility organization Business in Society, told Business Insider at the time.\n\n\"You've got to explain yourself and you've got to do it at the right time,\" Paluszek said.\n\nFurther, while roughly a third of Americans own guns, most people also agree that there should be new regulation. For example, 73% of respondents in the MSN poll said that they would support laws limiting gun sales to people 21 and older.",

                "body": "The TV site was one of the first places people could watch full episodes of shows on the web, and a rare example of a successful byproduct of the rocky AOL/Time Warner merger.\n\nToday, millions of people are streaming their favorite shows on demand. Services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are completely disrupting the media business. But some would argue this was all started by AOL.\n\nAOL of course is known for its early role in getting millions of Americans online. But way back in 2005 it may have kicked off the binge TV revolution.\n\nNow a forgotten footnote in the much maligned AOL/Time Warner merger, that November AOL rolled out In2TV.\n\nThe desktop-centric channel featured free, ad-supported episodes of a slew of TV classics and non-classics, including \"Chico and the Man,\" \"Lois and Clark\" and \"Growing Pains\" and yes, the John Travolta 1970s starmaker \"Welcome Back Kotter.\"\n\nWhile it only lasted a few years, the liberating viewing trends that In2TV unleashed were unstoppable. Here is a brief oral history of In2TV from those who were there:\n\nEric Frankel, CEO of the personalized digital ad firm AdGreetz, ran distribution for Warner Bros. at the time:\n\n\"I came up with it. I ran a $1.2 billion domestic distribution business at Warner at the time. We had tens of thousands of shows that we would try and get on television. One of the things I realized was, one of the terrific ways to grow a business is to invent new clients. We realized this whole internet thing was happening. What if we aggregate a bunch of shows?\n\n\"My First stop was Yahoo, which was run by Terry Semel at the time. Terry, for whatever reason, set me up with a bunch of content execs, including Lloyd Braun. [Braun, a former ABC executive ran Yahoo's media group at that time. He did not respond to a request for comment.]\n\n\"Long story short, he said no. I was shocked they didn't get it.\n\n\"We had been married somewhat unhappily to AOL, and I knew [then president] Jon Miller. I sent him a note and said, \"I have this idea and want to talk to you.' He said. 'Sure, I'll see you at 6pm on a Tuesday.' I get down to Dulles and they keep me waiting, and then they move me into a room and its Jon and Kevin Conroy [then EVP of AOL's media networks group].\n\nProminent media investor Jon Miller, who ran AOL at the time of the In2TV launch, noted that in 2005, many people were just getting broadband connections in their homes:\n\n\"I blessed it and said, 'If there's going to be broadband there's going to be video. There wasn't at the time. Now it's an obvious statement. I thought, 'People are going to watch shows online. The logic is as simple as that.\"\n\nConroy, who's since held top media posts at Univision and until recently MGM:\n\n\"Everything that can be said and written about the AOL/Time Warner era has been written. But the truth of the matter is there were some pretty remarkable things that happened despite the bullshit corporate politics.\"\n\nFrankel: \"The reality was, people actually watched. We got lots and lots of plays, even with a fairly under promoted group of channels. If they would have kept at it, wasn't like nobody watched it. It worked.\"\n\nIn2TV offered six channels, including Drama Rama (soaps like \"Falcon Crest\") and Heroes and Horrors (reruns of \"Wonder Woman\" and the lizard-alien sci-fi classic \"V.\") The site also carried streaming video ads from companies like Procter & Gamble.\n\nBesides shows, In2TV featured companion videos, such as theme song singalongs and compilations of early TV show appearances by stars like Brad Pitt and George Clooney.\n\nFormer WB network president Garth Ancier, who joined the In2TV effort midstream after the WB broadcast network was folded into the CW network in 2006:\n\n\"I had just wrapped WB [the now defunct broadcast TV network known for 90s shows like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"] We turned off the lights and handed over the keys to the CW [broadcast network] next day.\n\n\"I sat on the same floor with Frankel. He had started it. I tend to gravitate to stuff that is more unusual, and this was so early in video streaming. I remember AOL people didn't have a flash player in their dialup system.\n\nIt was really a mess technologically, trying to make all the systems talk to each other. But there was a lot of great stuff in the library. They had Hanna Barbera and Looney Tunes shows. So we said 'Let's try to program like a TV network. Create a personality.'\"\n\nConroy says that Time Warner leadership started to take notice:\n\n\"I'll never forget, [Time Warner CEO] Jeff Bewkes was so impressed with it that he used it in a presentation at a top management company meeting as as an example of what could be built. He was not a big synergy guy, but he was really impressed with what we had done.\n\n\"In2TV was really the precursor to the first generation of Netflix. We got alot of stuff done and were first in many areas [at AOL], but no one really wanted to pay attention. It was much more popular to be writing about the dysfunction.\"\n\nEven with In2TV's budding success, the landscape changed quickly. Apple was suddenly selling full episodes of shows like \"Lost\" via iTunes. Hulu was around the corner. Most of the players aren't sure exactly when In2TV shut down. By 2009, AOL was spun off from Time Warner, unwinding the failed merger. Some are left wondering what might have been.\n\nFrankel: \"When you were the only guy in town you had a major advantage. It might have taken one, two, three or or five years to build it right, but we pretty much sort of invented how it would all work [in streaming]. Such is life.\"\n\nConroy: \"The downside to In2TV was that it was desktop only. Mobile wasn't a thing yet. So how many people are going to sit down in front of their computer to watch TV shows. Had Roku been around then, history might have been written very differently.\"",

                "body": "But Iran has kept up its anti-US regional activity and encountered little resistance after toning down the more visible naval encounters.\n\nIran's navy made a point of harassing and humiliating the US Navy in 2016 after then-President Barack Obama had sealed the Iran deal, but since August 2017, the US Navy says things have changed.\n\n\"It seems like they've absolutely made a conscious decision to give us more space,\" Navy Cmdr. William Urban recently said. \"That is definitely a change in their behavior.\"\n\nIran would charge US Navy ships with fast attack craft, buzz fighter jets with drones, and even shine lasers at helicopters operating at sea during Obama's presidency.\n\nBut the worst, most embarrassing incident occurred in January 2016, when Iran's navy seized two US Navy rivernine boats and the 10 sailors on board after the ship wandered into Iranian waters due to mechanical issues. They broadcast footage of the sailors, crying, in detention, on television across the country. Iran later announced plans to build a monument commemorating the event.\n\nLater that year Iranian ships conducted \"unsafe and unprofessional,\" and often taunting maneuvers around US Navy ships in the Persian Gulf five times in about a month.\n\nIn September of that same year, Trump addressed Iran while on the campaign trail. \"When they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn't be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,\" Trump said.\n\nShortly after Trump's election, the incidents noticeably stopped, despite Trump's open hostility towards Iran, compared to Obama's attempts to appease them.\n\nThe US Navy \"openly acknowledged there was a shift that happened roughly around the time we had our political transition,\" Jonathan Schanzer, vice president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Business Insider. \"There was a status quo and the status quo changed.\"\n\nAccording to Schanzer, the Trump administration gave no official warning to Iran over the naval incidents, but instead, \"the unpredictability of Trump has made Iran more reticent to test American red lines.\"\n\nCompared to the US Navy, the best on earth, Iran's navy just treads water. Iranians, even the hardliners, must know their small attack craft can't pose a meaningful threat to US ships, and even if they could, US retaliation would devastate the forces.\n\nInstead, rushing US ships and putting them on the defensive, as well as capturing sailors, works mainly for propaganda purposes for Iran, whose authoritarian regime controls the media and pushes a heavily anti-US agenda.\n\nWith Trump similarly focused on optics and pledging to revitalize the US military, Iran may have pivoted towards quietly pursuing its foreign policy goals, rather than making a scene that Trump could react to violently.\n\n\"There's another side of this,\" said Schanzer. \"They understood that there was a change in the rules of the risk/reward calculus, but they also seem to understand that there was less of a policy with regard to their regional activity from Yemen to Iraq to Syria.\"\n\nSo while Iran has dropped the very visible, US-centric naval run-ins, it's picked up on recruiting militias, deploying its armed forces to Syria, and supplying anti-US and anti-Israel militant groups.\n\n\"They realize if they want to actually achieve their objectives across the Middle East, they needed to dial back on the harassment that would needlessly provoke the US,\" Schanzer said.",

But America had a surplus with six of the 15 major trading partners that the Census Bureau tracked in 2017.\n\nThe US largest trade surplus in 2017 was with Hong Kong, totaling nearly $35 billion. Following closely behind were Brazil (surplus of $28 billion), Singapore ($20 billion), and the United Kingdom ($14 billion).\n\nAdditionally, despite Trump's repeated insistence that the US runs a deficit with Canada, that was not the case in 2017. The US actually ran a surplus just shy of $3 billion with our neighbor to the north.\n\nThe largest deficit by far is, perhaps unsurprisingly, with China. While the country is the third-largest destination for US exports, with more than $186 billion worth of American goods going to China, the difference is more than made up by the $524 billion worth of Chinese goods coming into the US.\n\nThe large deficit is part of the reason the president announced tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods on Thursday.\n\nBeyond China, the US' largest deficits were with Mexico (a $69 billion deficit), Germany ($68 billion), and Japan ($56 billion).\n\nOutside of the top trading partners, the US ran a $41 billion deficit with all other countries.",

                "body": "It made me realize how I'm sentenced to use Facebook until there's some way to safely detach my accounts.\n\nI feel like my relationship with Facebook has run its course -- a sentiment that seems to be echoed by many others, if the \"#DeleteFacebook\" movement is anything to go by.\n\nI rarely log onto the Facebook account that I created five years ago. Except for major life updates, like moving or new employment, there's not much else I have a strong desire to share with my family and circle of college friends. I usually use Instagram to find out what's new with them, anyway.\n\nMy feed consists of political nonsense, bad outdated memes, and random posts made by relatives and friends of an older generation, who seem to have consistently overrun the social media platform over the past few years. I somehow missed the exact turning point where Facebook became the technological equivalent of a dad joke.\n\nI don't need my Facebook. I don't rely upon it for my livelihood, or for business networking like some do. And I've gotten to a point where I don't want it either.\n\nThrow in the recent scandal involving data analytics company Cambridge Analytica and the privacy violations Facebook took part in, and now seemed like a good time to call it quits with my account.\n\nThe thing is: When I began my research on how to efficiently delete a Facebook account, I was guided to the settings section of Facebook. I soon discovered the 72 apps that are attached to my Facebook login. It slowly sank in how much of my life is tied to Facebook. And even worse was how completely unwilling I was to sever those ties and potentially lose access to information that so closely affects my day-to-day life.\n\nThe problem is that my access to each of those apps is based on my Facebook identity. But if I no longer have a Facebook identity, how will those apps know who I am?\n\nIn theory, resetting your login information for any particular app should not be very difficult, but I soon discovered that the reality is quite different: For many apps, Facebook is the equivalent of your fingerprint. And you're no more likely to convince some apps that you're still the same person -- just with a different fingerprint -- than you would to a person in the real world.\n\nIn the app hierarchy of my phone, Spotify reigns supreme. So \"how to keep your Spotify after deleting Facebook\" is the first tutorial I searched for. To my horror, I found posts upon posts detailing how the participants were unable to log into their Spotify accounts after deleting Facebook.\n\nI thought of all the playlists I'd curated over the course of the last five years: one for that time I was in Paris by myself, one for fall of 2013 during my first college semester, one random assortment of songs I just really liked, etc. Each served as its own little metaphoric time capsule that transferred me back to a different point in my life. I wasn't ready to let that go.\n\nI followed suit with the rest of the apps, wondering what would happen to my online portfolio I built through Wix, all of my Pinterest boards, the reviews Airbnb-ers had given me over the years, my Instagram stream that dates back to 2013, and my access to the online network of my alma mater.\n\nAnd on a less significant level, I'd lose access to Hinge, my favorite dating app to waste time on, since the platform populates matches with mutual Facebook friends.\n\nI know why I'd used Facebook to log into all these things: It was quick, convenient and secure, or so I thought. But I didn't foresee the consequences of linking so many applications to one account.\n\nWith Facebook currently under a magnifying glass, I'm expecting, or hoping, that every developer creates a more seamless detachment process for users who delete the Facebook account but want to keep data and access to the apps that are connected to it.",

At an auto-finance conference in Las Vegas last week, Automotive News reported that General Motors President Dan Ammann said people will develop more confidence in driverless vehicles once the cars show what they can do.\n\nGM is pushing hard, through its Cruise division, to get a fully autonomous, no-driver vehicle on the road in a ride-hailing framework in the next few years. If the company succeeds, it could take the lead in a business that could play to its strengths as a carmaker able to build fully integrated self-driving cars at scale.\n\nBut if GM fails, it still has its highly profitable legacy business to fall back on. For the likes of Uber and Tesla, the stakes have been presented as being much higher. Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick saw autonomy as imperative, given Uber's driver costs. And Tesla has for several years with its Autopilot technology been attempting to avoid being left behind. CEO Elon Musk has taken a personal interest in the effort.\n\nBut the truth is that a revolution in autonomy won't ultimately affect Tesla's and Uber's business all that much. Unlike GM, Tesla has nothing in the way of a ride-sharing service ready to launch, and Uber's success hasn't been in getting drivers out from behind the wheel, but in putting more drivers in cars so that the company can continue to expand and grow, increasing the number of trips it provides, thereby maintaining its massive market-share lead over competitors like Lyft.\n\nFundamentals matter, even though Musk might want to change the Tesla story and Kalanick, before he was forced out of Uber as CEO, wanted to supercharge Uber's value by eliminating its biggest expense. Tesla is still almost entirely a company that makes electric cars. Uber is an app-enabled, low-friction alternative to taxis and livery cabs.\n\nBoth companies have achieved mighty valuations with those fundamental business propositions: Tesla's market cap is over $50 billion, while Uber's investors have pushed it to $50-$70 billion on paper, depending on how much of an impact you think Softbank's recent 20% stake lowered the value.\n\nNeither may ultimately be worth that much (although Uber certainly looks like it has the chance to be the biggest Silicon Valley IPO since Facebook), and Tesla certainly appears overvalued based on its performance -- or lack of it. The carmaker's Model 3 mass-market vehicle was launched last July with promises that Tesla would be building 5,000 per week by now. It would be lucky it if were building 1,000 -- the company is mired in what Musk has called \"production hell.\"\n\nNot for nothing, Tesla hasn't really made any money in 14 years, has a balance sheet heavy with debt, and burned through over $3 billion in 2017.\n\nUp against those challenges, Tesla's Autopilot tech is interesting but hardly mission-critical. Customers obviously can't use it if they can't get a Model 3 until 2019 0r 2020. Uber's self-driving roll-out in Pittsburgh in 2016 was spectacular, but since then, the vehicles have been in test-test-test mode while the startup has endured an epic management crisis and Kalanick's departure. Again, not exactly mission-critical.\n\nWhat we're seeing here is something of a bandwagon effect for companies whose value is tied up less in execution than in storytelling. Electric cars were the cool, \"disruptive\" story that made Musk and Tesla investors rich from 2010 until now. Driverless cars that can be summoned using an iPhone, anywhere and anytime, suggested Uber on steroids. You think $70 billion is impressive? Just wait until we don't have to pay drivers anymore.\n\nSo Tesla and Uber jumped on that bandwagon with the technology clearly still in a pre-beta phase. They didn't do it because it was important to their respective businesses. They did it because it could keep the story fresh and exciting.\n\nBut, you might ask, aren't GM and other traditional carmakers doing the same thing?\n\nWell, sort of. The self-driving story has improved investor outlook in GM. But that's a Wall Street thing. GM wants to attack the autonomous opportunity because it has a realistic chance to be dominant, with the capacity to build millions of autonomous vehicles every year, around the world.\n\nGM also thinks self-driving vehicles will be safer, and it ought to know. About 40,000 people die annually in the US alone in auto accidents. A percentage of those accidents involve GM cars and trucks. That's why Ammann doesn't think the Uber fatality in Arizona is the end of the road. Self-driving cars could be the biggest enhancement to safety GM has seen in its history.\n\nThe bottom line is that while it might seem that a self-driving death and its aftermath is a threat to Uber's and Tesla's ambitions, it isn't. That's because their self-driving efforts don't matter much in the grand scheme of things. Tesla dealt with an Autopilot-related fatality in 2016, but it didn't cause hundreds of thousands of Model 3 reservation-holders to cancel.\n\nThat raises a question, and it's an ethical one. If Uber and Tesla don't need self-driving tech to prosper, then why are they offering it -- and testing it when it's clear that the bugs haven't been worked out? Kalanick's argument was that Uber needs it to survive as a business. Musk's is that safety is more important, in fact, than selling cars.\n\nMusk's point is stronger, but even so, Tesla's business at the moment has to be all about getting cars out of its factory, not about those cars driving themselves once they hit the road. So even though the inevitable tragedies that will be associated with the development of autonomous vehicles aren't going to affect Tesla's business in a major way, that doesn't mean Tesla should continue with the experiment. Likewise, Uber.\n\nIn the end, it could be best to leave self-driving cars to the companies that have been dealing with human-driven cars for over a century.",

                "body": "All South Africans fear violent crime, which is pervasive and deadly. Few to none fear random or mass shootings, which are simply unheard of.\n\nWhat is the process like for getting a gun in your country?\n\nThere are several lengthy steps involved in buying a gun in Australia.\n\nThe legislation is state-based, so for this example I shall quote the law in New South Wales (NSW), the country's largest and oldest state with 7.5 million residents.\n\nSince the 1996 National Firearms Agreement, developed in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre, which killed 35 and was the last mass shooting in Australia, the country's six states and two territories have amended and/or diluted their rules. What follows is thorough by US standards, but both sides of the debate argue the rules are either too onerous or lax.\n\nIn NSW, you must be 18 years or older and apply for a firearms license from the NSW Firearms Registry, which is managed by the state police. (There are minors permits for children aged 12-18).\n\nYou need to have a genuine reason to own a gun, such as targeting shooting, primary production, hunting or collecting, or belong to an approved shooting club (as a club member, you need to comply with attendance requirements).\n\nPersonal protection is not a \"genuine reason\" for a gun.\n\nYou need to provide extensive paperwork to back up your application, which is granted at the discretion of police. You need to take part in a firearms safety training course with an accredited trainer before you can apply, and need to be a state resident.\n\nOnce you apply, there is a mandatory 28-day waiting period, as well as criminal background checks. You can't get a licence if you've committed a prescribed offense within the last 10 years.\n\nThose offenses include convictions involving firearms or weapons, prohibited drugs/plants, fraud/dishonesty/theft, drugs, terrorism, violence, public order, assaults against law enforcement officers, robbery, organized criminal groups, offence of a sexual nature or including being the subject of an Apprehended Violence Order.\n\nThe license also has category restrictions. For example, if you hold a license for sport/target shooting, you can't legally go hunting on a rural property. You would need to apply for \"recreational hunting/vermin control\" as a genuine reason on your licence.\n\nIf you're a farmer with a primary production license, you need written permission from the landowner on an adjoining property to use your gun there.\n\nYour firearm must be registered and you'll need a Firearm Registration Certificate for it, which includes its serial number and the registered owner.\n\nIt must also be stored safety in a secured firearms box. Police will come and check your compliance.\n\nWhen you want to buy a gun, you'll need to complete a Permit to Acquire (PTA) application and send it to the Firearms Registry to process. There is a mandatory 28 day waiting period to approve the permit, which you then present to a firearms dealer. A permit is needed for each firearm and it expires after 90 days.\n\nWhen you no longer require your gun, it must be disposed of by handing it in to police or via a registered second-hand dealer.\n\nAutomatic and semiautomatic weapons are banned in Australia (although the latter is available in exceptional circumstances).\n\nThe National Firearms Agreement put weapons into six categories.\n\nCategory A includes rimfire rifles and shotguns (not semi-automatic or pump-action) and air rifles, while Category B is centrefire rifles with a bolt, pump or lever action.\n\nBoth categories can be owned under most licenses.\n\nCategory C is pump-action or self-loading shotguns with a magazine with up to 5 rounds and semi-automatic rimfire rifles with up to 10 rounds. Ownership is limited to primary producers, dealers, collectors and clay target shooters.\n\nCategory D is the category C firearms with magazines larger than C-level and are restricted to government, occupational shooters and primary producers.\n\nCategory H is handguns, which are restricted to target shooters, police and security guards.\n\nAutomatic self-loading rifles are in the restricted weapons category, along with machine guns and rocket launchers, which a military-grade weapons.\n\nWhat do you think about President Trump's proposal to arm more teachers and trained professionals in schools?\n\nArmed response to a critical incident requires high levels of training. It's hard to see how teachers would fit that into their skills base alongside the primary role. Putting aside their willingness to participate and the range of ethical issues, what happens when they accidentally shoots a student? Or, God forbid, an educator deliberately turns their weapon on students?\n\nIn short, it shows a lack of imagination on the part of legislators to try and resolve every complex situation into the denouement of a Sam Peckinpah movie.\n\nMost Australians struggle to comprehend the validity of the argument that the best way to deal with guns is more guns. Our country chose the opposite direction.\n\nDoes the average person in your area fear the possibility of being the victim of gunfire?\n\nNo. Gun deaths are overwhelming the result of self-harm, aside from the occasional high-profile gangland shooting and police using lethal force in confrontations -- still a rare occurrence in Australia. Long-term crime trends involving firearms are generally falling. For example, assault involving a firearm in NSW is down nearly 19% in the last five years.\n\nA government study of firearms-related injuries found there were 338 hospitalized cases in 2013-14 and 209 deaths in 2012-13. Of those deaths, 80% were due to suicide, although that figure has also fallen since the 1980s. Based on those figures there were 1.5 hospitalized cases per 100,000 population and 0.9 deaths per 100,000 population.",

Mass shootings at American schools and colleges have become a regular occurrence.\n\n\"This issue is going to turn into the No. 1 issue in this country. I know that's not only what I want, but I know it's what you guys want,\" Alfonso Calderon, a junior at the Florida school, told Washington students at a pre-march event on Thursday.\n\nThe Washington rally is among more than 800 events scheduled worldwide, with U.S. demonstrations set from San Clemente, California, to New York and Parkland, according to gun-control group Everytown For Gun Safety.\n\nThe teenage organizers have won kudos and cash from dozens of celebrities, with singer Ariana Grande and \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda among those performing in Washington.\n\n\"Trainwreck\" star Amy Schumer is set to appear at the Los Angeles rally. Actor George Clooney and his human rights attorney wife have donated $500,000 and said they would be at the Washington rally.\n\nOrganizers want Congress, many of whose members are up for re-election this year, to ban the sale of assault weapons like the one used in the Florida rampage and to tighten background checks for gun buyers. On the other side of the debate, gun rights advocates cite constitutional guarantees of the right to bear arms.\n\nOn Friday, Republican President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that includes modest improvements to background checks for gun sales and grants to help schools prevent gun violence.\n\nDavid Hogg, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, said the protests were a way for young Americans to show their opposition to the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby.\n\n\"We're asking people (to) put the USA over the NRA,\" he said at the Thursday event in Washington.\n\nAn NRA spokeswoman said it had not taken a position on the protests.\n\nDemocrats and nonpartisan groups hope to register at least 25,000 first-time voters at the rallies, potentially a boost for Democrats, who generally favor stricter gun controls.",

                "title": "Silicon Valley's MeToo moment is changing the venture capital industry  --  but many wonder if it will last",
                "body": "And despite the heightened awareness, the industry has done little to address its underlying problem -- the venture capital business itself lacks diversity.\n\nDana Kanze has a pretty good sense of how the tech industry thinks about women.\n\nA former entrepreneur and CEO of a tech company, Kanze studies how women are treated in the venture capital and startup worlds as a doctoral fellow at Columbia Business School. In the last 18 months -- in the wake of Donald Trump's election and Susan Fowler's famous post about her \"strange year\" at Uber and the explosion of public accusations of sexual harassment in the tech industry -- she's noticed a distinct shift in attitudes in the venture capital community.\n\nVCs in general are more aware of gender discrimination issues, of how poorly women are often treated in the industry, and of research that indicates that firms with more diverse partners tend to have better returns, she said. And women in the venture industry are more willing to speak up about the discrimination and other challenges they've faced.\n\n\"I've had very positive discussions across the board,\" Kanze said.\n\nBut she's also gotten pushback. One Silicon Valley VC she spoke with challenged the very notion that gender discrimination exists or that his firm should do anything about it.\n\n\"He basically disregarded the issue out of hand,\" Kanze said.\n\nKanze's observations mirror those of others inside and outside the venture capital industry. Many say what became the #MeToo movement has had a marked influence on the business. But not everyone in the industry has taken it seriously or thoughtfully, and it's unclear whether the movement will effect lasting change.\n\n\"More and more venture firms are looking at their firms and seeing what they can do to be more inclusive and to create an environment where everyone -- regardless of gender or race or personality differences -- can thrive,\" said Fern Mandelbaum, a partner at Vista Venture Partners who teaches classes about diversity and entrepreneurship at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.\n\nBut, she continued, \"by no means is it the majority. I wish it was.\"\n\nGender discrimination is nothing new in the tech industry, much less in corporate America. But Silicon Valley in general and the venture business in particular have long been resistant to doing much about it.\n\nFor decades, women have been vastly underrepresented in tech and venture. Female-founded startups have attracted a tiny fraction of the funds drawn by those founded by their male counterparts. And women partners in the VC are so rare that some firms still don't have any. When major firms name their first woman partner -- as Sequoia did just two years ago when it hired Jess Lee -- it's big news.\n\nCoupled with the lack of female representation have been persistent rumors that those women who did find work in the industry often had to contend with toxic work environments and sexual harassment. Few spoke out publicly about what they faced, and those that did -- most notably former Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner Ellen Pao -- found themselves under attack.\n\nBut in the last year or so, a bright spotlight has been shone on the way Silicon Valley treats women. It started with Fowler's blog post describing how she was allegedly sexually harassed by her manager at Uber and how the company's human resources department did nothing to address that or other complaints she made about how women were treated at the company. That post spurred a major investigation at Uber that eventually led to the resignation of its CEO, Travis Kalanick, the ouster of several other executives, and the firing of more than 20 employees.\n\nMore importantly, Fowler's post -- and the change it led to at Uber -- spurred other women to come forward. By the end of the year, numerous executives and venture partners, including powerful figures such as Draper Fisher Jurvetson partner Steve Jurvetson and 500 Startups CEO Dave McClure, had resigned under clouds of allegations.\n\nThe women who came forward and the consequences that followed helped raised awareness of gender discrimination issues in the Valley -- and what might happen if the industry tried to continue with business as usual, those inside and outside the industry said.\n\nIn the venture capital business, this newfound awareness has led partners to think more about the lack of diversity in their ranks, they said. In general, venture firms are trying to bring more women into the business and trying to make sure their funds aren't biased against women, said Duncan Davidson, a general partner at Bullpen Capital.\n\n\"I think most people in the business are acting like grownups,\" Davidson said.\n\nThe heightened awareness of gender discrimination has also spurred venture investors to pay more attention to rumors of sexual harassment at the startups they're considering investing in, Duncan and others in the industry say. They're doing more digging into such allegations and it's more likely if they find something that they'll walk away from potential deals, they said. Such allegations are taken particularly seriously if they're being made about the startups' founders or management, said one Silicon Valley VC, who asked not to be named.\n\n\"Before July 2017, most people would have looked the other way\" the VC said. \"The standards have changed.\"\n\nThe newfound focus on gender issues in the Valley has also opened up opportunities for female entrepreneurs and investors and for firms that have long pushed for diversity. Last fall, for example, Sequoia's Lee, together with several other female venture partners, launched Female Founder Office Hours, an organization devoted to offering coaching to women entrepreneurs.\n\nObvious Ventures, which was started by Twitter cofounder Ev Williams, has emphasized the importance of its portfolio companies having diverse workforces since it started, said James Joaquin, one of the firm's cofounders. About a year ago, Joaquin proposed that venture firms include something he called the \"world positive term sheet\" in the contracts they sign when they invest in startups. The non-binding agreement would encourage companies to make a positive impact on the world, including by building diverse teams.\n\nMore recently, Obvious has been pushing for startups to put in place formal procedures for handling complaints by employees accusing managers of sexual harassment and other bad behaviors. Larger companies typically have such formal channels, but they are often lacking at startups, Joaquin noted.\n\nSuch initiatives have gained new attention in the wake of the Valley's MeToo moment, as has the focus on giving women more opportunities, he said.\n\n\"I think we've made more progress in the last 12 months than in the last 12 years prior to that,\" Joaquin said.\n\nRelatedly, startups are focusing earlier in their lifespans on putting in place human resources teams to ensure they have good hiring and management practices in place, said Jennifer Carolona, a cofounder and general partner at Reach Capital. Meanwhile, she's found that workers -- particularly younger ones -- within Reach's portfolio companies are becoming more vocal in pressing their companies to have greater diversity among their executives and directors.\n\nThere's a \"groundswell,\" Carolona said. Socially conscious Millennial workers \"really putting pressure (on companies) to make sure they have diversity,\" she said.\n\nStill, for all the heightened awareness and high-profile resignations, not everyone has signed on to do something about gender discrimination in the Valley and the changes have by no means upended the way the industry goes about its business.\n\nFemale VCs are still few and far between. Female founders still struggle to get funded. Women engineers still are a distinct minority. And tales of sexual harassment still keep percolating out of the industry.\n\nWhile many VCs have reacted to this moment by trying to be fairer to women, the lesson others have drawn is just that they need to be more careful of what they say around women or that they need to avoid them entirely, said Bullpen's Davidson.\n\n\"There are some people who are acting like grown ups and others that are acting like children,\" he said.\n\nWhile many VCs are paying closer attention to sexual harassment allegations, others still don't care. Indeed the chance that a firm will look away from such allegations within a startup it's considering investing in is still about \"50-50,\" said the VC who asked not to be named.\n\nAnd it's an open question whether addressing gender discrimination and stamping out sexual harassment will remain a priority for the industry. It's still early days, said Pao, now a partner at Kapor Capital.\n\n\"It was heartening to see some investors step back from certain investments because of these risks, but disheartening to see others invest anyway,\" she said in an email.\n\nIn one high-profile example, the popular trivia app HQ Trivia was unable to raise money at the end of 2017 as the company was dogged by allegations of past behavior by cofounder Colin Kroll during his time working at Twitter.\n\nEarlier this month, HQ Trivia raised $15 million, from Founders Fund, which reportedly carried out its own investigation and decided to put one of its female partners on the board as part of the deal. In a statement to the news site Axios, Kroll apologized for past \"things I said and did that made some feel unappreciated or uncomfortable\" but said he had never sexually harassed anyone while at Twitter.\n\nAs much attention as gender discrimination issues have gotten in Silicon Valley in the last year, the tech industry has yet to address the underlying structural issues that give rise to such unequal treatment, said Y-Vonne Hutchison, founder and CEO of ReadySet, a consulting firm that works with companies that are trying to create more diverse workforces.\n\nThey're continuing to invest in people and technology that look certain way. They're not changing who's in power ... Without that, there can be no change.\n\nThe crux of the problem, she and other critics say, comes down to what they call pattern matching. Venture capitalists are largely white and male and come from affluent backgrounds. In their minds, they know what a successful entrepreneur looks like. No surprise, it's typically someone white and male who comes from a privileged upbringing.\n\nIt's a self-perpetuating system, because when looking for new partners, venture firms often want to hire the people who founded successful startups -- who happen to be the white, rich male entrepreneurs they funded in the first place.\n\n\"They're continuing to invest in people and technology that look certain way. They're not changing who's in power,\" Hutchison said. She continued: \"Without that, there can be no change.\"\n\nIndeed, whether the Valley's MeToo moment will maintain its momentum and prompt further changes or just peter out is anyone's guess.\n\n\"It's a favorable time for change,\" said Mitch Kapor, a longtime champion of diversity and founder of Kapor Capital. \"But if people wait for the storm clouds to pass and for it to blow over -- that could happen.\"",

                "body": "The film's director, Jake Kasdan, explained to Business Insider how he pulled off one of the biggest surprise hits in recent memory.\n\nThings did not start off well for the sequel to \"Jumanji.\"\n\nTwenty years after the 1995 hit movie -- which starred Robin Williams as a man who, after decades of being trapped inside a magical board game, is finally released to complete it with two kids -- Sony announced in 2015 that it was going to dust off the property and reboot it.\n\nThe internet was not happy.\n\n\"It was like, 'You're ruining my childhood!'\" Jake Kasdan, the director of \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,\" recalled when Business Insider asked whether he was aware of the backlash.\n\nFollowing the Sony announcement, social media was flooded with negative reactions, the consensus being that a \"Jumanji\" reboot would tarnish the original's legacy and that the sequel was just the latest example of Hollywood running out of new ideas:\n\nAnd things didn't get any better for the movie when, after the screenwriter Chris McKenna (\"Spider-Man: Homecoming\") was tasked with coming up with a new take on the movie, three more screenwriters came on board to give it a crack. The release date was also changed three times, eventually settling on December 20, the Wednesday after \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" would hit theaters.\n\nThese are not good signs for a movie.\n\nBut in one of the most miraculous turnarounds for a movie in recent memory, \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" didn't just hold its own against \"The Last Jedi\" in December (finishing in second place for the last week and a half of the year), it knocked the latest \"Star Wars\" movie off the top spot and went on an incredible three-week streak of topping the weekend domestic box office in January.\n\nThe movie went on to earn over $939 million worldwide, and over $400 million in North America -- the second-best domestic performance ever for a Sony movie (just below the $403.7 million made by 2002's \"Spider-Man\"). All this came from just a $90 million budget.\n\nAnd no one is more surprised by the movie's global success than Kasdan.\n\nKnown for R-rated comedies like \"Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story\" and \"Bad Teacher,\" Kasdan came out of nowhere to prove he could helm a PG-13 action-comedy with major stars like Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas.\n\nKasdan signed on to direct a few months after Sony made the official announcement, despite being fully aware of the hatred for the idea by those on the internet.\n\n\"On some level I think there's a deserved skepticism about bringing back titles,\" Kasdan told Business Insider while promoting the Blu-ray/DVD release of the movie (available Tuesday). \"Whether it's a sequel, reboot, relaunch, I think we've done so much of it that understandably the audience is kind of, 'Why does everything have to be like this?' But I loved what this could be.\"\n\nWhat the haters online didn't know was that Kasdan and the screenwriters McKenna, Erik Sommers, Scott Rosenberg, and Jeff Pinkner all contributed to what can only be described as a unicorn in the movie business -- a reboot that feels new while also paying homage to the original.\n\nThe major adjustment done for the \"Jumanji\" sequel was shifting the board-game element to better reflect the present gaming world.\n\nAt the end of the original \"Jumanji,\" the two main characters toss the game into a river. The sequel starts years later in 1996, with the game being found on a beach. The boy who is given it ignores what he sees as a lame board game, so the game magically morphs into a more attractive video game, sucking him into it. Years later, more kids are sucked in and become avatars played by Johnson, Hart, Black, and Gillan.\n\nThat element opened incredible possibilities for the sequel's story, as it not only could bring the Jumanji game to life but also could deliver all types of gaming aspects to the movie -- from the characters' three game \"lives\" apiece to the jokes about their avatar's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nKasdan said this was all pulled off not by one single screenwriter who finally figured out how to crack the story but by collectively using all of them, like a TV writers' room.\n\nTraditionally, on a movie, when a screenwriter has handed in his or her draft and been told that another scribe has been hired, that usually means the director, producers, or studio executives (or all the above) didn't like the previous screenwriter's work. But that wasn't the case on \"Welcome to the Jungle.\"\n\n\"What made this project unusual was I continued to work with a lot of the writers,\" Kasdan said. \"It wasn't like someone was dismissed and never heard from again. Chris McKenna came up with the idea and wrote it with Erik Sommers, and then Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner came on, and I did some work on it as well. I just liked their work, so by the end it was this unique experience where they worked with me or each other. Everyone kept a foot in.\"\n\nThough Kasdan thought they had made a worthy movie, he still had no idea how it would play in test screenings. So first, he decided to play the movie for his kids.\n\n\"My kids are like 7 and 5, which is sort of younger than we ever thought about our audience, but they loved it,\" he said. \"That made me think that the movie had a larger possible audience than I had fully realized while we made the movie. They connected so strongly to the fantasy of it, it got me excited.\"\n\nAnd the rest is history. The movie made just under $1 billion globally at the box office and solidified the star status of Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. And Kasdan is still trying to take it all in.\n\n\"I've been doing this long enough to realize how extraordinary this is,\" he said. \"It's kind of a dream.\"\n\nBut now it's back to the drawing board for a sequel. Kasdan, Rosenberg, and Pinkner are all set to return, along with the lead cast. But can a sequel that was praised for having its own identity pull off a successful encore? Can the video game storyline be used again? Is it right to bring back the same cast?\n\n\"We're just starting to figure that out,\" Kasdan said. \"The honest answer is you could do all different kinds of things and we're trying to figure out what feels like the most organic and fun way to continue this.\"",

                "body": "The benchmark S&P 500 closed below a key technical support level, and the breach opens up the index to further selling, according to JPMorgan.\n\nAfter a rough stretch that saw the benchmark S&P 500 fall 5.9%, its biggest weekly drop in more than two years, equity investors are rightfully picking up the pieces and trying to figure out what's next.\n\nIf they're looking for good news, they're probably best off steering clear of the latest research from JPMorgan's technical analysis team. According to strategist Jason Hunter, the index's plunge below a key support level on Friday has left it exposed to far greater downside.\n\nHe's referring to 2,610, which was the bottom boundary of a support range Hunter laid out in a recent note to clients. The S&P 500 closed Friday at 2,588.26, well below JPMorgan's technical threshold, confirming the breach.\n\nHunter's analysis suggests the next support level for the benchmark will be in the mid-2,500s -- roughly 3-4% below its current level. He specifically highlights the 2,541-2,557 range that marks the index's October-November 2017 lows, as well as its recent intraday low of 2,533 reached on February 15.\n\nThis technical dynamic already played out to a degree in late trading on Friday. With about two hours left until the close, the S&P 500 began flirting with the 2,610 level. After sustaining a move below that technical area, selling accelerated into the close, and the benchmark wound up finishing the day at session lows.\n\nThat drastic decline and the subsequent technical selling pressure is a direct threat to Hunter's base-case forecast, which calls for the S&P 500 to recover and hit new highs in the second quarter. Prior to Friday's turbulence, he was optimistic about the prospects of a full rebound, but he's likely calibrating his model to the downside now.\n\nSo what can traders do? Perhaps most actionable in the near term is Hunter's suggestion that traders start to scale back equity holdings -- a recommendation he made contingent on the 2,610 breach we just saw.",

                "title": "The way you use social media could reveal your attachment style in romantic relationships",
                "body": "It's important to remember that social media isn't real life, and it can't cover up real life problems.\n\nHow we attach to other people pretty much shapes how our romantic relationships go. If you grew up in a loving, caring environment, you're more likely to have developed a healthy attachment style. This means you're comfortable being open and honest with your partner, and you don't fear intimacy.\n\nHowever, some people consistently push away people they have feelings for, because they believe they cannot rely on anyone. This usually comes from some sort of trauma in childhood, or it can be developed as a result of an abusive relationship in later life.\n\nAccording to a study from the University of Kansas, published last year in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, there is also a link between how secure someone is in their close relationships and how they use social networks like Facebook.\n\nThe research looked at four separate studies that gave insights into how people with different attachment styles -- avoidant, anxious, or secure -- managed their friendship networks.\n\n\"If you're high on attachment avoidance, you're trying to avoid intimacy and tend not to trust others -- downplaying the importance of emotions and relationships,\" said Omri Gillath, professor of psychology at the University of Kansas, and lead author of the study.\n\n\"Conversely, if you're high on attachment anxiety, you're very concerned with rejection and abandonment and tend to be overwhelmed by emotions. Being low on both -- securely attached -- associates with long, stable, satisfying relationships.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at the participants' social media friendship circles, which they evaluated for \"tie strength\" and \"multiplexity\" -- which respectively mean looking at how intimate they felt with people, how often they interacted, and how many roles were filled, such as caring friend or work colleague, by individuals in their network.\n\nResults showed people's social networks and the way they managed them could be predicted from their personality type.\n\n\"We found people high on attachment anxiety or avoidance had weaker tie strength,\" said Gillath. \"Further, people high on avoidance reported lower multiplexity.\"\n\nAlso, people who were more avoidantly attached were less likely to initiate and maintain friendships, and more likely to dissolve ties.\n\nAn earlier study from 2014, also published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, looked at something called \"relationship visibility,\" which essentially means how often people in relationships posted about their partner online.\n\nThe researchers thought people with avoidant attachment styles would show a low desire for relationship visibility, whereas those with anxious attachment styles would seek out reassurance from people on social networks in lieu of getting it from their partner, and thus post more.\n\nThe results supported this hypothesis, and excessive posting about one's lover was shown to be a cover for feeling relationship insecurity.\n\n\"On a daily basis, when people felt more insecure about their partner's feelings, they tended to make their relationships visible,\" the study concluded.\n\nIn other words, someone who scores highly for anxious attachment is more likely to be busy posting on Instagram about their date night with their partner, whereas someone who is secure prefers to be in the moment.\n\nOf course, this isn't an absolute rule -- secure people post on social media too. But it makes sense if anxiously attached people are constantly seeking out validation for their relationship in the form of \"likes\" because they feel insecure.\n\nUnfortunately, anxious and avoidant people are often attracted to each other. The anxious one is pursuing someone emotionally unavailable because it feels familiar, all the time validating their anxious thoughts. Meanwhile, the avoidant one of the pair is safe in the knowledge they have a partner who is constantly after them and won't hurt them.\n\nIt's a toxic cycle, and only exaggerates relationship anxiety, which may lead the anxious partner to post even more on social media to make up for it.\n\nSocial media already has many negative connotations, even though the scientific evidence for it being bad for our health is shaky. It's important to remember that people are always portraying their \"best\" selves in their posts. They could be doing it because they are going through a tough time with their partner, or they might just think it was a good photo.\n\nEither way, it's best not to jump to conclusions about someone else's relationship. But if you think you're posting social media posts a lot more than usual, it could be worth thinking about whether you're being fulfilled in your relationships or not. That way, you can focus your attention on the real problem, rather than covering it up with \"favourites\" and \"likes\" from the digital connections you've learned to seek assurance from.",

                "body": "LONDON -- Santander is on track to launch an international money transfer app in partnership with fintech startup Ripple in the next few months, the bank's UK CEO has confirmed.\n\nNathan Bostock told the International Fintech conference in London on Friday: \"This spring, if not one beats us to it, we will be the first large retail bank to carry out cross-border payments at scale with blockchain technology.\"\n\nBostock name-checked partner Ripple, the fintech company which specialises in cross-border payments through its blockchain-based xCurrent and RippleNet products. He did not give a specific date for launch of the new product.\n\nA spokesperson for Santander declined to comment when Business Insider inquired about Bostock's comments.\n\nSantander invested in US-headquartered Ripple in 2015 and then again in 2016. The bank also trialled an international payments app using Ripple technology with its staff in 2016.\n\nSantander CEO Ana Botin flagged the upcoming launch to customers of the payment app in the group's 2017 results presentation at the end of January, saying the new app would go live in Spain, Brazil, the UK, and Poland.\n\nSantander said when it launched its internal app trial that Ripple's technology allows transfers to be settled within 24 hours, compared to days with traditional cross-border payment providers.\n\nThe tech also lets people find out up front how much a transfer will cost. Most international transfer systems use various middle men to transfer money who will take cuts along the way so the final sum is often less than when it was sent. Because of the covulted process, most processors can't give an accurate estimate of the total cost.\n\nRipple, founded in 2012, is a San Francisco-headquartered company trying to bring blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions to the global payments and transfer market. MoneyGram and Western Union are trialing its liquidity solution xRapid while global transfer businesses such as UAE Exchange use its international transfer platform xCurrent.",

                "title": "'Breaking point': The Lib Dems are falling apart as Cable fails to capitalise on Brexit",
                "body": "LONDON & BRUSSELS -- It was all smiles as Sir Vince Cable and his team made their way out of the Palais D'Egmont in Brussels on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat leader had just enjoyed lunch with a handful of European leaders, who according to his press office, had all signed a declaration of support for Britain to hold another Brexit referendum.\n\nThe lunch -- which took place in a grand mansion a short stroll from the European Union complex -- was attended by figures including Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rassmussen, and Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator.\n\nCable was in a triumphant mood about this apparent European coup, when he spoke to Business Insider following the meeting.\n\n\"They [the leaders] were very supportive. There was no disagreement at all. They were all in the same place,\" he said.\n\n\"Public opinion is moving in that direction,\" he added. \"The Remain-Brexit divide hasn't changed a great deal but what has changed is that a majority of people support the proposition that there should be a vote on the final deal.\"\n\nBut there was a big problem.\n\nLess than an hour after the Lib Dems briefed journalists, the ALDE Group, a cross-party group in the European Parliament to whom the leaders are affiliated, issued a statement saying that \"no statement was agreed upon or issued at the meeting.\"\n\nThe Lib Dem press release had also claimed that Luxembourgish Prime Minister Xavier Bettel and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel attended. However, the former resigned a month ago, while the latter didn't even show up.\n\nQuestioned by BI, a Lib Dem source later said that the leaders had merely reached a \"verbal agreement\" but admitted the leaders had not signed a formal agreement. The party has yet to fully explain how the statement came about.\n\nIt was a humiliating blow for the Liberal Democrats, who in recent years have acquired a reputation among Westminster journalists for boasting some of the most effective and reliable press officers.\n\n\"They fucked up massively,\" an ex-senior Lib Dem told BI later that day.\n\nHowever, BI has spoken to both serving and former Lib Dem staff members, who all said that Thursday's horror-show was a culmination of months of tension and discontent inside Cable's party.\n\nCable succeeded Tim Farron as leader of the Liberal Democrats following the general election, and with a change in leadership came a significant change in personnel within the party's communications unit.\n\nPaul Butters -- a highly-rated press officer who now works for anti-Brexit group Best For Britain - stood down. Butters' departure was planned in advance but nonetheless left the party with a sizable vacuum which needed filling.\n\nHowever, more press officers soon followed him out of the door. \"Most of the press office has disappeared over the last few months,\" a source who recently left the party's HQ told BI.\n\nCable's anointing didn't just trigger a change in personnel within the party's press team -- but a significant change in structure, which quickly caused frustration among employees, numerous sources have told BI.\n\nWhile now-departed press officers were entrusted to handle the party's output with minimal interference from the leadership, under Cable the approach is more top-down.\n\nThe leader's office allegedly insists on scrutinizing every press release before it is published, an idiosyncrasy that has slowed down the communications machine and contributed to declining morale among the current press team.\n\n\"Cable's lost the plot and it's rubbing off on his team,\" one well-placed source said, adding that a senior member of Cable's press team had been \"approaching breaking point\" prior to Thursday's press release disaster.\n\nThe party has not yet responded to BI's request for comment.\n\n\"Cable's lost the plot and it's rubbing off on his team\"\n\nThe election of Cable -- a seasoned MP with Cabinet experience and plenty of respect across the Commons -- was supposed to be the dawn of a new era for the Liberal Democrats, in which it would attract new support from voters put off by Theresa May's hard Brexit Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party.\n\n\"There is a vast opening in British politics,\" Cable told BI shortly before coming leader.\n\n\"We are very polarised between the hard right and hard left. There are millions of people with moderate views who are looking for a party that is shaped like the Liberal Democrats but haven't been supporting us.\n\n\"My job is to turn that potential into political support.\"\n\nHowever, any suggestion that Cable could become the Nigel Farage of the anti-Brexiters has yet to materialise.\n\nAnd with just over a year to go until Brexit, the party remains stagnant in the polls, while Labour and the Tories continue to dictate the political weather in Westminster.\n\nFor some time now this failure to make progress has caused growing tensions within the party. Now after a disastrous couple of days in Brussels, that unrest is starting to creep to the surface.",

                "body": "But it could also force Uber to improve the safety of its autonomous and human-driven vehicles.\n\nA fatal accident involving a self-driving vehicle was inevitable, but no tech or auto company was in a worse position to handle one than Uber.\n\nThe company has spent the better part of the past year cleaning up the mess left by former CEO Travis Kalanick, who oversaw the company's meteoric rise and turned it in into a symbol for the ruthless, growth-at-all-costs attitude that has come to represent the dark side of Silicon Valley.\n\nNow, Uber has the ignoble distinction of being possibly the first company to be involved in a fatal crash with a self-driving vehicle. Immediately after last Sunday's accident -- in which a self-driving Volvo XC90 operated by Uber hit and killed a 49-year-old woman, Elaine Herzberg, in Tempe, Arizona -- local police indicated that the accident probably wasn't Uber's fault.\n\nBut a video released on Wednesday and showing the moments before the accident indicates otherwise. The video reveals that Herzberg likely wouldn't have been visible to the human eye long enough for the car's backup driver to intervene, but the sensors, radar, and LIDAR systems that detect objects near self-driving vehicles shouldn't have had the same problem.\n\n\"The sensors should have been able to detect her for several seconds before she was struck,\" Navigant senior research analyst Sam Abuelsamid told Business Insider. \"The system did not seem to respond at all. That's a sign that Uber's system really does not work very well.\"\n\nThe video could end up shaping the reputation of the company's self-driving arm in the same way a February 2017 video of Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver defined its current business as careless and insensitive. Even if Uber can perfect its self-driving technology by mid-2019, when it hopes to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service, city governments might not trust the company enough to work with them.\n\n\"Cities might be less willing to work with Uber,\" Abuelsamid said. \"They might be less willing to trust Uber to do the right thing and make sure that their vehicles are safe.\"\n\nThe effects of the accident could extend beyond Uber's self-driving ambitions and undermine one of its fundamental claims: that it's a platform which connects drivers and passengers, rather than a transportation service. Defining itself as a platform decreases the company's liability for what happens to its customers, drivers, and the other vehicles they affect.\n\nIt will be much harder for Uber to make that argument now, according to attorney Neama Rahmani.\n\n\"This death was caused by either their operator or their manufacturer and now, this is going to make them not a technology company, but really a transportation company,\" he told Business Insider. \"And they'll have to step up and pay out and accept responsibility for the conduct of their vehicle. There's no independent contractor driver to blame anymore.\"\n\nWhile that redefinition won't help Uber's reputation or stock price in the short term, it could end up forcing the company to become more serious about safety, which could save the company in the long run.\n\n\"I think the positive thing that will come out of this is Uber is going to invest a lot more in the safety of its riders,\" Rahmani said.\n\nThat process would be painful, but it could end up being the reason the company doesn't become a victim of its recklessness.",

                "title": "Latin America's biggest port just made its largest cocaine seizure ever  --  the latest bust in a thriving drug-trafficking corridor",
                "body": "Brazil as a whole has become a hub for both consumption and transit of the drug.\n\nFederal officials in Brazil intercepted a shipment of 2,052 kilos of cocaine on Friday at the port of Santos in the country's southeast, near São Paulo. It was the biggest bust ever made at the port, according to Brazil's Federal Revenue service.\n\nBrazilian Revenue officials found the drugs at a container terminal at a wharf in Guaruja. During a survey of the containers, customs officials found hundreds of tablets of the drug in three containers, hidden among legal, declared shipments of coffee, sugar, and soy.\n\nOne container held 1.1 tons of cocaine, another had 500 kilos, and the rest was in the third.\n\nThe containers were to be loaded on a ship called the Cap San Marco, set to arrive at the port this weekend, and were destined for Hamburg, Germany; Le Havre, France, and Algeciras, Spain, port authorities told news site Globo.\n\nAuthorities suspected the cocaine was hidden in the containers after they arrived at the terminal. An investigation will be opened to identify the people responsible for the shipment as well as those involved in the attempt to sneak the drugs into the legitimate cargo, according to Globo.\n\nSantos was the busiest port in Latin America in 2016, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. That year, the port saw 3.4 million TEUs, each of which is equivalent to one standard 20-foot-long shipping container. The port accounts for nearly one-third of Brazil's trade.\n\nThe three-square-mile port complex in Santos is surrounded by upscale beachfront condos and three sprawling favelas, which are made up of huts mounted on stilts. The port itself has over the past year processed many of the goods driving the country's protracted recovery from a deep recession, according to a Bloomberg report published late last year.\n\nCocaine has become increasingly common among those goods. So far this year, Brazilian authorities have made six drug-seizures in Santos, totaling about 2,800 pounds, according to the Brazil's Federal Revenue service.\n\nSantos' federal police chief told Bloomberg smugglers active in the port continue to innovate. A recent method has been pulling up alongside ships leaving the port and using lines dropped by cooperating crew members to hoist drug shipments aboard.\n\nA 2017 report found there was 100 times more cocaine in the water of the Bay of Santos, off the São Paulo coast, than there was in the water off US coasts.\n\nJust a few weeks before the bust on Friday, federal authorities intercepted 355 kilos of the drug at the port, also at a wharf in Guaruja. That shipment was destined for Hamburg.\n\nIn a February bust, a diver was spotted near a ship in the port. The diver fled when authorities responded, but 57 kilos of cocaine were found on the ship and in a waterproof bag dropped by the diver.\n\nThe port's previous record seizure was 1,495 kilos, which were found in three containers there in August 2016. Those drugs were bound for Antwerp, Belgium.\n\n2016 also saw a then-record 10.6 tons of cocaine seized at Santos. That mark was eclipsed in 2017, when more than 11 tons were intercepted.\n\nBrazil -- its southeastern corner in particular -- has emerged as a key transshipment point for South American cocaine headed to Europe.\n\nIts porous borders stretch nearly 10,000 kilometers -- three times as long as the US-Mexico border -- much of which is shared with Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, the three main producers of the drug. Brazil itself is also the world's second-biggest cocaine consumer, behind the US.\n\nAccording to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's 2017 World Drug Report, Brazil was the most frequently mentioned non-European country of departure for shipments of cocaine to Europe between 2010 and 2015 -- followed by Colombia and Peru.\n\nAfrican countries also reported Brazil as the most common departure or transit point for cocaine smuggled to that continent between 2010 and 2015, citing it 58% of the time. Second place, Colombia, was cited just 20% of the time.\n\nBrazil was also the most frequently reported departure or transit point for cocaine trafficked to Asia between 2010 and 2015, cited 37% of the time -- again ahead of Colombia, which was cited 19% of the time.\n\nThe southeast corner of Brazil, where Santos is located, has also become a hub for smuggling, as it located near the tri-border region where Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay converge. In late 2016, as the Rio Olympics were in full swing, authorities in Paraguay intercepted a bus loaded with 300 kilos of Colombia cocaine headed for the games.\n\nThat shipment would have stayed in Brazil. But many like it appear headed to Santos. The port sees off as much as 80% of the cocaine heading to Europe, according to a mid-2015 report.",

                "title": "China's 'Great Firewall' is taller than ever under 'president-for-life' Xi Jinping",
                "body": "All of China's online rules are incredibly vague, allowing police broad discretion and encouraging netizens to self-censor before they ever post anything.\n\nIt was 10.07 p.m. on a cool Vancouver evening when Shawn Zhang's phone rang. It was his mom.\n\nBased in Wuyi, in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang just south of Shanghai, she had just received a call from the police. They were asking questions about a post her son, a law student in Canada, had put up on Weibo -- they said it wasn't good and it would be better if Zhang deleted it.\n\nJust a day earlier, China's legislature had voted -- almost unanimously -- to scrap presidential term limits, paving the way for President Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely. After weeks of extensive censorship, where everything from Xi's name to the words \"immortality\" and \"lifelong\" were banned, Zhang wanted to see if retweeting a picture would draw the ire of censors.\n\nSo that afternoon he set up an anonymous account on Weibo, posted a cartoon of Xi encased in glass and draped in a communist flag, and then retweeted it from his own account.\n\nBut before the post was censored or his account suspended, public-security police called his mum. All told, it took fewer than eight hours and four minutes.\n\n\"I didn't expect this picture would trigger the police's response. It is a parody picture, not a political statement,\" Zhang told Business Insider.\n\nIt is not the first time Zhang's posts have attracted scrutiny back home.\n\nEarlier this year, he tweeted a picture of the Tibetan flag with the words \"Free Tibet\" after hotel chain Marriott controversially listed Tibet, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan, as countries despite China's claims to those territories. And last year he gave an answer on the question-and-answer website, Quora, about the disputed Doklam territory which borders China, India, and Bhutan, which received 38,000 upvotes.\n\nBoth times, public-security police contacted his parents to try and convince Zhang to remove the posts.\n\n\"It's really disturbing that police called again and again,\" Zhang said.\n\nBut this time felt different.\n\n\"I also didn't expect police to respond so quickly. It suggests my social media account is probably under their close monitoring. They will read everything I say,\" Zhang said. \"Last time I posted a Tibet flag, police responded because someone reported my posts to the police. But this time, the police's response seems more proactive. I am probably on their watch list.\"\n\nWhether he is on a watch-list or not, Zhang is not alone in thinking censorship in China is rapidly changing.\n\nIn 2018, more than 600 million people will use social media in China -- that's nearly one-quarter of all global users.\n\nBut these people will be faced with more censorship than ever before, according to a new report this month from human-rights organization PEN America, \"Forbidden Feeds: Government Controls on Social Media in China.\"\n\nWhile the term \"Great Firewall\" used to describe the large number of international websites blocked from China -- Google, Facebook, Twitter -- PEN says that censorship on local platforms has soared over the past six years.\n\n\"There has never been a particularly good time for internet freedom in China, or for free expression on social media in China specifically,\" the PEN report said. \"Yet... the space for free expression online has been under increasing and unrelenting pressure by the government under the tenure of President Xi Jinping.\"\n\nIn September 2015, censorship-monitoring site China Digital Times received a rare image of a censorship directive -- usually editors receive tips verbally to minimize a paper trail, deputy editor Samuel Wade told PEN. This particular directive was numbered 320 and came from the Central Propaganda Department. Because this department is just one agency within the government and Communist Party that issues censorship orders, its fair to assume thousands of directives are ordered each year.\n\nAdvanced censorship technology combined with new laws, regulations, and increased enforcement are increasingly being used to \"repress dissident voices and shape online conversation,\" according to PEN.\n\nJust this month, a former prosecutor was arrested for making comments online about the removal of presidential term limits. The Globe and Mail also reported that around the same time a teenager, who posted a tool on Weibo allowing users to connect with people whose accounts were deleted, had his computer seized by the police who also took some of his blood to collect his DNA.\n\nAnd as Zhang's case shows, China's attempts at censorship are no longer limited by geography or technology. Beijing is also trying to crackdown on overseas dissidents whose families are still in the mainland, despite the fact many posts are on platforms like Twitter that aren't accessible in China.\n\n\"Under Xi, the \"Great Firewall\" is getting taller,\" the PEN report said.\n\nThe law, the courts, and the police have all become stricter in the last six years.\n\nIn 2013, the Supreme People's Court increased penalties for posts that are defamatory of contain \"false information.\" If a post is forwarded more than 500 times or clicked on over 5,000 times, the author can go to jail for up to three years.\n\nTwo years later it became illegal to post fabricated content about natural disasters, emergencies, or any reports of danger -- encouraging netizens to closely stick to the government's narrative on major events.\n\nThen last year, a new law made it illegal to endanger the \"honor or interests of the State.\"\n\nNew regulations also urged social-media companies to begin rating users. Companies are encouraged to have a credit system for users, deducting points for disobeying regulations, and to grant the government access to the data.\n\n\"Before Xi Jinping we feared only that they would delete our posts. In the worst situation, they would delete [your account],\" Qiao Mu, an academic told The Guardian in 2015. \"But since Xi Jinping came to power this changed. They began to arrest people.\"\n\nIn 2016, blogger Liu Yanli was charged with defamation and spent eight months in jail for copying a number of short posts critical of Chinese leaders, including Xi, into a private WeChat group.\n\nThe following year Wang Jiangfeng was sentenced to two years prison for using the satirical nickname \"Steamed Bun Xi,\" also in a private WeChat group.\n\nWeChat groups are popular in China, where there can be as many as 500 members in each group. And while there are numerous instances of the government appearing to have read private messages through some sort of back door, such large groups are, as PEN describes, \"leaky by design\" and can easily be infiltrated.\n\nThe problem isn't just limited to Chinese apps though. Despite WhatsApp's encrypted technology, Zhang Guanghong was charged last year with insulting the government for sharing an article that was critical of Xi in a group chat. According to The New York Times, this will be one of the first times conversation history from a non-Chinese app will be used as evidence.\n\nThreats of prosecution pose risks for people who post content but also group creators. New regulations introduced in September last year hold group initiators criminally liable for content posted in any group they start.\n\nThe regulations also require the tech companies to monitor and keep records of chats for six months, and report any illegal activity to authorities. The companies have essentially been ordered to spy on their users.\n\nInterestingly, group chats have more words censored than one-on-one chats, an indicator that China is focused more on dissent growing than it existing.\n\n\"China is more concerned about monitoring group opinion and preventing political mobilization than with censoring one-on-one discussions,\" the PEN report said.\n\nAside from the new laws and regulations, since 2013 there have been seven \"bottom lines\" that social-media content shouldn't contravene: China's rules and laws, the socialist system, the country's national interests, the legitimate interests of citizens, public order, morality, and authentic information.\n\n\"The broad and vague nature of these lists provides authorities with unfettered discretion to crack down on anything they deem inappropriate,\" the PEN report said. \"Additionally, it helps instill self-censorship among internet users, who are left with very little sense of what types of social media postings are appropriate.\"\n\nJust this week, the values of the socialist system were interpreted to require an immediate crackdown on any and all parodies and spoofs.\n\n\"To be safe, a person must pull back in every respect, and moreover must become his or her own policeman,\" China scholar Perry Link wrote back in 2002.\n\nFor Zhang, he's already thinking about what posting online could mean for his family back in China.\n\n\"I was upset at that time because police harassed my family again,\" Zhang said. \"I don't want them to be disturbed. Police calling gave them pressure. I have to think about my parents when I say something online.\"",

Trump was reportedly reacting to a reminder that a budget deadline loomed at midnight on Friday, and he would be blamed if the federal government were to shut down again.\n\nThe optics wouldn't be good since the shutdown would've occurred during a planned visit to his resort in Palm Beach, Florida, according to The Journal.\n\nTrump eventually signed the bill, but not before holding a press conference on Friday during which he criticized the process.\n\nTrump previously assured lawmakers he would sign the bill, but then took a step back with a tweet Friday morning, saying he was \"considering a veto,\" citing the lack of funding for his US-Mexico border wall. Ultimately, he said he was compelled to sign \"as a matter of National Security.\"\n\nThe omnibus bill includes $1.6 billion in additional funding for border security but would only allow for fencing similar to what already exists along the border -- nothing that would resemble Trump's envisioned wall.\n\nAdditionally, the bill does not include a codification of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program -- a program that protects 700,000 unauthorized immigrants who came to the US as children from being deported.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that I am unhappy about in this bill -- there are a lot of things we shouldn't have been in this bill,\" Trump said. \"But I say to Congress: I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again.\n\n\"Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what's in it,\" Trump said, referring to the 2,232-page bill that was released on Wednesday night and passed in the Senate on Thursday evening.\n\nLawmakers from both parties expressed worries about the legislation.",

Trump celebrated it on Twitter last Friday, calling it \"a great day for democracy.\" The president had engaged in months of public attacks on McCabe and his wife, a move that critics described as an effort to push McCabe out of the agency.\n\nThe reason, those critics said, could be related to the fact that former FBI director James Comey, who Trump fired in May last year, told McCabe and two other top FBI officials about his conversations with Trump that may be germane to an obstruction-of-justice case special counsel Robert Mueller is building in the Russia investigation.\n\nMcCabe painted Trump as being out of touch with the rank-and-file of federal law-enforcement.\n\n\"I was sad, but not surprised, to see that such unhinged public attacks on me would continue into my life after my service to the FBI,\" McCabe continued. \"President Trump's cruelty reminded me of the days immediately following the firing of James B. Comey ... the president's comments about me were equally hurtful and false, which shows that he has no idea how FBI people feel about their leaders.\"\n\nMcCabe ended his column with an inspirational message to current FBI officials and people who were interested in a career in law-enforcement: \"To those men and women, I say: Fear not. Set the headlines aside and give in to what draws you to this work. The country needs you.\"\n\n\"There is nothing like having the opportunity to be a part of the greatest law-enforcement organization in the world, working every day for goals that you respect and cherish. It is the best job you will ever have.\"",

                "body": "Doug Jones won the election, becoming the first Democrat to claim a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama in more than two decades.\n\nTwo supporters of Roy Moore, the former Republican candidate who ran for a US Senate seat in Alabama, reportedly contacted the attorney representing one of his accusers and offered to pay him to discredit his own client, according to a Washington Post report published on Friday.\n\nAttorney Eddie Sexton represents Leigh Corfman, who accused Moore of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and he was 32. Moore faced a number of sexual misconduct allegations during his campaign for a Senate seat in Alabama last year.\n\nSexton claimed that two of Moore's supporters asked him to drop Corfman as a client and publicly state that he did not believe her allegations against Moore, according to The Post. The supporters reportedly offered to distribute Sexton's statement to Breitbart News, the newspaper said.\n\nThe supporters said they would pay Sexton $10,000 to cooperate, and would introduce him to Steve Bannon, who led Breitbart at the time, as well as other people in Washington, DC.\n\nSexton's account was reportedly corroborated by recorded conversations, text messages, and other people he told, according to The Post.\n\n\"What they're saying, all they want to do is cloud something,\" Gary Lantrip, an attendee of a private fundraising event for Moore, reportedly said during a recorded phone call. \"They said if they cloud, like, two of them, then that's all they need.\"\n\n\"We got some chance to do something, make some quick little-bitty for you ... and then, on down the line, we can go to D.C.,\" Lantrip said according to The Post.\n\nLantrip's alleged comments apparently implied that, by effectively renouncing his client, Sexton would cast doubt on other women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct.\n\nLantrip reportedly attended rallies for Moore, but was not involved in an effort to compensate Sexton and was not authorized \"to do such a thing,\" according to a statement from Moore.\n\nLantrip and Bert Davi, another associate, did meet Moore, but \"did not have any special access\" and were not \"ever commissioned with any special tasks,\" the statement continued.\n\nWhen confronted by The Post's reporters, Davi said the incident \"was between Eddie and Gary.\"\n\nThough Lantrop did not comment on Sexton's account of compensation, he did acknowledge that he said Sexton would receive legal work from Bannon.\n\n\"I'll protect what I did, because I know I didn't do nothing,\" Lantrip said, according to The Post.\n\nCorfman sued Moore after alleging he and his campaign defamed her after he denied the molestation allegations. Corfman's lawsuit drove Moore to campaign for funds, according to a Facebook post in March. Moore said he was seeking $250,000 after his resources were \"depleted.\"\n\nMoore lost to Democratic Sen. Doug Jones with 48.4% of the vote to Jones' 49.9%, making Jones the first Democrat to hold a Senate seat in Alabama in more than two decades. He was sworn in on January 3. Moore still has not conceded the race.",

                "title": "Dropbox CEO talks about how he went from rejecting Steve Jobs to an $11 billion IPO",
                "body": "Dropbox CEO Drew Houston famously turned down Steve Jobs when Jobs offered to acquire the company. After the rejection, Jobs not-so-subtly implied that he'd have to put Dropbox out of business instead.\n\nOn Friday, Dropbox went public, with its stock popping 35% by the end of the first day of trading, defying the rest of the bleak market.\n\nHouston is probably feeling pretty good about rejecting the tech legend. He's now a billionaire a few times over.\n\nGoing into Dropbox's IPO Friday, there were worries that the company's valuation would be well below the $10 billion that private investors pegged it at a few years ago. But those concerns were quickly squashed. It now has a market cap of $11.03 billion.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider on Friday, CEO Houston said he wasn't concerned about near-term stock price of his newly public company. He told his employees not to focus on what could have been, and could still be, a fluctuating stock price.\n\n\"One thing I tell the team is get used to the stock going up and down,\" Houston said. \"This will be a normal, everyday occurrence... that's outside of our control. So what I make sure the team stays focused on is that our customers don't care if we're public or private. They just want a great experience.\"\n\nDropbox is the first of the so-called tech unicorns -- companies valued over $1 billion -- to go public this year. Music streaming service Spotify will have its IPO in the coming weeks, and Lyft, Uber, and Airbnb, are all seen as the next major tech companies likely to go public either this year or next year.\n\n\"I think we're all excited about this cohort of companies,\" Houston said. \"And I'm looking forward to see Daniel [Ek] take Spotify public. A lot of these founders are my friends. It's certainly a lot of fun to watch them scale their businesses.\"\n\nDropbox may not be mired by accusations of spreading fake news or mishandling personal user data, but it is growing in an environment tainted by a lack of employee diversity. Dropbox released its latest employee diversity stats in February, and they don't look much better than other Silicon Valley tech companies. Women make up 39% of Dropbox's workforce, and the company is 55% white and 32% Asian.\n\nHouston recently joined a group called Founders for Change, a coalition of tech companies and startups that have pledged not to take venture capital funding from groups that didn't have a woman or person of color who could write the check.\n\nIt's one of many efforts to fix the diversity problem in Silicon Valley, but it's not going to happen overnight.\n\nBut one quick fix that can be made is the gender pay gap, when female employees are paid less for the same work. It's simply a matter of analyzing salary data and making sure all employees are getting equal pay for the same work. Houston said that's an issue Dropbox is looking at too.\n\n\"While as an industry we have a long way to go, there are things that are directly within companies' control, and so by all means within our company we take a close look at gender pay equity, and I think everybody should,\" Houston said.\n\nAnd then there's the other black eye on Silicon Valley's reputation. Facebook's failure to protect user data that was given to third-party developers sent the company headfirst into one of its biggest crises since its founding. In a series of interviews this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he's be open to some form of government regulation.\n\nEven though Dropbox isn't a major social network, Houston did say it's responsible for keeping user data stored on its servers secure.\n\n\"We shouldn't wait for [regulation],\" Houston said. \"I think we all realize that it's critical that we trust all the services we use, and that's certainly top of mind for us, as you can imagine.\"\n\n\"I think what the government does from a regulation standpoint, from a policy standpoint, can go in a lot of different directions,\" Houston later added. \"But we want to make sure that we -- whether as a public company or whether as a private company -- are doing everything we can to keep our user's information safe.\"\n\nYou can watch Business Insider's full interview with Houston in the video above.",

                "body": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed the Obama administration for a 2010 ruling that found that bump stocks weren't technically \"machineguns\" and therefore couldn't be banned.\n\nThe Trump administration announced a new proposal on Friday to effectively ban bump stock devices, which were used to accelerate the gunfire of the Las Vegas mass shooter last year.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Justice Department intends to amend a regulation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to ensure that bump stocks fall under the definition of a \"machinegun\" under federal law, thereby banning the devices.\n\n\"After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress,\" Sessions said in a statement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in on the decision on Twitter, blaming the Obama administration's ATF for ruling in 2010 that bump stocks didn't fall under the \"machinegun\" definition.\n\n\"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period,\" Trump tweeted Friday afternoon. \"We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"\n\nThe Justice Department's statement on Friday also indicated that if the proposal is adopted, people who currently own bump stocks would have to give them up or destroy them.\n\n\"If the [notice of proposed rulemaking] is made final, bump-stock-type devices would be effectively banned under federal law and current possessors of bump-stock-type devices would be required to surrender, destroy, or otherwise render the devices permanently inoperable,\" the statement said.\n\nA bump stock is a device meant to be installed onto a semiautomatic firearm, such as AR-15, AK-47, and Saiga models, replacing the rifle's standard stock.\n\nUnlike automatic firearms, which fire continuously while the trigger is pulled, semiautomatic weapons fire one round per trigger pull. But the bump stock harnesses the recoil energy produced when a shot is fired from a semiautomatic rifle to \"bump\" the weapon back and forth between the shooter's shoulder and trigger finger.\n\nSince the shooter is still pulling the trigger for each shot, federal officials previously argued that the firearm technically remains semiautomatic, even as it achieves a rate of fire similar to that of an automatic one.\n\nIt's unclear how the Justice Department is justifying the regulation change, as firearms outfitted with bump stocks still require multiple trigger pulls. But Sessions' statement on Friday said that bump stocks \"allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has been reviewing the legality of bump stocks since December 2017.\n\nShortly after a mass shooting at a Florida high school on February 14 this year, Trump issued a memorandum directing the Justice Department to craft a rule that would ban the devices.",

                "body": "More likely, Mayweather is using the possibility of his appearance in the UFC to make more money off of his celebrity.\n\nTalk of a possible return to the fight game for Floyd Mayweather has grown in recent days as the undefeated fighter teases taking a turn in the Octagon with UFC.\n\nIn the past week, Mayweather has claimed he will be applying for his MMA license and says he'll soon begin training with UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley. Las Vegas odds have even been set for a potential fight in the Octagon between Mayweather and McGregor, with McGregor the understandably heavy favorite at -1000. Mayweather is a +650 underdog.\n\nFirst, it must be said: to anyone strictly following logic, this is a silly idea that will never, ever happen in reality.\n\nMayweather is 41 years old and has been strictly a boxer for the entirety of his fighting career. He would be outclassed by any trained UFC fighter when it comes to kicks, grappling, ground game, and any other aspect of mixed martial arts that goes beyond boxing.\n\nAdd to that the idea that Mayweather might not be going up against just any cage fighter, but rather a possible rematch with Conor McGregor, and the prospect of him stepping into the Octagon goes from ludicrous to outright insanity.\n\nEven Mayweather's closest confidants don't seem entirely convinced he has an MMA turn in him. During a recent appearance on \"Boxing with Chris Mannix,\" Yahoo Sports writer Kevin Iole discussed his recent interaction with Leonard Ellerbe, Floyd's longtime business partner. Iole said that Ellerbe told him he would advise against Mayweather entering the Octagon, before ultimately concluding that it wasn't his decision to make.\n\nBut even with most evidence pointing to the fact that this is only Mayweather teasing and trolling with no intention of actually fighting, one factor keeps the idea of a Mayweather fight in the cage possible: money.\n\n\"Money\" Mayweather didn't get that name by accident. If Floyd has proven anything over the course of his career, it's that he's ready to take a check, and while another boxing match might bring in a big payday, an entrance into the Octagon could prove and hugelyy profitable few minutes for the fighter.\n\nFurther, the UFC has shown recently a willingness to flex its checkbook for the right deal -- a report on Wednesday revealed that UFC is aiming to offer heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua a whopping $500 million in order to sign him to a multi-fight deal that could potentially serve as an anchor for the UFC's foray into boxing.\n\nIf the right amount of money came along -- and granted, it would have to be A LOT of money -- the idea of Floyd taking part in an MMA fight or three is difficult to ignore. We all thought the Mayweather-McGregor boxing match would never happen, and yet here we are a year later, all with $100 less to our names having bought the pay-per-view.\n\nStill, much more likely than Mayweather's eventual MMA career is that he is merely putting on a show to keep attention on him. As Iona discussed during his podcast appearance, as long as Mayweather continues to tease a trip to the Octagon, he can use his social channels to sell ads like the one you see above, capitalizing on the interest in him in a way that doesn't involve getting choked out by another human.\n\nAgain, \"Money\" Mayweather didn't get that name by accident.",

                "body": "However, it's unlikely that any pieces of Tiangong-1 will land or people.\n\nThe first space station that China ever launched is about to return to Earth as a mess of ultra-hot, supersonic space junk.\n\nChina launched Tiangong-1 or \"Heavenly Palace,\" in 2011. After six successful missions to Tiangong-1, three of which were crewed, China abandoned the spacecraft in June 2013. The two-room, 9.4-ton vessel has orbited the planet without any Chinese astronauts on board since then. But in March 2016, China told the United Nations that it'd lost contact with Tiangong-1 after it'd \"fully fulfilled its historic mission.\"\n\nTiangong-1 may reenter Earth's atmosphere sometime around April 1, according to the latest prediction by the Aerospace Corp., a nonprofit spaceflight research company.\n\nWhen that happens, chunks of the space station are likely to rain down over our planet's surface. Some of the gear left inside the vessel may even reach the ground intact.\n\nNo one knows exactly when or where Tiangong-1's debris will land, but the good news it that the garbage will most likely fall into the ocean. So you're about 1 million times more likely to win the Powerball lottery jackpot than get hit by any piece of Tiangong-1.\n\nIt seems like the brightest minds on Earth should be able to pinpoint when and where giant spacecraft will reenter Earth's atmosphere, but it's not so simple. Here's why.\n\nTo circle Earth from about 250 miles up, spacecraft must reach a blistering speed of 17,500 mph. This makes a spacecraft orbit the planet once every 90 minutes.\n\nEven that high up, however, the outer fringes of Earth's atmosphere drag on spacecraft like Tiangong-1. If a vessel isn't sped up every so often to correct its orbit, it will eventually slow down and fall from the sky.\n\n\"You often hear space starts at 100 kilometers [62 miles]. That's based on where aerodynamic forces start having an effect to where you can actually control your [craft] with wings,\" Jesse Gossner, an orbital mechanics engineer who teaches at the US Air Force's Advanced Space Operations School, told Business Insider. \"Above 100 kilometers, it's a lot, lot, lot thinner than down here, and you certainly wouldn't be able to survive. But it's thick enough to slow you down.\"\n\n\"It's really just a guessing game. There's just no way to tell where it's going to land.\"\n\nThat's what's been happening to Tiangong-1, and the reason it will soon fall. But even now -- less than a week from the space station's expected crash -- the timing estimate has a six-day window of uncertainty. It could come down as early as Thursday, March 29, or as late as Wednesday, April 4.\n\n\"The 21st Space Wing, using its global Space Surveillance Network of ground and space-based radar and optical sensors, is tracking Tiangong-1,\" Diana McKissock, a flight lead with the US Air Force's 18th Space Control Squadron, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nGossner said the uncertainty is due to the nature of Earth's atmosphere and how high-speed objects behave in it.\n\n\"You'd be surprised just how inaccurate and random it is because of the atmosphere. Have you ever skipped a stone on a lake?\" Gossner said. \"It bounces a few times, then eventually goes into the water.\"\n\nA hypothetical out-of-control spacecraft like Tiangong-1, Gossner said, might behave similarly to that stone.\n\n\"This thing can bounce off the atmosphere because it's going so fast,\" he said. \"If it hits on its smooth side, sort of like a rock skipping on a lake, it'll bounce. But if it hits on a pointy end, or on one end of a cylinder, in the direction of the velocity, it could dig in.\"\n\nGossner said any large spacecraft that dips below about 125 miles in altitude has just a few days left in orbit -- and that's roughly where Tiangong-1 is drifting now. Once it's around 80 miles up, it'll be within one orbit (about 90 minutes) of crashing.\n\n\"Even if you knew exactly where it hits in the atmosphere, the debris and stuff can spread out to a pretty big area,\" He said. \"It's really just a guessing game. ... There's just no way to tell where it's going to land.\"\n\nWhen space stations come down, Gossner said \"a funny thing\" happens that helps doom the spacecraft: They speed up.\n\n\"You start going really, really fast. Then you get slowed down really, really fast,\" he said.\n\nThis is because the spacecraft is losing its forward speed, which allows gravity to accelerate the space station toward Earth. The air is still too thin to slow it down much, so it plummets faster and faster.\n\nAs the spacecraft falls into thicker air, the drag begins to rip off solar panels, antennas, and other loosely attached pieces. Superheated plasma will begin heating the vessel to thousands of degrees, melting and disintegrating it.\n\nOnly a few types of materials can withstand such punishment.\n\n\"Titanium is a good one,\" Gossner said.\n\nBut there is a chance that some gear and hardware left on board could survive intact all the way to the ground, according to Bill Ailor, an aerospace engineer who specializes in atmospheric reentry. That durability is thanks to Tiangong-1's onion-like layers of protective material.\n\n\"The thing about a space station is that it's typically got things on the inside,\" Ailor, who works for The Aerospace Corp., previously told Business Insider. \"So basically, the heating will just strip these various layers off.\n\n\"If you've got enough layers, a lot of the energy is gone before a particular object falls out, it doesn't get hot, and it lands on the ground.\"\n\nFor example, he said, after NASA's Columbia space shuttle broke up over the US in 2003, investigators recovered a working flight computer -- an artifact that ultimately helped explain how the deadly incident happened.\n\nTiangong-1 is likely to crash over the ocean, as water covers about 71% of Earth's surface. In fact, space agencies try to de-orbit large spacecraft over the Pacific Ocean \"graveyard\" since it's such a huge and innocuous target.\n\n\"So much of it lands in the ocean, that's our saving grace,\" Gossner said.\n\nSome pieces of the Chinese space station, however, may strike land, since the crash will leave a long, thin footprint of debris.\n\n\"The whole footprint length for something like this could be 1,000 miles or so,\" Ailor said, with heavier pieces at the front and lighter ones toward the back.\n\nIf anyone is lucky enough to witness Tiangong-1's atmospheric breakup from an airplane, it may look similar to the destruction of the European Space Agency's 14-ton Automated Transfer Vehicle, which used to resupply the ISS. Once astronauts and cosmonauts unloaded the vehicle's supplies, it was filled with garbage and sent careening back to Earth.\n\nAilor says pieces of China's space station are \"really unlikely\" to hit any people on Earth, though.\n\n\"It's not impossible, but since the beginning of the space age ... a woman who was brushed on the shoulder in Oklahoma is the only one we're aware of who's been touched by a piece of space debris,\" he said.\n\nShould a hunk of titanium, a computer, or another piece smash through a roof or windshield, however, international space law covers compensation for victims.\n\n\"It's China's responsibility if someone gets hurt or property gets damaged by this,\" a NASA representative told Business Insider.",

                "title": "Airlines are increasingly using vouchers over cash  --  here are the secrets for how to use them",
                "body": "Here are things you should look out for when using vouchers to buy a ticket.\n\nOn Thursday, a United Airlines passenger received $10,000 after being bumped from a flight. Contrary to some reports, this was in the form of a voucher and not cash.\n\nVouchers are nothing new. We hear about them all the time, especially if a flight is oversold or when something goes wrong.\n\nAnd they're usually used as compensation in place of cold, hard cash.\n\nIn fact, airlines make it clear these vouchers have no cash value.\n\n\"Airlines give you these vouchers to achieve two things: Solve their problem, such as an overbooked flight, and have you go away,\" travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt told Business Insider.\n\nHowever, the terms and conditions that govern what you can do with these vouchers vary greatly based on the type of certificate you were given and the airline you are flying.\n\nSo it's important you not only negotiate for the highest amount possible but also get clear answers on the terms of use before accepting them.\n\nHere are a couple of things to pay attention to.\n\nFirst, there are restrictions on which airlines you can fly.\n\nThese days, major airlines such as American, Delta, and United, are all members of global airline alliances. As a result, these airlines can sell tickets on flights operated by their alliance partners.\n\nFor instance, United, as a member of Star Alliance, routinely sells tickets on its website for flights operated by alliance partner Lufthansa. Unfortunately, these tickets are not eligible for voucher holders.\n\n\"Electronic travel certificates (vouchers) can be used for travel on United and United Express-operated flights,\" a United spokesman told Business Insider in an email. \"Certificates are not valid for travel on Star Alliance flights or United-marketed flights operated by other airlines.\"\n\nConversely, American Airlines will allow you to use vouchers for flights operated by its Oneworld alliance and AA codeshare partners.\n\nAirlines can also restrict where you can redeem the vouchers. Some vouchers stipulate that they cannot be redeemed at third-party travel agents and websites.\n\nIn addition, the voucher might not be able to take you everywhere you want to go. That's because airlines may place restrictions on destinations or point of origin.\n\nFor example, the terms of American Airlines eVouchers clearly state that it's valid for \"flights operated by American Airlines and the American Eagle carriers for itineraries sold and originating in the U.S., Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands.\"\n\nEven more interesting is the fact that \"flights sold or originating outside the U.S., Puerto Rico or U.S. Virgin Islands or operated by other carriers are not eligible.\"\n\nSo if you happen to be in Spain and want to use your voucher to pay for a flight back to the US, you're out of luck.\n\nThe extent to which a voucher will cover the cost of a ticket varies.\n\nFor example, Southwest Airlines' LUV Vouchers can only be used as a form of payment towards the cost of airfare. The passenger is on the hook for any additional government-imposed taxes or fees, which, in some cases, can cost as much as the airfare itself.\n\nOn the other hand, Delta Air Lines' transportation credit vouchers and American eVouchers can be used to cover both the cost of the airfare and any associated fees or taxes.\n\nSometimes you can even use the value of the voucher on someone else. According to Southwest, its LUV Vouchers are fully transferable.\n\nDelta Air Lines vouchers are transferable, but with some caveats.\n\nFor certificates issued before December 15, 2011, Delta will allow you to transfer the voucher to another passenger by simply giving that person the 13-digit voucher number and the name to whom the voucher was issued.\n\nFor certificates issued on or after December 15, 2011, the value on the voucher can be applied to a different passenger as long as the person to whom the voucher was issued is traveling on the same reservation.\n\nUnfortunately, American Airlines eVouchers are non-transferable.\n\nHowever, even fully transferable vouchers can't be sold. In fact, selling or bartering away your voucher will almost certainly cause them to become void.\n\nInstead of a $1,000 voucher, sometimes an airline may choose to give you two $500 vouchers. Don't worry -- many airlines will allow you to combine multiple vouchers.\n\nAmerican, for example, will allow you to combine up to eight vouchers to pay for a single ticket.\n\nMost airline vouchers are valid for one year after its issuance. However, this can vary, so pay attention to its expiration date.",

                "title": "New emails show George Papadopoulos communicated with Michael Flynn and Steve Bannon during Trump's 2016 campaign",
                "body": "But new emails obtained by The Washington Post indicate that top campaign officials -- in addition to those listed in previous court filings -- knew of and encouraged Papadopoulos' actions and outreach during the campaign to foreign officials.\n\nPreviously-undisclosed emails described to The Washington Post indicate that George Papadopoulos, the early Trump campaign foreign-policy adviser who pleaded guilty in the Russia investigation last year, was in more frequent contact with top campaign officials than has been reported.\n\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to one count of making false statements to investigators about his contacts with Russia-linked individuals. The emails that were described to The Post are in the special counsel Robert Mueller's possession.\n\nPapadopoulos is known to have been in contact via email with several key campaign officials, including former chairman Paul Manafort, former co-chairman Sam Clovis, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and an unidentified \"high-ranking\" campaign official.\n\nBut according to The Post's report Friday, Papadopoulos was also in touch with former campaign CEO and later White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, and campaign advise, and later national-security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nIn one email around late September or early October 2016, Papadopoulos told Bannon he was receiving messages from the Egyptian embassy about organizing a meeting between Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi and then candidate Trump. Papadopoulos was the first individual to alert the campaign to Egypt's interest in a meeting with Trump.\n\nBannon reportedly asked Papadopoulos for talking points for the meeting, scheduled a phone call to discuss the matter with him, and requested that Papadopoulos get in touch with the embassy when they finalized a meeting time.\n\n\"This is a great move on our side,\" Papadopoulos reportedly wrote to Bannon. \"A home run.\"\n\n\"Agree,\" Bannon replied. \"But very hard sell to DJT.\"\n\nTrump, Flynn, and then-campaign adviser Jeff Sessions, met with al-Sissi the next day, and Trump later said the meeting lasted \"a long time\" and that \"there was a good chemistry there.\"\n\nTwo to three months later, in December 2016, Papadopoulos again contacted Bannon and told him he had been in touch with Panos Kammenous, the Greek defense minister and a pro-Russian nationalist.\n\nPapadopoulos reportedly told Bannon that \"they want to sign a government-to-government agreement with the USA for all rights to all energy fields offshore, strategic foothold in the Mediterranean and Balkans.\"\n\nBannon did not reply to the message, but instead forwarded it to Flynn and KT McFarland, who, by that point, was working on the Trump transition team as Flynn's deputy.\n\n\"Will work this one,\" Flynn responded, according to the report.\n\nLater that month, Flynn is said to have told Papadopoulos in an email that his suggestions were \"great opportunities.\"\n\n\"We will examine these and determine if this is something we should take on early,\" Flynn reportedly wrote. \"Stay in touch and, at some point, we should get together.\"\n\nA little under a year later, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his contacts with Russian officials during the transition period.\n\nPapadopoulos joined the Trump campaign as a foreign-policy adviser in March 2016, but his outreach to the operation began nearly eight months earlier, according to the report.\n\nIn July 2015, Papadopoulos reached out to the campaign to inquire about any openings but was rebuffed after months of communications with Lewandowski and Michael Glassner, then the deputy campaign manager and a key figure in the current Trump reelection effort.\n\nHe later went on to work for then Republican candidate Ben Carson's campaign. As Carson's candidacy took a nosedive, Papadopoulos again contacted the Trump team and asked if there were openings, The Post reported. At the time, Trump was receiving significant scrutiny for not having a foreign-policy team, and the campaign subsequently brought Papadopoulos on, along with another little-known adviser: Carter Page.\n\nAccording to court filings, in April 2016, one month after he joined the campaign, Papadopoulos emailed Lewandowski, telling him he had gotten \"a lot of calls over the past month\" about how \"Putin wants to host the Trump team when the time is right.\"\n\nOn May 4, he told Lewandowski and Clovis that Ivan Timofeev, a senior official at the Russian International Affairs Council, had indicated that Russian officials were open to Trump visiting Moscow.\n\nClovis replied: \"There are legal issues we need to mitigate, meeting with foreign officials as a private citizen.\"\n\nPapadopoulos then emailed Manafort and said, \"Russia has been eager to meet with Mr. Trump for some time and have been reaching out to me to discuss.\"\n\nManafort forwarded the email to his associate, Rick Gates, and added: \"Let's discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.\"\n\nIn July 2016, Page traveled to Moscow and met with top Russian officials.\n\nIn August, Clovis encouraged Papadopoulos to pursue meetings with Russians on his own \"if feasible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on June 1, Papadopoulos emailed someone identified in the special counsel Robert Mueller's filings as \"a high-ranking campaign official\" and inquired about Russia. The official pointed Papadopoulos to the \"campaign supervisor,\" whom Papadopoulos emailed with the subject line: \"Re: Messages from Russia.\"\n\nHe added in the email's body: \"I have the Russian MFA asking me if Mr. Trump is interested in visiting Russia at some point. Wanted to pass this info along to you for you to decide what's best to do with it and what message I should send (or to ignore).\"\n\nThe same month, Papadopoulos emailed the unidentified \"high-ranking\" campaign official to tell him he would be willing to travel to Moscow to meet with Russian government officials \"if it's in the interest of Mr. Trump and the campaign to meet specific people.\"\n\nBased on public knowledge, Papadopoulos never went to Moscow for the trip. However, the so-called Steele dossier -- an explosive collection of memos alleging ties between the Trump campaign and Russia -- says that by late July 2016, there was \"a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between\" the Trump campaign \"and the Russian leadership.\"\n\nBy September 2016, the Russian state media outlet Interfax contacted Papadopoulos and asked to interview him.\n\n\"Received a request from Interfax Russian News Agency with Ksenia Baygarova on U.S.-Russia ties under a President Trump. What do you think?\" Papadopoulos reportedly wrote in an email sent to deputy communications director Bryan Lanza on September 9, 2016.\n\n\"You should do it,\" Lanza replied, according to The Post. Lanza said the US could find common ground with Russia regarding the ongoing conflict in Syria, and he also reportedly emphasized the benefits of a potential \"partnership with Russia.\"\n\nAfter Papadopoulos offered to send Lanza a copy of the interview after it was published, Lanza replied, \"You're the best. Thank you!\"\n\nInvestigators also said Papadopoulos sent the Interfax article to another individual after it was published: the shadowy London-based professor Joseph Mifsud.\n\nPapadopoulos first met Mifsud in March 2016. Mifsud wasn't open to engaging with Papadopoulos at first, but he became more interested after he learned Papadopoulos was working on the Trump campaign.\n\nMifsud and Papadopoulos stayed in touch and Mifsud connected the Trump campaign adviser with at least two Russia-linked individuals over the next few weeks: Olga Polonskaya, a wine company manager based in St. Petersburg, Timofeev, the senior official on the Russian International Affairs Council.\n\nMifsud told Papadopoulos in April 2016, just over a month after their initial contact, that the Russians had information that would embarrass Hillary Clinton that came in the form of \"thousands of emails,\" the FBI's statement of offense against Papadopoulos said.\n\nThe next day, Papadopoulos wrote in an email to campaign adviser Stephen Miller -- who now serves as a senior policy adviser in the White House -- that there were \"interesting messages coming in from Moscow\" but did not elaborate on what he had learned.\n\nIn May, Papadopoulos told Alexander Downer, Australia's top diplomat to the UK, about Russia's dirt on Clinton while they were drinking at a swanky bar in London, according to The New York Times.\n\nTwo months later, when the radical pro-transparency group WikiLeaks posted a trove of hacked Democratic National Committee emails online, Australian officials informed their American counterparts of Papadopoulos' conversation with Downer, The Times reported. The FBI began scrutinizing the Trump campaign's Russia ties that month.",

                "body": "People on social media pushed back against characterizing Rollins as \"lovesick,\" saying that this normalizes abusive relationships.\n\nOn Tuesday, officials say that 17-year-old Austin Rollins entered Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County, Maryland, with a handgun and shot two students. He was killed while being apprehended by an officer, according to Business Insider. One of the shooting victims, a 14-year-old boy, was treated for his injuries and released on the same day. The other victim, 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey, died late Thursday night after she was taken off life support.\n\nOn Wednesday, police officers in St. Mary's County revealed more details about the shooting, saying that Willey and Rollins had been in a relationship that \"recently ended,\" according to the Baltimore Sun.\n\nAfter this announcement, some news outlets, such as TIME and ABC News, began circulating a story from the Associated Press that said the motive for the attack was due to the fact that Rollins was \"lovesick.\"\n\nPeople on social media immediately began pushing back against this characterization, saying that it normalizes intimate partner violence.\n\nAnthony Moll, a Baltimore-based writer and adjunct professor of writing, said that characterizing a killer as \"lovesick\" is more insidious than many people realize.\n\n\"Whether we like it or not, the news media set the agenda for the issues the public talks about and the way in which we talk about them,\" Moll told INSIDER. \"For many, 'lovesick' may draw up images like that of Romeo and Juliet, and that not only unnecessarily editorializes the subject, but it does so in a way that may give a toxic and counterproductive perception of the matter to readers. Intimate partner violence is not a matter of lovesickness.\"\n\nTeen dating violence is more common than many people realize. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 12% of high school females had experienced physical violence and nearly 16% had experienced sexual violence from a partner in the year before they were surveyed. The CDC also reports that those who experience dating violence in high school are more likely to experience it in college, too.\n\nChristine Gutierrez, a psychotherapist who specializes in relationship trauma, said that the relationship may have been abusive for some time, but friends and family wouldn't have known how to look for the signs.\n\n\"Abusive and toxic relationships escalate really quickly,\" Gutierrez told INSIDER. \"And many people don't recognize the signs because so much of it is normalized in our culture. Verbal abuse will often transfer into physical abuse, and when you try to walk away, that's actually one of the most dangerous times for the person who is being abused.\"\n\nThis is not to say that anyone in an abusive relationship is solely responsible for anything that happens to them in the relationship. What it does mean, however, is that more people need to be aware of the many ways abuse in a relationship can be manifested.\n\n\"My guess is that this couple had some sort of history of emotional and verbal abuse, at the very least,\" Gutierrez told INSIDER. \"For me, this 'lovesick' phrasing points to abusive relationships and the lack of information people have on them. This [abuse] is happening earlier and earlier on, and people aren't equipped with tools for dealing with it.\"\n\nMuch of this has to do with the stories that get represented in the media, and how, exactly, they are represented -- especially in the media.\n\nMoll told INSIDER, \"We journalists in the US have a long way to go in dismantling the asymmetric ways in which we discuss violence in the context of both gender and race.\"",

                "body": "NEW YORK CITY -- Another San Francisco unicorn made the trip to Wall Street on Friday, as the 11-year-old cloud storage company Dropbox debuted as a public company.\n\nDropbox's $9.2 billion IPO was widely anticipated, on both coasts. And it had a first-day pop of almost 36%, with the stock worth $28.48 at the closing bell.\n\nBut with the champagne all poured out and the confetti settled, it's time for the company to get down to business and start working toward maturity -- not to mention profitability.\n\nLeading that charge is Dennis Woodside, who joined Dropbox as chief operating officer in 2014, after a stint as CEO of Motorola. Woodside is largely credited with helping Dropbox mature its business, and spearheaded its push into business and enterprise sales.\n\nBusiness Insider's Becky Peterson sat down with Woodside at the NASDAQ in Time Square to hear about his thoughts on Dropbox's future, Silicon Valley, and the changing nature of technology for businesses. He shared his thoughts on profitability, growth, why he doesn't like it when Dropbox is called an \"enterprise\" company, and how Dropbox reminds him a lot of his experiences at at pre-IPO Google.\n\nHere are some highlights from the interview.\n\nPeterson: I've heard that from other executives, [...] that the IPO is not the finish line. What is the finish line for you?\n\nWoodside: Well if you think about the state of the world, the state of cloud, and the state of work today, we see lots of problems that are unsolved.\n\nThe first one, that we're focused the most on, is around enabling teams to collaborate regardless of what operating system they have, what device they have, around their most important intellectual property, which often is a file.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors -- they have to collaborate around scouting reports, and they do all that in Dropbox. Or Expedia has to collaborate with its hotel partners around photography or imagery that's going to go on their site, and that all happens on Dropbox. So that's a big problem.\n\nWe think it's still pretty early in the adoption of cloud generally. More than three quarters of our users are outside of the US. There is a big international opportunity, just with Dropbox, the product we all know and love. And then we see opportunities in collaboration around that content, and the first product that indicates the direction we're excited about is Paper.\n\nPaper is a collaborative text editing tool. It's super easy to embed anything in your Dropbox into a Paper. And teams like the team that produces Saturday Night Life use paper to produce that show. They're embedding images of wardrobe and video cuts and project cuts. It's a much more 2018 way of working together than a lot of the other tools that are out there.\n\nSo that's where we're heading -- How do we enable teams to be more effective and creative through technology?\n\nPeterson: So you're looking more at growing your collaboration tools than enterprise storage?\n\nWoodside: Our business certainly started out as, \"let's move all files to the cloud so that you can access them anywhere.\" But we really don't get paid for that. There are other solutions that provide that. We get paid for the collaborative elements of Dropbox. For sharing content, enabling you to view content on any device. For all the integrations that we've built with Salesforce and Autodesk and Microsoft products. So it's super seamless to pull a document from Dropbox and work on it, and get some work done.\n\nStorage is really a starting point for a much broader opportunity that we're focused on. We've built the enterprise \"grade\" security features, functionality controls. Those are table stakes to be able to compete in larger and larger businesses, but that's not necessarily what's going to drive users to move to Dropbox. So we focus on the end user. We deliver value for that end user. Of course we can provide the security that IT needs, but it's that end user focus that differentiates us.\n\nWoodside: The 500 million registered users are important to us. They create network effects that are how we grow. People sign up for Dropbox. Usually they find out about it from a friend. Then they share a file with another friend and that friend signs up. What happens in many businesses, you already have many people using Dropbox as an informal solution before they even pay us. So those users effectively are sales people over time. And that enables us to spend less on sales and marketing than our competitors.\n\nAnd the good news is, the cost of serving them that fundamental storage over time declines, which is why we've been able to expand our gross margins and drive 28% free cash flow margins, which is remarkable for a business of our scale and our growth.\n\nPeterson: You joined Dropbox in 2014. How has the company changed? Are there any big programs that you think have been important in your time there?\n\nWoodside: We've grown a lot. We were about 500 people then and now we're about 2,000. Revenue has roughly quadrupled. From a business standpoint, Dropbox Business existed and was pretty nascent. We had not built some of the controls that were required to compete in larger and larger teams. So we have done that and obviously we're winning in the market lots of larger companies.\n\nI think from a cultural standpoint, Drew and Arash have been really focused on preserving the culture, codifying the values, trying to make sure that as we grow, we don't lose touch with those values.\n\nAnd that goes from who do we hire, to who do we promote, to how do we evaluate people?\n\nPeterson: Can you share what those values are?\n\nWoodside: I'll share a couple. One of them, and one of the most important one, is be worthy of trust. If you think about our business, people are entrusting us with their most important information. It could be project plans, or videos related to Saturday Night Live. and we have to be worthy of their truth in how we secure that information and access that information at all points in time. That's been fundamental to the business.\n\nAnother one is aim higher, so always be stretching yourself, stretching your team, trying to deliver experiences that are magical, and surprising and helpful and delightful. And that also informs our product vision. And we think Paper is that kind of experience where you ind of discover things along the way that you wouldn't have expected the product can do.\n\nPeterson: Is there anything about the Dropbox story that you think surprised investors?\n\nWoodside: I think it's not as well understood that our business, our future, and what we deliver today is about really enhancing the work experience and allowing people to collaborate around content. I think it did surprise people that we have four billion pieces of content, we have a billion AutoCAD files, we have billions of Office docs, and we have 500,000 developers working on the Dropbox platform that integrate Dropbox into all kinds of workflows I think some people who haven't followed the story for a long period of time think of us as that consumer company that we started out as.\n\nPeople like to put you neatly in the consumer box or in the enterprise box. We kind of transcend that in that we have this viral model of attracting users. Those users bring us into businesses and then the real value is in that business use case. And that also our business model -- which is highly predictable and really is a software-as-a-service model. So that story is for more sophisticated investors who have followed us, they get it. But for others who are newer to us, it was definitely good to have a roadshow and to have those conversations and educate people.\n\nPeterson: Were investors under the impression that Dropbox has an unpredictable business model?\n\nWoodside: If your view of Dropbox was 2014, where the majority of the focus was on a more consumer use case -- if that was still your vantage point then you might not have appreciated the traction that we've gotten in businesses. The fact that we have 300,000 paying teams which if you look at the scale of that, we added 80,000 teams in the last year, and Box has 80,000 and they've been at it a lot longer than we have.\n\nWe've added these huge accounts and if you were more of a casual observer of the story, you might not have realized that. The misconception was that we're consumer, not business focused.\n\nPeterson: Do you think it's accurate to say that enterprise is the only way for you to reach profitability?\n\nWoodside: The word \"enterprise,\" to be honest, we don't like. Because it implies very big companies, where as we are able to profitably reach small and large businesses all around the world. And it's rare that companies can do that. If you think about who has been able to profitably reach a five person company as well as 30,000 seat deployment, there's not a lot. There's in the ad business Facebook and Google. In the infrastructure business, Amazon. And it's this self-serve model that we built that educates people when they're in the free product and helps them understand the work use case so they take us into work. That's a very unique approach. So we try not to categorize ourselves because at the end of the day we're serving people at work, and some of them are in very small organizations and some of them are in huge organizations.\n\nPeterson: Let's go back to company culture. I know you spent a lot of time at Google. How would you compare the two companies in terms of style and management?\n\nWoodside: I started at Google in 2003, so before Google's IPO. I want to say there were under 1,000 people at the time, so small than Dropbox is now. I want to say that there are some similarities in that both companies are led by deeply technical, product-oriented founders, and I think that's super important in a technology company. You need that focus on what can technology do? How can it solve a real problem for people. You need that beating heart of innovation in your leadership and for both companies, the founder-led leadership team is super important as well because you have two people in Drew and Arash here who have their heart in the business and they're going to be in it for a long time, and they deeply care about the customers and people here. And that was true at Google as well.\n\nNow, different time, different place, and different competitive environment. All of those things are quite different.\n\nPeterson: What do you think Dropbox's biggest challenges are in the next five years?\n\nWoodside: We don't have limitless resources so we have to pick our battles well. We've done a good job in the last couple of years, like when we moved to our own infrastructure, we did that well. Now we have Paper, and we've proven that the product is delightful and solves problems, and we need to get more people using Paper. That's the next set of challenges ahead of us.",

                "body": "But there is a larger problem with how much personal data is exposed online, either by legitimate companies looking to sell ads, or by hackers.\n\nThe type of personality data harvested by Cambridge Analytica might allow researchers to predict who someone might vote for, but it pales in comparison to what data advertisers collect or what sensitive data is for sale on the dark web.\n\n\"The Cambridge Analytica thing has really resonated with people, but it has pointed out a much larger problem,\" Mark Turnage, the CEO of DarkOwl, a cybersecurity firm specializing in the dark web, told Business Insider. \"The more websites you use the more careful you have to be, because that data is not only being bought and sold for perfectly legal uses, but it's also being bought and sold for illegal uses.\"\n\nThe scope of how much data is being brokered between companies and cyber criminals online has been a concern for privacy advocates for years; everything you do online is tracked some way or another.\n\nAdvertisers, social media companies, and e-commerce websites not only track what users do on their own platforms, but they use cookies to track what other websites or applications users visit.\n\n\"If people really knew how much data was used for companies to learn about them, track them, and sell products to people, they'd probably be a little more careful with their data,\" said Corey Milligan, a senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Armor.\n\nAnd that's just what's legal. Hackers also use malware to target companies and public institutions that store social security numbers, credit card numbers, bank account information, health records, and login information to various websites.\n\nThe marketplace for personal data on the dark web -- the part of the internet not indexed by search engines -- is so big it's almost impossible for security researchers to quantify just how many records are out there.\n\nBut it's unlikely the Cambridge Analytica data, which was improperly obtained from 50 million Facebook users, has made its way on the dark web. The UK-based firm used the data internally, so unless hackers stole it from Cambridge Analytica, the data probably isn't for sale, security experts told Business Insider\n\nPlus, the types of \"psychographic\" data likely obtained from Facebook -- where you live, your likes, dislikes, relationship status, birthday -- aren't as valuable to hackers as the sensitive financial and health records that could be used to steal someone's identity.\n\n\"I haven't seen psychographic data on the dark net, and the reason for that is because if you think about a criminal who is buying data, their desire is to get access to data that can be immediately monetized,\" Turnage told Business Insider.\n\nWhile social security and credit card numbers might be more dangerous than the data Cambridge Analytica obtained, the consequences of the debacle have been swift and far reaching. The scandal has spawned #deletefacebook, outraged users, caused lawmakers to call on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify, and dramatically dropped Facebook's stock price.\n\nTurnage said this is due to the divisive political nature of the debacle.\n\n\"People don't like to feel that someone is trying to manipulate them in a particularly underhanded way,\" Turnage said. \"Campaigns run political ads all the time, that's part of the process -- but stealing data and sending articles to try and influence people's political opinions crosses an emotional line.\"",

                "body": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nBombfell\n\nIn 2007, best friends and Harvard alumni Jason Kim and Bernie Yoo found themselves living in New York City post-graduation with seriously outdated wardrobes. To get by, they dragged their more fashionable friends and family into stores to help them revamp their wardrobes, but a few years later, they faced the same problem again.\n\nAs they clung onto their dating clothes, they felt they needed to find a real solution -- not just for themselves, but for all men. After teaming up with fashion expert Sarah Lee in 2011, the three founded Bombfell, a stylish subscription service that helped men keep their wardrobes updated and relevant.\n\nLike most clothing subscriptions, Bombfell requires users to take a quiz to help determine their style, but that's just about where the similarities end.\n\nBombfell uses a very thorough quiz to ensure you get items that lend well to your style and that fit great. In addition to typical questions about body measurements and clothing sizes, they quiz asks you to describe your style, favorite brands, and even items you never wear (a feature I really like, as it saves plenty of time and aggravation in the long run).\n\nAs harmless as it might seem, receiving a bunch of clothes you dislike, is largely a waste of time. Like other subscription services, Bombfell allows you to send back the items you don't like, but it does an excellent job at getting your order right the first time.\n\nHere's how they do it: Bombfell uses \"human-in-the-loop\" artificial intelligence, which takes the data from your quiz to generate recommended style picks. Then, a Bombfell stylist uses information to handpick items for you. After your style picks are made, you can preview them, and even communicate with your stylist to make further changes and get style advice. The end result is a satisfying box every time.\n\nBombfell\n\nAlthough the brand was created to help guys who either need all the style advice they can get or simply hate to shop, Bombfell is a great choice for even the most stylish of men. To get a consumer's point of view on the brand, I sampled Bombfell by setting up a subscription through the site, and I had a very positive experience. As someone who is very detail oriented and particular when it comes to clothing, I was able to work with my Bombfell personal stylist to make sure I got items that I appealed to me.\n\nWhat I like most about Bombfell is how well they cater to the customer. There is no 5- or 10-item commitment, designed to pigeonhole you into spending money and keeping stuff you don't want. Simply set your budget on items like shirts, t-shirts, sweaters, jackets, jeans, and you'll receive those items in your price range. The ability to preview and edit your order before it ships is also amazing -- this is a rare capacity for subscription services. Still, in the event you receive your order and it doesn't fit or your have second thoughts, you can return or exchange them with free shipping.\n\nBombfell\n\nIn addition to the customizable budgets and and shipment sizes, I was impressed with just how accurate the quiz was. When I set up my profile, I opted for trying new styles over basics, and I selected Ralph Lauren as one of my favorite brands. While I didn't receive anything from that brand specifically, I did get a flannel and a three-button blazer from Grayers, a brand founded by Peter Georgiou, a 10-year Ralph Lauren veteran. The flannel was a piece that fit my existing style and the blazer was a new style that they thought I'd like, and I did. I personally like to pick and choose all the clothes I buy, and Bombfell is the closest subscription to that. If you don't have time to go to the store or spend hours scouring the Internet for clothes, Bombfell is the best alternative.\n\nWhether you're in dire need of a style upgrade or simply want a better way to fill your wardrobe with stylish pieces, Bombfell is where you should look.\n\nIf you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

                "body": "Online retailer ASOS is making an effort to acknowledge body diversity in new updates to its website.\n\nWhile shopping online, Twitter user Eleanor noticed that the brand used photos of three women modeling the Cherry Print Mini Sundress with Strappy Back to show how it fits in a variety of sizes.\n\nSince people come in all different shapes and sizes, it can be difficult to envision how a garment might fit anybody who is not similar in size to the one featured model. This new concept is challenging how brands traditionally use photos of just one sample-size model to present clothing online.\n\nWhen ASOS caught wind of Eleanor's tweet, it confirmed that this development is a work in progress and that it will be rolling out on its app.\n\nIn a statement to Cosmopolitan UK, ASOS elaborated on the goal of its new initiative: \"We're always testing new technology that can make our customers' experience even better. In this case, we're experimenting with AR [augmented reality] to show product on different size models, so customers can get a better sense of how something might fit their body shape.\"\n\nSome people think that ASOS is making online shopping more relatable and that the change means they would make fewer returns.\n\nSome people think ASOS doesn't show diverse sizes.\n\nOthers have expressed concern over ASOS' use of computer technology to map the clothes onto different women.\n\nIn the Size & Fit details for the Cherry Print Mini Sundress with Strappy Back, ASOS lists each model's height along with the dress size that she is wearing. For this particular dress, each model is listed as being 5'10\" and is wearing either a US size 4, a US size 8, or a US size 10.\n\nOne example on the site shows three other models wearing the Midi Ultimate Cotton Smock Dress, representing various heights and a range of sizes.\n\nWhen one Twitter user inquired if the brand will present its men's clothing in the same manner, ASOS responded that it can't confirm yet as it's still testing the technology.\n\nIn the same thread, ASOS replied to another Twitter user to provide reassurance that it will still show all angles of its clothes online.\n\nThough ASOS has been accused of selling insensitive and unoriginal clothing in the past, the retailer has also been praised for promoting body positivity. It seems that the latest change on the retailer's website is part of its continued effort to be more inclusive; in the past, ASOS has used unedited photos that show models' stretch marks and acne scars.\n\nA representative for ASOS did not immediately respond to INSIDER's request for comment.",

                "body": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\n2018 is shaping up to be the year of the Mediterranean diet. Google search interest in this diet spiked a few days into January, around the same time that US News & World Report gave it the #1 spot (tied with the DASH diet) in its Best Diets Overall rankings.\n\nWith all the recent attention surrounding this diet, you've probably heard the term floating around, but what exactly does the Mediterranean diet involve and what are its benefits?\n\nFruits, veggies, whole grains, beans, nuts, legumes, olive oil, and flavorful herbs and spices are the main players. You can enjoy fish and seafood at least a couple of times a week and poultry, eggs, cheese, and yogurt in moderation. Sweets and red meat should be reserved for special occasions.\n\nAccording to US News & World Report, the diet has been associated with a decreased risk of heart disease and shown to reduce blood pressure and \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. It isn't designed for quick or even long-term weight loss. Instead, it's touted for its cardiovascular benefits, nutritional value, and diversity of foods and flavors.\n\nCooking according to this diet might involve more work that you're used to. You must emphasize shopping for fresh ingredients and shift the proportions of foods you regularly consume (e.g. less meat and dairy, more vegetables). However, it's easier to follow than other diets such as paleo or vegetarian because it doesn't ban entire food groups. You can still enjoy all the foods you love.\n\nOne service that makes adhering to the Mediterranean diet more convenient is meal kit delivery company Blue Apron, which started rolling out specific Mediterranean diet recipes at the beginning of March.\n\nThese recipes, available as part of Blue Apron's weekly 2-Person meal plans, align well with the diet by focusing on seasonal fruits and vegetables, lean meats, nutritious grains, and generous helpings of olive oil. Some of the recipes include Roasted Cauliflower & Farro Salad, Chicken Paillard & Olive-Raisin Sauce, and Seared Salmon & Salsa Verde. The meals start at $10.99 per serving.\n\nCurious about this trending diet but unwilling to put my own time into making a meal plan and shopping for ingredients, I opted to take the shortcut and try a couple of Blue Apron's Mediterranean diet meals instead.\n\nThe company sent me two meals:\n\nAll the ingredients for both recipes were packed together in a cold, insulated box, and arrived fresh and ready to cook. After separating them into their respective recipes, I got to cooking.\n\nBoth of the recipes only required two to three pots and pans, and basic kitchen staples like salt, pepper, olive oil, a strainer, and chef's knife. I had no problem with this, as I'm a perennial fan of using the least equipment possible to achieve a great-tasting meal.\n\nTo me, one of the biggest draws of following a recipe is not about the combination of ingredients, but instead how to time the prep and cooking efficiently enough so that everything comes out ready at the same time. Blue Apron's instructions were clear and easy to follow, leading me through the process effortlessly. I tend to be a slow chef when I'm following a recipe, but actually finished both recipes at the faster end of the estimated time frames given (40 minutes for the chicken thighs and 20 minutes for the shrimp).\n\nThe recipes called for a mix of familiar ingredients, like chicken thigh, carrots, garlic, and sweet pepper, and less traditional components, like fregola sarda pasta, capers, and verjus blanc. The latter group I would not ordinarily seek out when grocery shopping for myself, so it was refreshing to be exposed to something unexpected.\n\nIn the end, both meals were delicious in their own way. I enjoyed how the tangy yogurt sauce cut through the hearty chicken, the couscous was filled with oven-roasted vegetables, and the variety of textures -- the round pasta, crunchy peppers, and juicy shrimp -- mingled together.\n\nI really wouldn't be able to pick a favorite of the two, and I didn't feel like I was following a strict diet, despite the categorization of the meals into the \"Mediterranean diet\" label. I could still consume meat, but I was also happy with how much green (and bright yellows and oranges) I saw on my plate.\n\nIf, like many people right now, you're interested in the Mediterranean diet for its flavorful, balanced take on healthy eating, but you don't know where to start or are simply too busy to prepare for it, Blue Apron's Mediterranean diet meals are the perfect option. Blue Apron does most of the grunt work for you by designing the recipes and sending you the ingredients, but you still get to have some fun cooking and you ultimately sit down to a nutritious, tasty meal.",

Richard Branson and Sophia Bush count themselves among the Summit clan, and anyone wanting to join must go through an application process beforehand.\n\nSummit, which has been described as a mix of Ted Talks and Burning Man, is taking its progressive programming to the slopes. According to a report published in The Guardian, Summit's founders envision that the mountain will bring together its community members in a more permanent settlement.\n\nPowder Mountain is still under construction, but these photos give us an early peak inside the Utah utopia.

Now, Spurs veteran Tony Parker is making his shots at Leonard more public.\n\nLeonard has played in just nine games this season but had reportedly been set to return to the team back in February. As Parker implies, it's some second opinions that Leonard apparently hears from that is keeping him off the court.\n\nThe Spurs are in a tight spot without their superstar. Coming into the season they had surpassed 50 wins for 18 consecutive seasons, but currently sitting at 42-30, they'll have to go 8-2 over their final ten games to keep the streak alive.\n\nAdditionally, San Antonio will need to keep up a hot pace if they wish to stay in the Western Conference playoff race. While they are currently sixth in the conference, they are just three games clear of missing the postseason. Seven of their final ten games come against playoff teams.",

                "body": "But by increasing the number of seats in their aircraft and making them smaller, airlines aren't helping to make flights less stressful.\n\nIt seems a day can't pass without a story about a disruptive airline passenger going viral.\n\nOften, the stories are accompanied by videos filmed by other passengers. Together, they create the impression that air travel has become a circus. If your flight isn't interrupted by a passenger climbing onto a plane's wing or trying to open a cabin door in mid-air, you're lucky, it seems.\n\nBut it's difficult to tell if air travelers are acting out more, of if social media makes the most extreme examples of misbehavior easier to share. The answer probably involves both.\n\n\"I don't think the problem is increasing. I think that awareness of the problem is increasing,\" Airways senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider.\n\n\"I think the key difference in today's world is that information if something goes wrong spreads in a way that it didn't previously,\" he said.\n\nBefore, a disruptive passenger \"was going to be, at most, local news,\" Bhaskara said. Today, that passenger becomes national news if the outburst has enough shock value.\n\nAirlines have limited control over their customers' behavior, but, by increasing the number of seats on their aircraft and shrinking their size, they aren't helping matters, according to SmarterTravel senior editor Sarah Schlichter.\n\n\"There is more stress with the travel experience these days,\" she told Business Insider.\n\n\"You have less personal space. Everybody's kind of in each other's face. And so I wouldn't be surprised if that sort of environment is leading a little bit more to people acting out.\"\n\nSchlichter thinks that the frequency with which disruptive behavior is documented and shared might change air travelers' expectations before they get to the airport. If a passenger's impression of air travel is formed by depictions of extreme behavior, that passenger might expect the worst and be more likely to act out of character if something goes wrong. That may not result in the kind of incident that inspires other passengers to pull out their smartphones, but it could make the idea of being rude to airline employees seem more acceptable.\n\n\"I think people sometimes go in expecting the worst, and that might predispose you to more stress and more incidents,\" Schlichter said.\n\nWhile the increased visibility of misbehavior may be out of airlines' control, they can take steps to decrease the odds of a passenger's frustration turning into front-page news. Bhaskara thinks airlines should focus on positive incentives rather than negative ones. That means giving passengers perks like gift cards or free drinks to resolve potential conflicts rather than punishing them for misbehavior.\n\n\"You're going to catch more flies with honey than you are with a baseball bat,\" he said.\n\nBut he cautioned that airlines can't be too generous when they sense a passenger might become a liability. If they're too quick to pay off potentially troublesome passengers, they might create the impression that they reward misbehavior, which could lead to more of it.\n\nNo matter how airlines approach customer service in the social media age, there's a drawback. If they do nothing, they're criticized for being callous or ignorant. But if they design new training programs for employees or update their customer service policies, it might not have any impact on their reputations.\n\n\"The good flights are never going to make headlines. So even if you improve service and more people are happy, does that help you in the court of public opinion? I don't know,\" Schlichter said.\n\n\"I don't know what the answer is.\"\n\nNeither do airlines, who live under the constant threat of having to start damage control on a moment's notice when a passenger or employee's misbehavior goes viral. For them, the question isn't if they'll be at the center of a scandal, but when.",

That gas-chugging V8 on a '78 Chevy would give you just about 160 horsepower, while a modern V8-motored pickup will top 400hp with better fuel economy. It's also hooked up to the internet, is far more reliable, and can be had with all manner of luxurious appointments.\n\nFord has revamped its segment-leading F-Series pickups, and now both Chevy/GMC and Fiat Chrysler's RAM have followed suit. For old time's sake, however, we jumped at the chance to sample the outgoing RAM 1500 when the carmaker flipped us the keys to a well-optioned $63,870 2018 Limited Crew Car 4x4 version of the third-best selling pickup in the USA (over half a million units in 2017).",

                "body": "This is an installment of Business Insider's \"Your Brain on Apps\" series that investigates how addictive apps can influence behavior.\n\nPeople trying to sell you a new car, a fancy phone, or a bigger home might like you to believe that money can buy a whole lot of happiness. But your brain knows that's not true. Money can buy you pleasure, but happiness has to come from somewhere else.\n\nIf you're confused between happiness and pleasure, you're not alone. After all, we've been conditioned to believe that happiness comes from buying that new thing, satisfying that food craving or being in on the latest trend.\n\nEven the dictionaries and search engines get a little confused: If you Google \"pleasure\" the first definition that pops up is \"a feeling of happy satisfaction and enjoyment.\"\n\nBut scientists who study hormones say our brains can tell the difference between a quick rush of pleasure and the long-lasting contentment that is the true definition of happiness. And it's a big one.\n\n\"If you've been told your entire life that pleasure is happiness, then, you know, you're screwed,\" Robert Lustig says.\n\nLustig's an endocrinologist, and author of \"The Hacking of the American Mind: The science behind the corporate takeover of our bodies and brains.\" He was one of the first to study the effects of refined sugar consumption on kids, and now he's worried that tech could be working on our brains in similar, near-addictive ways. He says tech is not quite like a drug, but it feeds a potentially dangerous system of motivations and rewards in our brain, leaving us craving another hit.\n\n\"Technology is a dopamine stimulator,\" Lustig told Business Insider. \"Anything that causes dopamine to rise has, as its end point, addiction.\"\n\nThat's not to say that tech works on our brains exactly like an alcohol or drug problem, because with tech, as far as we know, there are no visceral withdrawal symptoms, like jitteriness or headaches, if you turn off your phone.\n\nStill, there is a dependence we've developed to our phones that is different from a feeling of contentment or calm peace.\n\nThat buzzing brick in your pocket? It's fueling the release of more stress hormones, and our brain's pleasure and reward-related chemical, dopamine.\n\nIt turns out that dopamine touches very different areas of our brain then serotonin, which we know is involved in decreasing anxiety and counteracting depression. Serotonin is so closely related to happiness that it's one of the key ingredients in many antidepressant drugs.\n\nTake a look at the difference between how happiness-related serotonin and addiction-related dopamine circulate in the brain:\n\nAs you can see in the above graphic, serotonin spreads happiness signals out to many different parts of the brain, touching at least 14 different receptors. Scientists like Lustig think this is part of the reason why happiness can be felt in so many different ways: sensations of joy, love and contentment might be sparked during different interactions serotonin has with receptors in different parts of the brain.\n\nDopamine, on the other hand, only has five brain receptors. The neurotransmitter interacts with those receptors to fuel feelings of desire and motivation. Dopamine is involved in regulating many things in our brains: rewards, motivation, pleasure, there's even some evidence it's involved in healthy hallucinations. But because it fuels a cycle of motivation and reward, it will never make us truly happy or content, feeling like we have enough and we are enough.\n\nInstead, our phones have been built to leave us always craving more. They're not inherently bad, but it is something that we should all be aware of.\n\nThe only antidote? To put away our phones, limit the alerts they send us and share time with others, instead of constantly staring at our screens.",

                "body": "It is possible to invest according to SRI principles, but still make the same return on your investments.\n\nIn an age when we want more from everything -- our phones, our cars, to the foods we eat, it's no surprise that investors have begun demanding more from their investments. Beyond financial return, many investors are asking how they can better align their investments with their values, particularly in light of policy shifts that stand to adversely impact the environment, a rapid thinning of the social safety net, and notably, the recent spate of gun violence in the nation's schools.\n\nMany major institutional investors -- like pension funds and mutual funds -- already avoid the stocks of companies whose operations could harm the environment, like oil and gas companies, or those they believe are contributing to violence, like manufacturers or distributors of firearms. This is called sustainable and responsible investing, or SRI for short. These investors have learned that they can invest according to SRI principles, without sacrificing return.\n\nFirst, understand what you already own. For many people, their largest investment is in a 401(k) or 403(b) plan at work, where many of the plan's investments are mutual funds or ETFs. These funds can be made up of dozens, or even hundreds of securities, so you (or your financial advisor if you work with one) will need to do a little digging to find out what you're really investing in. The first place to look is in a fund's prospectus -- found on your retirement plan's website -- that outlines its investment objective and the types of securities in which it invests.\n\nUnfortunately, some funds only provide their top 10 holdings. To dig deeper, you will need to examine your fund's current holdings by going to its website. For example, if your plan holds a Vanguard fund, your next steps are to visit Vanguard's website, search for the fund and, on the fund's overview page, look for its annual report.\n\nOther sources you can use are the Securities and Exchange Commission's website, where funds are required to file their holdings quarterly, or sites like Yahoo! Finance or CNN Money. Likewise, if you own mutual funds or ETFs outside of your retirement plan, you can find holdings information by going directly to that fund family's website.\n\nFor example, do you only want to exclude manufacturers of guns and ammunition, or do you also want to exclude retailers? Or do you want to avoid investing in companies that offer discounts to NRA members? Many brokerage platforms allow you to filter out companies and industries that you wish to not invest in, making it possible to create a portfolio of stocks and funds that is highly tailored to your values.\n\nThen, explore your options for creating the portfolio that matters to you. A financial advisor can be a big help. Firms like First Affirmative Financial Network specialize in sustainable and responsible investing, and connect investors with advisors who are SRI experts.\n\nIf you're more of a DIY investor, you also have many options. Check out companies like Folio Investing where you can set up sector- and security-level filters for your portfolio. Folio Investing (a sister company to First Affirmative), also offers ready-made groups of securities to make building your portfolio easier but in a more cost-effective way than investing in a fund. For those who want to own individual stocks, check out the issuing company's investor relations webpage for its annual report to learn about their commitment to sustainability. Some companies, like Amazon, also have a website about their sustainability activities.\n\nMost online brokerage services offer funds from firms like Pax World, Calvert Investments and Domini that focus on SRI. Similarly, some robo advisors like Swell, OpenInvest and Earth Folio offer automated investing services that make SRI investing easy. If you're already using a robo advisor, ask how you can update your portfolio so it better matches your values.\n\nRather than simply avoiding companies you view as bad actors, consider becoming an involved shareholder. Voting your proxies or filing shareholder resolutions (any shareholder who owns more than $2,000 in stock or 1% of the company can do this) are two ways you can encourage change in corporate behavior.\n\nAligning your portfolio with your values -- whether that's eliminating gun manufacturers or something else -- may take some extra work, but it is very much worth the time.",

Ever since, local and federal lawmakers have floated various school-safety measures to prevent or stop mass shootings, though Helsel said the buckets of rocks have been in place in his district since last fall.\n\nEven the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, the site of last month's shooting, announced it will soon require students to use clear backpacks in an effort to prevent weapons from entering the campus.\n\nHelsel told ABC News the buckets of stones are intended to be a \"last-ditch response to an armed intruder,\" and said in his testimony that the school district's staff and students are trained in lockdown and evacuation procedures they're meant to follow first.\n\nHelsel also said that the district doesn't currently plan to arm teachers with guns, though he noted that one maintenance staff member is armed and has received security training.\n\nInstead, classrooms are equipped with \"a device that makes entry into a classroom extremely difficult, if not impossible,\" Helsel said.\n\nAnd if an intruder does manage to enter, that's where the rocks come in, he said.\n\n\"How can you aim a gun if you're being pelted with rocks?\" Helsel told ABC News.",

                "body": "The purchase suggests Snap could introduce casual gaming in a big way to the Snapchat app, and get into immersive virtual reality.\n\nSnapchat's parent company Snap Inc. has acquired PlayCanvas, a British software startup which powers 3D gaming on mobile browsers and social media services.\n\nPlayCanvas was founded in 2011, and has built an open-sourced gaming engine that powers casual games on Facebook and on browsers. Its technology also allows developers to build and run virtual reality experiences from the browser.\n\nPlayCanvas' technology has been adopted by casual gaming giant King, as well as Disney and Nickelodeon. The PlayCanvas Engine is based on HTML5 and WebGL, two standards that are seen as natural successors to Adobe's now-defunct Flash.\n\nAccording to its site, PlayCanvas' graphics engine is also used by vehicle manufacturer Polaris and global engineering group Trelleborg AB to show off 3D product renders.\n\nUK financial filings show the transfer of PlayCanvas shares to Snap was confirmed in May 2017. Snap also filed to trademark the PlayCanvas name in January this year. It's unclear how much Snap paid.\n\nA source with knowledge of the matter confirmed the deal.\n\nSnap declined to comment.\n\nPlayCanvas has only raised around $540,000 (£381,000) since its foundation, according to public reports. Investors included 500 Startups, DC Thomson, Techstars London.\n\nIts CEO Will Eastcott is still listed as a director of PlayCanvas. CTO and cofounder David Evans is no longer a director, but still works at PlayCanvas, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nHere's a demo browser application showing off PlayCanvas' capabilities:\n\nIt isn't clear what Snap plans to do with the company. It's possible the firm could introduce lightweight casual gaming to Snapchat, and potentially allow third-party developers to create games for the app. Chinese web giant Tencent took a stake in Snap in November so the two companies could work together on mobile gaming.\n\nIt isn't the first early stage European company snapped up by Snap. The firm acquired French mapping service Zenly in June last year as well as the Swiss team behind Strong.Codes, which helps block copycats from replicating code.",

                "body": "Keeping it chilled will help prevent it from degrading and keep you protected.\n\nThe right form of birth control is personal and individualized. Just because your sister swears by the pill doesn't mean that the ring isn't the best choice for you. But if you're going to use the ring, which is slightly more complicated than some of the other forms, you need to know how to use it correctly.\n\n\"The ring is one of those methods that isn't completely intuitive,\" Dr. Katharine O'Connell White, MD, MPH, OB-GYN and an assistant professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University Medical Center, told INSIDER.\n\nBecause it's not something that most people just inherently understand, getting the right information is important. If you've ever considered using the ring, you might have heard something about storing it in the refrigerator, but you might not understand the details.\n\n\"So all drugs and devices come with a temperature range from the manufacturer, which represents the range at which they know their products are stable and effective,\" O'Connell White said. Outside of that range, there are a lot of unknowns.\n\n\"When it comes to the NuvaRing, it's not so much the one ring that you fill at the pharmacy that has to go in the fridge, it's that if you are lucky enough to get multiple rings at once, you want to put the spares in the crisper -- or wherever in your fridge,\" she added.\n\n\"While there is no definitive information about why, it makes common sense that the medication might not be as effective if sorted otherwise, particularly in direct sunlight,\" Dr. Alyssa Dweck, MS, MD, FACOG, an OB-GYN, told INSIDER. \"In other words, leaving your NuvaRing in the hot car while you're at work or at the beach is ill-advised.\"\n\nOnce you're ready to change the ring and are going to insert one that has been sitting in the refrigerator for awhile, you'll probably want to let it warm up a bit before using, if only for the sake of comfort. O'Connell White recommended letting the ring sit out at room temperature for a few hours or so before inserting it.\n\n\"It's amazing how fast 98.6 degrees is gonna thaw that sucker, if you were to put it in cold,\" O'Connell White said. \"That ring's going to warm up very quickly to the temperature of your body, but it will be really frosty until it happens, so I think in an ideal world you take it out a little bit before you need to use it.\"\n\n\"That three-hour rule has to do with the risk of hormones starting to cycle again and the risk of ovulation, it's not because the ring itself can only be out for three hours,\" O'Connell White said. \"So you do not need to throw the ring in the fridge when you have sex.\"\n\nLeaving the ring out at room temperature while you're having sex is completely fine. Just make sure that it's not out of your body for longer than those three hours that your body allow.\n\nAnd make sure that if you ever have more than one birth control ring in your possession at once, that the extras are kept in the refrigerator.",

But the personals section also includes subcategories for romantic relationships like \"women seeking women,\" \"misc romance,\" and \"casual encounters,\" often misused by locals as a way to pay for (or get paid for) sexual relations.\n\nThis new act known as \"FOSTA\" -- now on its way to the president's desk -- allows \"states and victims to fight online sex trafficking,\" which counters the section of the Communications Act of 1934 that previously protected Craigslist from any liability.\n\nThe Communications Act (also known as the Communications Decency Act) says websites can't be held liable for its users' actions, but FOSTA's language makes clear that the old law wasn't intended to protect websites that \"facilitate prostitution,\" and imposes a 10-year prison term and/or a fine on anyone who operates an online service that does.\n\nFinding it impossible to monitor the tens of millions of Americans who use the site every year, Craigslist opted to shut down the personals section to prevent any kind of potential lawsuit under FOSTA.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to Newmark for comment, but didn't immediately hear back.\n\nThe personals section is still where it last was, but clicking on any of the subcategories on the site pulls up a message from the company explaining why the personals section is gone, and wishing well to the people who benefited from it:\n\n\"US Congress just passed HR 1865, 'FOSTA', seeking to subject websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties (users) misuse online personals unlawfully. Any tool or service can be misused. We can't take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking Craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day. To the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through craigslist, we wish you every happiness!\"",

Neither position is Labour's official policy.\n\nA spokesman for Corbyn said that Smith had been \"asked to stand down as Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, and has been replaced by Tony Lloyd with immediate effect\".\n\nA Labour source added that: \"Owen was asked to stand down for repeatedly breaching shadow cabinet collective responsibility on Brexit by advocating single market membership.\"\n\nHe added: \"Those views are shared by Labour members & supporters and I will continue to speak up for them, and in the interest of our country.\"\n\nSmith stood against Corbyn in 2016 following a challenge against Corbyn's leadership by Labour MPs. However, Smith rejoined Labour's top team after the challenge and is understood to have had good relations with the leadership since.\n\nHis departure highlights growing divisions within the party over Brexit, with significant numbers of Labour MPs, as well as Labour members, pushing for the leadership to take a tougher anti-Brexit position.\n\nSmith was backed by former leadership contender and anti-Brexit campaigner Chuka Ummuna, who tweeted: \"what has happened to our party?\" in response to his sacking\n\nIn a statement on Smith's replacement, Corbyn said that: \"Tony is a highly experienced former Government Minister who is committed to ensuring that peace in Northern Ireland is maintained and helping to steer the devolution deal back on track.\"\n\nCommenting on his appointment, Tony Lloyd said: \"As we leave the European Union, ensuring there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is of paramount importance and this will be my number one priority.

The show followed nine law-abiding citizens who volunteered to go undercover as inmates at Atlanta's Fulton County Jail and southern Indiana's Clark County Jail for two months to expose problems from within the system.\n\nWhile some of the inmates' \"life hacks\" were innocuous -- like making jewelry and decorations out of potato chip bags -- others involved using household materials to make contraband drugs.\n\n\"A lot of this stuff is ingenious, it really is,\" Fulton County Jail chief jailer Mark Adger told Business Insider. \"If they would just put their minds to legitimate work, a lot of these guys would probably be millionaires.\"\n\nHere are 13 of the most inventive things the inmates came up with behind bars:",

                "body": "Clue also recently launched a women's centered health website, HelloClue, that offers researched information regarding all things female.\n\nPeriods are super annoying, period. I think it's safe to say most people who get them would agree. But since it's 2018, there's an app and or start-up out there trying to solve every possible problem known to mankind, and luckily, periods are no exception.\n\nThere are in fact countless period tracking apps out there that will help you do everything from predict when your next period will arrive, to track your mood and cravings, to pregnancy planning.\n\nFor this experiment, I downloaded about eight of the top rated period trackers to see which would actually be helpful. I've never been much of a period tracker anyway -- it's just one of those things I always mess up. So, I figured if I could find one that I could actually navigate and remember to keep up with, it was probably a worthwhile app. And, luckily I did!\n\nA lot of the tracker apps out there have very similar capabilities, but I found Clue to be the easiest to follow and navigate. All the apps ask you lots of questions like, when was the date of your last period? How long does your cycle usually last? Will you be attempting to conceive in the near future? It was a little overwhelming and to be honest I didn't even know the answers to a lot of them. Clue lets you straight up answer, 'I don't know,' and move on. I found that to be really helpful.\n\nI also really liked that they explain everything. There is this little \"i\" icon next to pretty much every option or question in the app that tells you the importance of the symptoms they track and why they are relevant to your overall health. I actually learned a lot about myself just from those little articles.\n\nYou can also set the specific reminders you want the app to send you. So, unlike a lot of the other apps I downloaded that flooded my phone with useless reminders like, \"your fertile window is closing\" -- thanks app, but I didn't ask you for that info. Clue lets you decide what specific reminders you want to get. This way you can tailor which reminders you need and which ones you don't.\n\nThe one thing Clue doesn't have that many of the other apps did, was community access. Pink Pad, Glow, Eve, and Kindara, some of the other apps I tried, all had options where you can connect with other users, post questions, and join different relevant groups. To be honest, this didn't really bother me that much, but I can see how easy access to topics that concern users could be helpful.\n\nAlthough, Clue lets you share your cycle information with others privately. I didn't use this feature, nor did I feel like it was that necessary, but many users have said it has helped them avoid lots of awkward encounters.\n\nThe app was also rated the number one period and ovulation tracker app by the Journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, and has ongoing research partnerships with Columbia University, Stanford University, the University of Oxford, and the University of Washington. That made me feel like I could really trust what they were telling me.\n\nClue prides itself on total inclusivity. They don't use \"feminine\" symbols like flowers, butterflies, and hearts. Instead, their interface is purposefully gender-neutral in order to include anyone who gets a period.\n\nClue also recently launched a full-fledged, women-centered website that covers all topics relating to women's health. Their goal is to, \"close the knowledge gap about the menstrual cycle -- with information that's accessible, serious, scientific, and empathetic.\" Their site, HelloClue, offers explanation videos, expert advice, and research backed studies to explain pretty much anything about the female body.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself asking a search engine if you're pregnant -- like 90,000 other people do each month -- try HelloClue, first.",

                "body": "Trump may be unfaithful in his marriages, but he is extremely faithful to his voting basis, Farnan says.\n\nKarl Marx once said, \"History repeats itself, first as a tragedy, second as a farce.\" In the fevered opposition to President Trump among the children of the Age of Aquarius, history is repeating itself as a farce.\n\nSelf-proclaimed progressives are acting like horn-rimmed scolds aghast at Elvis' gyrations. Donning her straight pinned skirt and hair bun to join the other placard carrying women of the sudden temperance movement, Maureen Dowd has hollered that Trump is \"our first porn president.\"\n\nShe is but one of America's sexual revolutionaries to turn on him because of his crassness.\n\nOkay, maybe it is more than just crassness. Trump was a frequent guest on The Howard Stern Show. His third wife posed nude before their marriage. He has qualities that would disqualify him from the local PTA. Yet he is president.\n\nOn this week's 60 Minutes, Anderson Cooper will attempt to prove that Trump cheated on his wife by sleeping with a porn star. Trump has denied the allegations. The explanation being floated is that the porn star was poised to use her incidental association with him (through a celebrity golf tournament) to fan her personal brand in the crucial last days of the election.\n\nHad her \"Make America Horny Again\" tour launched in October 2016 instead of now, the news cycle would have been all Stormy Daniels all the time. Videos of her dancing would have been splashed across television and the internet, her private parts discreetly blurred.\n\nShe was given $130,000 to lay low. That it was paid through Trump's lawyer should not bother the press. They show no interest that $9.1 million was laundered through the law firm Perkins Coie to create the phony Russian collusion narrative.\n\nThe bigger question is why does it matter? The strike zone set by the media during the Monica Lewinsky scandal was that only a repressed Eagle Scout like Ken Starr would care about what the president does with his cigars in the privacy of the Oval Office.\n\nConservatives at the time essentially agreed that marital infidelities among politicians are not disqualifiers. Their gripe was that Clinton's alleged summoning of a state worker to a hotel room to proposition her was classic sexual harassment by a powerful man in the workplace, something Democrats were winning elections by railing against. Then he lied about it under oath.\n\nWhatever Trump's personal peccadillos, he seems to care too much about his businesses to force himself on employees. The closest he comes has been to buy the only legitimate business in America that poses women in bathing suits, crowns the most desirable one, and parades her before the audience's whoops with a bouquet of flowers, which somehow is not sexual harassment.\n\nLook, I didn't make the rules.\n\nThe left is perplexed that Christian voters would support a guy whose first mistress declared \"Best Sex I Ever Had\" in headlines in the early 90s. They can't do that! Russian bots mind controlled them with Facebook ads. There is no other reason they voted for him.\n\nPerhaps American conservatives are more three dimensional than they look from your coastal enclaves, smart people.\n\nIt is a thin view of morality, really, that cannot tolerate an examination of conscience that confesses sins of the flesh. David processed into Jerusalem wearing a loin cloth, dancing \"with abandon\" before the Ark of the Covenant. St. Augustine, after his conversion to Christianity, prayed \"Lord make me celibate, but not yet.\" His live-in girlfriend and bastard son would not have understood.\n\nA religion built upon redemption commences its narrative arc with sin. The great Christian artist Caravaggio killed a man, an experience that possibly supplies the depth and passion in his stunning \"The Conversion of Saint Paul,\" who himself was among St. Stephen's murderers.\n\nVoters long ago discounted whatever is going on in Trump's marriages. He is like many men in the lives of ordinary people: the twice divorced brash real estate developer with lots of money whom they're glad to see at the Church fundraiser even if they do not see him in the pews.\n\nThere is a basic morality to Trump's politics. He may be unfaithful in other relationships, but in dealings with his supporters he has been heroically true. He sticks to his promises under attacks that men with greater reputations for virtue have fled.\n\nIt is not lost on conservatives that they put into office two Bushes, exemplars of public rectitude, who tended to sue for peace whenever the left threatened to expel them from the club of right thinkers.\n\nThe parable Jesus told of the Good Samaritan is about two upstanding members of the community passing a man who was robbed and beaten and thrown in a ditch, and the rogue oddball from the land of strange customs, Samaria, stopping to help.\n\n\"Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?\" Jesus asked.\n\nThe boarded-up mill towns in the Rust Belt had been ignored by the political class until Trump showed up to hold rallies in their skating rinks promising to help. In Christianity, that is a measure of decency.\n\nTrump supporters are not buying the left's current tut-tutting over sex. They know it is contrived indignation aimed only at diminishing a president who threatens their corrupt little world.",

Some people would argue that eating an entire Domino's pizza at three in the morning is a sign that you have at least a couple of problems, but if doing that is wrong, then I don't want to be right.\n\nNo one is more appreciative of the relationship between pizza and booze like Scarpetta, a restaurant in Philadelphia that decided to add vodka-infused pizza to their menu. Unlike most recipes that contain alcohol as an ingredient, it doesn't burn off in this case, and you have to be at least 21 years old to order it.\n\nThe pizza starts off with a Stateside Urbancraft vodka-based dough, but the restaurant also adds a couple of toppings the might be capable of giving you a buzz. The Philly Voice described the vodka-centric dish, saying: The pie is made with vodka-infused pizza dough, layered with vodka-infused ricotta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes, and drizzled with a vodka blush sauce.\n\nIt doesn't come with a shot of vodka, but I assume it's implied you want one when you order it.\n\nWhile the pizza probably won't get you drunk on its own (unless you happen to be the ultimate lightweight), but if you want to give it a shot, it only costs $6 during the restaurant's happy hour.",

                "body": "For those who are vegan, the Spicy Southwest Salad with chili lime vinaigrette is the perfect meal.\n\nJust last week I was placed on a Low Fodmap diet by a nutritionist. I am now gluten-free, dairy-free, garlic/onion-free, and I also have limitations on the number of particular foods I can eat. With all of these limitations, there is really only one fast food chain that I can count on for good, safe food -- Chick-Fil-A.\n\nChick-Fil-A has always been my favorite fast food restaurant, but now it is my only fast food restaurant. If you have a food intolerance, dietary problem or just prefer to follow a specific diet dining out can be hard. There are only so many places you can trust, but thankfully Chick-Fil-A has options for almost every kind of diet, even the most restrictive of diets. Here's what to eat at Chick-Fil-A, based on your diet.\n\nHere's a grilled chicken sandwich on a gluten-free bun with your fave sauce, waffle fries, and lemonade. Whether you are gluten-free by choice or not, Chick-Fil-A takes a lot of precautions to avoid cross-contamination. And you can't even tell its gluten-free.\n\nBeing dairy-free and not being able to get milkshakes kills me every time I walk into Chick-Fil-A. However, if you're lactose-intolerant you can still have most things on the menu. I highly recommend eating enough Chick-In-Strips and Waffle fries until you are fully satisfied.\n\n#Spoon Tip: If you can't have ANY dairy, then you can still enjoy the grilled chicken nuggets or a salad without the cheese.\n\nThe issue with low fodmap is that it is different for everyone. What you can and cannot eat depends on what your doctor allows. That being said, you can definitely have some grilled chicken nuggets and maybe add a fruit cup. Just make sure to pick out the apples if you need to.\n\nAsk for a vegetarian wrap with black beans, corn, tomato, lettuce and cheese at Chick-Fil-A. It is pretty much a mash-up of the grilled chicken wrap (without the chicken ofc) and the southwest salad. Also remember, you can still enjoy one of Chick-Fil-A's milkshakes (I recommend cookies and cream, but be to check out the rankings).\n\nYou can ask for any salad to be made vegan by eliminating the chicken and cheese. The southwest salad is still filling and flavorful, as it is full of black beans, corn, and other vegetables.\n\nOne of the best parts about Chick-Fil-A is the waffle fries. Waffle fries are for everyone. They are gluten-free and fried in canola oil, not animal fat.\n\n#SpoonTip: Let the cashier know about any food allergies so your order can be notated with \"allergy\". They will change their gloves to help avoid cross continuation but remember, there is still always a risk.\n\nNo matter what your dietary restriction is, Chick-Fil-A is there for you. You no longer need to worry packing enough snacks everywhere you go, because as long as you have Chick-Fil-A, you'll always be safe.",

But then, last September, \"Fortnite\" came out with its own, similar, free-to-play \"Battle Royale\" mode - and became a smash hit in its own right, challenging the dominance of \"PUBG.\"\n\nBut at a talk at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this week, Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene, the game's original creator, says he's more flattered by the success of \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" than anything.\n\n\"I've tried to combat the perception that we're competitive with other 'Battle Royale' games,\" said Greene. \"Its great that the space is expanding. We're happy that more and more people are getting to play games,\" he continued.\n\nAfter the session, Greene reinforced the notion in an interview Business Insider after his presentation, saying, \"I don't see us as competing. We are focusing on our game, not anyone else's.\"\n\nIt's a slight change of tune from September 2017, when \"PUBG\" developer Bluehole said that was \"concerned\" about the similarites between the game and the then-new \"Fortnite: Battle Royale.\" At the time, \"Fortnite\" developer Epic Games acknowledged that \"PUBG\" was a direct inspiration for the new game mode, but it wasn't enough to fend off critisism from fans of Greene's game.\n\nThe \"battle royale\" game style first popularized by Greene's PUBG, drops a hundred players onto an island where they must fight to stay alive, until there's one player left standing, similar to \"The Hunger Games.\"\n\nSo-called \"Battle Royale\" games have been exploding with popularity in the last year. \"PUBG\" was the most-played PC game on Steam last year, while \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" recently set a Twitch viewership record with as many as 600,000 people tuning in at once to watch musician Drake play with streaming superstar Ninja.\n\n\"PUBG\" is available for PC and Xbox One, and also just launched for Apple iOS this month. While Greene has said that the game will eventually come to Sony PlayStation 4, he declined to give Business Insider an update on when it will be available.\n\nFor its part, \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" is available for PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and it's currently in a closed testing period for iOS.",

Instead of taking your phone out, you can quickly glance down at your watch to determine whether your friend needs help or someone liked a photo of your cat on Instagram.\n\nOnce you get used to having notifications at a glance, there's no going back to constantly checking your phone, trust me.\n\nWhile the Apple Watch is one of my favorite gadgets, its regular price makes me a little hesitant to recommend it to everyone.

Hamill resigned in the wake of the scandal.\n\nFor his part, Officer Rengering used the massive public attention to sell official calendars featuring his photos. All of the proceeds from their sales went to the Basketball Cop Foundation, a charity that aims to improve youth and police relations, as Rengering continued to work in the police force and explore a career in modeling.\n\nAccording to TMZ, producers reached out to Rengering about six months ago. It's alleged that he'll begin filming season 37 of the CBS show by the of the month. His position at the police department will also allegedly remain open if he chooses to return when he's finished filming.\n\nFor his part, Rengering has made no mention of the reality show, which pits a diverse cast of players against both each other and nature in the hopes of one coming out on top and taking home the grand prize, on his official Twitter account, other social media pages, or his website.\n\nINSIDER reached out to both CBS and Officer Rengering's team for comment about the casting news but did not immediately hear back from CBS.\n\nRengering's management said that they could not comment on \"any casting speculations.\"",

John Thune and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a joint statement on behalf of the committee. \"As a result, we have decided to ask Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before our committee.\"\n\n\"On a bipartisan basis, we believe Mr. Zuckerberg's testimony is necessary to gain a better understanding of how the company plans to restore lost trust, safeguard users' data, and end a troubling series of belated responses to serious problems,\" the two senators added. \"We appreciate the efforts Facebook and its employees have already made to assist our committee and will work with them to find a suitable date for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify in the coming weeks.\"\n\nThune and Nelson also noted that Facebook has not yet responded to a series of questions from the committee about the recent privacy scandal involving the Republican data firm Cambridge Analytica, which are due by March 29.\n\nThe request followed briefings from Facebook officials on Thursday for staffers on various congressional committees. As Business Insider previously reported, many of the committees were unsatisfied with the answers they received, increasing the likelihood of multiple marathon hearings for Zuckerberg in the near future.\n\nThe House Committee on Energy and Commerce also requested Zuckerberg's testimony on Thursday, while the Senate Judiciary Committee is mulling bringing him in after two senators asked Chairman Chuck Grassley to bring the billionaire in for a public hearing.\n\nAnd simple requests for Zuckerberg's testimony might be the tip of the iceberg. Some lawmakers have expressed a desire to subpoena Zuckerberg and Facebook for testimony and any relevant documents for their probe.",

Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and James Lankford.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Trump threatened to veto the bill because he argued it didn't provide enough funds for his much-promised border wall as well as recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program.\n\n\"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill),\" Trump said in a tweet, \"and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"",

                "body": "Warning: Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the \"Helen\" episode of season 2 of \"Atlanta.\"\n\nThere was a lot to digest in this week's episode of \"Atlanta.\"\n\nTitled \"Helen,\" Earn (Donald Glover) and Van (Zazie Beetz) take a trip to Helen, Georgia, for a Fastnacht party (think Oktoberfest meets Halloween). And along with navigating the bizarre costumes and strange games, we also see that Earn and Van's relationship is on shaky ground. The episode ends with the two parting ways.\n\n\"Helen\" marks only the second time in two seasons of \"Atlanta\" that an episode was directed by someone other than Glover or Hiro Murai. Amy Seimetz (\"The Girlfriend Experience\") was brought on to helm, and admitted she was hesitant at first to take on the job.\n\n\"It is one of my favorite shows and I Skyped with Donald and Hiro and I told them, 'I just want to make sure that you guys know I don't know how to direct someone else's script so there's going to be a lot of learning from my mistakes.' And they were like, 'That's what we do, we don't know how to direct TV either,'\" Seimetz recalled to Business Insider. \"So as soon as they said that I was game to do it.\"\n\nFirst starting out her career as an actress (she was last seen in \"Alien: Covenant\"), Seimetz has created a impressive filmography behind the camera with her feature film \"Sun Don't Shine\" and directing two seasons of \"The Girlfriend Experience,\" all of which she wrote or co-wrote.\n\nComing on \"Atlanta,\" Seimetz was relieved to find that she was given little restriction on what she could do. She said a big reason for that was the need for a female point-of-view, as the \"Helen\" episode is one of the rare times in the series when the focus is on the Van character.\n\n\"We haven't gotten to see her internal struggle with Earn, what she's going through while he's trying to make Paper Boy a thing,\" she said. \"I think they wanted a woman to tackle that.\"\n\nIt also helped that Seimetz had an emotional connection to Helen, Georgia. \"10 years ago I had a breakup with my boyfriend in Helen,\" she said.\n\nBut other than that incredible coincidence, she said she didn't recall Helen being as bizarre as the episode depicts it.\n\nAlong with the strange costumes everyone's wearing, at one point Earn and Van are sitting in a circle playing a game that involves two tennis balls being passed around and everyone trying to bounce the ball into two jars in the center of the circle. Puzzled by the game, Earn ends up with both balls and then just gets up from his seat and places the balls into the cartons. Everyone is in awe at what he did and he wins the game.\n\n\"That was completely made up,\" Seimetz said of the game. \"Donald told me he was watching some YouTube video of a Swedish game and he just couldn't figure out what the f--- they were doing. He thought it was just the whitest game that you could ever play. He said, 'When we make it up it needs to be that no one knows what's going on.'\"\n\nSo on the day of shooting, Seimetz and Glover tried to explain the game to the cast. \"People were like, 'I don't get the goal of the game,' and we were like, 'We don't either, we just made it up right now!' I still have no idea why Earn won the game.\"\n\nSeimetz's work will be seen later this season on \"Atlanta\" in episode seven titled \"Champagne Papi.\" She said this episode will focus on Van and her friends having a girls night out on the town.\n\nAnd is the title of the episode a reference to Drake, whose Instagram account is named that?\n\n\"It definitely is a Drake reference,\" she said. \"But the less you know about it the better.\"",

However, Disney fanatics were less than pleased this week when the Mouse House announced it would be closing one of its most adorable rides to make way for a new Marvel-themed land by 2020.\n\n\"At Disneyland Resort, the new themed land will be anchored by the popular Guardians of the Galaxy -- Mission: BREAKOUT! at Disney California Adventure park, which has become the highest-rated attraction at Disneyland Resort since its 2017 opening,\" Disney said in a press release Tuesday. \"The Guardians of the Galaxy will be joined by Spider-Man and the Avengers in what will become a completely immersive Superhero universe.

The rest of the \"A Bug's Land\" attractions are slated to be closed by late summer.

It's that last ride that has everyone on social media shedding a few tears.\n\nStill, not everyone is heartbroken about the land's closing.\n\nDavid Koenig, author of \"Mouse Tales: A Behind The Ears Look At Disneyland,\" told the \"Register\" that \"A Bug's Land\" has \"four off-the-shelf rides that are just horrible. It was unpopular from the start. It's targeted for teeny little kids and most people grow out of it pretty quickly. It's themed really well, the environment is very convincing, but it's just cheap little carnival rides they dressed up.\"\n\nBut, if you're really heartbroken about the loss of this \"chew chew\" train you could always head to Disneyland over the next few weeks to catch its last ride around the track.",

                "title": "Here's what happens in your body when you swallow gum",
                "body": "We have all heard of terrible things that take place inside our stomach when we swallow gum. But is it really that big of a deal if you forget to spit it out?\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nYou may have heard from your 2nd grade teacher that if you swallow your gum, it could stay in your stomach forever. Or worse, it could grow into a rubber tree. Well, that's true. Don't do it.\n\nJust kidding. Swallowing chewing gum isn't really going to plant trees in your stomach, but that's no reason to start doing it regularly. Here's what happens to your body when you swallow gum.\n\nWhen you eat standard food, three processes go to work in your body to turn food into fuel. The first is obvious: Chewing. The process breaks food into smaller and smaller pieces, increasing the surface area. Meanwhile, saliva coats those pieces, delivering enzymes that help break down the food.\n\nFinally, once swallowed, the stomach acids turn any remaining food pieces into mush. This lets the food pass through the rest of the digestive tract smoothly.\n\nBut gum doesn't play by those rules. As much as you chew it, gum doesn't break up into smaller pieces. Because it's gum. Duh.\n\nGum has been around for much longer than you'd think. Ancient Mayans and Aztecs harvested resin from the Sapodilla tree. They would dry it into a 'cha', and chewed it to stave off hunger. Even back then, it was also recognized as a breath freshener.\n\nHowever, most gum today is made from natural or synthetic polymers, most commonly butyl rubber.\n\nIt's used in all kinds of products, including adhesives, fiber optics, sealants, cling film, paper, fuel, explosives, sporting equipment, roofing, bottle stoppers, and tires.\n\nBut don't worry, the butyl in gum won't make you sick. Because it can't be broken down, the wad of chewed gum hits your stomach intact.\n\nYour saliva enzymes and your stomach acid can't touch the butyl in the gum base. But that doesn't mean it just hangs out. Your body is equipped to handle gum in the same way it deals with other food it can't fully digest, like corn and sunflower seeds. The muscles of your digestive tract move it along and eventually flush it out of your system in a day or two, along with everything else.\n\nSo, no, your gum doesn't stay in your body when you swallow it. But that's no reason to start gulping it down by the pack. The more gum that your body has to process, the higher the likelihood that it'll build up.\n\nThis gum mass could potentially clog your digestive tract, causing an intestinal blockage which can trigger stomach pain or constipation. There's a lovely name for this blockage: a bezoar.\n\nAn 18-year old Israeli woman once suffered from a bezoar that blocked her stomach. The problem? Turns out, she had been swallowing at least five pieces of gum every day. The blockage had grown so large that doctors had to break it into smaller pieces and then fish it out of her, piece by piece.\n\nBut chewing gum alone isn't necessarily bad for you. A couple small studies have shown that the act of chewing gum can actually help relax you. Because it can help reduce levels of cortisol -- a common stress hormone -- in your saliva.\n\nSo, feel free to unwrap a stick. You won't be alone. 56% of American chew gum, each about 280 sticks per year. It's a 2 billion dollar industry in the U.S.\n\nBut be wary of swallowing it once done. The occasional piece of gum won't hurt, but with everything your body already does for you, why put it through the extra work? Just don't spit it out on the ground. That's just gross.",

                "title": "9 details you may have missed in the new 'Deadpool 2' trailer",
                "body": "Both the kid and Deadpool are wearing collars at some point in the trailer which could be used to suppress their powers.\n\nIf you'll recall, 2016's \"Deadpool\" more or less beat America over the head with its marketing campaign. For well over a year before its release, the physical and digital worlds were inundated with viral messaging starring the sophomoric superhero. It worked, of course: The relatively low-budget film became one of the most profitable that the superhero genre has ever seen. In comparison, \"Deadpool 2\" has weirdly flown under the radar. There haven't been nearly as many bits of promotion for it, we didn't know the official title until quite recently, and we didn't even have a formal trailer until this morning. But now that the teaser has dropped, it's time to dig into it and see what it reveals about this scatological sequel.\n\nAfter Fox released a quasi-trailer last month, astute viewers noted that Wade Wilson was seen alongside a group of tough-looking folks who bore a more-than-passing resemblance to members of X-Men spinoff group X-Force. Created in the early 1990s, the team has historically been a more lethal version of the X-Men. This trailer makes their appearance official, with Wade declaring that he's forming a group and giving it that name. Fox's reported plan is that the team will move into a self-titled film written and directed by \"Cabin in the Woods\" and \"The Martian\" alum Drew Goddard. In \"Deadpool 2\", the group will include Zazie Beetz's Domino (whose mutant power allows her to alter luck), but the rest of the members are shrouded in a little mystery. It looks like one of them will be beloved third-tier comics character Shatterstar, whose overall deal is that he's a supernaturally gifted mutant warrior. Oh, and Terry Crews is there. But who is he playing? Well ...\n\nAt one point, we see Deadpool looking through headshots of potential X-Force members and comes across a photo of Terry Crews with the name \"Bedlam\" printed below it. Now, this could mean anything, but there is a semi-obscure (and African-American) X-Force character named Jesse Aaronson who goes by the name Bedlam. (Well, went by that name. He's currently dead in the comics.) His gist is that he's a mutant who can manipulate bioelectric fields to mess with people and machines. We don't see Crews do anything like that in the trailer, so maybe they just used the name and nothing else?\n\nIn what is perhaps the most delightful surprise of the entire clip, we encounter a recruitment headshot for none other than \"Catastrophe\" star Rob Delaney. He'll be playing someone named Peter. That's about all we know, but that's more than enough to make this film significantly better.\n\nExactly which one, we don't know. We see her with an X on her shoulder, swinging around a chain-link weapon suffused with electricity during a quick montage about Deadpool forming X-Force, but that's about it. There's speculation that she might be playing either Psylocke or Surge. They're both mutants of Japanese descent (well, Psylocke is an English woman trapped in a Japanese woman's body ... long story), but it's entirely possible that people are just being mildly racist and ignoring the possibility that she's playing a character who isn't Asian in the comics. Psylocke's deal is that she's a telekinetic and telepath; Surge's is that she can absorb and discharge electricity. The latter seems more likely, but then again, who knows.\n\nIt appears that we finally have the basic plot of the flick. We've long known that it would prominently feature Josh Brolin as the classic time-traveling X-Force member/leader Cable, but we didn't know a ton more than that. Here, we see him telling Deadpool he has to kill \"the kid,\" presumably in order to save the future. Wade doesn't want him to carry this mission out. Et voilà: conflict with the eventual resolution! Wait, who's this kid?\n\nIt looks like this is the lad Cable is after. Played by relative unknown Julian Dennison, we see him standing around with his hands glowing while wreckage smokes around him. One of the things he seems to have blown up is an Immigration and Customs Enforcement car. Could it be that he's on the run from anti-mutant authorities and ICE? Oh, and we see him wearing a curious device ...\n\nBoth the kid and Deadpool are seen wearing bulky black collars with little red lights on them. Mayhap they restrict mutant powers? But who installed them? Maybe the people who work for whatever \"DMC\" is? We see a military-ish dude with those letters stenciled on his chest. Department of Mutant Corrections, perhaps? Is that a thing?\n\nThe connection between the X-Men pictures and Deadpool has always been a little loose, but it seems like it'll be strengthened in this movie. We get a brief glimpse of Deadpool wheeling around in Professor X's motorized wheelchair. Will James McAvoy pop up in old-age makeup? Patrick Stewart has said he'd be open to reprising his role as the character, but there's no confirmation of that.",

                "body": "If the two do decide to have children, they will be fairly far down the line of succession.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle haven't even walked down the aisle yet, but that isn't stopping the prince from thinking about his future royal babies.\n\nKatie Nicholl, royal expert and author of \"Harry: Life, Loss, and Love,\" recently shared with Entertainment Tonight that Prince Harry is very \"keen\" to have children as soon as possible.\n\n\"My sources are saying that Prince Harry, particularly, is very keen to start a family, pretty soon after the royal wedding,\" she said. \"He's made no secret about wanting children.\"\n\nNicholl added that Harry's love for his little niece and nephew, Princess Charlotte and Prince George, really sealed the deal for him.\n\n\"I think that moment [for Harry] really kicked in when his brother, Prince William, of course, settled down with Kate Middleton,\" Nicholl said. \"That has definitely gotten Prince Harry pretty broody.\"\n\nHarry may not be the only one with baby fever, however. Meghan has already met both George and Charlotte, and according to Nicholl, she's completely smitten.\n\n\"The reason he wanted Meghan to meet Prince George and Princess Charlotte was so she could see that -- this would be hopefully replicated by them, that they would go on to have children,\" Nicholl said. \"That you marry into the royal family, but that doesn't mean you can't have a regular family with cute children, and here are George and Charlotte to show that that can happen. That was really important to him.\"\n\nThough, it's key to note this is speculation from one person. Who knows, Meghan and Harry may instead choose to live out their lives as the \"cool\" aunt and uncle to the royal children.\n\nIf they do decide to add a few more little ones to the Windsor family, their children will be fairly far down the line of succession. As it stands, Harry is sitting as sixth in line to the throne, behind his grandmother, father, brother, and his soon-to-be three children. Though, you never really know, Queen Elizabeth was also a \"spare heir\" until her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in 1936. So if for some reason William decides ruling the monarchy isn't for him, and his three children decide the same, there would be hope for a King Harry.",

                "title": "I took a $5,000 business class flight on Emirates Airlines  --  here's why it's worth every cent",
                "body": "While I was in the air, I enjoyed fancy meals and cocktails, a full bed, and great entertainment.\n\nBefore September 2016, I was good at flying. I accepted whatever somewhat sticky, very cramped, amenity-free seat any airline would sell me at the lowest fare, transporting me from my home in New York City to wherever in the world I wanted to go, safely. That was good enough.\n\nI'd flown first class, once, over a decade ago, on a family trip to Mexico during which we were re-booked on a later flight but with upgraded seats. I remember eating real food off a real porcelain plate, bragging a little about being a first class passenger. That memory has since faded.\n\nBut then, for a business trip, I was booked on Emirates in business class, from New York's JFK to Milan's MXP. Depending on timing, tickets for this flight start at $5000, which seemed exorbitant to me, until I added up the value of the entire experience. It would later become clear to me that this experience would ruin me for regular-people air travel.\n\nThe experience started before I even left my apartment, when a black car pulled up outside my house and the driver helped me with my luggage and unloaded me at the airport, an amenity all Emirates Business & First Class passengers can take advantage of. Considering a ride to the airport can cost upwards of $100, depending on traffic, the cost of the ticket was already beginning to feel worthwhile.\n\nAt the airport, I checked in, quickly went through security and arrived at the Emirates lounge, which, the desk attendant apologized, did not connect directly to the plane, though most of their lounges do. That was fine with me.\n\nA serene stillness enveloped the lounge, dissipating any rollerboard-fueled, jetlagged mania that pretty much defined the rest of the international terminal outside the doors of the lounge. I helped myself to a bowl of soup, a glass of champagne, and a plate (okay, two plates) of hot food and assorted cheeses from the buffet in the time before my flight boarded. The WiFi was solid, the snacks to accompany the full bar of top shelf spirits were excellent, and I got more work done in a lounge armchair than I had all day leading up to my flight. Considering the time I otherwise would have wasted perusing a convenience-slash-bookstore and fighting for an outlet at the gate, the productive pre-flight hours knocked a few hundred more dollars off my flight's exorbitant cost.\n\nAnd then, we boarded. A lounge announcement encouraged passengers on my flight to head to our nearby gate, where we calmly walked across the jet bridge like the royalty of one of America's lowest-rated airports. There was no pushing, no stifled groaning from passengers getting their last audible moans out to a crowd before squishing into a middle seat. In fact, no one in this boarding group had a middle seat.\n\nA flight attendant guided me to my window seat, asked if I wanted champagne and warm nuts or water (I wanted all of them, obviously) and helped me with my carry on and coat. If only I'd known that boarding a plane could be nicer than getting seated at a fancy restaurant in Manhattan on a weeknight, I would have been traveling like this all along. That is, if I could afford to.\n\nAs we waited for the hundreds of Milan-bound passengers to board below us (literally below us -- the double decker plane made me feel like Kate Winslet aboard the actually nice part of the Titanic while fellow travelers were left to suffer in the lower decks), we business and first classers snacked on our warm (they were really toasty!) nuts, sipped our champagne from real glasses, and scanned through the entertainment touch screens mounted in our mini-compounds, complete with privacy walls.\n\nI flipped through the menu, which offered welcome cocktails, a three-course dinner and a two-course lighter meal before we landed, and as I contemplated whether I wanted lamb or chicken for my second dinner, a flight attendant supplied me with a Bulgari amenity kit. It was stuffed with the type of mini treasures you usually have to not-so-secretly hoard-steal from hotels, only designer branded and all tucked neatly in a chic fabric pouch, complete with a plush eye mask and sleep socks. I stored it in my personal cubby, which was stocked with fresh juices, sodas, and bottled water. A quick run to the bathroom before the plane took off revealed fresh roses in the lavatory, and I started contemplating get rich quick schemes to ensure I never had to travel any other way again.\n\nOnce we were in the air, the bar in the back of the upper level of the plane opened, doling out finger sandwiches and more snacks. And though Jennifer Aniston was not back there sipping a Chardonnay, the in-flight glory she portrayed on the Emirates commercials was in tact. I am not famous nor rich, but the in-air staff treated me, and seemingly every passenger, like we were., Though I felt like I and my well-worn Diane Von Furstenberg silk travel pants paired with J. Crew turtleneck pretty much negated any chance I had at fitting in with the business class crowd, the flight attendants never made me feel like I didn't belong.\n\nInstead of pushing an obnoxious cart full of pre-heated trays down the aisle, flight attendants passed by each seat to jot down meal orders, laying down a white tablecloth over our pull-out tray before the feast was served. This was airline pampering at its best.\n\nWhen I was ready to sleep, a flight attendant arranged a light mattress, pillow, and blankets on my seat, which transformed into a flat, dorm-like bed with the push of a button, a type of in-air turndown service I had no idea existed. I wish I could say I slept well, but with all the not just edible, but genuinely tasty food (on real plates!), endless stream of fine wines, and recently-released movies, as well as shows I'd neglected to binge watch over the summer, sleep seemed out of the question. I mean, how could I sleep through the best flight experience of my life?\n\nBy the time we landed the next morning in Italy, I was genuinely disappointed to have to deplane, a strange feeling I'd never experienced in my years of frequent travel. Was it possible -- was this flight not just tolerable, but enjoyable?\n\nThe return trip offered similar amenities, only more pasta, espresso, and Italian snacks in the pre-boarding lounge, which did board directly to the upper level of the plane, saving time and the stress of navigating through a foreign airport. This was it, there was no other acceptable way to travel. Luckily (okay, beyond luckily, sorry), I was booked on the same flight the following month for a conference, and I relieved all the glory of being treated like traveling royalty the entire time I was in transit. My expectations were high, and they were met, but I knew this streak couldn't last.\n\nSince those four separate flights, I have yet to fly Emirates (in any class) again, but knowing how actually enjoyable air travel can be completely spoiled me for any future flights. I went from a person totally okay with curling up in my leggings and sweatshirt into a tiny ball entertained by pre-loaded podcasts for an entire flight to a traveler constantly comparing the lack of amenities, professionalism, and comfort of any seat on any airline to the two roundtrip business class flights I took on Emirates.\n\nAnd while I wouldn't have traded that mode of transportation to get me to and from Milan, part of me wonders if I should never have boarded that elite, top-of-the aircraft class. Nothing compares.",

                "title": "6 months after hurricanes devastated Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the US territories are still in shambles  --  and it reveals a disturbing truth about America",
                "body": "The government needs to provide more funding for hurricane relief, and invite the territories to take part in conversations concerning national identity.\n\nIt's been six months since Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in September, and recovery is very much an ongoing process. Power remains spotty in Puerto Rico; the U.S. Virgin Islands are without a fully functioning hospital. Media attention has waned, though surely it will rise for a host of half-year check-ins, a fleeting spike of attention to go with the other stories that have popped in and out of the national spotlight: the still-uncounted lives lost, the resourceful citizens rebuilding local infrastructure, the spat between President Donald Trump and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, the curious case of Whitefish Energy.\n\nThese are all important, all deserving of far more attention than they received. And yet, six months on, it's increasingly clear that we also need to peer beneath the clamor and hum of these news items and look at more elemental details. We need to grapple with the fact that those of us in the states, including our national leaders, still know almost nothing of substance about the U.S. territories. The issue occasionally crept to the fore in the days immediately following the storm, like when a poll found that nearly half of all Americans didn't know that Puerto Ricans were American citizens, or when Trump referred to U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp as that territory's \"president.\" But for the most part, it has remained subtext.\n\nAs I've read articles and listened to politicians and pundits argue, I've thought of my own travels and friends in the territories, and wondered: How many people in the states, including those with the loudest voices in these discussions, could name a single city in Puerto Rico other than San Juan? Do they know the differences between, say, Loíza and Caguas and Barranquitas? Can they list one cultural tradition of St. Thomas or a major industry, other than tourism, of St. Croix? Do they realize that Puerto Rico has poverty, yes, but also charming small towns and high-rise banking headquarters and James Beard Award-nominated restaurants and the United States' highest concentration of Walgreens and Walmarts? Do the words jíbaro, Borinquen, lechón, or coquí mean anything to those without roots on the island? Do they know that Puerto Rico is officially a commonwealth, not a territory, and understand the differences between the two? Can they list even a few bullet points of the Insular Cases, the overtly racist set of Supreme Court rulings that provide the legal basis for American colonialism? Do they know the history of the mid-20-century Great Migration of Puerto Ricans to the mainland United States, and its cultural and political impact?\n\nThese aren't esoteric pieces of trivia, or at least they shouldn't be. If you can find Iowa on the map and rattle off a few facts about the state (corn, caucuses, Field of Dreams, a really big state fair), you should be able to do the same for Puerto Rico, which has a larger population. That's especially important for leaders in Washington, given that the territories have no full-fledged congressional representation of their own, and given that a certain baseline level of knowledge is a prerequisite for sound policymaking.\n\nThis is nothing new. The five territories enter the national consciousness almost exclusively in times of adversity. Hurricanes, economic woes, North Korea's threats to Guam; the new but already notorious casino in the Northern Mariana Islands, Tropical Storm Gita, which knocked out power and closed schools in American Samoa in early February: all worthy of coverage, but hardly the full picture. It's the view through a kaleidoscope, composed of truths but distorted and incomplete. Absent greater context and understanding (everyday life, history, deep-rooted problems), the territories become stock images of dysfunctional exotic lands or hard-luck case studies for mainland pundits to bemoan within the framework of stateside partisan battles -- in November, a Washington Post analysis found that \"The mainstream media didn't care about Puerto Rico until it became a Trump story,\" and even before that, the story of the commonwealth's debt crisis was often framed as yet another party-line Washington squabble. As I learned during the research for my book 'The Not-Quite States of America,' the most reliable source for everyday news about these regions of America were public radio's foreign affairs program, 'The World,' and, for the Pacific territories, Radio New Zealand. Even in academia, there's scant attention to the territories, barely a mention in standard U.S. history or political science textbooks.\n\nCrucially, the way we talk about the territories -- and the fact that we rarely talk about them -- goes hand in hand with their colonial status. This, after all, is the very core of colonialism: treating people not as equal members of society but as abstractions, policies to be debated, problems to be solved. This isn't unique to the territories (ask residents of Flint, Michigan, or Ferguson, Missouri, or the Navajo Nation if they think their stories are well-told), but it's amplified in these islands; their residents are held not just in low regard but as entirely inscrutable, \"foreign in a domestic sense,\" as the Supreme Court put it in one of the Insular Cases.\n\nAnd just as colonialism thrives on the erasure of individual stories, it also endures by masking its size, obscuring the reach of its talons. Too often, even the most nuanced discussions of Puerto Rico -- like the recent hourlong special on NPR's 'On the Media' -- fail to acknowledge the broader story of American Empire. In my own travels to the five territories, I've been struck not only by the bounty of their distinct cultures but by the consistency of their concerns -- what can appear to be isolated matters are often the result of systemic, historic problems, part and parcel of the story of American colonialism, and need to be understood and addressed as such. Compartmentalization makes it too easy to see issues like economic turmoil, lack of voting rights, governmental mismanagement, or disaffection with being part of the USA at all as purely local matters. But the U.S. Virgin Islands were also hit hard by the hurricanes and have higher debt per capita than Puerto Rico. The Northern Mariana Islands have long struggled to find their economic footing. Guam has a growing (if still small) independence movement. And while some Puerto Ricans don't want to be American citizens, most American Samoans truly aren't American citizens.\n\nThe easiest way to expand and improve the conversations about the territories is simply to include them in existing discussions. We talk at length about the USA's role in the world and American imperialism, yet even the sharpest critiques typically fail to mention the territories, which were the historic starting point for American nation-building overseas and remain America's front lines in the Caribbean and, more importantly today, the Pacific. We talk about the legacy of British colonialism and the need to \"decolonize the curriculum\" of schools and colleges, all while focusing on the colonialism of other nations, not our own. We talk about the rights of detainees at Guantánamo without reckoning with fact that it's effectively a U.S. territory, claimed from the Spanish at the same time as Guam and Puerto Rico, and that decisions made about its legal status directly apply to the everyday residents of the territories.\n\nThe territories should have a place, too, in any ongoing discussion of the nation's complex cultural identity and who can claim to be a so-called real American. Nowhere is this question more discussed than in the territories, with their complicated relationships to mainland United States and their lives that blend familiar Americana with their own distinct traditions and cultures.\n\nGo to Guam, where you'll find the world's largest Kmart, its façade imprinted with silhouettes of lattes, two-piece stone columns that formed the basis of ancient Chamorro structures. Just across Marine Corps Drive is Meskla Dos, one of the island's many purveyors of Guamanian barbecue, which draws from the territory's Chamorro, Japanese, and American roots. Here is the American polyglot ideal, on a plate, in a landscape, imbued in a local culture, alongside an Air Force base that embodies American empire and imperialism near and far and is a major catalyst for the island's burgeoning independence movement.\n\nAnd this, finally, is the most important reason to learn more about the U.S. territories: not out of a burdensome, eat-your-vegetables duty but because they're as interesting and important and worthy of celebration as anywhere else in the USA. Do you have an hour or two to learn the history of Puerto Rican folk music and its interconnected African, Spanish, and Taíno roots? Would you like to see a slideshow of American Samoa's stunning natural beauty, all jagged, jungly mountains and quiet coves, and hear how environmental and cultural stewardship work hand in hand in the territory? Pull up a chair, these are good stories, if only people in the states took a moment to pay attention. News outlets have spent the past year examining the middle America of the Midwest and Appalachia, and there's a cottage industry of similarly focused books like 'Hillbilly Elegy' or the forthcoming Voices From the Rust Belt. But there's no such broad interest in the contours of present-day life in the U.S. territories, no sustained effort to give territory residents a platform to share their joys and sorrows and make their voices heard and show off their complexity and humanity.\n\nIt's time to change that, to keep the territory residents in the spotlight, to listen to them and get to know their lives beyond headlines.\n\nCongress needs to do its part to help the territories, starting with providing more funding for hurricane relief and listening to territory residents more. The Supreme Court should overturn the Insular Cases. And stateside Americans need to engage in the soft activism of increased awareness. Find the territories on a map. Learn their histories and how they fit into the USA's own path to economic and military power. Read their newspapers (there are many online) and their literature: the poetry of Chamorro writer Craig Santos Perez, the graphic novel 'La Borinqueña,' novels like 'Land of Love and Drowning' (set in the U.S. Virgin Islands), politically charged histories like 'The War Against All Puerto Ricans.' (Hollywood, take note: As you talk about representation on screen, consider these and other stories from the territories.) Above all, never forget that the United States is more than 50 states, that our nation is an empire.\n\nAs the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands rebuild on the ground, those of us in the states need to put in the effort to rebuild our own understanding and appreciation of the territories islands and their nearly 4 million residents. It's only when we understand the depths of their shading and complexity that we can appreciate them on their own terms and realize what's truly at stake when disaster does strike.",

                "body": "In the end, I learned that exercise can and should be personal, individual, and of course, healthy as opposed to obligatory or obsessive.\n\nScrolling through Instagram can feel like walking unwittingly through the world's loudest, harshest motivational speech. It's not even a Ted Talk, it's a Ted Scream.\n\nSometimes, I feel as though I can't use social media without being told never to give up or that Beyoncé and I have the same number of hours in a day, usually accompanied by a detox tea, waist trainer or some sort of irresponsibly thinly-veiled claim of \"wellness\" and/or \"self-care.\"\n\nI've lost 100 pounds over the course of two years and I try to exercise at least four or five days a week. I don't need any graphics or quotes to help me get moving, but sometimes, I actually think that I overdo it.\n\nThe problem is that institutions of socialization, like Instagram and TV, tend to lay it on a little too thick with the \"motivational\" speeches, crossing the line from providing a positive pep talk to planting seeds of obsessive self-doubt, guilt, and body-shaming. How can someone actually take \"no days off\"?\n\nIn my case, days off mean feeling guilty and negative and getting down on myself for not following this specific culture of unflinching \"fitspiration\" even though there are so, so many legitimate, healthy reasons to skip the gym sometimes.\n\n\"This mentality can lead to all sorts of problems,\" personal trainer Max Lowery told INSIDER. \"People don't realize that in order for your body to adapt to any exercise stimulus you need to have adequate recovery.\"\n\nThis tested both my body and mind, would help me with focusing on recovery, rest, and leaving behind the compulsory social mentality that can accompany working out.\n\nIt sounds dramatic, but in reality, exercise has become such a part of my schedule that I use it for more than just this obligatory acquiescence of social norms and Insta-voices. It's also a form of therapy and an outlet for me, but one that can walk a thin line between just enough and way too much. I needed to see the other side.\n\nOn day one, I felt like I was treating myself to a much-needed day off. By day three, I'd fallen into the trap of feeling lazy and self-deprecating. By the end of the week, I realized more than a few major ways that working out affects my lifestyle, from my moods to my sleeping habits, and why it was time for me to re-evaluate my own feelings behind exercise.\n\nAfter a week, I noticed a few physical changes, but nothing major. As sports medicine physician Dr. James Ting told Dailyburn.com, it takes longer than a week for any troubling, noticeable, tangible changes to really take effect. And according to Dr. Ting, the better shape you're in, the longer it'll take for time off to show.\n\nI didn't feel as physically awake, let alone as limber and active as I do once I've completed a workout. According to Livestrong.com, this could be caused by sitting around and remaining stationary, which can translate into muscle and bone weakness if made into a long-term habit.\n\nI also realized that at the end of the week, my sleep schedule seemed less consistent and I wasn't able to sleep as soundly as I do when I'm working out on a consistent basis. According to Men's Fitness, exercise leads to deeper REM sleep, helping the body repair and restore itself after being worked in different ways or areas.\n\nTo put it simply, exercise releases hormones called endorphins, which make us feel better and improve our mood, alleviating a plethora of negative mental health ailments or symptoms. I was essentially depriving myself of these endorphins, which have been called a \"miracle drug,\" for a week.\n\nI use going to the gym as a time to take care of myself and do something healthy for myself. It's necessary maintenance that also gives me 45 minutes or an hour to think, to focus, and to leave my problems at home or at work. Not having that time to silence the noise, as well as missing out on the post-workout adrenaline rush, just wasn't as fun.\n\nI've learned that it's about finding a balance. Do I want to feel obligated to go to the gym because of social pressures? No, that's not healthy or sustainable. It's wrong. But should I also skip the gym on a consistent basis? Absolutely not. There are a lot of healthy benefits to setting aside some time to exercise.\n\nIt's about crafting and creating a schedule for yourself and with the right intentions. It can't be all Instagram quotes or motivational speeches. That's not realistic. It should be about you, your goals, and your own health without anyone else's dictation.\n\nThere are going to be days off and that's ok because everybody is different. Even Beyoncé.",

Apple Stores have rules that govern everything from how employees interact with customers to the exact angle laptops should be placed in.\n\nApple retail boss Angela Ahrendts explained in 2016 that the company wants its stores to be places you go to meet people, like a gathering place or a town hall.\n\nBut if you've visited an Apple Store recently, you may have found that this idealistic vision of a town hall isn't quite the reality. Long wait times, confusion, and overcrowding have become the norm at Apple Stores, with some customers even comparing the shopping experience to being at the DMV.\n\nApple isn't the only place that provides tech support on Apple devices, nor is it the only place that sells them. Best Buy has partnered with Apple to become an authorized service provider, in addition to creating what is essentially a mini Apple Store within Best Buy locations.\n\nBest Buy also has its own equivalent to the Genius Bar, called the Geek Squad, which can service both Apple and non-Apple products.\n\nTo see how Best Buy's retail experience stacks up against the Apple Store, I visited the two stores in Downtown Manhattan back to back.

                "body": "Pack it in, folks. The stock market may have already topped for the year.\n\nSo says Morgan Stanley, which is troubled by a series of factors signaling the end of a so-called melt-up period that has seen investors flood into US stocks with little regard for underlying fundamentals.\n\nMajor US indexes are operating at a handicap, having plummeted more than 10% over a 10-day period ending in early February. Given that suppressed starting point, Morgan Stanley outlines two reasons it'll be difficult for stocks to get back to the rarefied air they experienced when hitting records in January.\n\nThe first headwind is the resurgence of volatility in stocks. After staying locked near record lows for much of 2017, the Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX -- also known as the equity market's fear gauge -- has surged since the 10% correction, at one point more than doubling.\n\nThe two charts below show this dynamic in action. The one on the left shows gross leverage by Morgan Stanley's hedge fund clients, which serves as a proxy for risk sentiment. The gauge saw a large decline near the time of the correction, suggesting risk thresholds have adjusted to the downside.\n\nMeanwhile, the chart on the right shows a different measure of risk held by investors. It too saw a sharp decline amid the market turmoil last month.\n\nIf the market stays choppy relative to recent history, as it has been since the correction, Morgan Stanley says it'll be difficult for both risk measures to reach previous highs.\n\n\"We think January was the top for sentiment, if not prices, for the year,\" Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, wrote in a client note. \"With volatility moving higher, we think it will be difficult for institutional clients to gross up to or beyond the January peaks.\"\n\nThe second major risk facing US equity investors, Morgan Stanley says, is retail sentiment that appears to have already peaked. For evidence of this, look no further than the chart below, showing that trader bullishness hit a multiyear high earlier this year.\n\nAnd while the firm says this recent peak in sentiment isn't a great standalone bearish indicator, it says it's \"unlikely retail will reach higher heights of excitement this year.\"\n\n\"January's move was perhaps just a punctuation mark on a 59% rally in the S&P 500 from the February 2016 lows,\" Wilson said. \"By the time people are calling for a melt-up, it is basically over.\"",

Well you should be, considering the catastrophic effect it could have on markets.\n\nBarclays has constructed a scenario where retaliation in response to President Donald Trump's recently instated steel and aluminum tariffs amounts to a 10% across-the-board tax on all US imports -- and it's not pretty. The firm estimates such a tariff would cost the benchmark S&P 500 roughly 11% on an earnings-per-share basis.\n\nThat sort of hit would \"completely offset the positive fiscal stimulus from tax reform,\" Maneesh Deshpande, head of equity derivatives strategy at Barclays, wrote in a recent client note.\n\nIt's important to note that Deshpande admits this scenario is merely a low-probability tail risk at this point. However, he argues this isn't even the worst-case outcome, pointing out that his scenario doesn't factor in secondary effects on global growth and sentiment.\n\nWith those caveats in mind, Deshpande says the likelihood of a trade war has been rising in recent weeks, driving a greater need for investor protection should the situation escalate. And he has a specific trade recommendation for those looking to head off possible market negativity -- one that's measured enough to fit an environment where a full-on trade war is still a long shot.\n\nBefore we get into the nitty gritty of the strategy, note that Deshpande's recommendation involves the SPDR Industrial Select Sector ETF (XLI), which he says is most vulnerable in a trade war. And the trade is built around the fact that XLI is still expensive relative to the S&P 500.\n\nHere's Deshpande's full recommendation (note that put contracts are wagers the underlying asset will fall):\n\n\"The market is not currently pricing in the tail risk of a trade war,\" he said. \"Which provides us with a good entry point to hedge the asymmetric downside risks to industrials.\"",

                "body": "The bank provides some recommendations around how to deal with these dynamics -- one of which involves sticking with a familiar favorite.\n\nWhen the stock market doesn't behave the way one might expect, that's actually when some of the best opportunities crop up.\n\nSuch a situation is playing out right now, as so-called growth stocks continue a prolonged stretch of dominance.\n\nA long-short growth investment factor maintained by Goldman Sachs has returned 5% in the past month, putting it in the 98th percentile of historical monthly returns. What's more, the strategy gained 9% in 2017, its best calendar year since 2007.\n\nWith this in mind, popular intuition may suggest growth would soon give way to the so-called value trade, which involves scooping up stocks at prices deemed undervalued. After all, throughout the history of the stock market, these two strategies have alternated leadership.\n\nIn what Goldman describes as a \"surprising twist,\" such a reversal is not imminent. In fact, the firm says growth stocks have further to run.\n\nFirst, despite their recent streak of outperformance, growth stocks remain attractively priced. For example, firms with long-term growth estimates of 20% to 30% are trading at a median price-to-earnings multiple of 22 times, which is in just the 58th percentile, according to Goldman data.\n\nThe second argument in favor of growth stocks is one based around a market measure called dispersion, which measures the magnitude of single-security moves compared with a benchmark index. That the measure is so tight marks another shortcoming of the value trade. For context, wider dispersion has historically preceded value outperformance.\n\n\"Unlike the growth rally in the late 1990s, which widened P/E dispersion and set the stage for value outperformance from 2000-02, today there appears to be less potential energy stored for a value stock rebound,\" David Kostin, Goldman's chief US equity strategist, wrote in a client note.\n\nSo what does this all mean for you, the investor? For starters, perhaps you should start seeking out exposure to the growth trade, if you haven't already. And if you still wish to stubbornly cling to a value trade, Goldman recommends healthcare above all other industries -- because that's where dispersion is the widest.\n\nIf you wish to stick with growth, Goldman has a 50-stock basket of companies spanning all 11 major industries. The stocks in the group are based on realized and consensus forward earnings and sales growth. Here's a five-company sampling: Netflix, Costco Wholesale, E-Trade Financial, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and Micron Technology.",

                "body": "One Wall Street expert thinks the stock market can recover and even hit new highs in the coming months.\n\nA quick glance at a chart of US equity performance suggests the market is rebounding nicely from the 10% correction it suffered in early February. And while it hasn't exactly been a smooth ride, the benchmark S&P 500 is still just 4% from its all-time high.\n\nBut Bank of America Merrill Lynch says it should be doing even better, considering the mountain of cash being poured into stocks.\n\nEquity funds absorbed a record $43.3 billion of inflows over the past week, according to data compiled by BAML. That puts the \"more humble\" $2.4 billion taken in by bond funds over the same period to shame.\n\nIn fact, stock inflows have been so heavy that they're now outpacing their fixed-income counterparts for the first time since 2013 on an annualized basis, BAML data show.\n\nIn order to drive home just how little the stock market has done with these inflows, BAML highlights the $25 trillion NYSE Composite Index, which was down on a year-to-date basis through Friday. Meanwhile, emerging-market stocks are up just 5.5%, while US equities as a whole have increased just 3.4%.\n\nAnd those are the two best-performing asset classes of the year -- it's all downhill from there. Government bonds have returned just 2.2%, while gold, oil, and high-yield bonds have failed to exceed 1.7%.\n\nThe \"wall of money\" being deployed is \"at odds with lackluster cross-asset returns,\" BAML chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a client note. \"Chart-topping inflows are not coinciding with headline returns.\"\n\nBut Hartnett's consternation may be fleeting, at least if the most recent outlook from Marko Kolanovic -- JPMorgan's global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy -- comes to fruition.\n\nHe argues escalating fears over a global trade war are overblown, and the negative effect it's had on markets will be temporary. Once that psychological overhang is removed, stocks could once again re-test highs. Kolanovic also says the systematic outflows that worsened the stock correction in February will reverse in coming months, which could push equities back to record levels.\n\nThe fact that Kolanovic even has to address these issues shows the impact they're having on stocks -- and perhaps explains why they've had trouble matching the record-setting nature of their fund inflows.\n\n\"Our views on risks and equity upside have been confirmed by markets,\" he said. \"The market should reach all-time highs relatively soon.\"",

                "body": "After shortness of breath from climbing the stairs at home, Rich Roll, author of Finding Ultra, decided to completely change his lifestyle. Dropping 60 lbs in 6 months, this out-of-shape dad became an ultra-endurance athlete at 39. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nRich Roll: Ultra-endurance sports didn't just change me physically, they actually gave me a brand new life. Throughout my 30s, I was climbing the corporate ladder, very intent on achieving the traditional idea of the American dream. But deep down inside, I started to question this path that I was on.\n\nFor well over a decade, I really hadn't been taking care of myself. I had become a junk food addict, I was 50 pounds overweight, kind of semi-depressed, and shortly before I turned 40, I was climbing up a simple flight of stairs to go to bed one evening, and I had to pause halfway. I was winded, I was out of breath, I had tightness in my chest, and it was a very specific moment in time in which I realized that not only that I needed to change my lifestyle habits but that I had the willingness that I truly wanted to.\n\nI realized that vague ideas of eating better or working out a little bit or going to the gym weren't really going to work for me. I needed something specific, something definitive. I'd played around with a bunch of different diets, to no avail, and I sort of attempted this experiment in plant-based eating as kind of the last thing that I hadn't explored. And I didn't have a big expectation that it would make a big difference, but within about seven to 10 days of eating nothing but plants, nothing with a mother, nothing with a face, I experienced this extraordinary thing, like I had this resurgence in vitality, my mental acuity improved, my sleep improved, I had this sense of well-being and energy that I hadn't really felt since I was a teenager. And I didn't really know what I was doing, but I knew in that moment that I was onto something.\n\nAnd it started getting me thinking about human potential and my own potential, because if I could make such a simple, basic shift and experience such a dramatic result, where were there other untapped reservoirs of potential that I could explore? And that's what got me interested, ultimately, in the world of ultra-endurance sports.\n\nAt the peak of training, I would say I was training about 25 hours a week, so it was really almost a second job, and at the time, I was still a practicing attorney, I have four kids, I'm busy doing a lot of things, and in order to make the time that was required to appropriately prepare for this race, I had to make some significant cuts and really look hard and fast at how I was spending my time on a day-to-day basis. I had to get rid of late-night television and sort of business meetings that could be pushed to a conference call or an email chain to free up the time that was required so I could show up at the starting line and know in my heart of hearts that I could complete this race.\n\nI started training, which really connected me with myself in a very profound way, and to the surprise of myself and many other people, I ended up showing some prowess in this field and ended up competing at a very high level, specifically a race called Ultraman, which is a double Ironman distance triathlon. Over the course of three days, it completely circumnavigates the entire big island of Hawaii.",

                "body": "Drinking a lot of sugary coffee, tea, soda, or juice could be increasing your risk of an early death.\n\nThat's the finding of a groundbreaking study of over 17,000 Americans above the age of 45. The researchers behind the yet-to-be-published study found that over the course of six years, people who slurped more sugary drinks were more likely to die than those who sip unsweetened beverages.\n\nIn fact, the results suggested that the more sugar a person drinks, the greater their chance of death.\n\nAdults who guzzled at least 24 ounces of sugary beverages per day had twice the risk of dying from coronary heart disease compared to those who drank less than one ounce. Sugary-drink lovers also increased their risk of what the study called \"all cause\" mortality -- an indication that drinking sugar might be deadly in a bunch of different ways.\n\nThe study authors pointed out, however, that their finding doesn't establish cause and effect -- since they were only observing trends, they can't say for sure that consuming more sugary drinks directly causes people to die. But there is a clear link between early death and the liquid sugar in sodas, decadent Frappuccinos, and fruit juice.\n\nInterestingly, the study did not establish the same link for sweet foods -- people who ate more of those were not found to have an increased risk of death. That suggests there may be something especially toxic about drinking something sugary.\n\nStudy author Jean Welsh told Business Insider that there's a scientific reason why sugary drinks are more potent than solid sweet foods.\n\n\"It's basically sugar and water, and no protein or fat to counteract that metabolism,\" Welsh said.\n\nWhen we drink in sugar, fructose rushes into the liver, unabated by other nutrients like fiber that slow our digestion and help us feel full and satiated.\n\n\"There's some pretty good evidence that when we drink liquid calories, like in sugary beverages, we don't eat less food as a result,\" Welsh said.\n\nThat's why drinking fruit juice is worse for you than eating a whole fruit: juicing strips the fruit of its fibers and most nutrient-dense parts, which leads the sugary liquid to temporarily raise your blood sugar, setting you up for a crash and leaving you hungry later.\n\nEstimates suggest that American children and adults drink in around 7% of their daily calories from sweet beverages.\n\nEven though people in the US have cut back on the amount of soda they once drank, the number of calories we consume from sugar has been flat-lining in recent years, Welsh said. That's because sugar lurks in lots of other types of beverages, including fizzy kombuchas, coconut waters, sports drinks, and flavored vitamin elixirs.\n\nMost people probably don't understand how much sugar they're really drinking: a recent study of over 300 children and parents found that an overwhelming majority of moms and dads routinely underestimate how much sugar they're giving their children. That puts their kids at greater risk for becoming overweight.\n\nThe first step toward helping Americans be healthier, Welsh said, is simply developing a savvier understanding of how much sugar we're drinking day to day.\n\n\"We just have to be aware that it's a lot of calories that don't provide us with other nutrients,\" she said. \"A little bit is great, but a lot could be a problem.\"",

                "body": "What's not to love about ASOS? The site has a huge selection of amazing clothes, beauty products, and accessories for every size, shape, and occasion.\n\nAnd with free returns and shipping (with a minimum purchase of $45), it's usually my first stop when I'm looking for a trendy new addition to my wardrobe.\n\nAccording to ASOS, their site features 85,000 product lines with over 5,000 new items added daily. With all of those gorgeous fashion goodies at your fingertips -- even if you're someone like me who loves to shop -- you don't always have the time or patience to sort through pages of items just to get to the one specific thing you're looking for.\n\nIn fact, my recent search for a pair of colorful heels on the ASOS site gave me almost 700 results. And while I could definitely see myself in almost all of them, my budget and my closet only had room for one new pair.\n\nBut just when I thought I couldn't love ASOS any more, the UK-based online retailer launched Style Match, a visual search tool accessible through the ASOS app. The Style Match tool lets users upload photos of items they love and helps them find something similar on the ASOS site. Whether it's from the Instagram feed of one of your favorite celebs, or a pic of some cool style you spotted on the street, the tool will search through thousands of items to find similar products in the ASOS inventory.\n\nThe inspiration for the Style Match tool came from ASOS's ongoing efforts to improve their customer's shopping experience.\n\n\"Ever since ASOS was founded, we've been driven to delight our customers and improve their lives in little ways by using innovation,\" said Andy Berks, Digital Product Director for ASOS. \"But our technology has always been in their service, and never just for its own sake,\" he added.\n\nI used the Style Match tool to help me sift through the results of my overwhelming spring shoe search. By uploading a picture of a pair of shoes I already owned to the ASOS app, I was able to narrow my search results to a much more manageable 300.\n\nAnd with the time I saved, I decided to give the tool another try.\n\nThis time, I grabbed a picture from the Instagram feed of one of my star style crushes, actress Yara Shahidi. A photo of her swoon-worthy yellow coat produced an almost identical, and likely much less expensive alternative, on the ASOS site in minutes.\n\nIf I had to make any suggestions, I would have liked all of the search results to be relevant to the item in the photo. My search for Yara Shahidi's coat did come back with a few men's items that I could have done without. But overall, the Style Match tool has the potential to make my ASOS shopping experience even more fun.\n\nNow that I know I can find exactly what I'm looking for on the ASOS app with just a few clicks, I'm definitely going to need a bigger closet.",

It wouldn't fund anything resembling Trump's envisioned 30-foot wall.\n\nAdditionally, the bill does not include a codification of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program, or DACA.\n\nThe program protects from deportation nearly 700,000 unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the US as minors. Trump ended the program in September but gave Congress until March to pass a law codifying protections for DACA recipients. A federal judge recently blocked the Trump administration from ending the program, however, so the program has continued.\n\nTalks over a deal fell apart Tuesday after the Trump administration only offered a three year extension of protections for the current DACA recipients, instead of a path to citizenship for the roughly 1.8 million people that qualify for the program. In exchange for the full DACA protections, Democrats were reportedly set to give Trump all $25 billion that the administration requested for the wall.\n\nThe threats also come after members of the president's administration praised the bipartisan omnibus bill, which provides funds for everything from the military to low-income housing projects.\n\n\"The president supports the bill, looks forward to signing it,\" Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday.\n\n\"This omnibus bill, the priorities that are being funded here, are going on the heels of the president's fiscal and economic accomplishments,\" Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, said Friday morning just minutes before Trump's tweet.",

That includes 71 million paying premium subscribers.\n\nIn addition, the company restated the total number of content-hours streaming in 2017, by 1.2%, to account for the unauthorized usage. Previously, Spotify said users worldwide consumed 40.3 billion hours of audio and video last year; now it says users accessed 39.8 billion hours of content.\n\nSpotify said that \"we currently do not have, and may never have, the requisite data available to adjust such key performance indicators and other metrics prior to January 1, 2017, and as a result, such key performance indicators and other metrics for such periods may be overstated.\"\n\nIn the risk factors outlined in its IPO filing, Spotify noted, it says it is \"at risk of artificial manipulation of stream counts and failure to effectively manage and remediate such fraudulent streams could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\"\n\nIn a filing Tuesday, Spotify said about 31% of its outstanding shares (55.7 million of 178.1 million total) will be available for sale on the first day of trading. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek is eligible to sell 15.8 million shares (less than one-third of his total holdings).\n\nSpotify identifies Apple Music as its chief rival. Apple last week announced it now has 38 million paying subscribers for Apple Music, a little over half as many as Spotify's reported year-end 2017 total.",

                "body": "People are leaving San Francisco because, as they say, the rent is too damn high.\n\nUS census data shows the region that includes San Francisco, Oakland, and Hayward -- a city in the East Bay that offers a quicker commute to Silicon Valley -- lost more residents than it attracted between 2016 and 2017. And the migration is worsening in the Bay Area's urban core.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that in the year ending July 1, census data shows the area had a net loss of almost 24,000 residents who moved into other parts of California or the US.\n\nThe San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward metropolitan area lost only half that many residents the year prior. As recently as 2013 - 2014, the region saw net annual gains of about 15,000 people.\n\nA critical lack of affordable housing and sky-high rent prices have made the San Francisco Bay Area unlivable for many artists, artisans, longtime residents, and even tech entrepreneurs.\n\nThe median-priced home in San Francisco sells for $1.5 million, according to Paragon Real Estate Group. It's not uncommon for buyers to bid hundreds of thousands above asking and pay in all cash.\n\nThe situation has forced many to rent longer than they would like. In March, San Francisco's median two-bedroom rent of $3,040 was about two and a half times as high as the national average. Still, people are finding ways to make it work. They cram into communal housing, or \"co-living\" units, that offer perks like maid service and free internet in lieu of space. Some give up their internet, cable, and cars, while others take home wherever they go by living in vans.\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area, recognized as a global hub of tech finance and innovation, may be at risk of losing top tech workers if they can't afford to live there, even on six-figure salaries.\n\nA recent report from Paragon Real Estate Group showed that the household income required to buy a median-priced home in San Francisco reached an all-time high of $303,000 in December.\n\nKatherine Maher, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, which is based in San Francisco, responded to the report on Twitter, saying: \"As a non-profit employer, I cannot see how we reconcile this with a future for our organization in San Francisco.\"\n\nShe added: \"Our local employees, particularly the younger ones, struggle to make ends meet. They leave when they start families. How can we be an equitable employer when only those who can afford to work for us, do?\"\n\nBrian Brennan, senior vice president at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, told the Wall Street Journal that while the area's high-paying jobs and lifestyle still bring tech workers to the Bay Area, \"it is hard to get the best talent outside of this region to come here and stay here.\"",

                "title": "Here's why a modern torpedo sinks a ship with one hit",
                "body": "Anyone who knows naval history knows that torpedoes are lethal to ships -- just look at what they did to the liner Lusitania, the aircraft carrier USS Wasp (CV 7), and a host of other ships.\n\nBack through World War II, the primary way torpedoes did their damage was with a direct hit. The impact of the torpedo on a ship's hull would drive a firing pin that sets off a warhead.\n\nThe hope here is that the blast punches a hole in a ship, allowing water to flood in, causing the ship to list to one side or the other and, eventually, capsize. Generally, this approach worked well, but it could take many direct hits to do damage enough to sink a vessel.\n\nThe Japanese battleship Musashi, for example, took over twenty hits from Mk 13 air-dropped torpedoes before she went down.\n\nThis was a problem -- as defensive anti-aircraft capability developed, planes launching torpedoes needed to do so from higher altitudes, at faster speeds, and from further away in order to survive. This was not conducive to scoring the many hits you needed to sink the enemy ship.\n\nIn fact, with rare exceptions, the only vessels that use heavy anti-ship torpedoes today are submarines. The torpedoes used by planes and ships are often less than 13 inches wide and hold warheads packed with less than 100 pounds of high explosive. They're not that good against surface ships, but you don't need much to sink a sub that's a few hundred feet below the surface of the ocean.\n\nThe heavy torpedoes themselves have also evolved, and not just in tracking capabilities.\n\nDuring World War II, the United States Navy fielded torpedoes equipped with magnetic exploders. However, they didn't quite work right.\n\nWith bigger fish to fry and a war to fight, the U.S. Navy simply disabled them and went on fielding functional, contact exploders. These torpedoes helped force Japan's surrender.\n\nBut the magnetic exploder concept wasn't forgotten after the war -- and for good reason: Hitting the hull does some damage, but if you want to really kill a ship, it's best to break it in two.\n\nThe best way to do that is to set off the explosion just below a ship. That will damage the ship's keel in a process called \"breaking its back.\" Modern torpedoes with magnetic exploders are designed to do exactly that.",

Gone are the days when having multi-room audio meant wiring up an expensive audio system, with installation from a professional. These days, all you need to do is buy a few wireless speakers, set them up on your phone, and start playing the music.\n\nOf course, there are quite a few multi-room speaker systems out there, and they're not all effortless to use. A few brands really stand above the rest, and Sonos is the obvious king of the speaker space.\n\nIf you're in the market for a new multi-room speaker system, there are a few things to consider. Ease of setup and sound quality are obviously important, but you'll also want to think about the standard you use to connect multiple speakers.\n\nSonos speakers, for example, can't really connect with speakers from other brands. On the other hand, speakers that connect through Google's Cast standard can indeed be used with other Cast-enabled speakers, so you can buy multiple speakers from different brands if you so choose.\n\nApart from that, the main things you'll want to think about are sound-quality and price. Often-times, larger speakers have improved bass, but bigger isn't always better -- a lot of work goes into tuning speakers. We've combed through all the reviews and tested some of these speakers ourselves to find the bets multi-room speakers you can buy.",

                "body": "This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider. To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nAmazon has been attempting to curb losses on shipping orders of low-priced items by raising shipping fees for consumer goods suppliers, Bloomberg reports.\n\nThe e-commerce giant deducts transport costs -- or the cost of moving a supplier's inventory through its distribution network -- from payments for bulk orders from suppliers.\n\nBut, as its shipping costs have dramatically increased over the years, Amazon is looking to shift these costs more to its suppliers, and specifically target low-cost items that are heavy and expensive to ship, like beverages and diapers.\n\nAdditionally, the e-commerce giant is planning to make it more difficult for shoppers to purchase single, low-priced items, such as toothbrushes or soap, to encourage them to add these items into a larger purchase. Some personal care and health items on Amazon are already restricted as \"add-ons,\" or items that can only be purchased with a basket size of $25 or more. However, the company is planning on designating more items as \"add-ons\" by expanding the category to include health and beauty products that cost less than $7.\n\nAmazon is looking to curb costs because its shipping costs are skyrocketing. Although Amazon has been working to optimize its fulfillment network through various initiatives, like extending order cut-off times to eliminate split shipments, its shipping costs are still growing in the double digits. Shipping costs reached nearly $20 billion in 2017 for the e-commerce titan, growing 31% year-over-year (YoY) in Q4 alone. As Amazon looks to grow its Prime Now, one-hour, and two-hour delivery services, while keeping its reputation for free and fast shipping on all orders, its move to improve profitability on consumer goods products is a sensible one.\n\nThe retail giant is following Walmart's move to aim for profitability in shipping online orders. Walmart has already raised prices for some online goods, and recently began to push suppliers to offer more high-priced goods on its e-commerce site. Although these two companies have been in a grid-lock price war, it seems like they've come to a tipping point in terms of shipping costs.\n\nHowever, each company's approach has different pros and cons, making it unclear which one will be more successful in optimizing online revenues while minimizing shipping costs.",

That's wack. That's wack,\" James said when asked about the idea. \"You got to earn your spot to be in the postseason. No consolation for finishing last. That's corny. That's corny. That's wack. To play for what? What are they playing for?\"\n\nIt's not hard to imagine why James would believe the playoffs are already fine as they are -- James has made it to seven straight NBA Finals and will be pushing for his eighth straight Finals campaign this season.",

                "title": "REVIEW: Bella Thorne's 'Midnight Sun' is a badly acted romance about a girl who dies if she gets exposed to the sun",
                "body": "\"Midnight Sun\" has a weighty premise for a teen romance movie. Bella Thorne plays Katie, a teenager with the real-life disease of Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). If she gets exposed to the slightest bit of sunlight, she'll die.\n\nSo she only goes out at night. During the day, she has a Rapunzel-like existence behind tinted windows getting home-schooled by her father, writing song lyrics, and sleeping.\n\nWhile she's up in her bedroom, she develops a crush on Charlie, a moody hunk played by Patrick Schwarzenegger who passes by her house every day on the way to school. When they meet in real life, shortly after high school graduation, he likes her too.\n\nBut Katie won't tell him about his life-threatening condition. She doesn't want to be seen as \"just a disease,\" so they hang out only at night. What will happen when the truth comes out?\n\nBella Thorne is becoming increasingly famous as a model and star of teen shows and movies like \"Famous in Love\" and \"The DUFF.\" She's also been in the news for speaking about body image issues and online bullying. Since her character is a musician in this movie, it's also a test to see whether she can be a pop star.\n\nPatrick Schwarzenegger, son of Arnold, has less acting experience but is also being positioned as a star. \"Midnight Sun\" is the first big movie test for both of them. But its out-there premise -- where the female character basically has a secret deathly allergy to the sun -- could be too outlandish to work as a movie.\n\nBecause Katie is doomed to die a slow death if she sees the sun, the movie automatically has a low-key dramatic tension which is kind of intriguing to see mixed with all the lovey-dovey romance stuff where Bella Thorne and Patrick Schwarzenegger look into each other's eyes and talk about how much she loves music. For much of the movie, when they're hanging out at night and it's unclear how much time passed, it's startling to see a glare on an object in the background. Is the sun coming up, or is it just the glare of a streetlamp?\n\nIt's also nice that Charlie isn't written as just a bland jock. He's surprisingly emo, because he lost his scholarship to the University of California at Berkeley when he had to leave the swim team because of an injury. You could imagine him listening to My Chemical Romance alone on his bed at night but never talking to his friends about it.\n\nThe movie is also sensitive about the disease, XP. The genetic disorder affects only 0.0004% of people in the United States, who are the only demographic for this movie aside from Bella Thorne fans. (XP is more common in Japan, and \"Midnight Sun\" is adapted from a Japanese movie of the same name.)\n\nI have so many questions. Charlie is dating Katie for weeks and never thinks once to ask why she can only hang out during the night and why her windows are tinted? The film also establishes early on that everyone who goes to the local high school thinks Katie is weird because she never hangs out with them. He never suspects something is going on?\n\nAlso, does Charlie have parents? He had to leave his swim team, lost a scholarship, and planned to aimlessly drive across the country instead of going to college. He also spends a bunch of money renting a recording studio for Katie to record the songs she's been writing. You'd figure his parents might have an opinion or two about everything he's up to, but the movie never mentions if they even exist.\n\nOh yeah, and -- spoiler alert -- Katie eventually gets exposed to the sun when they're out on a date for too long one night. The movie briefly turns into a thriller as she scrambles for shelter.\n\nIt doesn't help that neither of its stars are very good actors. Rob Riggle, playing Katie's dad, provides a warm presence. But Thorne pretends to be a goofy theater kid, which is totally unconvincing, and Schwarzenegger is just flat.\n\nYou can skip it unless you're a die-hard Bella Thorne fan.",

She's already worn some iconic outfits so far, and it looks like she's picked up a style hack from her future sister-in-law Kate Middleton that makes picking the perfect outfit even easier.\n\nMiddleton is known to give not-so-subtle nods to the country she's visiting when traveling abroad, such as the time she looked like a walking Canadian flag with her white dress and red hat adorned with maple leaves in July 2011. She also wore a tartan coat for a visit to Scotland in April 2013.\n\nWhen Markle visited Lisburn, Northern Ireland, she took a page right out of Middleton's style playbook by incorporating the colors of the country's flag in her outfit.\n\nMarkle's most obvious nod to the country was her forest-green skirt by Canadian designer Greta Constantine, which she paired with some bold orange suede pumps by Jimmy Choo. She completed her look with the same white Victoria Beckham sweater from her engagement shoot and a $750 coat by Mackage. Markle paired the outfit with a small leather bag by Charlotte Elizabeth that added a nice casual touch.\n\nIt's also quite a departure from Markle's recent penchant for pants, which Middleton opted for when she made her final appearance before going on maternity leave on Thursday. It seems like the future sisters-in-law might be turning to each other for style cues, and they are both pulling the looks off flawlessly.",

                "body": "In a new paper, researchers found that the skeleton -- Ata -- was in fact not an alien, but a human who had suffered from a range of mysterious genetic mutations.\n\nAlmost two decades ago, an amateur collector found something astonishing in the Atacama desert in Northern Chile: A six-inch tall, humanoid skeleton.\n\nWhile the skeleton did have human features, it also had some peculiarities, like a long, pointy skull, large eye sockets, and ten ribs instead of 12. Over the intervening years, the skeleton, dubbed Ata, became the subject of rumors and rampant speculation, with some suggesting that it could be a form of extraterrestrial life.\n\nNow scientists think they've figured out the mystery behind the skeleton -- and it has more to do with genetics than aliens.\n\nA team of scientists at Stanford and the University of California, San Francisco analyzed the skeleton's DNA and found that Ata was, in fact a human female, and that she was closely related to the local population.\n\nAfter reconstructing Ata's genome, they found that she probably lived less than 500 years ago -- likely in the 16th century -- and that she also shared some European ancestry, meaning she was alive well after South America was colonized.\n\nIn a new paper in the journal Genome Research, the scientists, led by Sanchita Bhattacharya, Garry Nolan, and Atul Butte, found that Ata's bones were as developed as a six-year-old's, even though she was about the same size as a fetus.\n\nAta, the scientists found, suffered from a litany of genetic mutations -- but they couldn't point to one specific disorder. Many of Ata's specific mutations were also completely unknown to the scientists, leading them to believe that Ata was likely stillborn, though her bone structure was well-developed in other areas.\n\nThe researchers identified 54 mutations in Ata that could affect her skeletal structure. These mutations have been linked to bone disorders like skeletal dysplasia, rib anomalies, and dwarfism.\n\n\"I was amazed by how much you can tell from the genetic blueprint,\" Bhattacharya told The New York Times.\n\nWhile more research is needed to figure out the causes of Ata's deformities, it's possible that stillborn babies in the modern era suffer from similar conditions.",

                "body": "Defense experts estimate that in a best-case scenario for any strike, including in a \"bloody nose\" attack, more than 300,000 people in South Korea could die.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has offered John Bolton, a Fox News contributor and former ambassador to the United Nations, the role of national security advisor.\n\nThe development comes following this week's resignation of former national security advisor H.R. McMaster.\n\n\"I humbly accept his offer,\" Bolton, who also works for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, tweeted Thursday night. \"The United States currently faces a wide array of issues and I look forward to working with President Trump and his leadership team in addressing these complex challenges in an effort to make our country safer at home and stronger abroad.\"\n\nHowever, defense and arms control experts have expressed extreme reservations about slotting Bolton into this role, which he is slated to begin April 9. One arms control expert even labeled the appointment a \"national security emergency.\"\n\nA major concern is Bolton's long-held and recently promoted views in support of a preemptive strike on North Korea. He appears ready to use force in attempt to halt North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n\"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current 'necessity' posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first,\" Bolton wrote in a Feb. 28 opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nYet defense experts say any preemptive attack may lead North Korea to pursue an overwhelming retaliatory response against South Korea, Japan, and US military installations.\n\nAccording to conservative estimates, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans would die within hours, and possibly millions of people in the region if North Korea were to deploy nuclear weapons.\n\nThere are two different violent responses North Korea could choose if the US were to attack. One option would be to use conventional artillery weapons -- such as explosive mortars and rockets -- and possibly chemical weapons like VX nerve gas. North Korea is known to have many reinforced bunkers armed with such munitions.\n\nKori Schake, who studies military history and contemporary conflicts at the right-leaning Hoover Institution, discussed this possibility on a Nov. 17 episode of the Pod Save The World podcast.\n\n\"[Suppose] in the space of, say, three hours, we could destroy all of the 8,000 to 10,000 hardened sites of North Korean artillery that Seoul, South Korea, is in range of,\" she said. \"Even in that [scenario] -- which would be a level of military virtuosity unimaginable -- you're still probably talking 300,000 dead South Koreans.\"\n\nThe second option would be much worse: North Korean leaders could potentially deploy and launch the short-range nuclear weapons that the country has developed.\n\n\"[I]f the 'unthinkable' happened, nuclear detonations over Seoul and Tokyo with North Korea's current estimated weapon yields could result in as many as 2.1 million fatalities and 7.7 million injuries,\" Michael J. Zagurek Jr. wrote in an October 2017 analysis for 38 North, a project of the The US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nThis is because Seoul's 25 million residents, including tens of thousands of US forces, are just 35 miles from the North Korean border.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, a nuclear policy expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, previously told Business Insider that he doesn't think North Korea \"would ever deliberately use the nuclear weapons unless they thought they were being invaded.\"\n\nLewis -- who publishes Arms Control Wonk, a site about nuclear arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation -- and many other experts worry about how North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would respond to any kind of attack, perceived or real.\n\n\"The North Koreans, when they write official statements about what their nuclear posture or doctrine is, the phrase they use is 'deter and repel,'\" he said, explaining that the country's nuclear arsenal has become its primary way of deterring conflict.\n\n\"But 'repel' means if the deterrent fails, and the United States launches an invasion, they will use nuclear weapons to try and repel the invasion -- to try to destroy US forces throughout South Korea and Japan.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how Bolton's coming appointment will influence pending denuclearization talks between North Korea, South Korea, and the US.\n\nA spokesperson for Bolton declined to comment for this story.",

                "title": "Advertisers to Facebook: 'Did I work with Cambridge Analytica?'",
                "body": "Most big marketers' use of Facebook is likely unaffected, she said, and no brands have threatened to pull their ad budgets.\n\nAdvertisers want to know something from Facebook. Did I work with Cambridge Analytica at any point? Can you make sure?\n\nCarolyn Everson, Facebook's vice president of global marketing solutions says she has spent the past week contacting thousands of the company's advertisers, helping them understand the ramifications of the ongoing Cambridge Analytica mess. She started by notifying Facebook's client council, which is made up of several top marketing executives, last Saturday.\n\nMost advertisers want to hear directly about what steps Facebook is taking to protect consumer data. But some, according to Everson, have a more urgent question. \"Do you know if we worked with Cambridge Analytica?'\"\n\nEverson told Business Insider that some advertisers are asking for assurance that they have not directly or inadvertently worked with the company, which is accused of using data from 50 million Facebook users without permission.\n\nCambridge Analytica is associated with its work on the Trump campaign. But Ad Age reported that the company has more recently pitched its psychographic ad targeting services to other brands, including the US Army.\n\nEverson said Facebook doesn't know who may or may not have worked with Cambridge. \"We are trying to pull that together as we speak,\" she said.\n\nFor the most part, the average Facebook advertiser will be unaffected by the Cambridge fiasco. Day-to-day most advertisers have relied on Facebook data for their ad targeting, not data collected by third party apps. And for brands that may have once used data from these kinds of apps, they likely would have stopped around 2015 when Facebook changed the rules to restrict the kind of data collection at issue.\n\nThe exception would be if a marketer had previously built its own app that collected users' friends data like Cambridge did prior to Facebook's rule changes. That's something Facebook is trying to get a handle on as it audits all third party apps, Everson said.\n\n\"If they created an app and collected friend data and didn't destroy it, there would be a problem,\" she said.\n\nYet for the most part brands primarily use the demographic data provided by Facebook (people's self reported ages, sex, location, etc.) for ad targeting and none of that has changed.\n\nIn fact, advertisers told Business Insider that they don't plan to pull ad spending from Facebook in light of the controversy. Everson reiterated that \"none of our largest partners have\" threatened to cut spending.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they aren't concerned.\n\n\"Advertisers care deeply about people,\" Everson said. \"If people are upset, advertisers are upset. What they care about most is, how you react. That is what they are watching. They don't expect you to be perfect.\"\n\nThe meshes with what one top ad buying executive told Business Insider. The challenge for Facebook, he said, is longer term.\n\nIf this story doesn't go away - and given Congress' interest in talking to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, it may take a while - what happens to the Facebook brand over time? Does it become associated with consumer data and privacy problems?\n\nEverson sees this crisis as providing Facebook a chance to become a leader in data privacy protection. \"It's on us,\" she said. \" We have to work incredibly hard to rebuild trust where we've lost it. It's our job and it's our problem.\"\n\nFacebook will make sure its 2 billion plus users know how it's handing this problem by explaining its actions on data \"front and center in people's news feeds,\" Everson said. \"We need to really ensure frequency of message, and not assume that all people are reading the news. This is going to be an ongoing effort for us.\"\n\n\"We really want to set a totally new standard for data and privacy,\" she said. \"This is a defining moment for the company and the future of the entire industry.\"",

A sales assistant at its Greenville, South Carolina, store told Business Insider that the sale had started there. Dozens of shoppers have also confirmed on social media that other locations are on sale.\n\nBut after all the build-up, some are walking away disappointed.\n\n\"Toys R Us so damn expensive even with a discount no wonder it's closing,\" on Twitter user wrote.\n\n\"ToysRUs sale is a bit of a let down.

Also the board game I wanted was already gone,\" another Twitter user wrote.\n\nA sales assistant from the Greenville store told Business Insider that the discounts would start at 10%. These will increase in the coming weeks as the store tries to clear inventory, so it could pay off to wait before heading out on a shopping spree there.\n\nOnce all the inventory is cleared, these stores will close, so you'll want to time your visit for right before the stores run out of stock.\n\nCustomers are now complaining that even in its sales, Toys R Us is not competing with rivals on price.\n\nIn a bankruptcy filing earlier this month, Toys R Us blamed Target, Walmart, and Amazon for its demise, claiming that these retailers created the \"perfect storm\" to kill off the chain after cutting prices on toys during the holiday season. Toys R Us said it could not offer such low prices because it relies exclusively on toys for profit.",

You've come to the right place.\n\nNetflix's \"Santa Clarita Diet\" isn't for everyone. It's a quirky, violent, and weird satire of the zombie genre and of American suburban life. But it's improved a lot in season two, and is definitely worth giving a shot.\n\nThe \"Santa Clarita Diet,\" created by Victor Fresco (\"Better Off Ted,\" \"My Name is Earl\"), debuted its first season on Netflix last year, and season two became available Friday.\n\nThe show centers on a suburban family in Santa Clarita, California. Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant play Sheila and Joel Hammond, husband and wife real-estate agents with a teenage daughter. They live a standard, bland suburban life until one day, Sheila dies and is reborn as a zombie. Sheila's condition makes her more impulsive: She's more honest, aggressive, and her truest self -- which helps her marriage with Joel.\n\nBut it also creates problems.\n\nAt first, she can eat raw meat and animals. But then her diet progresses to the point where she has to eat people to survive.\n\nSheila and Joel, with the help of their daughter and their neighbor, try to figure out what happened to Sheila and why. And they also try to figure out who Sheila can eat to survive. She needs fresh human flesh, so she can't just take bodies from the morgue.\n\nIn an effort to murder but remain good people, Sheila and Joel try to only kill people who are bad. In season two, they come across a Nazi who is on a Nazi softball team. Sheila is convinced that's the perfect target for a surplus of food.\n\nWhile season one was a bit of a mess, it was still enjoyable. In season two, the show's found its footing and adds some hilarious and surprising twists to the narrative and characters. Barrymore and Olyphant's chemistry drives the show at this point, but the lore behind Sheila's condition, and the social satire at the show's heart, come together in a way that feels more natural than season one.",

                "body": "Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee Chair Damian Collins said giving false statements to a parliamentary committee is a \"very serious matter.\"\n\nA powerful group of British MPs wants to quiz Cambridge Analytica's (CA) suspended CEO Alexander Nix about the firm's murky role in Brexit after a source told Business Insider that he may have misled Parliament.\n\nThe Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee (DCMSC) has recalled Nix as a witness in its 'fake news' inquiry amid claims he gave \"false statements\" about CA's role in harvesting Facebook data during a hearing last month.\n\nThe influential group of lawmakers want to question him for a second time about the work his firm undertook during the EU referendum, a spokesman said.\n\nThe request comes after a source told Business Insider that Nix gave the DCMSC questionable evidence about an article he penned in 2016, in which he claimed that the company worked for Nigel Farage's Brexit campaign group Leave.EU.\n\nA CA spokesman told Business Insider that the company \"did not work on the referendum,\" adding that any reports to the contrary were \"silly.\"\n\nHowever, on February 10, 2016, Nix put his name to a comment piece for British trade journal Campaign about how data had helped Ted Cruz beat Trump in the Republican primary in Iowa.\n\nWithin the column, which is still online here, Nix said the company had \"teamed up with Leave.EU \" to help the Brexit campaign group \"better understand and communicate with UK voters.\"\n\nThe suspended CEO boasted: \"We have already helped supercharge Leave.EU's social media campaign by ensuring the right messages are getting to the right voters online, and the campaign's Facebook page is growing in support to the tune of about 3,000 people per day.\"\n\nBut in evidence to the DCMSC last month, Nix furiously backpedaled from this version of events. He said the comment piece was drafted by a \"slightly overzealous PR consultant\" and was published when CA was hoping to win work from Leave.EU, but had yet to enter into a formal contractual relationship.\n\nHe told MPs on the committee that CA made efforts to have the article corrected or withdrawn soon after it was published by Campaign -- for the simple reason that it never worked with Leave.EU.\n\n\"It was an error. We were very vocal about that at the time and we addressed it head-on immediately when we realised that it had been put out,\" he said. Asked why the article is still online, Nix said: \"I cannot speak to that personally, but I am sure that we have asked them [to withdraw it.]\"\n\nHowever, a source familiar with the matter told BI that Cambridge Analytica did not ask for a correction or for the piece to be taken down. \"I'm pretty sure they never asked us to withdraw it at the time it was published. There would have been a big discussion about it,\" the source told BI.\n\nThey said that the magazine has a clear process of meeting to discuss major corrections, which was not initiated after Nix's article was published. They added that the piece did not generate a lot of traffic, and was largely forgotten about until his quotes about working with Leave.EU began to resurface many months later.\n\nThe source also pointed to the fact that Nix did an interview with Campaign last year (the profile was headlined \"Cambridge Analytica boss on why he's no Bond villain,\" and is behind a paywall), in which he did not ask for a correction, but stuck to the line he used in the DCMSC hearing: That CA did not work with Leave.EU. CA said this was evidence that Nix had set the record straight.\n\nThe source's comments raise the prospect that CA did actually formally work with Leave.EU in 2016, or at the very least was happy to give the impression that the two organisation's had a relationship that went beyond CA simply pitching for a contract.\n\nThis is supported by other comments from CA and Leave.EU executives at the time. CA's former Business Development Director Brittany Kaiser spoke at a Leave.EU event in 2015, and said the firm was undertaking research for the campaign group. Aaron Banks, who bankrolled Leave.EU, also said in his book \"The Bad Boys of Brexit\" that he hired CA to use data to \"influence people.\"\n\nA CA spokesman said questions about the firm's involvement with Leave.EU are \"getting silly.\" He added: \"For conspiracy theorists, these explanations only reinforce their absurd belief that Brexit was caused by a data marketing agency (in the same way that they think CA used Facebook data to get Trump elected, which is also untrue).\"\n\nHe did not, however, produce when asked evidence to show that CA asked Campaign to withdraw or correct Nix's article from February 10, 2016.\n\nIn a letter sent to Nix on Thursday, DCMSC Chair Damian Collins said he is yet to provide answers to a series of follow-up questions the committee asked after last month's hearing. This included a request for CA bank statements to show it received no payment from Leave.EU, which Nix said he would be \"pleased\" to provide.\n\nCollins reminded Nix that giving false statements to a parliamentary committee is a \"very serious matter.\" Although very rare, a jail sentence or a substantial fine could theoretically be imposed as a punishment if a witness misleads a select committee.\n\nNix was suspended on Tuesday pending an independent investigation by the British barrister Julian Malins. It followed him being secretly filmed by Channel 4 News offering to entrap politicians with bribes and sex workers.",

Neither the driver nor any people in the building were injured.\n\nNo official word on whether or not our aspiring driver passed the test or not, but at least she -- and her parents -- can rest assured: the police report that \"no charges are pending.\"",

                "body": "Fans applauded the post -- and some even reminded us that this isn't the first time Bieber has been candid about acne.\n\nJustin Bieber can be a polarizing celebrity. Whether he's canoodling with on-again-off-again girlfriend Selena Gomez or botching the words to his own song, everyone has an opinion about the young star. But when it comes to acne, Bieber is as relatable and unifying as anyone.\n\nThe \"Love Yourself\" hitmaker recently posted a video to his Instagram story with the caption \"pimples are in.\" In the video, he casually points to the blemishes on his forehead and shows off his so-called imperfect skin.\n\nBieber's fans flocked to social media to praise him for his honesty (and, as Beliebers tend to do, his good looks).\n\nMany praised Bieber for declaring pimples \"trendy\" and vowed to follow his example.\n\nFor others, the video reminded them of another time when Bieber was candid about his uneven skin. During a performance, he changed the lyrics to his classic song \"Baby\" by singing, \"I got a pimple, it's on my forehead. Can you see it? I tried to cover it.\"\n\nOf course, not everyone was impressed by Bieber's acne embrace. Some criticized the singer for his appearance, while others seemed offended by the post.\n\nThe video may be an indirect way of addressing his appearance at the premiere of \"Midnight Sun\" last week. Bieber walked the red carpet with a shaggy haircut and visible acne on his forehead. Many people were quick to judge and post negative comments on Twitter -- but Bieber's fans defended him with the reminder that acne is a common struggle that can make anyone self-conscious.\n\nThe video response may seem insignificant to many, but it's refreshing to watch an influential singer remind almost 100 million followers that acne is normal and sometimes pimples are unavoidable -- even for celebrities.",

The cuts are company-wide, and do not just apply to Whole Foods' northeast region.\n\nWestcoe said that the move came about as a result of the company's efforts to centralize \"the creation and production of signage and decisions around signage needs.\"\n\n\"This means that the SGA role will be removed from the Whole Foods Market structure,\" she said.\n\nIn order to collect severance pay, the Whole Foods SGAs must remain working until July 2, as the brand is not yet ready to replace its signage.\n\nThe severance package features two weeks of severance pay for each year of employment. The minimum severance is two weeks, while the maximum is 26 weeks. In addition, employee benefits will last until the end of July.\n\n\"I want you guys to understand that decisions like this across the company -- it is no reflection on how we value you, the work you do, and how you show up every day,\" Westcoe said.\n\nWestcoe also spoke about opportunities for the affected marketing staffers to apply to new marketing or store roles.\n\n\"We will help support, partner, and champion you to find another position within Whole Foods Market,\" Westcoe said. \"If you believe that you want to stay with the company and move forward, I want to tell you that I will make it my business to help you do just that.\"",

                "body": "Because of his hawkish views, some consider Bolton's appointment a betrayal of Trump's base, since he campaigned on a platform of non-intervention.\n\nNewly appointed national security advisor John Bolton is perhaps the most hawkish, and potentially \"dangerous,\" person that will be in President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nBolton, who served as the US ambassador to the UN under former President George W. Bush, tried to distance himself from his previous comments after the announcement of the new position -- but if the past is any indication, he will likely continue to be a major defense hawk.\n\nEspecially when it comes to Iran.\n\nBolton has long expressed a firm belief that military action is needed to contain Iran and prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons, as well as keep its influence in the region in check. In 2008, Bolton suggested that the US should conduct airstrikes in Iran as retaliation for them aiding insurgents in Iraq.\n\n\"I think the Iranians need to look very carefully at what risk they would run if they were to escalate,\" Bolton said at the time, when asked what the Iranian response would be to the proposed airstrikes. \"So this is not provocative or preemptive, this is entirely responsive on our part.\"\n\nBolton also made his disdain for the Iran nuclear deal, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, public when it was still being put together.\n\nIn March of 2015, he wrote an op-ed for the New York Times titled \"To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran.\" In it, he stated that \"America and the West were guilty of inattention when they should have been vigilant,\" and that \"failing to act in the past is no excuse for making the same mistakes now.\"\n\n\"The inconvenient truth is that only military action like Israel's 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein's Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor, designed and built by North Korea, can accomplish what is required,\" Bolton wrote.\n\nWhen the Iran deal was signed and Trump took office, Bolton said that the incoming president should \"abrogate the Iran nuclear deal in his first days in office.\" He also wrote an article in the National Review in August 2017 titled \"How to Get Out of the Iran Nuclear Deal.\"\n\nThe article was, according to Bolton, originally a game plan for Trump that Bolton had drawn up and given to former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nAmong Bolton's suggestions were ending \"all visas for Iranians, including so called 'scholarly,' student, sports, or other exchanges;\" demanding payment from Iran for terrorism \"including 9/11;\" provide \"assistance\" to minority and activist groups, as well as labor unions in Iran; and to \"actively organize opposition to Iranian political objectives in the U.N.\"\n\nTrump shares a similar view with Bolton when is comes to the Iran deal, as does incoming Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The president said when he fired Rex Tillerson earlier this month that he dismissed the secretary of state at least in part over a disagreement on how best to proceed with the Iran deal.\n\nHowever, Trump campaigned on a platform of non-intervention in 2016, making some feel that Bolton's appointment would be tantamount to a betrayal of his base.",

According to Cosmopolitan, Reynolds and Lively haven't made a joint red carpet appearance since the Met Gala in May 2017.\n\nLet us hope that Reynolds and Lively do another public red carpet appearance soon.

                "body": "Risch and Andrus were political rivals during their time in the Idaho state government.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho nearly derailed the massive $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill Thursday, just a day before the government shutdown deadline, all over the naming of a forest for a dead political rival.\n\nThe funding bill, which was eventually passed, included a provision to rename the White Clouds Wilderness preserve in Idaho after the state's most recent Democratic governor, Cecil Andrus, who died in August.\n\nRisch demanded that Senate leaders remove the provision from the bill or he would use a procedural objection to block a vote. The only problem is that any edit of the massive 2,232 page bill would have required the House to re-vote on it, pushing Congress dangerously close to the Friday shutdown deadline.\n\nCNN reported that Risch and Andrus clashed in during their time in state government. In the 1980s, Risch was majority leader of the Idaho state Senate and fought with Andrus, then the governor, over education funding.\n\n\"Risch is one of the most partisan people I've ever had to deal with,\" Adrus said in a 2008 profile of Risch. The article was passed around the Capitol as an explanation for the objection.\n\nThe provision was added by GOP Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. Simpson praised Andrus when a separate bill to rename the preserve passed the House. That bill did not receive Senate consideration, so it appears Simpson fought to get it included in the must-pass spending bill.\n\nSince the omnibus bill was only released Wednesday night, there was little time to address the issue before the fight on Thursday.\n\nRisch refused to address the problem Thursday.\n\n\"What part of 'No' don't you understand?\" Risch told reporters. \"Do I have a problem with my English? I don't have any comment.\"\n\nThe debate continued for several hours as Risch met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer about the problem and refused to drop the objection until the leaders agreed to add a separate procedural vote to possibly reverse the naming.\n\nThe House would still need to approve that change, but the hold was lifted after the agreement and the omnibus finally passed just after midnight.",

I got rid of my wheels several years ago and my company provides a transit pass, so I don't have to worry about that expense. Also, I'm not a big shopper, nor into acquiring \"stuff,\" so my retail expenses are minimal.\n\nA big chunk of my income goes to shared experiences, so what my savings lacks in zeros, my quality of life makes up for in spades.\n\nHere's what I spend on food, drinks, groceries and dining out in a typical week.

Just look at the Nasdaq's rough last couple days for evidence of that.\n\nBut Bank of America Merrill Lynch has crunched data that reveals something surprising: amid all of the chaos, traders actually poured another $500 million into tech stocks this past week.\n\nThat statistic is made even more surprising when you consider yields on investment-grade bonds are the highest in eight years (as indicated by the chart below). Theoretically, higher yields would make tech bonds more attractive relative to stocks, which might prompt traders to reallocate. But that doesn't seem to be the case -- at least yet.\n\nThis air of calm has persisted even amid negative commentary from the few Facebook bears out there. Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said in a recent note that Facebook's spate of issues indicates signs of \"systemic mismanagement.\" He even went as far as to suggest the company could be facing some imminent personnel changes.\n\nOne driver that may be keeping tech sentiment afloat in the face of such arguments is the stock market's most trusted ally: earnings growth. Tech companies in the benchmark S&P 500 are expected to see profit expansion of 30% in 2018, far exceeding forecasts for the broader market.\n\nSince earnings growth has been the foremost catalyst for equity gains throughout the nine-year bull market, it looks like traders are blocking out transitory negative factors and staying strong.

Actor Bill Murray recently wrote an op-ed for NBC News Think that compared the students to those that protested the Vietnam War.\n\nThank you for your note and congratulations on the incredible work you and all of your fellow students are doing to make the country a safer place.\n\nIt's terrific that you're editing the Guardian. It's a stellar newspaper and they must feel honored to be working with you.\n\nAmal and I are 100% behind you and will be marching in DC on the 24th, but we both feel very strongly that this is your march. Your moment. Young people are taking it to the adults and that has been your most effective tool. The fact that no adults will speak on the stage in DC is a powerful message to the world that if we can't do something about gun violence then you will. The issue is going to be this, anyone you ask would feel proud to be interviewed by you but it's so much more effective if it's young people.\n\nYou could talk to a dozen kids like the young kids from Chicago and LA that Emma met with. You could take over the Guardian and make it tell the stories of children by children. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to point to this moment and say it belongs to you. You certainly should do what you want but that would be my hope for you.",

McMaster's ouster as White House national security advisor on Thursday was sudden, but not unexpected.\n\nMcMaster and President Donald Trump had long been at odds, with Trump at times publicly rebuking McMaster.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on March 15 that Trump was ready to remove McMaster, but had decided to take his time doing so because he didn't want to humiliate the three-star general and wanted to have a strong successor in place.\n\nMcMaster, 55, told The New York Times on Thursday after the announcement that his departure had been discussed for weeks.\n\n\"Really, the only issue that had been left open is timing,\" he said, adding that he would have preferred to stay until the summer, but the decision was prompted by \"what was best for [Trump] and the country.\"\n\nHowever, McMaster announced that he will retire from the military and is leaving without the other job that it was long rumored he would move to after the White House.\n\nIn August, it was reported that, amid a broader shakeup, Trump was considering giving McMaster command of forces in Afghanistan, allowing him to earn a fourth star.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former senior adviser, characterized that potential move as a vindictive one. \"McMaster wants to send more troops to Afghanistan, so we're going to send him,\" Bannon boasted to author Michael Wolff.\n\nCNN reported in early March that the Pentagon was looking into options that would allow Trump to move McMaster from the White House back to the military. The Defense Department was reportedly also looking for four-star jobs that McMaster could take on -- one potential post was head of Forces Command at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, where McMaster previously served as deputy commander.\n\nMcMaster indicated on Thursday that he would instead retire from the military and public service, which would preclude him from receiving a fourth star.\n\n\"After 34 years of service to our nation, I am requesting retirement from the US Army effective this summer after which I will leave public service,\" McMaster said in a statement that also thanked Trump. \"Throughout my career it has been my greatest privilege to serve alongside extraordinary servicemembers and dedicated civilians.\"\n\nWhite House officials told The Times that the Army had been in contact with McMaster about four-star commands after he left the White House, but he reportedly declined them.\n\n\"I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend,\" Trump said in a tweet announcing the departure.",

The Houthis claim they downed the jet.\n\nSaudi fighter jets likely have decoys and defensive measures on board, but according to Bronk, \"I would be reasonably surprised if a fast jet could emit that amount of fire on impact and get home.\"\n\nNo matter the outcome, the fact that Houthi rebels in Yemen have demonstrated their ability to rig a Russian fighter jet missile to fire at Saudi jets from the ground shows they've advanced and increased their warfighting abilities.",

                "title": "What 'Mercury in retrograde' really means  --  and why it can't tell you anything about your life",
                "body": "It's an optical illusion that astronomers can observe as Mercury speeds past the Earth a few times every year.\n\nAs our world continues to orbit the star at the center of our solar system, we can gaze at the night sky -- like people have for thousands of years -- and watch the stars and the planets that rise and set around us.\n\nOne of those planets -- tiny, sun-scorched Mercury -- frequently causes some consternation for followers of astrology, the belief that the position of Earth in relation to other planets and stars has an effect on human lives and futures.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Mercury entered what's known as apparent retrograde motion, a phrase often shortened to \"Mercury in retrograde\" or simply \"Mercury retrograde.\"\n\nThis phenomenon occurs when the super-speedy planet appears to be moving across the sky in a different direction than it normally does.\n\nIt's an optical illusion created when Mercury catches up to and then passes Earth in its orbit around the sun.\n\nAs one NASA website explains it:\n\n\"You can experience this effect for yourself. Start out standing side by side with a friend. Have a friend walk forward slowly. Now you walk forward at a faster speed. Watch your friend and think about how they are moving relative to you. At first, they move away, then as you pass them, they appear to be moving backward relative to you -- even though they are still walking forward.\"\n\nIt's all about perspective.\n\nSince Mercury moves so quickly, a \"year\" on that planet (the time it takes to complete its orbit around the sun) takes approximately 88 Earth-days. So Mercury's apparent retrograde motion relative to Earth happens three or four times a year, and tends to last approximately three weeks each time.\n\nAs NASA and countless astronomers have pointed out, there's absolutely no scientific evidence that astrology can tell you anything about the future, how you should behave, or what your personality is based on the position of Earth relative to the stars when you were born.\n\nIn fact, we should be grateful that we don't observe any effects from the motion of Mercury or other planets.\n\nAs theoretical cosmologist Katie Mack, as assistant professor at North Carolina State University, told The Guardian, life on Earth would be pretty wild if we were truly affected by surrounding celestial objects.\n\n\"It would be fascinating but rather dystopian if the planets COULD affect our lives. Like, the 'Mercury in retrograde' thing,\" she said. \"Like if the apparent motion across the sky, from Earth, of a planet we can almost never actually see, somehow meant that it, the planet, would suddenly start to meddle in our lives and screw things up for a time.\"\n\nThose who actually want to observe Mercury retrograde in the sky for themselves face a bit of a challenge, since you need to look toward the sun to do so. It's much easier to see Mars retrograde, which happens about every two years, when Earth passes Mars in its orbit.",

                "body": "Cambridge Analytica is embroiled in an international controversy over its alleged improper use of millions of people's Facebook data.\n\nAnother former employee of Cambridge Analytica has come forward and revealed the techniques the controversial data firm used to target US voters ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nA 27-page internal presentation obtained by The Guardian shows how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, and Snapchat to push pro-Donald Trump advertisements during the campaign.\n\nWhile the advertising techniques described in the internal presentation were perfectly legal, they provide further insight into the extent to which Cambridge tried to influence people's perceptions of political candidates on the internet in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nThe Trump campaign hired the firm to lead its digital advertising efforts in early June 2016. Upon joining the Trump team, Cambridge staff discovered it had virtually no centralized digital marketing team.\n\n\"There was no database of record. There were many disparate data sources that were not connected, matched or hygiened,\" Brittany Kaiser, who left her job as a business development director at Cambridge two weeks ago, told The Guardian. \"There was no data science program, so they weren't undertaking any modelling.\"\n\nBut Cambridge helped the Trump campaign turn things around with in-depth survey research, data modelling, and targeted algorithms on social media.\n\nIn one example detailed in the leaked 27-page presentation, Cambridge bought ad space on Google so that when people searched the words \"Trump Iraq War,\" the first query would show a pro-Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton message.\n\n\"Hillary Voted for the Iraq War -- Donald Trump opposed it,\" one of the ads read.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton supports NAFTA -- She will ship jobs overseas,\" said another.\n\nKaiser left Cambridge Analytica earlier this month over a contract dispute, according to The Guardian. She is the second former employee from the company -- following 28-year-old Christopher Wylie -- to speak to the media about how the firm operated.\n\nCambridge has been under intense scrutiny in the last week after it was reported that the firm used the personal information of 50 million people on Facebook without authorization to target them with personalized political advertisements.\n\nFacebook has since suspended the firm from buying ads or managing pages on its social media platform. The company's CEO, Alexander Nix, has also been suspended amid an investigation by British lawmakers into fake news and Nix's contradictory statements regarding Cambridge's use of data from Facebook.",

                "title": "I tried McDonald's new $8 burger made from the world's finest beef  --  and it proved why the chain should stay away from gourmet",
                "body": "I was disappointed by the burger. It tasted bland and overcooked, and it's not worth the price.\n\nIf you haven't heard the news, McDonald's recently began testing a limited-edition Wagyu beef burger in Australia. And no, it's not called the McWagyu. The hyped up burger was released on Wednesday, March 21, in 970 McDonald's Australia locations. So what makes it so special?\n\nIt's McDonald's first burger made from 100% Wagyu beef. Traditionally, Wagyu comes from a Japanese breed of cattle. As McDonald's aims to show the world that it sources from local suppliers, it uses Australian-bred Wagyu for this particular burger.\n\nThe Wagyu beef burger is one of McDonald's most expensive menu items worldwide. It comes out to a whopping $10.50 AUD ($8.10 USD). Typically, Wagyu is on the pricey side as it undergoes an intense marbling process, which makes the meat extra tender, juicy, and flavorful.\n\nAs a lover of all things fast food, I was curious about this new high-quality beef burger. So I marched over to my closest McDonald's in Melbourne, Australia, to try it for myself.\n\nI walked into the restaurant and considered ordering from the kiosks, but the perky Australian employee greeted me with an enthusiastic, \"Hi, how ya going!,\" which made me excited to place my order with her. After picking my jaw off the ground thanks to the shockingly expensive price of the Wagyu beef burger, I grabbed my number and sat down at a table by the window. Most McDonald's locations in Australia do table service, which is always a nice bonus.\n\nThe burger was placed in front of me in a sleek black box with gold writing. It looked as if it held something super rare and extraordinary inside. I looked at it and thought to myself, \"this is gonna be good.\"\n\nI opened the box and my shoulders deflated. It looked like any other McDonald's burger.\n\nSomething I notice right off the bat is that it didn't smell like anything. To me, the sign of a good burger is that mouth-watering whiff of beef that you can smell a mile away. So that was one red flag.\n\nI checked out the burger from all angles. It didn't look like anything out of the ordinary and I could hold it easily in one hand.\n\nThe bun seemed similar to any other burger (although it's supposed to be a gourmet bun), and it came with a few squirts of secret sauce, lettuce, two tomatoes, two measly strips of bacon, one slice of unmelted cheddar cheese, and a few caramelized onions chucked in underneath the Wagyu beef patty.\n\nI took a large bite out of the odorless burger and I was immediately unimpressed. I had high hopes for the 100% Wagyu beef to be something special, but it tasted bland and overcooked.\n\nI really wanted to tell the difference in the beef and be able to justify me purchasing the more expensive burger from McDonald's, but I couldn't. It's simply an overpriced, dry burger whose toppings can't save it. I struggled to enjoy it.\n\nAs Australia is a test hub for new McDonald's products (it's the pioneer behind McCafe, McAngus burger and the design your own burger concept), I think America can pass on the Wagyu beef burger. McDonald's serves much better menu items than this, and I would rather go to a pub and order a proper, tender and juicy Wagyu burger that justifies the price.\n\nAs disappointed as I am, I understand that the recipe is still undergoing testing and can use a few tweaks. If anything, I'd suggest not to keep the patties on the burner for so long. It's the least McDonald's can do when cooking something as high quality as Wagyu.",

                "body": "This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider. To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nFacebook will limit developer access to user data in response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the company announced on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to reports, Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University researcher, created an app that was used by about 300,000 Facebook users, who gave the app permission to access data on themselves and their friends, exposing a network of 50 million people.\n\nCambridge Analytica harvested the personal data of these users without their consent, which the Trump campaign then used to drive \"psychographic\" targeting of the American electorate. Cambridge Analytica was able to do this because Facebook's platform previously enabled apps to gain access not just from a user's data, but also that user's friends' data. The steps Facebook will take in protecting account data focus on fixing previous problems, and introducing stronger protections and tools to prevent future abuse of user data.\n\nHere's an overview of how Facebook plans to limit developers' access to user information and prevent future data abuse on the platform.\n\nThe new privacy changes Facebook outlined will significantly impact third-party developers on the platform. The added data access restrictions could hinder the development of creative Facebook apps because they're largely reliant on account data, according to Marketingdive. It could also impact the speed at which new content is created since developers will have to wait for Facebook to grant them access, according to developer statements to The Economic Times.\n\nEnhancing the privacy and security on Facebook's platform is important because consumers are highly concerned with access to personal and transaction data. The lack of privacy features and the misuse of information on Facebook has hindered use of the platform. Among consumers who don't use Facebook, 57% say its because they don't trust the platform, 49% say Facebook invades their privacy, and 31% say the platform requires too much information, according to The Verge. Facebook's daily active user base in the US and Canada fell for the first time ever in Q4 2017, declining to 184 million from 185 million in the previous quarter. The additional layer of privacy and security could help the social network retain users by making them feel more comfortable using the platform.",

To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nChina will allow foreign companies access to its electronic payments market for the first time, according to an announcement made Wednesday by the country's central bank.\n\nTo operate in the market, international firms will be required to set up local units, establish infrastructure within China, and store client information within the country. The move follows the country's decision to open its ecosystem to foreign card networks, like Visa and Mastercard, in 2016. This could broadly open access to the market, which previously required a domestic partnership, like that between PayPal and Baidu, for even limited entry into the space.\n\nThe Chinese payments market is a massive opportunity for foreign players, but succeeding in it could be an uphill battle.\n\nThe move was intended to spur increased competition in the domestic market. Bloomberg noted that the move could propel the market forward by bringing new ideas into the space that might boost innovation and create newfound competition in an ecosystem that's dominated by major leaders. This, in some ways, goes along with other new central bank policies that place restrictions on QR-code mobile payments in a way that might allow smaller firms to more effectively compete with giants, and could signal a paradigm shift in the region.\n\nBut it's quite possible that the process won't be as simple as it seems. For card players, though the process seemed fairly straightforward at the outset, getting into the Chinese market has been a complicated road, with long waits and shifting regulations.\n\nThis process could be the same, and so firms looking to enter China should anticipate that getting settled in the market could be a complicated and extensive process. That's compounded by new US-levied tariffs against China, in response to perceived theft of intellectual property related to information storage, which could further complicate things for these players.",

The National Retail Federation estimated earlier this year that 13% of all goods purchased over the holiday season would eventually be returned, highlighting the sheer volume of parcels that logistics providers have to handle on the returns side.\n\nAdditionally, an AlixPartners study found the variable cost per package returned can reach $8 per parcel, and it can take as many as six days before the item is ready for resale by a retailer, eating into retailers' revenue and profit margins. Moreover, meeting consumers' desire for in-store returns could help attract retailers looking to improve the customer relationship. If the platform is able to help FedEx and its retail customers cut costs, streamline return shipments, and strengthen customer engagement, it could push rival logistics providers like UPS and DHL to explore launching their own in-house platforms.",

                "title": "Bill Hader breaks down how 'SNL' stage fright inspired his new HBO show about a hitman, and tells a funny Tom Cruise story",
                "body": "He also opened up about helping to voice the \"Star Wars\" character BB-8 (and if he's getting any residuals from the work) and working alongside Tom Cruise in \"Tropic Thunder.\"\n\nSince walking away as a \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member in 2013, Bill Hader has bounced around doing a bunch of things: showing off his dramatic chops in the indie \"The Skeleton Twins,\" playing the leading man in \"Trainwreck,\" doing a lot of voiceover work (\"Inside Out,\" \"Sausage Party,\" \"The Angry Birds Movie,\" \"The BFG\"), and contributing to the voice of BB-8 for \"The Force Awakens.\"\n\nNow he's returning to television for the HBO series, \"Barry\" (series premieres March 25), which he said was inspired by the years of anxiety he battled with while on \"SNL.\"\n\nCocreating the series with Alec Berg (\"Silicon Valley\" executive producer), Hader plays the title character, a former Marine who is now a hitman completely burnt out and in a midlife crisis. While on a job in Los Angeles, Barry suddenly finds acceptance when he mistakenly becomes part of a local theater class while tailing his target. Now Barry has to try to find a way to continue his passion (acting) while continuing his day job as a hitman. The show also marks the first time Hader has ever directed, as he helmed the first three episodes.\n\nBusiness Insider sat down with Hader last month to talk about how he channeled his fears on \"SNL\" -- or, as he put it, \"the thing that you're good at is destroying you\" -- into a creative way to tell a hitman story, if he has received any residuals for voicing BB-8, and what it was like watching Tom Cruise become Les Grossman on the set of \"Tropic Thunder.\"\n\nJason Guerrasio: Was it harder to convince HBO of the \"Barry\" storyline or that you could play a hitman convincingly?\n\nBill Hader: [Laughs] I think it was maybe both. To be honest, HBO was really open. They didn't need a lot of convincing. I had a meeting with them and said, \"I want to do a show,\" and they said, \"We'd love to do something with you.\" And they had seen \"The Skeleton Twins,\" and they liked my performance and saw that I wanted to branch out and do more than just sketch comedy. I think if Alec and I came in and pitched a broad comedy idea they wouldn't have been as interested. However, you say hitman and it conjures up images of a guy in a skinny tie with two 45s.\n\nGuerrasio: But you take that idea of an outsider looking for a community and then bring in the whole arc of a guy dealing with a dead-end job. The kicker is, though, it just happens to be the job he hates is being a hitman.\n\nHader: That's exactly what it is. We thought what's the thing that we could relate to and just copy-paste hitman into it.\n\nHader: I totally pulled it out of thin air, I'm going to be totally honest. Alec and I worked on an idea for a month and a half and it just wasn't jelling.\n\nGuerrasio: What was that?\n\nHader: I can't remember, it was based on a guy I knew back home in Oklahoma and it was much more a weird guy in the Midwest. It was more in tune with the shows you see now that are led by comedians. This show is his daily life and daily struggles. And then we hit this place where it had no narrative pull, and I like things like that. Where each episode ends and you go, \"What's going to happen next?\" And it didn't have big stakes. That got us thinking, the biggest stakes are life and death. And I just said, \"Well, why don't I play a hitman?\" And Alec was like, \"Ugh, I hate that word.\"\n\nGuerrasio: But if it's Jason Statham saying, \"Why don't I play a hitman?\" it's like, seen that before, but you saying it makes things interesting.\n\nHader: Yeah, because I said, \"It's me.\" I remember going to HBO saying, \"OK, it's me as a hitman -- but me.\" And they laughed and we pitched what essentially the pilot was, beat for beat. How art can heal a person. I love reading, I love music, to me these aren't recreational, they fulfill my life. So we made it as the thing this guy is good at is hurting him.\n\nGuerrasio: And is it true the show also gave you an outlet to explore some of the anxieties you went through performing on \"Saturday Night Live\"?\n\nHader: 100%. That was the thing, at \"SNL\" the anxiety was so high. The longer I was on the show the better I was getting at the show but my anxiety didn't go down. It was actually going up. So, again, the thing that you're good at is destroying you.\n\nGuerrasio: Did you throw any specific experiences you dealt with on \"SNL\" into \"Barry\"?\n\nHader: I do have a stage-fright thing, it's gotten better. That was in the pilot a little. The closest thing in the pilot is when Barry goes to the bar with the theater class. I remember when I first got to \"SNL\" I was suddenly getting to hang out with Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers and Rachel Dratch, and Tina Fey, and Chris Parnell, all these people that I admired. And I would be at a bar with them and I felt very out of place. I have to work with them and they are all geniuses and I don't feel equipped.\n\nGuerrasio: You direct the first three episodes of the season, did that just happen by accident?\n\nHader: I wanted to direct. I said I wanted to direct the pilot and that was kind of a big thing. HBO came back and said, \"We want to do this pilot,\" and I went, \"Cool, I want to direct it.\" And they went, \"Huh, well, have you directed before?\" And I was. like, \"No. But I've been on a lot of sets.\" And they were like, \"Hmm.\" And I think the only reason they let me direct it was because Alec would be there and he's directed a ton of stuff for them. It was a thing I wanted to do my whole life. Before I wanted to be an actor. My heroes were all filmmakers. So getting a chance to do that was amazing.\n\nGuerrasio: You've said you watched a lot of true crime shows and movies to prepare for this, was that for a visual style or story?\n\nHader: More story. It's so hard because you just don't want to make it a TV show about other TV shows or movies.\n\nGuerrasio: You did not want to end up down the \"Get Shorty\" road.\n\nHader: Yeah. It's so easy to end up there. And that's not to disparage Elmore Leonard or \"Get Shorty.\" I remember we were out in the desert shooting a scene and I turn to Alec and I go, \"We're doing 'Breaking Bad' right now.\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I was thinking about that.\" We're thinking, hitman that wants to be an actor, chemistry teacher who wants to be a drug dealer, we were like \"Fu--! How did we not see this?\" But, I love \"Breaking Bad\" so it seeps in no matter what.\n\nGuerrasio: Gonna change it up a little before we're done. Did you do any BB-8 stuff for \"The Last Jedi\"?\n\nHader: No, no, no. That was really funny. That is J.J. Abrams being a really nice guy. That is him saying, \"Oh, I know you like Star Wars, do you want to come in and do the thing?\" But anybody could do that, what I did. It's a Peter Frampton talk box with an app J.J. had.\n\nHader: That's a good question, I should ask my business manager. [Laughs] You're finding out how bad I am at this. If my dad reads this he would lose his sh--. \"You gotta know how much f---ing money you have, you moron!\"\n\nGuerrasio: [Laughs]\n\nHader: I mean, I would hope so. But that was just J.J. calling me up and saying 'Hey, man, you wanna come do this?' And I was like, sure. I did a voice initially, I tried it as a voice. And it didn't work. And I was like, \"Well, there you go, it didn't work.\" And months later, I mean, there were billboards already out for the movie, and he called again and was like, \"You wanna try again?\"\n\nGuerrasio: I read once in an interview you did that you were kind of shocked to run into Tom Cruise at the premiere of \"Tropic Thunder\" because when you worked with him on the movie he was Les Grossman the whole time. Did you mean he was in character the whole time?\n\nHader: No. He wasn't Method or anything like that. It was just easy to talk to him because he was in that makeup. We're talking about \"Risky Business\" and I'm asking him questions about \"Eyes Wide Shut\" and he was so cool and so nice, but he was dressed as Les Grossman. But then seeing him at the premiere and he's like, \"Hey, man\" and I'm, like, \"Jesus, you're Tom Cruise!\" and I got star struck because I finally was next to him without makeup.\n\nGuerrasio: Did you come up with any bits on the fly on set for Tom to do as Les?\n\nHader: No. That was him and [screenwriter] Justin Theroux and [director] Ben Stiller. I was off to the side. I was just laughing at it all. I would improvise little things. I was just always trying to get him to yell at me. I would come up with stupid things to get him to get mad. I basically did an impersonation of an executive from Paramount that me and Ben know. Ben just liked the energy of me being this weird, calm guy and Les being this raging dude. But I don't think you can do Les Grossman right now. [Laughs] You would be in jail. It just seems he was a dying breed and hopefully dying in prison. [Laughs]",

The Treasury Department levied sanctions against the Mabna Institute and the defendents, which came in addition to the criminal charges filed by the Justice Department.\n\n\"For many of these intrusions, the defendants acted at the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps,\" Rosenstein said in a press conference. \"The Department of Justice will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors who attempt to profit from America's ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing intellectual property. This case is important because it will disrupt the defendants' hacking operations and deter similar crimes.\"\n\nThe defendents were charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, and identity theft.

                "body": "Finally, at executive level you must continue to find ways to improve as a leader while also maintaining confidence.\n\nMarch rings in National Women's History Month: when we recognize pioneers of women's rights for paving the way for our success.\n\nAround this time last year, I called on business leaders to take ownership of their responsibility to promote gender parity within -- and beyond -- the workplace. Since then, we've seen the #MeToo movement take off, defined by bravery on the part of many women calling out acts of workplace harassment.\n\nConcurrently, the aftermath of James Damore's Google diversity memo and Emily Chang's investigation into \"Brotopia\" exposes the prevalent sexist attitudes within the tech community. Sadly, when it comes to women in executive roles, the number of male-only executive boards increased in 2017.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to spend 30 plus years in the tech industry -- bearing witnessing its evolution and growth. Today, I'd like to share my approach to leadership and provide some helpful insight as to how women working in tech can achieve success as we call for a more inclusive tech community.\n\nI found tech through my love of writing. I loved to write (and still do), but I was intrigued by technology. I had an opportunity early on in my career to become a technical writer, and I jumped at the chance to combine my skills and passions. I had the good fortune to work at a large firm that afforded me solid professional training, coupled with a varied career path that led me to a passion for marketing and ultimately inspired me to get a second degree.\n\nI encourage you to find an environment where you can pursue your passion but also one that encourages professional development. Consider how fulfilled you are in your current position. Do you have room to explore your interests?\n\nTrust your judgment when assessing your growth potential. It's also never too early, nor too late, to try something new. Once you identify your passion, determine how it fits into your aspirations and future career trajectory.\n\nIn tech, as with most industries, there can be a culture of competition in the workplace. Women ages 25 to 34 are leaving tech all together due to \"unsupportive work environments,\" with 56% of women leaving at the \"mid-level\" point.\n\nWhile a certain degree of competition is healthy and productive, it must be fostered in the right manner -- or it can become toxic. It is more effective to marshal resources and energy toward winning as a team, rather than turning one's team against each other. One key tenet to which I subscribe is that \"the enemy is always on the outside.\"\n\nManagers set the tone for their teams. Identify the strengths of your colleagues and allow your team members to play to those strengths. Foster healthy competition, but also focus on collaboration. Have your leadership team take a styles inventory test, like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or 5 Dynamics Human Performance System , to identify how your team tends to meld (or not). Work with each team member to ensure you're allowing them to play to their strengths and excel.\n\nJust remember: You are in charge of cultivating the kind of work environment that is inclusive and conducive to their success.\n\nOne of the most impactful pieces of advice given to me over the years came from someone on my team. I was managing an enthusiastic group, full of fresh ideas, who resembled a band of renegades at times. It's a great problem to have, but focusing the team was a challenge. I also wanted to overlay my ideas onto theirs -- and in retrospect, this stifled the team's creativity. In a heated discussion with a team member defending his position, he frankly stated, \"You know, Nancy, not everything is black and white. You need to see more grey.\" While it may sound fundamental, it was eye-opening. It reminds me of the saying, \"Do you want to win or do you want to be right?\" I was so set on being right that I wasn't open to new ideas.\n\nTo best lead a team, you need to listen. That bold truth helped me to reflect on my leadership style and focus on what was most beneficial to the team. Part of creating inclusive environments is fostering a community where a team can be expressive and feel safe doing so. Figure out what kind of leadership style works for both you and your team, and what will be conducive to achieving overall company success. By creating a workplace where all employees can thrive, you can build a defense against the disorganized or competitive environments.\n\nRegardless of where you are in your career, always examine how your presence and influence can cultivate a more inclusive workplace. The year 2017 exposed the fact that sexual harassment, gender bias, and unhealthy workplace environments surround us.\n\nUndoubtedly, 2018 is the year to demand change. The technology industry praises itself for its innovation and problem-solving. Now is the time to tap into that creative energy at all career levels to build a stronger, more inclusive tech industry.",

                "body": "Whole Foods, now owned by Amazon, has been centralizing several roles in a push to cut costs. The moves have at times bothered employees, customers, and s uppliers.\n\nWhole Foods is slashing regional and in-store marketing and graphic design jobs in its latest push to centralize operations, people with knowledge of the matter told Business Insider. The company currently employs graphic designers who create signage used in the stores to highlight local products and prices. The positions, along with several corporate marketing roles, are being eliminated, the people said, asking not to be identified. Some employees were told they'd have until July 2 and would continue to receive benefits until the end of that month. It's not clear exactly how many jobs will be affected, but the company operates about 450 stores and 11 regional offices in the United States. About 10 positions are being eliminated from each regional office, the person said. Employees were told that the move is being made because Whole Foods wants to \"centralize\" certain jobs and have regional and global teams handle jobs that can be done outside the store. In-store marketing staff and regional marketing coordinators will have to re-interview for jobs at the regional office, employees were told on a conference call on Thursday. A profile of one of the graphic designers, posted on Whole Foods website, describes the role this way: \"We create a variety of hand drawn chalkboards that help define many Whole Foods Market stores. And my title means many things, but essentially I'm responsible for those chalkboards as well as the accuracy of item/pricing signage, maintenance of the associated databases and the creation, upkeep and distribution of all advertising and in-store marketing collateral.\" Whole Foods didn't reply to requests for comment on the moves. The company has been moving away from its localized approach in the past year, shifting other roles to its Austin headquarters and changing its supply chain and inventory methods in order to cut costs. Those moves have angered some employees, suppliers, and customers, as they've left stores without inventory or conflicted with the \"local\" ethos that Whole Foods had come to be known for.",

As such, we haven't included any of those frothers in this guide.\n\nThere are plenty of stationary electric milk frothers that you plug into your wall that will also produce excellent foamy milk, and we've put the best ones in this guide. However, the best electric milk frothers are significantly more expensive than handheld electronic ones and manual ones.\n\nAfter much testing, our best experience has been with manual milk frothers that cost less than $20. Since there's no electricity involved, you do have to froth the milk yourself by pumping the milk full of air inside the jug. You also have to heat the milk after you've frothed it, but you'll have more control over how hot it gets. Even though there is more work involved with manual milk frothers, you'll get the best results for the least amount of money.\n\nWe've included two great manual milk frothers as our topic picks for most people, but if you're dead set on having an electric milk frother, we've got you covered with three great options ranging in price from about $40 to $130.\n\nUpdated on 03/23/2018 by Malarie Gokey: Added the new Nespresso Aeroccino4 milk frother as a replacement for an out-of-stock pick that is no longer being produced. Also updated prices and added new links and imagery.",

For this yearly plan, MoviePass charges $6.95 per month and a one-time processing fee of $6.55. This is not the first time MoviePass has rolled out such an offer, but it isn't something the company offers all the time.\n\nThis continues the company's quest to hit the 5 million mark in subscribers to the service by the end of the year, which MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe has predicted. In February, the company announced that it had hit 2 million subscribers.\n\nThe announcement also boasts of the contribution MoviePass has had to the opening weekends of recent new releases. According to the company, it was responsible for 17% of box office to Paramount's \"Annihilation,\" 10% of box office to Orion's \"Every Day,\" and 9% of box office to Fox's \"Love, Simon.\"\n\nMoviePass also revealed to Business Insider recently that it bought over 1 million tickets for Disney/Marvel's sensation, \"Black Panther.\"",

Eventually, United offered Preiss a $10,000 travel credit, which she accepted.\n\n\"This is how badly United didn't want to give me cash,\" she wrote above what appears to be a photo of her $10,000 voucher.\n\n\"We issued this voucher per our policy,\" United told Business Insider in an email.\n\n\"On the upside, I wasn't physically dragged off the plane and my dog wasn't killed on board,\" she wrote.\n\nIn the past year, United has been unable to avoid customer service scandals. Last week, the airline had three dog-related incidents in which one died in the overhead bin of a United flight and two were sent to incorrect destinations.

                "title": "Donald Trump's ignorance about the Chinese auto market is hurting US companies  --  and Elon Musk isn't helping",
                "body": "By the numbers, an imbalance on imports duties is meaningless because so few China-made vehicles come to the US.\n\nEver since the 2016 campaign, then-candidate and now President Donald Trump's sweeping inability to grasp the basics of the global auto industry has continually astonished.\n\nSome of this was demagoguery: appeal to blue-collar workers angry about globalism and the decline of Team USA, using the most symbolic American industry of them all. But much of it was just flat-out ignorance. Trump as a real-estate developer from New York had reinvented himself as a reality TV star and was presiding over a family-run branding enterprise. His understanding of cars was limited to appreciating the inside of a limo.\n\nThe latest chapter in this is Trump's tariff and trade-war stance toward China, which was unfortunately amplified by Tesla CEO Elon Musk a few weeks back on Twitter. Trump thinks China is screwing the US and Musk unhelpfully tweeted that \"an American car going to China pays 25% import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference.\"\n\nExcept that American companies largely build their cars for the Chinese market in China, via joint ventures with Chinese manufacturers, an arrangement that's been in place since the 1990s. Tesla lacks a JV partner, builds all its cars in one factory in California, yet wants to expand its China market and -- because Musk dislikes sharing control of the company's destiny -- do it without a JV.\n\nMeanwhile, a fairly tiny number of vehicles coming to the US from China actually gets hit by that current 2.5% duty. The Buick Envision is made in China and imported to US, and last year Buick sold about 40,000. The Cadillac CT6 plug-in hybrid: maybe 1,000. The Volvo S60: about 12,000, but it's unclear from the sales data just how many of those came from China, and Volvo will be shifting production to a new US plant.\n\nThese numbers are so small relative to the size of the US market -- the past three years have seen at least 17 million in annual sales -- that it would be pointless to charge anything more than 2.5%. And really, even that duty seems unneeded. There isn't a single standalone Chinese brand in the US. Volvo is the closest, owned by China's Geely, but it's still technically a Swedish company.\n\nIt's possible that more Chinese imports could be coming, and it's also true that automakers such as Ford are moving some small-vehicle production to China -- but that's because Ford wants to free up capacity in the US to build higher-margin pickups and SUVs.\n\nMusk's stake here is obvious: that 25% duty is a real drag on Tesla's China demand. But most automakers prefer to build their cars where they sell them, so Tesla is going to have to come up with a way to achieve a carve-out from the JV rules -- something it already attempted with the city of Shanghai -- or just play along and do a normal JV like everybody else.\n\nFor the rest of the industry, it just makes doing business in China, the world's largest auto market, more difficult, and it damages the supply chain, imposing a cost on parts coming from China at a time when the US-based supply chain is maxed out on capacity.\n\nFortunately, the US auto industry was prepared for this. Trump threatened a border tax in 2016 when he was campaigning, and the industry assumed it was coming. Car companies figured they could lobby the administration about its execution while enjoying the counterbalancing corporate tax cut.\n\nAn all-out trade war wasn't part of that calculation. So yet again Trump has made trouble for perhaps his most important business constituency. He can't get his head around the fact that world's two most important car markets aren't independent from each other, as they might have been decades ago. They're increasingly connected and mutually supportive. Attack one and you attack the other.",

He cites a combination of tax cuts and higher budget spending at a time when the economic recovery is already long in the tooth and unemployment is historically low.\n\nThis will spell trouble for a corporate sector that has loaded up on debt over the past few years.\n\nMinerd sees strong economic growth this year and next followed by a potential downturn after 2019 -- a painful one for which he believes neither the Federal Reserve nor the federal government will be well prepared.\n\n\"With the huge fiscal stimulus coming online, the Fed will feel obliged to play the role of creating economic headwinds,\" he wrote. \"The collision will take place when the effects of fiscal stimulus begin to wear off and monetary policy keeps getting more and more restrictive.\"\n\nIndeed, the Fed raised interest rates this week but also revised up its economic growth forecasts for this year and next, in large part because of the expected impact of fiscal policies. Fears of a more accelerated pace of interest rate increases have been weighing on markets, who are concerned the central bank could overshoot and cause a recession.\n\nMinerd does not see a slump in the immediate future. But when it does come, it will be a deep, he says.\n\n\"We will enter the next recession with the highest debt load on record for corporate balance sheets,\" writes Minerd, who has been recommending clients to dump their corporate bond holdings.\n\n\"In the last recession, consumption by households collapsed because their balance sheets were overburdened by debt, and it was the household sector that led us into the recession,\" he said.\n\n\"The next recession is going to emanate from the corporate sector. There is likely to be a sharp decline in employment and a sharp decline in profitability, followed by widening credit spreads as the market discounts the expectation of higher corporate defaults.\"",

A majority of the actors who voice dogs in the film are white including Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson. (At the beginning of the movie, viewers are informed that all of the dog's barks have been translated into English.)\n\nWhile some have criticized Anderson for white-washing in the film, the majority of the negative critical attention has to do with his representation of Japanese culture.\n\nLos Angeles Times film reporter Justin Chang wrote a thoughtful review calling the film an \"often captivating, sometimes irritating, unavoidably perplexing movie.\" But he also took Anderson to task for the way he presented and interpreted Japanese culture as a white man.\n\n\"Bluntly put,\" Chang writes, \"does this white American filmmaker's highly selective, idiosyncratic rendering of an East Asian society constitute a sincere act of homage, or a clueless failure of sensitivity?\"\n\nChang finds that the movie is beautiful, the dogs \"amazing,\" but the story is its biggest flaw. \"It's in the director's handling of the story's human factor that his sensitivity falters, and the weakness for racial stereotyping that has sometimes marred his work comes to the fore.\"\n\nJen Yamato of the LA Times came forward in support of Chang's criticism of the movie. In a tweet, Yamato thanked Chang for \"devoting far more attention than most critics will to many of the willfully tone-deaf ways Wes Anderson appropriates and marginalizes Japanese culture and people in his so-called homage. It is ugly, indeed.\"\n\nChang's review also received some backlash on Twitter, however, with one user saying, \"it's a FILM FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!\"\n\nBut Chang's review, and Yamato's support of it, helped others see the film in a different way.\n\nGizmodo entertainment reporter Germain Lussier wrote on Twitter, \"This review is wonderful and opened my eyes to something I didn't see in the movie myself. I wish others could read it in the same way I did and learn from it.\"\n\nAwards Circuit writer Karen Peterson also reconsidered the movie, writing, \"Thank you for this. I enjoyed the film a lot, but the whole time I kept wondering how I would feel about it if this was my culture being depicted.\"",

To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out three ways that the company will protect user data going forward in a post on his Facebook page, the CEO's first public response to the scandal related to Cambridge Analytica, as reported by Bloomberg and The Verge.\n\nZuckerberg said that Facebook will take the following steps:\n\nFor the time being, most media buyers say they're unlikely to pull back on advertiser spending on the platform, per Adweek. So far internet company Mozilla has become the first to stop advertising on Facebook, saying it is \"pressing pause\" on the platform, following its own assessment of Facebook data controls, according to a blog post. It's possible other companies will follow suit in the coming days, particularly as brands feel the need to take a moral stance on issues in response to increasingly vocal consumers.\n\nFacebook remains virtually unmatched in terms of its targeting ability and reach thanks to its sheer scale, with 2.13 billion monthly active users (MAU) globally as of year-end 2017. Digital spending habits on Facebook are already deeply entrenched. Advertisers could grow skittish about the platform, however, if advertising there becomes less valuable, though it's still unclear if such an exodus will manifest. Another potential spur that could erode advertiser spending on Facebook is if new limitations on data access hurt the ability of advertisers to effectively target their desired audience.\n\nThe Digital Trust Report, a brand new report from Business Insider Intelligence, examines consumers' perception of major social platforms. It rates Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and LinkedIn on security, community, user experience, and content authenticity and shareability. These insights help brands and marketers make informed decisions about where to spend their marketing and branding dollars.\n\nAll of the information in this survey comes from our proprietary BI Insiders panel, made up of more than 15,000 specially selected and recruited Business Insider readers. This panel is designed to be a leading indicator of what's next in digital. The panelists are business and tech savvy, they have buying power, and they're highly engaged. The survey revealed some fascinating insights into how millennials and decision makers view today's most popular social media platforms.",
