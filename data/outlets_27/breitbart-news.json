                "body": "On Friday's broadcast of HBO's \"Real Time,\" host Bill Maher called for Hollywood producers to accept more pitches from Republicans, so that people rejected from show business like NRA Spokeswoman Dana Loesch, Breitbart News Founder Andrew Breitbart, and former Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon don't express anger towards Hollywood over being rejected.\n\nMaher began by arguing Republicans shouldn't pretend they dislike celebrities giving their political opinions since they made Ronald Reagan president. He continued, \"It's not our fault that your celebrities are Ted Nugent, Pat Sajak, and Donald Trump.\" Maher further referenced and mocked James Woods, Scott Baio, Antonio Sabàto, Jr., Stacey Dash.\n\nMaher then turned to Loesch. He said, \"What you may not know about Dana Loesch is that before her job as NRA spokesmodel, she was a show business wannabe, a homemaker in St. Louis with a mommy blog and a radio show and dreams of TV stardom. 'NCIS' Producer Paul Guyot says that ten years ago, Dana pitched him a sitcom, starring herself as 'a hot young mom who does a far-right radio show.' ... And you know what? If only they'd made that sitcom, today, she might be a completely normal person.\"\n\nHe also said that the same thing happened to Andrew Breitbart, \"who admits he came to Hollywood, 'with the hope that I'd eventually become a comedy writer.' And to his successor there, Steve Bannon, also a showbiz reject, who didn't have the talent to cut it here, and so, spent the rest of life hating, Hollywood, and by extension, all liberals.\"\n\nMaher further stated, \"In his memoir, Breitbart mentions Reagan 6 times, and me 34 times.\" Maher also stated that Andrew Breitbart's criticism of cocktail parties on the Westside is \"funny, because, you know, for years, you know who I'd always see at cocktail parties on the Westside? Andrew Breitbart. Oh, he hated Hollywood, hated it, hated it, hated it, mostly from his home in America's heartland, Brentwood.\"\n\nMaher's monologue continued, \"As for Bannon, George Clooney remembers him as 'a schmuck who literally tried everything he could to sell scripts' including, this is true, a rap musical of Shakespeare's 'Coriolanus.' ... But trust me, if Bannon could've sold a screenplay or Breitbart a sitcom, they wouldn't have ended up ranting and raving about cocktail parties on the Westside, they'd be attending them. And in Bannon's case, finishing the drinks people left on the table, including the ones with a cigarette in them.\"\n\nHe concluded by asking Hollywood executives to institute \"affirmative action\" for conservative movie and TV ideas so they won't \"take their rejection out on the whole country.\"",

I am going to get my shotgun and do something about this,\" Godwin reportedly said, according to court documents.\n\nGodwin then allegedly pointed at two staffers and said, \"You two are next.\"\n\nTaylor was not at the meeting and was scheduled to appear at several public events on Saturday, the Washington Post reported.\n\nGodwin reportedly has a concealed weapons permit and has a history of acting aggressively with the congressman's staff.\n\nHe has also been outspoken on social media about his anti-marijuana views and tried to sue the federal government for $500 million for not enforcing its marijuana laws, WKTR reported. His lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nGodwin was charged with threatening to murder and assault a United States official and could face up to ten years behind bars if convicted. Federal prosecutors say, however, that sentences issued are often less than the maximum penalties.\n\nTaylor praised law enforcement for its swift response and addressed the need for Americans to resolve their differences peacefully.\n\n\"The tone of our discourse has come to unacceptable and dangerous levels,\" Taylor said in a statement after the arrest was announced. \"I call on everyone, and I mean everyone, to please calm down. We are all Americans. There is so much that unites us.\"",

                "body": "A host of National Public Radio's Morning Edition asked Cameron Kasky, 17, about young people who disagree with him about guns.\n\n\"I've read some really interesting op-eds by students about your age who say, you know, 'I'm growing up in rural America. Guns are part of my family's culture. I like target shooting. I don't think guns are a bad thing,'\" Noel King noted.\n\n\"What do you say to a 17-year-old who fundamentally disagrees with you about some of this stuff?\" King asked.\n\n\"Well, I say we're marching to protect you from other people like you who have guns,\" Kasky said. \"And I say that target shooting, while it is a sport, we've become the targets.\"\n\n\"We're the targets now,\" Kasky said. \"We are running away from people like you.\"\n\nThe interview gave Kasky the opportunity to assert that the march, which is expected to draw as many as 500,000 to the nation's capital and hundreds of other cities around the country and even some abroad, was still controlled by the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\nBut when asked about the protest's left-wing supporters, Kasky admitted that adults helped pull off the D.C. event, which requires a federal permit, massive logistical support, and lots of money, including millions in insurance costs.\n\nKing: You are working with progressive groups, though - right? - like Indivisible, which is a movement to resist the Trump agenda. You have dipped a toe into politics here.\n\nKasky then said race is an issue in school shootings.\n\nKasky: You know, our story was told because we are an affluent white community. And we have to shine the spotlight that was given on us on everybody in the world who has to deal with this on a daily basis. So people like Indivisible, who represent students who are in lower-income communities and don't get to speak out the way we do because people don't listen, we have to connect with these students.\n\n\"So the leadership of this movement still is teenagers?\" King asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Kasky claimed. \"And while we have people who help us, while we have people who can help us book hotels and get city permits, those aren't the people controlling our message. Those aren't the people writing our words. The only reason this has worked and the only reason this will continue to work is because we don't let ourselves get bastardized by others.\"\n\nIn fact, a wide coalition of left-wing groups have been involved in organizing, promoting, and funding the march, including the anti-gun group Giffords, Move On, and Women's March LA.",

                "title": "Kobach: Liberal Corporations Attack America's Gun Culture",
                "body": "In the last week, liberal corporations and anti-gun interests have launched a new salvo in the gun control battle.\n\nBut this time they are not merely advocating gun control policies or limiting the sale of firearms in certain stores. Instead, they are attacking America's gun culture itself. By gun culture, I mean the culture that appreciates the value of firearms, promotes the lawful use of firearms, and respects the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Two different developments have occurred.\n\nFirst, the Kroger retail giant announced that it was removing from its stores any magazines or publications that feature \"assault rifles.\" Kroger wasn't specific about which magazines would go, but that could potentially remove everything from Guns & Ammo to Outdoor Life. Kroger owns nearly 3,000 supermarkets and retail stores including Kroger, Dillon's, Fred Meyer's and Harris Teeter. Unlike restricting the sale of firearms to buyers 21 or older, this move attacks the very notion that firearms can be the subject of collecting, sport shooting, hunting use, and popular interest. In other words, it rejects the fact that reasonable people have a legitimate interest in reading about guns.\n\nSecond, YouTube announced that all videos that demonstrate firearms, promote the sale of firearms, or provide instruction on the assembly of firearms will be banned from its platform. That is a major change that will affect millions of gun owners. Gun owners often check out reviews and demonstrations posted on YouTube before buying a firearm, just like other consumers check out reviews on YouTube.\n\nIt's also unclear just how extensive the YouTube ban will be. I and many other gun owners sometimes check out instructional videos on gun maintenance on YouTube. Those videos demonstrate firearms and sometimes involve the assembly of firearms. Will they be banned as well? And what about gun safety videos? Hunting videos? Those too involve the demonstration of firearms, and they indirectly promote the sale of firearms.\n\nYouTube has become a virtual public square where millions of Americans communicate with each other on a variety of topics. It appears that this public square will soon exclude communication that involves firearms in any demonstrative way.\n\nBoth of these moves are designed to inhibit the expression of ideas that is an important part of the gun culture in America. Our Founding Fathers appreciated the importance of an armed citizenry. Indeed, they declared in the Second Amendment that it was \"necessary to the security of a free State.\" But an armed citizenry requires a culture that supports the safe and lawful use of guns by a significant portion of the population. That culture is now under threat.",

                "body": "On the eve of a left-wing-orchestrated event called \"March for Our Lives\" - an adult-led protest that uses students to advocate for gun control - Runcie defends the PROMISE policy that drove down the number of minority student arrests and suspensions in his school district by allowing threatening and even violent behaviors to go unreported.\n\nIn a column at the Sun Sentinel, Runcie - who once worked for President Barack Obama's education secretary Arne Duncan in Chicago - mocks the attention paid to the Obama-era Dear Colleague letter that coerced school districts into adopting the policy as a means to supposedly end the \"school-to-prison pipeline\" for minority students.\n\nThe Obama administration threatened school districts with the possibility of federal investigation and loss of funding if their statistics showed disproportionately more minority students arrested and suspended than white and Asian students. The Obama administration praised Runcie's PROMISE program and likely considered it a model for the rest of the country.\n\nNevertheless, the Broward County superintendent would prefer the focus to be on \"easy access to guns\" as the reason Cruz was able to obtain his firearm.\n\nRuncie denies his PROMISE program was at all instrumental in Cruz's shooting.\n\n\"Contrary to media reports, the district has no record of Nikolas Cruz committing a PROMISE eligible infraction or being assigned to PROMISE while in high school,\" he writes:\n\nPROMISE is part of the district's Code Book for Student Conduct & Discipline Policy. It is an intervention program for 13 specific non-violent, misdemeanor infractions, such as petty theft under $300, trespassing, vandalism, alcohol use and disruption of campus.\n\nThe district has always been explicitly clear that we have no policies that limit or tie the hands of law enforcement in doing its job in addressing school safety.\n\nMax Eden, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, however, tells Breitbart News Runcie's explanation warrants a closer look.\n\n\"Runcie's careful formulation contains a falsehood, several omissions, and obfuscations,\" Eden says. \"It doesn't cover middle school, where Cruz racked up about two dozen offenses and was transferred into an intensive behavior management school - without ever getting an arrest record.\"\n\n\"Runcie claims that PROMISE only covered 'non-violent' offenses,\" Eden observes. \"That's just straight false. The 2013 version covered assault and fighting; the 2016 version covered 'affray,' i.e., fighting. That means Cruz's fights were only deemed non-PROMISE eligible based on administrator discretion, not policy.\"\n\n\"Given that Cruz is alleged to have threatened students, it's also worth noting that 'threats' are a PROMISE-eligible offense,\" he continues. \"Perhaps those incidents weren't recorded as threats. Students have reported that Cruz brought bullets and knives to school. Perhaps those incidents weren't recorded at all. Or perhaps they were and Runcie's statement eludes them; the discipline matrix doesn't highlight Class B Weapons as a PROMISE-eligible Incident.\"\n\nEden urges a careful look at \"the hurdles Runcie built into the new discipline matrix.\"\n\n\"After failing to get Cruz involuntarily committed to a mental institution, the school developed a plan: don't let him bring a backpack because maybe he'll kill everyone,\" he explains. \"Then he commits an assault. Used to be, there were four categories for assault and you could call the cops for three. But now, there were three categories and you could only call the cops for the most serious form of assault. So, despite everything about his record and insane behavior, policy prohibited administrators from sending him to law enforcement when he committed that assault ... three weeks before he legally bought an AR-15.\"\n\nThe 2016 PROMISE collaborative agreement among the school district, law enforcement, and community partners - such as the NAACP - also resolves that the parties \"follow the letter and spirit of the ESSA [federal Every Student Succeeds Act] provisions to reduce exclusionary disciplinary practices, while implementing prevention and intervention programs for children and youth who are neglected, delinquent, or at-risk.\"\n\n\"The parties will also follow the Department of Justice and Department of Education Guidelines on School Climate and Discipline,\" the PROMISE agreement states.\n\nAt a recent Heritage Foundation panel focused on the reported disorder that has resulted from the Obama-era school leniency policy, U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Gail Heriot, a professor of law at the University of San Diego School of Law, observed that the Obama administration essentially told schools that if teachers and principals are disciplining proportionally more African American students than white or Asian students, \"we're coming after you with massive investigations and threats to cut off your funding.\"\n\n\"Under this approach it's not actual race discrimination that gets schools in trouble,\" Heriot noted. \"It's having 'bad numbers.'\"\n\n\"Nobody disputes that African American students are disciplined at higher rates than white students or Asian students nationally,\" she observed. \"But what if the reason for that is that African Americans misbehave more often, and what if the cost of failure to discipline those students falls on their fellow African American students who are trying to learn amid classroom disorder?\"\n\nHeriot also emphasized that white students get disciplined at rates higher than Asian students and that boys get disciplined at higher rates than girls.\n\n\"Yet, no one seems very interested in those bad numbers,\" she asserted.\n\nAccording to Heriot, it is \"virtually undisputed that students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to misbehave in school than students from middle-class backgrounds.\"\n\nHowever, the U.S. Civil Rights commissioner said research shows that prior problem behavior is the best predictor of who will get suspended from school - and not race.\n\nShe observes the Obama-era policy has produced two \"severely negative effects\":\n\nFirst, it's caused schools to back away from discipline generally, with the result of more chaotic classrooms. Second, it has led to real discrimination, where white and Asian students on the one hand, and African American students on the other, operate under different discipline rules - all in order to make the numbers look good.\n\nHeriot urges the Trump U.S. Education Department to withdraw the Dear Colleague letters establishing the lenient discipline policy and put teachers and principals back in charge.",

                "body": "The Pentagon's rejection of the transgender ideology pushed Obama is a huge win for political groups who want to preserve the legal and civic distinctions between the two equal, different and complementary male and female biological sexes.\n\nThe rejection of Obama's policy prompted emotional protests from progressives who wish to outlaw and stigmatize the distinctions between women and men, and between girls and boys. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House's minority leader, described the revived policy as a \"hateful\" insult to \"our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.\"\n\nNo one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity. #ProtectTransTroops\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) March 24, 2018\n\nIn their immediate response, progressive advocates tried to smear Trump's defense of sexual distinctions as \"bigotry.\" They did not try to make any substantial arguments why Americans should agree to the transgender demand that people can change their legal sex by simply declaring themselves to be members of the other sex.\n\nBanning transgender men and women from serving in our military is based on nothing more than bigotry. To all of the brave trans troops in uniform today, please know that this President does not speak for a country eternally grateful for your service. #ProtectTransTroops\n\n-- Rep. Joe Kennedy III (@RepJoeKennedy) March 24, 2018\n\nTrump, as the Commander in Chief, sets policies in the military. Pro-transgender groups want judges to override the president's authority and to bar the military from using biology to determine a soldier's legal sex.\n\nBREAKING: The Department of Defense announced its plan tonight to implement President Trump's directive to ban transgender service members from serving in the military.\n\nThat directive has been blocked by federal courts in four separate cases, including our case, Stone v. Trump.\n\n-- ACLU (@ACLU) March 24, 2018\n\nThe revived policy will not exclude stable soldiers who want to live privately as members of the other sex, but it declines to validate their demand to be classified and treated as members of the other sex.\n\nUnder Obama, Pentagon deputies allowed soldiers to flip their \"gender marker\" in personnel files once the soldiers declared they have the \"gender identity\" of an opposite-sex person. That gender-identity-beats-biology policy had many knock-on effects, including orders to female soldiers that they must welcome men into their showers once the men have registered themselves as female in the military's personnel files.\n\nObama pushed the policy even though very few people claim to be transgender, and far fewer undergo surgery. For example, only 4,118 people tried to change their bodies in surgery from 2000 to 2014, according to a recent, peer-reviewed study. After the 2016 election, Obama told National Public Radio that his transgender push help Trump win the election.\n\nThe Pentagon policy is approved by a Trump memo and is detailed in a February memo from Defense Secretary James Mattis that was released March 23.\n\nMattis's memo says he will grandfather in the small number of soldiers who switched their \"gender marker\" under the Obama administration.\n\nThe memo says the military will accept recruits who prefer to live as members of the other sex but would not recognize their claim or provide any related medical treatment -- such as hormones and cosmetic genital surgery. The memo says:\n\nTransgender persons without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all other Service members, in their biological sex.\n\nPeople who want -- or have undergone -- sex-related medical treatment will be excluded, says the document:\n\nTransgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service.\n\nPeople who have mental health problems because of their desire to flip sex from male to female, or from female to male, will not be allowed to serve:\n\nTransgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service.\n\nMattis allowed three exceptions to that \"gender dysphoria\" rejection. The exemptions mean the military will accept people who say they are transgender but have not undergone medical treatment, will accept existing soldiers who do not ask to be classified as a member of the other sex, and will accept soldiers grandfathered in because of their acceptance under the Obama administration. The memo says:\n\nTherefore, in light of the Panel's professional military judgment and my own professional judgment, the Department should adopt the following policies:\n\n( 1) if they have been stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to accession;\n\n(2) Service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria after entering into service may be retained if they do not require a change of gender and remain deployable within applicable retention standards; and\n\n(3) currently serving Service members who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the previous administration's policy took effect and prior to the effective date of this new policy, may continue to serve in their preferred gender and receive medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria.\n\nMattis' memo also slammed the secretive Pentagon panel created by Obama to push his transgender policy:\n\nThe prior administration largely based its policy on a study prepared by the RAND National Defense Research Institute; however, that study contained significant shortcomings. It refered to limited and heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of healthcare costs, readiness, and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own. In short, this policy issue has proven more complex than the prior administration or RAND assumed.\n\nThe criticism will be cited in the lawsuits to prod judges towards a rejection of the Obama panel's recommendations.\n\nThe presidential memo endorsed Mattis' policy, saying:\n\nThese documents set forth the policies on this issue that the Secretary of Defense, in the exercise of his independent judgment, has concluded should be adopted by the Department of Defense ...\n\nAmong other things, the policies set forth by the Secretary of Defense state that transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances ...\n\nHowever, the president's letter does not directly reject the central political claim by progressive advocates -- that the government should agree that every person's legal sex is determined by their sense of \"gender identity,\" not by their genetics or biology.\n\nThat ideology requires the government to enforce each person's \"gender identity\" on other Americans, including schoolchildren and members of athletic clubs, swimming pools, shelters and other places where the vast majority of people prefer to guard their sexual privacy.\n\nInstead, Trump's directive endorses' Mattis's decision to restore normal distinctions between male and female soldiers.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.\n\nThe transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency.\n\nIn practice, the transgender ideology gags women who object to sharing their bathrooms, showers, and sports club with men who claim to have a female \"gender identity.\"\n\nThe ideology requires parents to stand aside when their children decide to begin a lifetime of risky and self-sterilizing medical treatments to help them pretend they are members of the opposite sex.\n\nMultiple polls also show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology's claim that a person's legal sex is determined by their feeling of \"gender identity,\" not by their biology.\n\nDespite the huge expense, conflict, and damage to young people, the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male. Also, officials in New York and various universities have threatened to penalize people who do not refer to men as if they are women, and several judges have declared that Pentagon officials must accept recruits who want to change their sex.\n\nThe progressive push to bend Americans' attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of \"gender\" has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules which help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different and equal men and women.\n\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents' rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women's expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men's sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children's sexual privacy.\n\nPres. Trump's ban on transgender troops only serves to throw fuel on the fire of hatred and fear, making an already-vulnerable population even more vulnerable.\n\nWe stand with all transgender and gender-nonconforming Americans.\n\n-- Southern Poverty Law Center (@splcenter) March 24, 2018\n\nTrump moves again to ban transgender troops. What a disgusting human being he is!\n\n-- Norman Ornstein (@NormOrnstein) March 24, 2018",

                "body": "A new poll of Nevada's third congressional district Republican primary voters shows that former Senate candidate Danny Tarkanian has taken a commanding lead upon switching to the congressional race, with President Donald Trump's endorsement.\n\nTarkanian, at 37 percent, towers over the other candidates remaining in the primary. Michelle Mortensen gets just ten percent, Scott Hammond gets nine percent, and David McKeon gets one percent. Victoria Seaman, who dropped out of the race upon Tarkanian's entry with Trump's endorsement, got nine percent -- while 34 percent were undecided.\n\nThe survey of 400 respondents was conducted from March 10 to March 11 by Strategic National, with a margin of error of 4.9 percent, and provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release.\n\nTarkanian, a strong supporter of President Trump, was the GOP nominee for this very seat in 2016, but lost to now Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in the general election after 2016 GOP senate nominee in Nevada, then-Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) tanked Republicans statewide by distancing himself from Trump in the leadup to election day. Rosen is running for the U.S. Senate and is expected to face off against Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in the November general election.\n\nTrump's approval rating in the survey of Nevada third district GOP voters is very high. A whopping 72 percent have an \"extremely favorable\" opinion of Trump, and another 16 percent have a \"somewhat favorable\" opinion of the president. Only four percent have a \"somewhat unfavorable\" opinion of Trump, and just six percent have an \"extremely unfavorable\" opinion of him.\n\nTarkanian was running against Heller for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate until Trump asked him to switch to the House race so as to give the party a better chance in the general election in both the Senate and House races.\n\nTarkanian announced Trump's endorsement of his congressional campaign in a statement last week. He said:\n\nI entered the U.S. Senate race after receiving an outpouring of requests from Trump supporters throughout Nevada, many of whom stood by both me and Donald Trump in 2016. These grassroots supporters saw in me a fierce defender of President Trump's America First agenda. Late Wednesday, the President and members of his political team reached out to me and asked me to consider supporting the America First agenda as a Congressional candidate by running again in CD3, where I nearly won in 2016 in what was one of the most expensive and closest Congressional races in America. This was not something I ever considered. In my travels throughout the state, I've had so many wonderful people thank me for running for the US Senate. They believe in our message and the cause. My incredible staff, mostly volunteers, have invested thousands of hours into this cause. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to them all. I do not want to let any of them down. I have always believed that public service is doing what is in the best interest of the people you represent, not yourself politically. I believe with every ounce of my body that the future of our country, and a better life for our children, requires the implementation of the America First agenda. I am confident I would have won the US Senate race and done a great job representing the people of Nevada in the Senate, but the President is adamant that a unified Republican ticket in Nevada is the best direction for the America First movement. With President Trump's full support and endorsement, I am filing to run again in CD3 with the firm belief that we will finish what we started in 2016 and win in 2018.\n\nThat came after a Trump tweet urged Tarkanian to switch to the House race from the Senate race, adding that he would have the president's backing in doing so.\n\nIt would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it's unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 16, 2018\n\nIn a subsequent appearance on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125, Tarkanian laid out the stakes of this race.\n\n\"It's a seat the Democrats currently hold, so we can take a seat back from the Democrats,\" Tarkanian said. \"Right now, you keep hearing all the talk that the Democrats are going to go after maybe 40 plus seats, maybe 50 seats that the Republicans hold right now, and try and switch them. This is one that's very likely to go back to the Republican side.\"\n\nIn a year where Democrats are on the offensive, Tarkanian is exactly right that if the GOP has a chance of holding the House they need every advantage they can possibly get -- especially pickup opportunities like this one. This particular district is one of a handful in the country where a Democrat currently represents it, but Republicans have a decent shot at a pickup. Assuming Tarkanian's lead holds and he solidifies the nomination quickly, with Trump's support in the general election, he will face off against Democrat Susie Lee in the general.\n\nLee is considered an easy target to beat, given her close ties to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, and problems already piling up for her campaign.\n\nSupporters of the president and his agenda are hopeful that the other contenders in the primary clear out of the way for Tarkanian to represent the party, as the president wants, in the general election. If that happens, the district could represent a battle between two national movements: The Women's March, #MeToo-fueled leftist resistance to Trump versus the economic nationalist conservative base of the president. Republicans and Democrats will likely both nationalize this race, and both parties are likely to compete heavily in Nevada's third district.\n\nThe suburban district just outside Las Vegas has traditionally been a swing district, but Republicans have generally held it in its current form.",

                "body": "By freezing the \"hunger nerve,\" doctors may have discovered the secret to the body's natural \"revenge\" on caloric restriction.\n\nLosing weight can be difficult, and keeping it off even more so. Our bodies naturally punish us for drastically altering our diets, making us hungrier and trying to conserve weight it believes will protect us from starvation. Because of that, there is a real biological resistance to the obesity crisis in the modern world -- and perhaps nowhere more so than the United States.\n\nHarvard School of Public Health Department of Nutrition's chair, Dr. Frank Hu, is discouraged by the news. \"It's difficult to be optimistic at this point,\" he said. \"The trend of obesity has been steadily increasing in both children and adults despite many public health efforts to improve nutrition and physical activity.\" He blames the \"huge amount of cheap, accessible, highly processed food available everywhere almost anytime,\" and a marked decrease in activity levels both at home and at work.\n\nBut help may very well come from within, and the solution could be to simply prevent the body's natural self-sabotage. By freezing the posterior vagal trunk nerve -- a branch of the same nerve that controls our hearts, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract -- doctors have been able to effectively shut down the mechanism which causes the compulsion to eat.\n\nIn a small study by Dr. David Prologo and his associates at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, researchers employed a very simple surgical procedure in which a probe was inserted in the patient's back to freeze the posterior vagal trunk for just two minutes. Eight women and two men were tested, this time merely to see whether the procedure had any unforeseen negative side effects or complications.\n\nNo patient experienced any negative effects by either the 45-day or 90-day checkups, and the results of the procedure itself were promising. \"I had struggled with weight since my 6-year-old was born ... and I'm constantly rebounding [with various weight-loss programs],\" said Melissa, one of the ten subjects. After the procedure, she was \"literally never hungry.\" Furthermore, she said, \"I'm not eating because I'm bored. It's gradually coming off, so now I know it's not going to come right back on like all the previous diets that I've tried.\"\n\nWhether or not this procedure has any longer-term detriments remains to be seen, as well as whether it is an effective solution for the nation's deadliest health crisis. With a lot more study and a little more luck, it might be the best chance yet for those who struggle with maintaining a happy, healthy natural weight.",

                "body": "The spending bill, which Trump signed despite opposition from conservatives and his base of supporters, paves way for the Catch and Release program to not only continue, but increase in its use.\n\nCatch and Release is the process where illegal aliens caught by federal immigration officials are released back into the U.S. until their immigration court hearing. Part of the reason for their release into the country is because the federal government refuses to fund the space needed to detain illegal aliens until their hearing.\n\nAfter being released, illegal aliens often do not show up for their court hearing and become quasi-fugitives living in the interior of the country, adding to the already booming 12 to 30 million illegal alien population.\n\nLocal media reports across the U.S. have highlighted how the Catch and Release program has continued:\n\nCurrently, according to the Washington Times' Stephen Dinan, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been using about 40,761 beds in its detention centers on average to house illegal aliens awaiting their hearings.\n\nRyan's spending bill eliminates nearly 250 of those detention center beds, thus increasing the number of illegal aliens who will be released back into the U.S. through the Catch and Release program.\n\nThe spending bill does not include any of the provisions from Trump's list of pro-American immigration principles, where he called for the end of Catch and Release.",

                "body": "Dozens of whales tragically died on the southwestern tip of Australia in the wee hours of Thursday morning.\n\nSometime between late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, more than 150 short-finned pilot whales beached themselves on Hamelin Bay in Western Australia. Piled upon one another, weakly thrashing, they slowly perished before a scatter of saddened onlookers. By 9:30 AM, more than half were dead.\n\nOfficials shut down the beach and issued a \"shark alert\" in order to clear the water. Time was short and with each passing moment, there were fewer left to save. But working with these massive, powerful mammals in unpredictable weather conditions was a risk -- not only for the whales but for the people desperately working to save their lives.\n\n\"The strength of the animals and the windy and possibly wet weather conditions will affect when and where we attempt to move them out to sea,\" said Parks and Wildlife Service Incident Controller Jeremy Chick in an update posted to their site. \"The main objectives are to ensure the safety of staff and volunteers as well as the whales' greatest chance of survival.\"\n\nBy noon, only 15 whales still lived. Four grueling hours later, just seven. Rocky beach and rough seas sabotaged every effort at an already difficult operation. \"The conditions are challenging but we are doing all we can to give these animals the best chance of survival without risking the safety of staff and volunteers,\" Chick said.\n\nThe rescue efforts sustained another loss before the last six whales were returned to the ocean. Still, questions remain. No one knows exactly why such \"mass strandings\" take place. Was the dominant whale disoriented, or distracted by the prospect of food? Does the sonar we use for subaquatic mapping and navigation confuse creatures so attuned to its frequencies? We may never know what led to the deaths of these creatures.\n\nFortunately, for them and for us, there are compassionate heroes willing to step in on their behalf.",

Jeri Rhodes is listed as the executing officer for the filing.\n\nRhodes is the Associate Executive Secretary for Finance and Administration for the Friends Committee on National Legislation, which is a Quaker lobbying group with the goal to \"advance peace and justice.\"\n\nMajor players and organizations -- including Everytown, Giffords, Move On, and Women's March LA -- told BuzzFeed News they are helping with logistics, strategy, and planning for next month's March for Our Lives rally and beyond. Much of the specific resources the groups are providing to the Parkland students remains unclear -- as is the full list of supporting organizations -- but there are broad outlines.\n\nGiffords, an organization started by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) that fights gun violence, is working with Everytown and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America to plan the main march on Washington -- as well as sister rallies across the country.\n\nA spokesperson for Giffords told BuzzFeed News that it is \"lending support in any way the students need, especially helping to operationalize these marches from logistics to programming.\"\n\n\"We applaud these students for demonstrating incredible leadership and demanding that our lawmakers do more to help protect Americans from gun violence,\" the Giffords spokesperson said in the BuzzFeed News report.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and the George Soros-funded Move On are also in the mix of left-wing groups behind the march.\n\nBuzzFeed News reported, \"MoveOn said it will encourage its millions of members to follow and promote the March for Our Lives movement on social media and attend the rally\" and would help with security and other logistics.\n\nA spokesperson for Planned Parenthood said it is \"teaching and hosting trainings\" for teens \"to keep momentum going so they don't get burned out,\" BuzzFeed News reported.\n\nThe NPS permit reveals \"persons in charge\" of the D.C. event, including Deena Katz, the co-executive producer of Dancing with the Stars who helped organized the Los Angeles Women's March.\n\nOther \"persons in charge\" are Matt Hall, Ann Marie Hoffman, Paul Sorenson, and James Day.\n\nMarch for Our Lives also started a GoFundMe page that has raised $3.3 million. The text on the page states:\n\nThe funds will be spent on the incredibly difficult and expensive process that is organizing a march like this. We have people making more specific plans, but for now, know that this is for the march and everything left over will be going to the victims' funds.\n\nNBA Miami Heat player Dewayne Wade donated $200,000 to the march and urged others to do the same on Twitter earlier this month.\n\nThey need our help! I'm asking my NBA fam to join us in raising money to send kids from underserved communities to March....@gabunion and I will start w/$200K for Chicago. every dollar counts! Who else is in?? Or donate here: https://t.co/pu10Gp76on #GetTheBallRollin\n\n-- DWade (@DwyaneWade) March 10, 2018\n\nThere is no list of supporters or donors on the March for Our Lives official website, and a map of the locations for all the marches allegedly taking place on Saturday includes this cryptic message: \"Note that information on accessing grants to support sibling marches will be emailed directly to registered host organizers.\"\n\nThe NPS permit reveals more about the event, including the \"event overview,\" which states:\n\nApproximately (500,000) student participants and adults from across the country, will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar. In the tragic wake of the seventeen lives brutally cut shot in Florida, politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns. March for Our Lives believes the time is now.\n\nThe permit also says that the organizers have to spend millions on insurance for the event.\n\nProcure public and employee liability insurance from responsible companies with a minimum limitation of $2,000,000 per person for any one claim and an aggregate limit of $5,000,000 for any number of claims arising from any one incident. The United States of America shall be named as an additional insured on all such policies. The permit number will be included on said policy.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that are taking part in the march, and some are performing. The March for our Lives website notes that Jennifer Hudson, Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato, Common, Vic Mensa, Andra Day, and Miley Cyrus are scheduled for the event.\n\nSo proud to stand with these brave students and the movement they're leading ὤc #IWillMarch #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/w0yLAORaVJ https://t.co/g1EgmKc6He\n\n-- Jennifer Hudson (@IAMJHUD) March 15, 2018\n\nNonetheless, the Florida students who are credited with organizing the march insist it is teens, not adults, who are in charge, while admitting adults are involved.\n\nCameron Kasky, 17, acknowledged that the anti-Trump group Indivisible is helping and said that their assistance is necessary because of the role race allegedly plays in school shootings. Kasky said in an interview on Friday with National Public Radio:\n\nYou know our story was told because we are an affluent white community and we have to shine the spotlight that was given on us on everybody in the world that has to deal with this on a daily basis. So people like Indivisible, who represent students who are in lower-income communities and don't get to speak out the way we do because people don't listen -- we have to connect with these students.\n\nThe March for Our Lives Twitter account also features a video with students stating the anti-gun talking points used by left-wing groups regularly, including blaming the National Rifle Association for school shootings.\n\nWe see these lawmakers representing the NRA, and not their constituents. We see our \"leaders\" making excuses and refusing to act. On Saturday, they'll see US. pic.twitter.com/7OGttnRSsz\n\n-- March For Our Lives (@AMarch4OurLives) March 21, 2018\n\nThe March for Our Lives website states that 840 marches are planned in the U.S. and around the world.",

We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\n\n-- Donald J.

                "title": "Caroline Glick: John Bolton's Appointment is an 'America First' Move | Breitbart",
                "body": "The news hit America's enemies and competitors -- from Pyongyang to Teheran to Moscow to Beijing -- like a wall of bricks Thursday night.\n\nEarly criticisms on the political right of Bolton's appointment have centered on two points. First, it is argued that Bolton, who has been involved in U.S. foreign policymaking since the Reagan administration, is a creature of the Washington foreign policy swamp.\n\nWhile it is true that Bolton is from Washington - or Baltimore, to be precise - and although it is true that he held senior foreign policy positions in both Bush administrations, he has always been a thorn in the side of the establishment rather than a member of that establishment.\n\nFor the better part of three decades, Bolton has bravely held positions that fly in the face of the establishment's innate preference for appeasement. He was a vocal critic, for example, of then-President Bill Clinton's disastrous nuclear diplomacy with North Korea.\n\nThe 1994 \"Agreed Framework\" that Clinton concluded with Pyongyang was touted as a peaceful resolution of the nuclear crisis with North Korea. In exchange for shuttering - but not destroying -- its nuclear installations, North Korea received light water reactors from the U.S. and massive economic relief. As Bolton warned it would, North Korea pocketed the concessions and gifts and continued to develop its nuclear weapons. In other words, far from preventing North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, the Agreed Framework preserved the North Korean nuclear program and enabled the regime to develop it effectively with U.S. assistance.\n\nFor his warnings, Bolton has been reviled as a \"warmonger\" and a \"superhawk\" by the foreign policy elite, which has gone out if its way to undercut him.\n\nPresident George W. Bush appointed Bolton to serve as UN ambassador in 2005 in a recess appointment. Three moderate Republicans on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Lincoln Chafee (RI), Chuck Hagel (ND), and George Voinovich (OH), signaled that they would oppose Bolton's confirmation, blocking it.\n\nAt the time, rumors surfaced that then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had quietly undercut Bolton's confirmation in private conversations with senators. Tthose rumors were denied, and Rice publicly supported Bolton's confirmation. But in 2016, Rice, along with her mentor, former secretary of state James Baker, and her deputy and successor as National Security Advisor, Stephen Hadley, openly opposed President Trump's intention to appoint Bolton Deputy Secretary of Sstate. At the same time, all three lobbied Trump to appoint outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\n\nBolton was a vocal opponent of Rice's nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, undertaken after Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. He also opposed Rice's pursuit of diplomatic ties with Iran through negotiations in Iraq. In both cases, as events showed, Bolton's criticisms were all in place.\n\nRice's nuclear diplomacy with North Korea emboldened the regime, and enabled its continued testing of nuclear weapons and development of ballistic missiles.\n\nIn Iran's case, Rice's negotiations with the Iranians in 2007 and 2008 set the stage for president Barack Obama's nuclear talks with Tehran, which led to the 2015 nuclear deal. That deal, like the 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea, preserves, rather than dismantles, Iran's nuclear program while providing Iran with the financial means to expand its regional power through its terrorist proxies.\n\nOn the other hand, Bolton's actions while in office brought extraordinary benefit to US national security. For instance, as Bush's undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, in 2003 Bolton conceptualized and launched the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The purpose of the PSI was to empower nations to interdict ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction, delivery systems, and related materials from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern. Originally launched with 11 state members, today the PSI has 105 state members. Its members have interdicted multiple ships suspected of transferring illicit weapons systems to other states and to non-state actors.\n\nLike Trump, Bolton is an opponent of international treaties that bind the U.S. in a manner that may be antithetical to its national interests, and prefers bilateral agreements that are tailor-made to defend America's national interests. Bolton was a firm opponent of the Rome Treaty, which established the International Criminal Court. He worked avidly to vacate America's signature from the treaty. Due largely to his cogent opposition, the Bush administration decided not to submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification. Bolton concluded 100 bilateral treaties with nations committing them never to present complaints against U.S. military personnel before the tribunal.\n\nBolton's nationalist convictions, and his refusal to join the foreign policy elite in its adoration of diplomacy, whatever the substance, over a firm, fact-based pursuit of America's national interests lies at the heart of the foreign policy establishment's opposition to him.\n\nIndeed, the level of hostility the foreign policy establishment has directed towards Bolton over the years has been so ferocious, it is a testament to his diplomatic skills, and success, that he has managed to persevere in Washington, in and out of office for forty years.\n\nAs to the second charge by conservative critics, that Bolton is a neoconservative interventionist, the fact is that he is neither a neoconservative nor is he a knee jerk interventionist. Rather, Bolton supports the judicious use of American power in the world to advance U.S. national security and economic interests when the use of force is the best way to achieve those interests.\n\nIt is true that Bolton supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. But it is also true that he opposed the nation-building strategy that stood at the root of America's failure to achieve its aims there.\n\nIt is also true that like many of the neoconservatives, Bolton is a firm supporter of Israel. However, Bolton is actually far more supportive of Israel than the neoconservatives are. As a nationalist, he supports U.S. allies because he understands that the stronger America's allies are, the better able they are to defend their interests. Since American allies - particularly Israel - share America's interests, the more powerful they are, the more secure America's interests are, and the less the U.S. needs to assert its power abroad. Bolton supported -- indeed, urged -- Israel to destroy Iran's nuclear installations during the Obama presidency. Rather than treating Israel as what Rice referred to patronizingly as America's \"special friend,\" Bolton views Israel as America's most powerful ally in the Middle East. He opposes Palestinian statehood and an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.\n\nThe neoconservative movement asserts that America's values of liberal democracy are universal, and that as a consequence, when given the opportunity to choose their leaders in open elections, everyone everywhere will choose leaders that are liberal democrats.\n\nThis view, for instance, stood at the root of Rice's demand that the Hamas terrorist group participate in the Palestinian elections in 2006. It was also the root of her decision to pressure then-Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to permit the Muslim Brotherhood to participate in parliamentary elections in Egypt in 2005.\n\nSince the neoconservatives asserted that all people believe in American values, they assessed that at the end of the day, even Hamas would govern responsibly. Bush famously raised what became known as the \"pothole theory\" of the moderating power of elected office.\n\nBush said, \"I like the idea of people running for office. There's a positive effect when you run for office. Maybe some will run for office and say, vote for me, I look forward to blowing up America. I don't know, I don't know if that will be their platform or not. But I don't think so. I think people who generally run for office say, vote for me, I'm looking forward to fixing your potholes, or making sure you got bread on the table.\"\n\nRice heartily concurred.\n\nBolton, in contrast, rejected the notion that American values are universally applicable, and argued that nation building and humanitarian intervention are both antithetical to American national security interests. In other words, while he agreed with certain policies that neoconservatives also supported, he opposed the basic assumptions of the neoconservative outlook.\n\nBolton's opposition to nation-building and humanitarian interventionism was all borne out by events. As the so-called Arab Spring showed -- and indeed, as Turkey's democratic transformation into an Islamic theocracy also demonstrates -- American values are not universal values at all. Supporting democratic processes with no concern about the values and culture those processes empower is unwise and irresponsible, and as the rise of Islamist regimes in Gaza, Egypt, Turkey, and beyond make clear, it is also antithetical to American national security interests.\n\nBolton's healthy skepticism for international agreements; his support for a foreign policy that prioritizes the advancement of American national interests over multilateral diplomacy; and his belief that Obama's signature diplomatic achievement, the nuclear deal with Iran, is a disaster, all make him the senior diplomat most aligned with President Trump's America First agenda in Washington.\n\nThe combination of Trump and Bolton no doubt puts fear in the hearts of America's enemies, and heartens America's allies. Given the hatred Bolton inspires in the Washington swamp, it took great courage for Trump to appoint him. America and its allies will be the primary beneficiaries of this bold move.",

                "body": "President Donald Trump signed the Taylor Force Act on Friday, which was attached to the omnibus spending bill and passed into law along with the rest of the legislation.\n\nTrump has been excoriated by conservatives for signing the omnibus, a bloated package that gave Democrats almost everything they wanted except amnesty for illegal aliens. But the passage of the Taylor Force Act is a silver lining -- and a milestone in foreign policy that could save taxpayers money.\n\nThe Taylor Force Act will end U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority (PA) as long as it pays stipends to Palestinian terrorists -- either those in Israeli prisons, or the families of those who are deceased.\n\nNamed for a U.S. Army veteran who was stabbed to death by a Palestinian terrorist while he was visiting Israel in 2016, the law was championed by Republicans. Democrats, worried about protecting the PA's $300 million in annual U.S. aid, were slow to warm to the legislation. It passed the House, but struggled in the Senate.\n\nTheoretically, the bill could have -- and, arguably, should have -- passed on its own. But the bill's sponsors decided to overcome Democratic opposition by adding it to the omnibus bill, which Senate Democrats were keen to pass.\n\nThough the Trump administration had repeatedly asked the PA to stop the payments to terrorists, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas made it clear he had no intention of doing so. Unless he changes his stance, the Taylor Force Act will force drastic cuts to the PA for all but humanitarian aid.\n\nThe potential implications of the Taylor Force Act are profound. For the first time, the PA will pay a direct price for supporting terror indirectly. Other countries may follow suit. And the U.S. will speak with greater moral clarity about the principle that terrorism is inexcusable.\n\nWith the PA under pressure to back away from supporting a culture of terror and incitement, it is possible that peace negotiations will be possible -- or that the PA will lurch toward financial collapse, perhaps to be followed by Israel annexing Judea and Samara (the West Bank). The choice is in Palestinians' hands.",

                "title": "Former South Korean President Lee Myung-bak Arrested on Corruption Charges | Breitbart",
                "body": "The allegations include bribery, embezzlement, abuse of power, breach of the public trust, illegally withholding presidential documents, tax evasion, and election law violations. The charges carry a combined sentence of up to 45 years in prison.\n\n\"Prosecutors escorted him from his grace-and-favor residence in Gangnam late Thursday night and transported him to a remand jail on the outskirts of Seoul,\" Chosun Ilbo reported.\n\nLee has clearly been in serious jeopardy from the corruption investigation for some time, but his arrest occurred with surprising speed because prosecutors feared the \"destruction of evidence.\" Given that the charges against him include illegally retaining official documents, the authorities evidently felt it was important to take him into custody and secure whatever materials were still in his possession.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Lee accepted over $10 million in bribes from various sources, including a payoff from Samsung laundered through an American law firm, paid to assist an auto-parts company called DAS that is ostensibly owned by Lee's older brother. Another charge against Lee accuses him of abusing government power to benefit DAS. A warehouse owned by the company is also said to be the repository for classified government documents that Lee should not possess.\n\nGlobal electronics giant Samsung figures in a number of South Korean corruption cases, notably including the case against Park Geun-hye, Lee Myung-bak's successor as president. The head of the Samsung Group, billionaire Jay Y. Lee, was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison on bribery charges in April 2017. Lee appealed the sentence, but it seems possible he could end up behind bars for even longer if prosecutors have their way.\n\nIn addition to being part of the seismic financial, cultural, and political calamity of the Samsung corruption case, Lee Myung-bak's arrest is a demoralizing blow to conservatives in South Korea because he is portrayed as putting his own selfish interests above national security. In the most egregious example, Lee appears to have signed a secret deal with the United Arab Emirates that would actually oblige South Korean troops to fight on the UAE's behalf. The quid pro quo was an $18.6 contract to construct a nuclear power plant in the UAE in 2009.\n\nAnother serious national-security allegation is that Lee diverted military cyber resources intended to protect against North Korean hackers and used them to manipulate public opinion in favor of Park Geun-hye during her ultimately successful bid to succeed him as president.\n\nLee has denied many of the charges against him, but not all. \"Rather than blaming others, I feel that I am at fault for everything and I also feel a sense of guilt. I hope that my arrest will ease the pain suffered by those who worked with me as well as their families,\" he wrote on Facebook after his arrest warrant was issued.\n\nLee's office was considerably less humble and penitent; it released a statement rejecting all charges from the state prosecutors, vowed to \"fight with full-fledged effort to get the truth out at court,\" and said the former president's arrest was part of \"a state-led political scheme to kill Lee Myung-bak\" that has been playing out \"since the day the Moon Jae-in government assumed office.\"\n\nLee himself has in the past speculated that current president Moon Jae-in is persecuting him in revenge for the death of an even earlier South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, who committed suicide in 2009 during a corruption investigation. Moon was President Roh's chief of staff.",

Prosecutors allege he pushed through security personnel, including a 66-year-old disabled woman who had told him to use a different entrance to access the field.\n\nThe charge of injury to the elderly can be filed if a person intentionally or knowingly causes injury to a person 65 or older. It carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n\nHarris County authorities say they're talking with Bennett's legal team about surrendering on the charge.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles earlier this month acquired Bennett from the Seattle Seahawks, where he became one of the dominant defensive linemen in the game.\n\n\"We are aware of the situation involving Michael Bennett and are in the process of gathering more information,\" the Eagles said. \"Because this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nBennett's agent, Doug Hendrickson, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday.\n\nBennett had 8 ½ sacks last season and has 54 in his nine-year career. The 32-year-old Bennett has three years remaining on his contract, with a base salary of just $1.65 million in 2018. That number jumps to $6 million in 2019 and $7.5 million in 2020.",

It will encompass, if it goes through, both the 232s and broader trade issues. And we hope by sometime next week to be able to have a real announcement.\"\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea began renegotiating a trade deal in January, according to the New York Times. The U.S. was focused on trade of its automobiles and may also be focused on financial services, according to the report.\n\nReuters reported at the time that South Korea's Trade Minister, Kim Hyun-chong, anticipated an \"uphill battle\" in trade talks. During the initial January trade talks, South Korea focused on U.S. import restrictions on South Korean washing machines, steel products, and solar panels.\n\nPresident Trump has called the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) a \"terrible deal\" and less than a year ago, warned it may be canceled, according to the Washington Post.",

                "title": "Michael Pillsbury: Trump Seeks to Thwart China's Hundred-Year Plan for Economic and Military Dominance",
                "body": "Pillsbury noted that Trump praised Chinese President Xi and thanked China for its assistance with the North Korean nuclear missile crisis even as tariffs were announced, framing the situation as a \"major negotiation\" between friendly states with competing interests rather than an all-out \"trade war.\"\n\n\"He's offering them some solutions that he hopes they'll move toward,\" Pillsbury said. \"One of them is, they simply purchase $100 billion worth of U.S. exports. Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, went on television tonight and even hinted what that might be. It might be natural gas and oil - various kinds of products we sell them already, but they could buy a great deal more.\"\n\nPillsbury found it necessary for Trump to take aggressive action to move negotiations forward because China simply has not taken American concerns seriously until now. Adding to the pressure on China is the release of a study that details \"what China really has been trying to do to the United States.\"\n\n\"It was thrilling to me because it picks up many of the themes I had in my book three years ago, The Hundred-Year Marathon. But it adds what's been happening in the last three years,\" Pillsbury said. \"I had not realized myself that it's actually gotten worse. The Chinese treatment of the United States has gotten more unfair, if I can put it that way, than was the case three years ago when I wrote my book trying to sound the alarm.\"\n\nPillsbury described the response to the tariff memorandum and release of the supporting report as a \"massive media attack on President Trump, and the stock market dropping on the theory that the Chinese are going to react very harshly.\"\n\n\"They're going to put enormous tariffs on American imports to China, they're going to stop buying soybeans and sorghum and live hogs -- three of our biggest products in the farm states -- and so the farmers are going to be angry at President Trump, and this is all going to be terrible for world trade, because everybody sort of knows that as tariffs go up it's a tax on all the countries involved so the world growth rate will drop. This is what the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said a couple of days ago,\" he recalled.\n\n\"My own view is quite different from the critics of President Trump,\" Pillsbury countered. \"I think he's on the right track and this is really a historic decision that takes the past presidents, like George W. Bush and Obama - they whined and they complained and they made speeches about Chinese unfair trade practices, but they really wouldn't do anything about it.\"\n\nPillsbury found China's reaction to Trump's announcement \"remarkable,\" as the Chinese ambassador in Washington, DC belligerently declared his country would \"fight back\" with furious intensity - a very different line than the top leadership in Beijing has taken.\n\n\"They knew this was coming,\" he concluded. \"The prime minister gave a press conference saying that China wants to open up further, wants to welcome more foreign investment, is totally for free trade, would never steal anybody's intellectual property. He went through in this press conference almost point-for-point what President Trump was going to say today, and said China would not dream of doing these things.\"\n\nPillsbury cautioned that many Americans retain an \"out of date\" image of China as poor, technologically backwards, and reluctant to provoke economic warfare with wealthier nations while so many of its people struggle with poverty.\n\n\"I wrote my book against that idea,\" he said. \"One of President Trump's key advisers, who was obviously present today at the meeting with the president and has gone on television since, is a gentleman - a professor, actually, University of California Irvine in the past - named Peter Navarro. Very courageous fellow, he wrote three books blowing the whistle on Chinese unfair trade practices.\"\n\n\"One of his books is called Crouching Tiger: What China's Militarism Means for the World. What this caused is the opening of a debate among China experts in America: are the Chinese really as friendly and poor? Often people say they will collapse soon. They sort of present a picture of China as about to collapse. While all this debate has been going on, the Chinese have doubled their economy again. They're quite close to passing us. This is really a shock to most people. How can a poor, backward country surpass the size of the American economy? It's just astonishing,\" he said.\n\nPillsbury pointed to the new United States lawsuit against China in the World Trade Organization over the behavior outlined in yesterday's report as another serious measure against Chinese trade practices, and further evidence that President Trump appreciates the scope of the problem.\n\n\"We've sued China before. China is the country we've sued the most in the World Trade Organization, but never this scale of criticism,\" he noted.\n\nPillsbury added that Thursday's actions actually represent the third and by far the largest round of tariffs against China under President Trump, and yet the president made it clear that even more measures could be forthcoming.\n\nThe products targeted by the new tariffs and the rationale for including them will send a strong message to China. \"It's going to be examples, as this report explained today, the examples are based on a kind of reciprocity that if China has stolen intellectual property, stolen trade secrets and then made money off of it, that is the kind of product that will have the tariff placed on it. It's kind of like a stiletto, if you will, not a sledgehammer,\" he explained.\n\nPillsbury predicted that the Chinese will now understand Trump means business, and will make concessions to hold off further sanctions.\n\n\"I happen to think they need us more than we need them,\" he said. \"I don't measure just trade. I measure all the things we've essentially -- I hate to use this phrase -- given away to China over the last 30 or more years. They still need our investment, our technology, our goodwill, our buying their products, the scientific programs we share with them - there's an extremely long list of the benefits China gets from the United States, counting everything.\"\n\n\"We get very little benefit from them along those lines,\" he continued. \"We don't get a wide, comprehensive set of benefits from China. We get some benefits. That's where this debate is really happening.\"\n\n\"My own forecast is there's not going to be a big trade war. The Chinese are quite afraid of being demonized in the United States and around Asia. Despite the ambassador here in Washington making this unfortunate remark, I think what's actually going to happen is we're going to have some successful negotiations for the first time,\" he said.\n\n\"The kind of stonewalling they were doing last year is going to end. They're not going to roll over and just suddenly buy $100 billion worth of products in the month of April, but I think we will see a number of steps by the Chinese that will justify what President Trump did today in this historic decision,\" he anticipated.\n\nPillsbury lamented that many people don't appreciate the severity of the challenge to American interests posed by China.\n\n\"But they will when China begins to fight back, at least rhetorically,\" he told Mansour. \"They don't understand what you and I are talking about tonight, that China is wrapped up with the loss of jobs, the competition for resources in Africa and Latin America - just a whole range of competitive things we're engaged in with the Chinese.\"\n\nEven as the Trump administration pursues what Vice President Mike Pence described yesterday as \"the end of the era of economic surrender,\" Pillsbury advised keeping areas of productive cooperation with China in mind, most notably North Korea.\n\n\"That's a brilliant way to start out,\" he said of President Trump's remarks on Thursday. \"He didn't say, 'You're bastards, I hate you, I'm going to bring China to its knees with my memorandum today.' He didn't say anything like that.\"\n\nFurthermore, he noted that even the American freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea, which the Chinese frequently complain about, do not represent an aggressive challenge because the American ships follow \"innocent passage\" protocols, keeping their weapons radars off and avoiding military maneuvers as they cruise through the area.\n\n\"We have not challenged China in the South China Sea yet. That's the important thing to understand. Some people think we should. It's very difficult to come up with specific measures, especially if you are looking at economics and trade issues as being more important. We can't fight China on all fronts,\" he said.\n\nPillsbury quoted U.S. trade representative Ambassador Robert Lighthizer's statement on Thursday that in addition to imposing tariffs and blocking intellectual property theft, one of the Trump administration's top goals is to place \"restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States.\"\n\n\"They blocked large sectors of their own country, and they say, 'We will not permit foreign investment in this sector,'\" Pillsbury said of the Chinese. \"We've negotiated with them for more than ten years to try to reduce that list - it's called the 'negative list,' for lack of a better phrase - and the Chinese just won't budge.\"\n\nPillsbury found it telling and encouraging that two days ago, with the Trump tariffs looming, Beijing for the first time signaled a willingness to open new sectors to foreign investment.\n\n\"The Chinese anticipated this, and they're trying to deal with it calmly. They don't want to squander the goodwill that they have, and the widespread belief in America that exists that China is our friend, and is a poor backward country that's going to collapse,\" he said.\n\n\"They want to continue what I described in Hundred-Year Marathon as a kind of stealthy acquisition of the role of the Number One economy in the world. They will blow all that if they follow the kind of rhetoric that the Chinese ambassador in Washington used. He actually did this on Fox News! Fox News called him up, apparently, and he made this comment,\" he marveled.\n\n\"I think he's going to be in trouble. I think the prime minister and President Xi have indicated more clearly what the future is: that they want to deal calmly, not emotionally, and they will be considering how their own reforms, if they open up their country more, that will meet one of President Trump's requirements right there,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to harden our own economy against Chinese theft, Chinese investment,\" Pillsbury recommended. \"Sometimes it can come in a small company. They will buy a technology in a joint venture or through a small company, let's say in Silicon Valley, that no one's ever heard of. Back in the days when robotics and artificial intelligence wasn't a household word, they were acquiring these high technology companies, sometimes very small.\"\n\n\"Frankly that scared friends of mine in the Pentagon, that American military superiority in the world depends largely on technology. Sure, we like to say that we have smarter troops, but technology is a big part of making weapons succeed. If we lose our technological edge, my Pentagon friends told me, we can't get it back,\" he noted.\n\n\"So China will be not only the dominant economy in the world, which they're well on their way to doing, but they'll be the dominant military power in the world. Now, this isn't in the next few months or the next few years, but this is the trend. What President Trump is doing is trying to halt that too with these restrictions on Chinese investment in our high-tech sectors,\" said Pillsbury.",

Friday's plan to impose $3b tariffs is to retaliate tariffs on steel and aluminum products. China's retaliation lists against the 301 investigation will target US products worth $ tens of billions. It is in the making.\n\n-- Hu Xijin 胡锡进 (@HuXijin_GT) March 23, 2018\n\nHu Xijin has been the editor-in-chief of the Global Times since 2005. He was appointed to the post by the Communist Party and his public statements nearly always reflect the thinking of the party's leaders.\n\nOn Friday, China said it would put $3 billion of tariffs on American goods. Those tariffs will tax fruit, pork, recycled aluminum, and steel pipes, according to the Chinese Commerce Ministry.\n\n\"If somebody imposes a trade war on China, we'll fight to the end,\" China's ambassador to the U.S. said on state television.\n\nThe Trump administration insists it is not trying to spark a trade war with China. Instead, the administration says that its tariffs are aimed at convincing China to abandon trade practices U.S. officials describe as \"economic aggression.\"",

                "body": "\"We had no choice but to fund our military, because we have to have the strongest military in the world,\" the president told reporters.\n\nThen the president explicitly called for an end to the Senate's filibuster rule, which would allow simple 51-vote majorities to pass legislation, and for a \"line-item veto\" to allow him to omit undesirable provisions from large bills like this one.\n\nThe former proposal would require action on the part of the Senate GOP under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), but the line item veto would be a tougher climb. In 1996, Congress created a limited line-item veto which was used by then-President Bill Clinton dozens of times, often limiting federal spending.\n\nThe line-item veto was quickly found to be a violation of the Constitution's Presentment Clause by a 6-3 majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. That decision, in Clinton v. City of New York, strongly suggests a new line-item veto would require a constitutional amendment.\n\nThe line-item was a rallying point of the GOP platform for much of the 1990s, featuring in Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey's fabled 1994 \"Contract with America\" that helped deliver one of the largest mid-term election victories in American history. The idea was that, armed with the ability to remove particularly troublesome spending provisions from large bundled \"must-pass\" bills, the president could help rein in spending.\n\nAs for this spending bill, the second largest in U.S. history, Trump quickly made clear he was signing under protest, slamming Democrats for refusing to consider proper border wall funding and a legislative compromise for the 800,000 illegal aliens covered by President Barack Obama's now-rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. He also criticized the Congress as a whole for proposing and passing such large, imperfect spending legislation with insufficient time to read the bill. \"Nobody read it,\" the President said.\n\nFailing to sign the bill could have set up a government shutdown as early as midnight Friday. Trump focused on some of what he saw as the bill's positives, including some limited new funding for border security. Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen called the bill's language a \"down payment\" on President Trump's signature southern border wall.\n\n\"I will never sign another bill like this again,\" Trump claimed, but, while an end to the Senate's traditional filibuster rule is possible with a bare Republican majority, the political campaign necessary to usher through a constitutional amendment for a line-item veto is likely out of reach in the current political climate.",

It also allows construction of 14 miles of reserve fencing behind existing walls in California.\n\nThe bill prohibits the prototype walls which Trump showcased this month:\n\nThe amounts designated in subsection (a)(2) through (a)(4) shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, (Public Law 115-31), such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.\n\nThe bill bars new fencing in the Santa Ana wildlife reserve, just beside the heavily trafficked border area in McAllen, Texas.\n\nEach year, 4 million Americans turn 18 and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.\n\nBut the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing temporary work-permits to roughly 3 million foreigner visitors, by not blocking the arrival of roughly 250,000 border crossing illegals, and by mostly ignoring the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.",

This is not just valid for Syria, but also for Iraq,\" said Çavuşoğlu.\n\nTurkey considers the U.S.-allied People's Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) to be terrorists affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK).\n\nCritics like United Nations envoy Nadia Murad, a Yazidi who survived atrocities at the hands of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), have described Turkey's actions as war crimes that amount to \"ethnic cleansing and genocide.\"\n\nTurkey and Syria share a border, particularly along areas with a robust Kurdish population.\n\nThe United States refused to help its YPG allies from the Turkish onslaught in Afrin, arguing that it does not maintain a presence there.\n\n\"The United States does not operate in the area of northwest Syria, where Afrin is located. We remain committed to our NATO ally Turkey, to include their legitimate security concerns,\" Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of State (DOS), declared on Monday, echoing the American military.\n\nThat argument no longer applies to Manbij, where the U.S. has troops stationed, prompting fears for a possible confrontation with American troops.\n\nDespite Turkey's concerns that the YPG is a terrorist group by affiliation, namely to the PKK, the United States continues to lend support to the Kurds, except in Afrin.\n\nThe primary focus of the Turkish offensive is to clear the Turkey-Syria border of Kurds it has labeled terrorists.\n\nİbrahim Kalın, a spokesman for the Turkish president, claimed in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday that the United State had agreed to allow Turkey to invade Manbij, an allegation that the Trump administration has dismissed as nonsense.\n\n\"Well, that's funny because no agreement has been reached,\" said Nauert in response to Kalin's assertions.\n\nThe State's Department's denial has fallen on deaf ears, as the Turkish foreign minister remains adamant that Ankara's Manbij offensive has Washington's blessings.\n\nTurkey's Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said:\n\nThe YPG [Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units] will withdraw from here [Manbij] and their withdrawal will be monitored. Then, the question of who will maintain the security of this region will be addressed. As soon as the YPG leaves, Turkey and the U.S. will take joint action there. We will also take measures regarding security together.\n\n...\n\nOnce the roadmap on Manbij is successfully implemented, [we] will then move on to cities located east of the Euphrates where the same model will be implemented,\" said Çavuşoğlu, citing the outcomes of a meeting for a working group.\n\nHurriyet Daily News pointed out, \"Ankara is seeking an agreement with Washington over who will secure Manbij after the YPG withdraws from the area.Turkey wants the U.S. to put an end to its support to the YPG and collect the arms it has distributed to the organization.\"\n\nAnkara and Washington \"should not let relations between them cool\" over the discussion of an offensive into Manbij,\" Çavuşoğlu indicated.\n\nSoon after launching its offensive to push the Kurds out of Afrin, Turkey urged its fellow NATO ally, the United States, to pull out of Manbij, but the U.S. refused.\n\n\"Turkey will rid Syria's Manbij of terrorists following Afrin,\" Turkish President Erdogan predicted in January.\n\nAt the time, the Turkish foreign minister claimed Turkey demanded the United States pull out of Manbij entirely before Ankara invades it.\n\nThis week, Turkish military troops backed by Syrian rebels conquered Afrin from the YPG abandoned by the U.S.-led coalition after they helped deal a defeating blow to ISIS.\n\nThe Turkish military and its allies have massacred thousands, including Christians and Yazidis, but U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, although urging Ankara to stop, preserved its alliance with Turkey.",

I'm not saying he doesn't want to be an NFL quarterback, I'm saying that doesn't appear to be his priority more than being martyred for the position that he's taken. He's enjoying this,\" Smith later stated.",

                "body": "Cuban state propaganda newspaper Granma called for a regional \"Latin America First\" policy to combat the alleged \"Monroe doctrine\" revival occurring under President Donald Trump this week, promoting a \"Thinking Americas Forum\" to replace the pro-democracy Summit of the Americas that Trump is expected to attend.\n\nThe Summit of the Americas is held by the Organization of American States (OAS) and will occur next month in Lima, Peru. Cuba was banned from the OAS between the time of the Cuban Revolution until 2009, when a coalition of socialist states led by Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez voted to tentatively allow Cuba back. The OAS requires all members to be participating democracies.\n\nThis year, the OAS did not invite Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, to the summit. Although Maduro has vowed he will personally disrupt the summit anyway and has lied about receiving an invitation, the Cuban government made legitimizing the Venezuelan tyranny a priority at the \"Thinking Americas Forum.\"\n\nGranma promoted the forum on its website throughout the week. In a piece titled \"It's Time for Latin America First,\" the newspaper described it as a \"parallel\" forum that will \"have the challenge of showing the diversity and richness of Cuban civil society in times of transcendental change to guarantee a prosperous and sustainable socialism.\" Despite being run by the Cuban Communist Party, the regime often chooses to use the word \"socialist\" for its autocratic rule as communism's record of 100 million dead has largely tainted the communist brand.\n\n\"As the liberators said 200 years ago, it is time to say, 'Latin America and the Caribbean first,'\" the column concludes, deriding President Trump's \"America First\" policy, and the president himself, as \"xenophobic\" and \"reviving the Monroe doctrine.\" The Monroe doctrine was an anti-imperialist policy that warned Europe not to meddle in the Western Hemisphere, as this constituted a threat to American interests. The Castro regime regularly claims to be an \"anti-imperialist\" regime, despite colonizing Venezuela, and refers to the United States as el imperio, \"the empire.\"\n\nClaiming that Trump's threat of \"fire and fury\" against North Korea would apply also to Latin America, the Granma piece goes on to warn that Trump will arrive at the Summit of the Americas \"with his xenophobic rhetoric fresh in the memory of his Latin American and Caribbean analogs.\" Rather than use the summit as planned -- to address the dire humanitarian crisis in Venezuela -- Granma's writers would prefer the occasion become a referendum on Trump.\n\nThis appears to be what occurred at Cuba's \"Thinking Americas Forum,\" attended by government-approved Cuban organizations. On Wednesday, the forum published a list of demands for the Summit of the Americas, including: the exclusion of \"citizens of Cuban origin and mercenary organizations\" who oppose communism; a call to lift the embargo on Cuba, but not Cuba's much larger embargo on the United States; and the expression of \"support for the government of Venezuela.\"\n\nIn addition to this more localized forum, Cuba has championed the creation of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), which hosts an annual summit attended by the hemisphere's socialist leaders.\n\nCuba's presence at the Summit of the Americas has largely been a destructive one. In 2015 -- the year President Barack Obama shook hands and shared a stage with dictator Raúl Castro at the event -- Cuban government agents publicly assaulted members of Cuba's dissident community who had traveled to the host nation, Panama, to repudiate the Castro record on human rights. Cuban government agents also disrupted sideline meetings with chanting and heckling of pro-democracy activists, before members of their delegation stormed out alongside Venezuelan representatives upon the summit expressing concerns for the starving Venezuelan population.",

The word \"wall\" does not appear anywhere in the bill to describe border security.\n\nTrump said that \"a strong border system, including a wall,\" would help defend the country's borders.\n\n\"We're going to be starting work literally on Monday on not only some new wall -- not enough, but we're working on that very quickly -- but also fixing existing walls and existing acceptable fences,\" he said. \"There are some areas that you have to see through, you have to be able to see through the other side in order to see what's coming.\"\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen also praised the new funding, calling it a \"downpayment on the border wall system.\"\n\nShe added, however, that it was \"unfortunate\" that Congress restricted DHS officials in the legislation on border security.\n\n\"They've told us how to build the wall, where to build the wall,\" Nielsen said. \"And we will continue to work with them to make sure that the wall is where we need it, how we need it as the president described, and to make sure that it serves the American people and the security of this nation.\"",

Chuck Schumer, used the budget defeat to mock Trump's campaign promise to his supporters that \"You're going to be sick and tired of winning!\"\n\nI, for one, am tired of all the winning.\n\n-- Matt House (@mattwhouse) March 23, 2018\n\nThe tweet likely reflects the Democrats' eagerness to wide the growing pre-November split between the GOP's business-first leaders and the party's populist voters. That split could help the Democrats win sweeping electoral victories -- and a majority in the House.\n\nIn a relaxed conversation with Capitol Hill reporters on Thursday, Schumer said:\n\nIt's a funny thing. In a certain sense, we're able to accomplish more in the minority than we were when we had the presidency or even were in the majority ... We don't have the House, we don't have the Senate, we don't have the presidency, but we produced a darn good bill for the priorities we have believed in.\n\nHouse Minority leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi, also gloated, saying her side won because the GOP leadership pushed conservative GOP legislators out of the closed-door talks. According to the Washington Examiner:\n\n\"Much of our leverage has sprung from the fact that the Republicans ... they weren't voting for this bill,\" Pelosi said. \"That gave us leverage in all the negotiations. That gave the middle class a victory.\"\n\nOne result of the bipartisan leadership cooperation was that the bipartisan legislation blocked Trump's border protection plans, giving him only 33 miles of new fencing to close up more than 1,300 miles of unrestricted border.\n\nHowever, the bill also includes the priorities of the GOP's business-first leadership, such as $78 billion in additional defense spending, and a tax-break for grain farmers. The GOP's business-first wing worked with Democrats to sideline Trump's border priorities which could reduce the supply of illegal immigrants to GOP-aligned businesses.",

                "title": "State Department Confirms Silence from North Korea on Trump/Kim Meeting",
                "body": "North Korean state media has not published the news of the agreement, meaning the average North Korean is not aware that their leader invited President Trump to meet while both nations remain technically at war.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a regular briefing on Thursday, State Department spokeswoman and acting Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Heather Nauert confirmed that the department was not in contact with their analogs in North Korea. She noted, however, that the government of South Korea was planning a meeting of high-level officials with the North, and American officials expected to receive more information about the Trump-Kim summit from that engagement. The invitation to Trump arrived following the conclusion of a diplomatic visit to Pyongyang by senior South Korean officials.\n\n\"I can tell you ... that South Korea and North Korea are planning to have a meeting ahead of our summit, which -- we have not announced any dates yet at this point,\" Nauert explained. \"They're planning to have a meeting. We are in close coordination with the South Koreans and the Japanese, for that matter, about all of these meetings and all of these talks.\"\n\nNauert did not confirm or deny reports that a three-way summit with North Korea and South Korea was possible, instead stating, \"We're still going under the operating premise that we will be meeting with North Korea.\"\n\nAsked specifically whether any direct communications had arrived from North Korea, Nauert said, \"Not at this point, not at this point. I don't have anything for you on that. I'll let you know.\"\n\nPressed on whether a summit of such magnitude could occur in the next two months without communication, Nauert lamented, \"This is just complicated diplomacy ... that's just the way it works.\"\n\nThe day after the White House announced the plan for the world leader and the tyrant to meet, North Korean state media published editorials condemning the \"wicked U.S.\" to its doom. On March 21, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the state-run newswire service, claimed that a \"sign of change also in the DPRK [North Korea]-U.S. relations\" had arrived but did not specify whether that meant the agreement between Trump and Kim to meet.\n\nSouth Korean officials claimed last week that they had begun working to expedite the planning of the Kim-Trump summit, but provided no details. Seoul also hopes that Trump will be able to meet with leftist South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the near future. Some Seoul officials believe that Kim may be seeking a peace treaty to end the technically ongoing Korean War before he will commit to abandoning his illegal nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo observes that, after a splashy appearance on the global stage during the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, Kim has largely \"retreated into silence,\" withdrawing his public spokesmen and keeping his propaganda outlets broadcasting their typical bellicose coverage against the Japanese. His most recent move was to send diplomats to Sweden, which triggered rumors that Kim may be shopping to use the Scandinavian country as a neutral site for the summit. Kim rarely ventures outside of Pyongyang, where he cannot control coverage of himself; it is highly unlikely that Trump would subject himself to total control under the North Korean regime within its borders.\n\nChosun sites several anonymous government sources who propose varying theories for why North Korea has gone silent. One suggests that the South Korean claim that Kim had vowed to denuclearize contradicts decades of North Korean state propaganda, leaving the regime in a bind. Another posits that \"Kim Jong-un is probably monitoring the behavior of the U.S. and moves by other countries as he calculates his next move.\"",

After his famous conversion (31 - 36 AD) on the Road to Damascus, Saul became Paul and, filled with the Holy Ghost, became one of the most important figures in early Christianity. Fourteen of the 27 books in the New Testament are attributed to Paul. He was martyred in Rome sometime between 64-68 AD.\n\nCaviezel, who played Jesus in Mel Gibson's 2004 record-breaking blockbuster The Passion of the Christ, plays Saint Luke here, a companion of Paul's who is believed to have written one of the four Gospels (The Gospel of Luke), which tells the story of Christ's time here on earth. Many scholars believe that whoever wrote The Gospel of Luke also wrote Acts of the Apostles.\n\nOver at the left-wing Variety, the negative review can best be described as a oh-so-Woke non sequitur that finds the Crusades relevant, even though the Crusades came hundreds of years after Paul's martyrdom:\n\nLike its namesake, \"Paul, Apostle of Christ\" is dedicated to \"all who have been persecuted for their faith,\" though nothing about the film suggests tolerance of religions other than Christianity. As a final assignment in a college medieval history course, my fellow students and I were expected to write a 10-page essay summarizing the entire semester from a single prompt: \"In the long run, who won, the Christians or the Romans?\" This film depicts circumstances as they were in 67 A.D., but after Constantine converted to Christianity in the early 4th century, the persecuted became the powerful, and the church went on to sanction the execution of heretics, the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition and so on.\n\nThe Wrap's review also brings some Woke into it. \"Naturally, no sticking points about Paul's legacy, like his (disputed) rejection of female church leaders, make it into Hyatt's script,\" the reviewer complains ... naturally.\n\nNevertheless, of the 287 audience members who rated the movie on Rotten Tomatoes, a full 93 percent said they \"liked it.\" The movie held some sneak previews Thursday night.",

Among those lawmakers was the brother of Popular Force party leader Keiko Fujimori, Rep. Kenji Fujimori.\n\nKenji called his sister a \"delinquent\" for releasing the video; Kuczynski, who beat Keiko for the presidency by less than one percent of the votes, resigned.\n\nBefore Kuczynski's resignation could become officials, however, Congress needed to accept it. After an intense floor debate Thursday, Congress instead drafted a bill rejecting his resignation and charging him for \"treason.\" Peruvian federal law lists treason as one of several crimes for which a president can be removed. Previous attempts to impeach Kuczsynki instead cited \"moral unfitness\" to hold the office.\n\nThe \"treason\" draft bill prompted an outraged threat from Kuczynski to withdraw his resignation on Friday.\n\n\"The Congressional resolution that attempts to present as resignation as an impeachment is unacceptable,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"If it's going to be like this, I withdraw my letter and subject myself to the regular impeachment process where I will exercise my right to a defense.\"\n\nInaceptable la propuesta de Resolución Legislativa del Congreso que intenta presentar como vacancia una renuncia. De ser así retiro mi carta y me someto al procedimiento regular de vacancia donde ejerceré mi derecho de defensa.\n\n-- PedroPablo Kuczynski (@ppkamigo) March 23, 2018\n\nAdding to the confusion was the absence of Vice President Martín Vizcarra, who was visiting Canada while the scandal unfolded. Vizcarra arrived in Lima on Friday and assume the presidency. \"Faith and optimism,\" he told reporters upon his return.\n\nPeru will host the Summit of the Americas this month, which President Donald Trump is expected to attend and Vizcarra now expected to preside over.\n\nKuczynski no longer facing impeachment charges leaves his legal status in limbo. The government would have to now begin pressing charges against him as a private citizen, both for the Odebrecht situation and potentially in relation to the alleged impeachment bribes.\n\nProsecutors seeking more information on the depth of Odebrecht's penetration of their government found evidence that Kuczynski accepted over $3 million in \"consulting\" fees from the firm between 2004 and 2007, when he served as Finance Minister of the country. The investigation triggered demands from Fujimori's party that Kuczynski face impeachment, even though Keiko Fujimori is also facing allegations that she took over one million dollars from the firm. That accusation led Kenji Fujimori to resign from the Popular Force party and become a non-partisan lawmaker in early March.\n\nWhile being savaged by the conservative Popular Force party over the Odebrecht scandal, Kuczynski, encouraged by Kenji, faced growing criticism from the nation's left for his pardon of former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, the legislators' father. As a former World Bank head and pro-business economist, Kuczynski could never rely on support from the far left, but the elder Fujimori's arrest was a major victory for leftists, and undoing it broke up the little support Kuczynski had cobbled together to defeat Keiko Fujimori for the presidency.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Kuczynski blamed \"a climate of ungovernability that does tremendous harm to the nation and does not allow us to advance\" and dismissed the videos of his attorney discussing bribes with Kenji Fujimori as \"edited and selectively tendencious.\" He bitterly concluded that he hoped the country would \"reach the unity and harmony that it so needs and that was denied to me.\"",

                "body": "The men's fashion magazine of record, GQ, plumbed new depths in journalistic sewer-dredging, trashing every conservative that has ever lived and even trying to discredit the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn an extended, stream-of-consciousness rant that is remarkably disjointed even by GQ standards, writer Drew Magary has declared a no-holds-barred war on conservatives that would make Al Sharpton blush.\n\n\"Today's Republican Party is nothing more than a gross celebration of inequality,\" Magary explains in his March 21 essay. \"It is a loose collective of yahoos and rich assholes and fringe libertarians and pious hypocrites whose only shared trait is their vindictiveness.\"\n\nClearly pandering to the highbrow clientele of the curiously named Gentleman's Quarterly, Mr. Magary informs readers that Trump is \"a graceless, ignorant sack of shit,\" while conservatism itself is \"a big fucking lie.\" William F. Buckley was just \"a rich asswipe with an affected accent who never had to worry about money a day in his life.\"\n\nIt would appear that when Mr. Magary suffers from writer's block he goes to the nearest public toilet to draw inspiration from the scribblings on the wall.\n\nHaving evidently gotten up on the wrong side of bed, Mr. Magary attacks everybody and everything associated with conservatives and conservatism, from Donald Trump back to the U.S. Constitution, taking swipes along the way at Ronald Reagan, both Bushes, Edmund Burke, William F. Buckley, and even Richard Nixon, \"who could claim Trump as his spiritual love child.\"\n\nMagary harbors special animus toward Russell Kirk, who in trying to formulate the tenets of conservatism, \"never addresses racism, or sexism, or environmental issues.\" In other words, Kirk committed the utterly inexcusable oversight of failing to foresee and embrace the identity politics that defined the Democratic party in its ill-fated bid for the presidency in 2016.\n\nAs a group, Republicans suffer from a \"blithe disinterest in progress,\" a \"complete lack of recognition of injustice,\" \"lionization of intractability,\" \"hatred of working government,\" a \"hilarious lack of creativity,\" and \"the Pence-ian lust to control everyone's 'passions.'\"\n\nMr. Magary declares that he does understand the principled opposition to the Soviet Union during the Cold War, explaining it as follows: \"I am a greedy capitalist at heart, and I do not like the prospect of a Commie Russia endgame any more than they did.\"\n\nFor their part, the nation's Founding Fathers suffered from \"blind spots to the oppressed\" when they drafted the Constitution, Magary declares, \"so no wonder conservatives are so eager to adhere to that document literally.\"\n\nMagary's singular accomplishment in this extraordinary essay is to have verbally abused so many conservatives living and dead in just 2,200 words, all the while saying almost nothing of substance.\n\nMagary does make one valid point, however. He correctly notes that the fathers of modern conservatism -- William F. Buckley, Russell Kirk, Milton Friedman -- are \"all dead now,\" which cannot be argued with. Readers are left to wonder what relevance this fact has to the rest of the piece, but in this, at least, they cannot accuse Magary of manufacturing fake news.\n\nOtherwise, the essay is an exercise in what liberals do best: expressing how they feel. And Magary feels angry. Very angry. Utterly bereft of reasonable arguments, the article reads like a high school sophomore's diary entry the evening after being called in for a tongue-lashing from the school principle.\n\nIf this is what passes for serious commentary in the GQ world -- written apparently for a cadre of fashion-minded drones walking in unthinking liberal lockstep -- then the left's intellectual firepower is at an all-time low.\n\nOutside the bubble, at least for the moment, right-thinking people can breathe easily knowing that their opponents are too busy outdoing one another in bashing dead conservatives to notice what is actually happening in the world.",

                "title": "New York Times: Why Does My Identity Determine the Value of My Political Voice? | Breitbart",
                "body": "A New York Times column published this week by David Brooks argues that modern America values identity over individual thought.\n\nIn a column entitled \"Speaking as a White Male,\" David Brooks writes that Americans have political beliefs assigned to them on the basis of their identity. Brooks attributes this to the rise of \"perspectivism,\" or the notion that our ideas are formed as a result of our experiences. Because of this, a white writer would not be able to adequately portray the experience of a black woman in a fiction novel. But has it always been this way?\n\nWriters like George Orwell believed that experience was more important than identity, that if you put yourself in other people's shoes, you could feel what other groups were feeling and communicate that experience. Lionel Trilling put great faith in imagination, certain that Shakespeare could capture the experience of being a woman, though he was not a woman.\n\nBrooks points his finger at Michel Foucault, a scholar whose body of work addressed the relationship between power and knowledge. Foucault's theory was essentially that those in power shape social understanding. Do you believe in low taxes for the upper classes? Well, according to Foucault, that's likely because those in power had manipulated you through cultural institutions into forming that belief.\n\nBut Foucault and his contemporaries brought something else to the table; the notion that one's political beliefs are the product of one's lived experience. Therefore, a white straight male who has enjoyed all of the privileges of a society designed for him to succeed can't speak to the experience of a black female raised in a bad neighborhood in Detroit. Under the new rules for social discourse, in a battle of the ideas on an issue such as poverty prevention, the black female should always best the straight white male, because her experience, more so than his, lends itself to the topic.\n\nThen came Michel Foucault and critical race theorists and the rest, and the argument that society is structured by elites to preserve their privilege. Beliefs and culture are part of the structure elites use to preserve that inequality. This led, in the common parlance, to the assumption that your beliefs are determined by your group's privilege or lack of privilege, by where your group is within the power structure.\n\nIt's a concept that doesn't make much sense after held up to the slightest of scrutiny. Simply experiencing poverty, for instance, does not lend one the wisdom necessary to offer remedies for such a complex issue. But yet, our political moment insists that the voices of those from marginalized backgrounds are more valuable than the voices of others.\n\nBrooks concedes that sometimes personal experience is important.\n\nWider inclusion has vastly improved public debate. For example, in the 1990s, African-Americans strongly supported tougher criminal justice laws. Now opinion has shifted and a majority of African-Americans strongly oppose them. That shift, born out of a direct and unique experience, reveals that, say, mandatory minimum sentencing laws have had harsh unintended effects.\n\nBut, as Brooks points out, on most political issues, identity is not important. \"How does being gay shape your view of U.S.-German relations or breaking up big tech? How does being Latina influence how you read a black writer like St. Augustine?\" he wrote.\n\nAll Americans should be asking themselves the following question: why does my identity determine the value of my political voice?",

He was so ungracious. He used his platform for a partisan attack.\"\n\nShe added, \"And the other point that was amazing is what he didn't say. This is a huge budget deal. It does include money for education, for jobs, for job training, for Social Security, for Medicare, for health care. It's as if he doesn't believe that the Constitution requires that the government provides not only for the common defense but to promote the general welfare and establish justice and domestic tranquility. He doesn't get it, and I was just, frankly, rolling my eyes over it because it was shocking to see him use his position in that way, as a partisan moment.\"",

They want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats fought us. They fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill. [Emphasis added]\n\nAnd as you know, DACA is also tied to the wall, for the major funding, the $25 billion for wall and other things. So I think that will be coming up very soon. But I do want the Hispanic community to know and DACA recipients to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats who are using you for their own purposes.

                "title": "'Congress Is Broken,' Say Pro-Life Leaders on GOP Broken Promises in Omnibus",
                "body": "The omnibus spending bill is drawing the ire of national pro-life leaders and members of Congress who say many Republicans have broken their promises to the base of the party by funding Planned Parenthood and rejecting an amendment that would provide conscience protections for healthcare workers who refuse to participate in abortions.\n\n\"It is incredibly disheartening that conscience language was not included especially given that it is reflective of the majority of Americans' views in addition to the fact that for 10 years strong this has been a priority for pro-life groups, who received assurance from Leadership that it was also a priority,\" said Vice President of Government Affairs for March for Life, Tom McClusky. \"In addition, included in this bill is continued funding for our nation's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, despite the current investigations into the trafficking of baby parts and the recent GAO report confirming the billions of taxpayer dollars it has received in recent years.\"\n\nMcClusky told Breitbart News pro-life leaders were told the Conscience Protection Act was a priority for House Speaker Paul Ryan, yet it was not included in the massive spending bill.\n\nRep. Diane Black (R-TN), who drove the effort to include the Conscience Protection Act in the omnibus - to protect healthcare workers who refuse to participate in abortions due to faith beliefs or moral convictions - voted against the spending bill:\n\nWhile the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding provision which prohibits taxpayer funding of most abortions is, as always, attached to the current spending bill, pro-life Republicans wanted it expanded so that any insurance company bailouts - if establishment members of Congress got their way - would also not allow taxpayer funds to cover abortions in their insurance plans.\n\nAs the Washington Post notes, \"Democrats, who wanted to preserve the ability of marketplace plans to cover abortions, rejected the additional Hyde language,\" and were only willing to maintain the current status quo Hyde provision.\n\n\"Under that language, marketplace plans covering abortions must collect an extra fee from customers and keep those funds separate to pay for the procedure,\" the Post reports.\n\n\"I think the Democrats basically decided they would rather have subsidies for plans with abortion coverage rather than have cost-sharing reductions and reinsurance to drive down premiums,\" the Family Research Council's David Christensen said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood tweeted its appreciation to pro-abortion Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) for \"pushing back on attempts to eliminate private insurance coverage of abortion!\":\n\nThank you Senator @PattyMurray for standing up for women's health and pushing back on attempts to eliminate private insurance coverage of abortion! https://t.co/VUfmDtjCYz\n\n-- Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) March 22, 2018\n\n\"When you have one spending bill - as opposed to 12 - we're told, 'Pick your priority,'\" McClusky told Breitbart News. \"There are other things that we've been fighting for - for years - that were left out of this bill, let alone defunding Planned Parenthood. So, we're told 'Pick your priority,' and then when it gets closer, we're told, 'Do you really want to shut the government down over this - the whole government?'\"\n\n\"Our response is usually, 'Yes,' but no member of Congress wants to, and if they went through regular order, you'd only shut down one-twelfth of the government,\" he added.\n\n\"While we appreciate that this bill will maintain the status quo on pro-life provisions, we did not elect this Congress or President to maintain the status quo on healthcare, which funds abortion,\" McClusky said.\n\nTroy Newman, president of pro-life organization Operation Rescue, said in a statement that addresses President Donald Trump, who indicated he is considering a veto of the omnibus:\n\nMr. President, Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion business in the U.S., making them one of the largest abusers of human beings in the world. It is currently under investigation by your Department of Justice for engaging in the illegal sale of aborted baby remains for profit, as revealed in a series of authenticated undercover videos that shook the nation in 2015.\n\nTwo Congressional investigations also provided evidence that there is enough probable cause to charge Planned Parenthood with multiple crimes.\n\nDuring your 2016 Presidential Campaign, you promised to defund Planned Parenthood. I urge you now to keep your promise and veto the Omnibus bill until it no longer provides any of our tax money to Planned Parenthood.\n\nStudents for Life of America president Kristan Hawkins said in a statement that the failure of the GOP to follow through with its promise to defund Planned Parenthood shows why elections are important.\n\n\"More pro-life leaders from both parties are needed to make an investment in life, not the abortion industry,\" she said. \"We are wasting scarce taxpayer dollars by allowing those monies to be funneled from real, full service medical centers, like Federally Qualified Health Centers, to the abortion mega-vendor, Planned Parenthood. Efforts to protect the conscience rights of Americans in the budget deserve our support, as no one should be forced into the ugly business of abortion.\"\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, also said in a statement:\n\nThis omnibus is nowhere close to what Republicans promised to fight for. When the American people sent us to Congress, their message was loud and their mandate clear: Secure the border; Repeal and replace Obamacare; Protect Second Amendment rights from bureaucrats in Washington; Defund Planned Parenthood; Cut wasteful spending; 'Drain the swamp' and change the unsustainable way Washington, D.C. does business.\n\nThis budget embraces the polar opposite of these principles. We are not funding the wall. We are putting Second Amendment rights at risk. We are failing to provide families relief from Obamacare. We are still sending taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood. We are not cutting federal funds to sanctuary cities. We are growing the size of government at a break-neck pace. And we are doing all of this through a 2,300 page spending bill, written privately by four leadership members, that became public only 24 hours ago.\n\n\"This is wrong,\" Meadows added. \"This is not the limited government conservatism our voters demand. Our constituents -- our employers -- deserve better.\"\n\nMcClusky agrees.\n\n\"Congress is broken,\" the pro-life leader said. \"It cannot continue doing business through large ominous Omnibus or Continuing Resolutions. Until Congress repairs itself, pro-life priorities, such as much needed conscience protections, will never get passed.\"",

Two prominent former military men made surprise announcements late last year and in January that they would run against Sisi, with indications from the street that their bids might be popular.\n\nOne of them, ex-military chief of staff Sami Anan, was arrested in January, accused of illegally running for public office, and remains detained. The other, former air force commander and prime minister Ahmed Shafik, also dropped his presidential bid.\n\nReuters learned from human rights groups that the Sisi administration has been silencing criticism by cracking down on dissenters in the media.\n\nAfter a popular uprising overthrew Mohamed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2014, then-chief of the Army Sisi assumed control of the country, ultimately becoming president.\n\nSome analysts suggest security has deteriorated in the country, particularly when it comes to Christian minorities targeted by the likes of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), which primarily operates in the restive Sinai peninsula region. However, Sisi's anti-terrorism credentials have played well in the west, yielding praise from U.S. President Donald Trump who has lauded the Egyptian leader for a \"tremendous job under trying circumstances.\"\n\nISIS attacks have killed and injured hundreds, including adherents of the mystic Sufism side of Islam and Coptic Christians.\n\nIn response, Sisi has launched a crackdown on the jihadist with no pity, taking into custody about 60,000 people on terrorism charges.",

                "body": "At most every major airport in America, far-left CNN's presence is as ubiquitous as the Starbucks and the four-dollar Snickers bar. But now that the last-place network has taken a sharp turn to the left of even MSNBC, people are starting to question why.\n\nFor obvious reasons, CNN is no longer seen by the public as a rather anodyne, left-of-center cable news channel. Under chief Jeff Zucker, CNN has not only become a national joke and unpopular (falling way into last place in the ratings) but a social justice hot house for fake news, wild-eyed conspiracy theories, porn-porn-porn, open calls for violence, on-camera harassment of Trump supporters, and the booing of rape victims.\n\nAs a result, decent people are starting to ask if it is responsible to pipe an unhinged propaganda outlet like CNN into the public space, especially one with a captive audience like the airport.\n\nTo the surprise of no one, CNN is not in all of these airports due to the network's popularity. Rather, the anti-Trump cable channel actually has to pay these airports to broadcast its left-wing content.\n\n\"CNN pays airports to leave the network on, and many travel hubs even have agreements in which CNN pays for their TVs and infrastructure,\" reports Fox News (the first place cable news outlet that regularly doubles and even triples CNN in viewership).\n\n\"CNN Airport covers the costs related to the TVs and related infrastructure, provides programming specifically geared for airports, and pays us for the opportunity to be in our facility,\" a representative from Minneapolis-Saint Paul International told Fox News, adding that \"CNN is willing to pay the most.\"\n\nIt is one thing for an airport to provide news and entertainment to its captive audience, but now that CNN is a 24/7 outlet for political activism, pumping in CNN is much closer to those large propaganda screens in George Orwell's Nineteen-Eighty-Four.\n\nFox News adds that as CNN's coverage has become more unhinged, salacious, and unreliable, there have been \"increasing calls for CNN to be removed from airports,\" noting specifically that the anti-Trump channel has \"obsessed about Trump's ice cream intake, fixated on a white truck that blocked the network from filming Trump playing golf, botched a date that resulted in a false report claiming the Trump campaign had early access to hacked DNC emails and even shaken up its primetime lineup to make room for the son of Democrat icon Mario Cuomo, Chris.\"\n\nAdd to that, CNN's chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, declared that Trump has heart disease despite the president's doctor giving him a clean bill of health... chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta has emerged as one of the faces of the anti-Trump media [and] senior media correspondent Brian Stelter has repeatedly questioned the President's mental health and fitness for office.\"\n\nIn some airports, CNN's Big Brother presence is so intrusive \"it is impossible for employees to even lower the volume on the televisions blaring cable news.\"\n\nCNN refused to answer Fox when asked if its airport presence impacts CNN's already embarrassingly low ratings.\n\nThe other day I sat in a waiting room for about 20 minutes. CNN was on the TV, which meant it was all about porn stars and playmates. The half-dozen of us waiting all bonded by rolling our eyes and outright laughing at basement-rated network.\n\nEventually, one woman asked, \"Mind if I change the channel?\"\n\nIt seems absurd that airport customers are denied the basic human right to escape from Jake Tapper's hypocritical self-righteousness, Chris Cuomo's idiotic intolerance, or any other moment emanating from Jeff Zucker's hate machine.\n\nIt also seems fair to wonder why these airports would force customers to watch the least popular news network available.",

For example, Trump requested \"$300 million to recruit, hire, and train 500 new Border Patrol Agents\" last year.\n\nThe spending bill, though, only funds $7 million to hire about 350 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) \"law enforcement officers\" who may not end up being trained as Border Patrol agents.\n\nThe lack of funding for ICE and Border Patrol is likely to result in continued pressure and strain on the federal immigration agencies. Both agencies have been under-funded for years while trying to detain the increased number of illegal aliens crossing the southern border every day, and also attempting to find, arrest, and deport the 12 to 30 million illegal aliens currently living in the U.S.\n\nTrump's lack of increased border and interior immigration enforcement funding through the spending bill may translate into continued stagnant wages for American workers, whose pay has been flat-lined by a continued flow of cheap, illegal and legal immigrant workers.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the spending bill will also increase the number of illegal aliens who are released into the U.S. through the Catch and Release program that has yet to end.\n\nAdditionally, the spending bill bans Trump from being able to build a wall along the southern border using the prototype walls that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) commissioned.",

                "body": "Breitbart News Senior Tech Correspondent Allum Bokhari joined Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on SiriusXM Patriot's Breitbart News Daily, Friday, to discuss Silicon Valley's double standard on free speech and regulation.\n\n\"Mark Zuckerberg's promise to the public is zero transparency and zero public accountability. He floated that he might be interested or might think its a good thing for the government to regulate him and to regulate Facebook, but Allum, what is the deal here?\" asked Marlow. \"He gives his speech, he's talking about the data breach or whatever it was, and he doesn't seem to be committing to anything aside from Facebook investigating itself.\"\n\n\"Yeah, this is exactly what he did when he had the trending news scandal in 2016, when Facebook was accused by one of its own employees of discriminating against conservative news sources,\" replied Bokhari. \"Facebook was under pressure from the Senate, so he announced an internal investigation, basically investigated itself and found itself innocent, surprise surprise. So he's trying to do the same thing here. But the comments Facebook are making, not just Zuckerberg but also Sheryl Sandberg, about wanting to be regulated, it's interesting, but the question is what kind of regulation are they talking about?\"\n\n\"Is it going to be regulation from the Democrats or regulation from the Republicans? I think conservatives and the left and the globalist establishment want very different things from Facebook,\" he continued. \"I think the globalist establishment want Facebook to exert more editorial control over their platform, they want them to do more suppression of conservative media, and they want less free speech. I think they're the people that Facebook is responding to. It's pressure from them. They're not asking their users anymore what they think, what they want to see on their news feed. They're not giving users more power, they're responding to Democratic senators, and advertising conglomerates, and corporate media. Those are the people that Facebook listens to at the moment, at least it seems that way with how everything changes.\"\n\n\"So when they ask for regulation I think that's what they're talking about. It's not regulation that will make Facebook freer, more open, more of a neutral platform,\" Bokhari claimed. \"It will make it less of those things.\"\n\nMarlow then responded, \"So it sounds like what Zuckerberg is trying to do is diffuse the news cycle, and he also achieved it... The world is moving on; there are a million things to talk about. We can talk about trade, we can talk about McMaster and Bolton, we can talk about this omnibus bill... stock turbulence, stocks are down big yesterday, there are so many things in the news that Zuckerberg is hoping this thing just sort of goes away, and then he can go back to his business, but I don't know if he's going to be quite that lucky.\"\n\n\"He really is just playing this politician out there where he's saying, 'We're going to do this investigation.' Who are the investigators? Oh, it just so happens to be Facebook. It's going to be investigating themselves. I mean what is actually changing here?\" expressed Marlow. \"What is he proposing that is a hard and fast change that could potentially lead to some transparency from these masters of the universe?\"\n\n\"Well he hasn't promised transparency, he's promised to do an internal audit of applications and developers who had access to user data before 2014, and before 2014 is important because prior to 2014 Facebook had very lax rules on the amount of data that third-party applications could access,\" explained Bokhari. \"So if I used and installed an app prior to 2014, many of those apps would've asked the user for permission to not only view their data but also the news feed and information and personal information from their friends. So these apps not only had permission to view information from the user who installed the app, but they also had permission to view the information from their friends, who hadn't consented to that. So that's the real issue that Mark Zuckerberg is trying to address.\"\n\n\"Now the focus of the story has been on Cambridge Analytica, and alleged involvement with the Trump campaign. They say they didn't use any data to support Donald Trump, or in the 2016 election at all. But one campaign that definitely did use Facebook's data at a time when they did have those weak data protection rules was the Obama campaign in 2012, because that was before Facebook tightened their rules in 2014,\" he continued. \"And we have a former Obama staffer who oversaw the campaign's data analytics programs who essentially said that they were able to scoop the entire social network's social graph from Facebook, that's data on virtually everyone, every American citizen on the platform, and strange there was no mention of that from Mark Zuckerberg or from Facebook, which has an extraordinary amount of ex-Obama staffers on their payroll.\"\n\nMarlow agreed, declaring, \"And this is, Allum, what I think is a pattern when it comes to media bias, when it comes to corporate bias, and when it comes to entertainment bias, is that you're allowed to have opinions so long as they're left-wing opinions. You're allowed to have a system that favors one political party so long as it's the Democratic party.\"\n\n\"That's what's been exposed here, the hypocrisy that this was happening under Obama and no one cared, and it took the fact that Donald Trump and his allies like Cambridge Analytica, like Breitbart, were able to use some of the tools developed by the globalist Silicon Valley elite to their advantage and to beat Silicon Valley elite at their own game,\" he concluded. \"That's why this is getting attention now. It's a point that bears repeating over and over and over, that this isn't just about right and wrong, this isn't just about data collection and power and transparency, this is about the fact that conservatives are using these very expensive tools that are created by left of center people to vanquish the left of center agenda. That's why the outrage is happening; it really isn't even about the data. They aren't outraged about the data because they weren't outraged when Obama was using it for these exact purposes. They're outraged that President Trump's allies are using it to beat Democrats.\"",

He said it also includes upgrades for nuclear equipment. \"Praise be to God that we don't ever have to use it.\" He pointed to money included to upgrade Navy ships that are in disrepair. $10.2 billion for F-35s and more for other specialized military aircraft. He said they are spending a lot of money on \"very, very important\" missile defense.\n\nThe president then added that the bill is funding ICE agents and funding to add more immigration judges.\n\n\"Nobody more disappointed than me because it's so large,\" Trump said of the funding. He said it had to be done because of military funding. He thanked members of Congress for \"working so hard.\" He added, \"There are a lot of strings\" pulling people in a lot of directions.",

                "body": "Google Deep Learning researcher François Chollet took to Twitter recently to outline Facebook's use of \"digital information consumption\" as a \"psychological control vector,\" while also describing the company's interest in A.I., adding \"Personally, it really scares me.\"\n\nIn a long thread of tweets, Google Deep Learning researcher François Chollet discussed the problem facing Facebook going forward and the risks that users take putting their personal information on the platform. He also discussed the dangers that artificial intelligence could pose when given access to the data of billions of users, and how Facebook could use A.I. to shape and manipulate users.\n\nThe problem with Facebook is not *just* the loss of your privacy and the fact that it can be used as a totalitarian panopticon. The more worrying issue, in my opinion, is its use of digital information consumption as a psychological control vector. Time for a thread\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nThe world is being shaped in large part by two long-time trends: first, our lives are increasingly dematerialized, consisting of consuming and generating information online, both at work and at home. Second, AI is getting ever smarter.\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nThese two trends overlap at the level of the algorithms that shape our digital content consumption. Opaque social media algorithms get to decide, to an ever-increasing extent, which articles we read, who we keep in touch with, whose opinions we read, whose feedback we get\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nChollet notes that as Facebook becomes many peoples' main source of news, and as they control what content and news is seen on their platform, they are beginning to shape the worldview and politics of users.\n\nIf Facebook gets to decide, over the span of many years, which news you will see (real or fake), whose political status updates you'll see, and who will see yours, then Facebook is in effect in control of your political beliefs and your worldview\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nThis is not quite news, as Facebook has been known to run since at least 2013 a series of experiments in which they were able to successfully control the moods and decisions of unwitting users by tuning their newsfeeds' contents, as well as prediction user's future decisions\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nIn short, Facebook can simultaneously measure everything about us, and control the information we consume. When you have access to both perception and action, you're looking at an AI problem. You can start establishing an optimization loop for human behavior. A RL loop.\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nChollet warns that combined with an advanced Artificial Intelligence, Facebook could begin to easily manipulate users as they see fit.\n\nA good chunk of the field of AI research (especially the bits that Facebook has been investing in) is about developing algorithms to solve such optimization problems as efficiently as possible, to close the loop and achieve full control of the phenomenon at hand. In this case, us\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nThis is made all the easier by the fact that the human mind is highly vulnerable to simple patterns of social manipulation. While thinking about these issues, I have compiled a short list of psychological attack patterns that would be devastatingly effective\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nChollet is particularly worried about Facebook's recent investments in A.I. and warns that this could have a devastating impact on the future. He adds that Facebook's A.I. initiatives scare him.\n\nWe're looking at a powerful entity that builds fine-grained psychological profiles of over two billion humans, that runs large-scale behavior manipulation experiments, and that aims at developing the best AI technology the world has ever seen. Personally, it really scares me\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nHe finished his tweetstorm by urging anyone that works in A.I. not to work for Facebook:\n\nIf you work in AI, please don't help them. Don't play their game. Don't participate in their research ecosystem. Please show some conscience\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nHowever, it was pointed out by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that Google is allegedly taking part in many of the same practices as Facebook, and that they may reach the goal that Chollet warns about sooner than Facebook.",

You're well-paid serfs, but you're serfs. They've debased your currency, and so you're continuing to underwrite debt for sovereign governments at zero interest rates, so you're always on the spinning wheel like a little hamster, trying to get ahead,\" he told the audience.\n\n\"Because they've destroyed the ability of thrift, of you to save, to get ahead. It's the same thing on your digital assets, your intellectual property: They take it all for free.\"\n\nHe added that Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg's \"entire business model\" is based on these activities, \"taking [your] data for free and monetising it, and then writing algorithms behind a wall that treat you like hamsters on a wheel.\"\n\nBANNON ON BREXIT: It Was Breitbart London Wot Won It https://t.co/gNn4wMKuWI\n\n-- Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 16, 2018\n\nBarber was keen to steer the conversation to more comfortable topics, trying to suggest Bannon was an admirer of Fascist leader Benito Mussolini, and proposing that U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for a military parade in Washington D.C. made him a kind of latter-day Julius Caesar -- but failed to land any telling blows.\n\nHe also broached the subject of Bannon's recent speech at a conference of France's Front National -- now reconstituted as 'National Rally' -- where he said \"Let them call you racist. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honour.\"\n\n\"This is the great thing about the propaganda media,\" answered Bannon.\n\n\"If you look at that speech, I built up [to that statement] ... I talked about, 'What is economic nationalism, that Donald Trump won on?'\n\n\"[Economic nationalism] doesn't care about your race, doesn't care about your colour, doesn't care about your ethnicity, doesn't care about your gender, doesn't care about your religion, doesn't care about your sexual preference.\n\n\"It cares about one thing: that you're a citizen of the United States of America,\" he said -- citing low turnout for Hilary Clinton among working-class black and Hispanic voters before the election and rising prospects for those groups after the election, to show how the concept works.\n\n\"That's why I told these people, listen, the identity politics that Hilary Clinton came out with ... racism, white supremacy -- I sat there, and I told [the team] right there, 'If she's gonna run on identity politics and we run on economic nationalism -- this was August 19th, and we're down by 12 points -- we are going to beat her. And we did.\n\n\"If they call you a racist they have nothing else to argue,\" he concluded.\n\nStephen K. Bannon Declares Marine Le Pen Leader of Europe's Populist Movement https://t.co/wdSfY38y6q\n\n-- Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 15, 2018\n\nOn Marine Le Pen and the Front National more particularly, Bannon was candid.\n\n\"Was I up there to say, 'Those people are perfect'? They're not perfect. The Deplorables are not perfect. I'm not perfect.\n\n\"I believe in the tenet of the Judeo-Christian West, that man is fallen -- we're not perfect.\n\n\"But those are working-class people in France ... I went there for one reason, to tell them they're not alone. That this anti-establishment, populist-nationalist movement, as personified in Italy a couple days before, where two-thirds of the people voted anti-establishment, is on the rise, it's on the move, and it's only going to get stronger, it's only going to get more powerful.\n\n\"And the reason is the party of Davos is destroying your citizenship, they're debasing your currency, and they're taking your data sovereignty -- and as long as they continue to do that, people are going to rise up against it.\"",

He appears to be focusing on advertising regulation, as opposed to the free speech rights of his users, by saying, \"Well, there are some basic things that I think that there are some big intellectual debates on.\" He continued \"On the basic side you know there were things like ads transparency regulation that I would love to see, but if you look at how much regulation there is around advertising on TV and print you know it's just not clear why there should be less on the internet right?\" Zuckerberg continued \"You should have the same level of transparency required.\"\n\nThe Facebook CEO revealed that there may be a bill currently being edited and reviewed that would see harsher regulations placed on tech companies such as Facebook and Google, \"I know a couple of senators are working really hard on this,\" said Zuckerberg. Until then, the Facebook CEO promised that the site would be more transparent about advertising on their platform in the future \"We're committed and we've actually already started rolling out ad transparency tools that accomplish most of the things that are in all the bills that people are talking about today, because we just think that this is an important thing people should know.\" He continued \"You should be able to go to any page and see all the ads that people are running to different audiences.\"",

Spread the word.\"\n\nVfB said in a statement: \"As a result of a below-radar deal reached 15 months ago, the UK will now be transitioning via a third country arrangement, that provides a u-bend route for the UK to come back fully under EU authority in the future.\n\n\"Political commentators in academia and the media are largely yet to grasp the small print of what is really going on.

Students will now be required to use clear, see-through backpacks only.\n\nThe backpacks will be provided for free to students. The reason for the clear backpack is obvious: to make it more difficult to sneak a weapon on campus. The school is also considering metal detectors.\n\nHogg, however, is upset about this infringement on his backpack rights, telling Axios, \"After we come back from Spring Break, they're requiring us all to have clear backpacks...it's unnecessary. It's embarrassing for a lot of the students.\"\n\nThe irony here is remarkable. The same David Hogg who is stridently running around the country calling for further restrictions on every American's Second Amendment civil rights is upset over a common sense security protocol many other schools and all kinds of retail workers have dealt with for decades.\n\nWhen you walk into a government building, be it a courthouse, statehouse, or school, you are voluntarily giving up some of your privacy rights.\n\nThe idea that we are not treating school security like we do airport security is madness.\n\nThere is not a single proposed gun law that would have stopped any of these mass school shootings. Security is the only move that makes any sense whatsoever, but Hogg seems to believe he would be safer with faraway legislation than with hardened security measures at his own school door.",

This policy will apply across the firm, including to small business, commercial and institutional clients, as well as credit card partners, whether co-brand or private label. It doesn't impact the ability of consumers to use their Citi cards at merchants of their choice.\n\nEvery gun purchased at retail must already be acquired via a background check according to federal law. Citibank's emphasis on background checks would require licensed firearms dealers to go beyond federal law and refuse to sell a gun to anyone if an instant background check lasts three business days without incriminating evidence being discovered against the would-be buyer.\n\nThe emphasis on not selling long guns to 18-20 year olds, in states where such sales are legal, is also asking licensed firearms dealers to go above and beyond what federal law requires. It is legal, federally, to sell long guns to persons 18 years old and older.\n\nCitibank contends that their firearms policy is \"not centered on an ideological mission to rid the world of firearms.\" Rather, they said the policy is an expression of \"common-sense measures that would help prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands.\"\n\nOn March 9 Breitbart News reported that Visa refused to cave to a pressure campaign designed to force the company into cutting ties with certain semiautomatic rifle manufacturers.

                "title": "Reporters Admit to Consulting Kerry State Dept. Official Before Publishing Trump Dossier Articles",
                "body": "NEW YORK -- Jonathan M. Winer, an official in John Kerry's State Department, vouched for the credibility of anti-Trump dossier author Christopher Steele to two reporters before they each broke separate stories about the information contained in Steele's largely discredited dossier, the two reporters revealed in their new book.\n\nWiner gave his nod of approval for Steele to the reporters while he served at the State Department. The detail is particularly noteworthy since Winer's purported green light was followed by one of the reporters, Michael Isikoff, penning a story on Yahoo News that was cited in a FISA court application signed by James Comey to obtain a warrant to monitor the communications of Carter Page.\n\nIsikoff's Yahoo News article focused on alleged contacts between Page and Russian officials during a trip to Moscow.\n\nWiner later admitted that while he was at the State Department, he regularly interfaced and exchanged information with Steele, including passing anti-Trump claims to Steele that originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals. Winer also conceded that Shearer's claims were provided to him by Clinton confident Sidney Blumenthal.\n\nAnother reporter, David Corn, also disclosed that he called Winer to assess the credibility of Steele before publishing a widely cited article at Mother Jones about Steele's claims titled, \"Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump.\"\n\nIsikoff and Corn revealed their contacts with Winer in their recently released book Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump.\n\nIsikoff and Corn write that Isikoff was told about Steele's dossier claims at a background briefing for individual reporters at the Tabard Inn in Washington, DC. The briefings were arranged by Glenn Simpson, co-founder of the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which had hired Steele for the anti-Trump work resulting in the dossier. Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Clinton's 2016 campaign and the DNC via Perkins Coie.\n\nSteele briefed Isikoff in a conversation that lasted an hour, Isikoff related. \"But when Isikoff left the Tabard, after a conversation that lasted about an hour, he figured he had more than enough to work with,\" Isikoff and Corn wrote.\n\nNotably, other reporters at the briefing confab did not write about Steele's claims, with some news outlets later describing the charges as unverified. The authors write that the Tabard briefing was attended by \"reporters for the New York Times, the Washington Post and CNN, and Yahoo News' Michael Isikoff.\"\n\nIn a recent article, New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer reported that she personally attended one of the meetings at the Tabard and that \"these encounters were surely sanctioned in some way by Fusion's client, the Clinton campaign.\" However, she wrote that at the time, Steele \"provided no documentary evidence\" and \"neither the New Yorker nor any other news organization ran a story about the allegations.\"\n\nIsikoff and Corn, however, wrote that Steele provided \"more than enough\" for Isikoff to \"work with.\"\n\nIsikoff's next move, the authors relate, was to call Winer and another unnamed official at the State Department.\n\nThe authors write:\n\nWhen he got back to the office, Isikoff called Jonathan Winer at the State Department; he had known Winer for years. Simpson had told him Winer could vouch for Steele. Yes, Steele was an absolutely reliable source, Winer said. Isikoff called another State Department official who had worked on Russian affairs. The source didn't know about Page's alleged meetings in Moscow but knew about Page. U.S. officials had taken notice of his previous trips to Russia, as well his provocative comments critical of U.S. policy and sympathetic to Putin. \"He was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did,\" the official said.\n\nIsikoff did not disclose the name of the other official at the State Department.\n\nWiner previously conceded that he compiled a dossier summary and shared it with Victoria Nuland, a career diplomat who worked under the Clintons and served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under Kerry. Nuland has not responded to Breitbart News requests for comment.\n\nAfter checking with Winer and the unnamed State Department official, Isikoff's Yahoo News story ran after he also contacted Page for comment and talked with a \"senior U.S. law enforcement official,\" the authors write.\n\nLater in the book, Isikoff and Corn also relate that Corn checked with Winer before penning his Mother Jones article for which they write that Steele was a source.\n\nThe authors state:\n\nAfter speaking with Steele, Corn confirmed Steele's identity and expertise. He contacted Jonathan Winer to ask him about Steele. (Isikoff, too, had called Winer about Steele.) Speaking on background, Winer told Corn that he had worked with Steele and that he had a solid track record of collaborating with U.S. government agencies and providing them accurate and valuable information about sensitive national security matters.\n\nA four-page House Intelligence Committee memo released last month revealed that Isikoff's September 23, 2016 Yahoo News article was cited in an Obama-era FISA application as part of the justification to seek approval for monitoring Page's communications. The House memo says that the FISA application cited Isikoff's article \"extensively.\"\n\nThe House memo relates:\n\nThe Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow. This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News and several other outlets in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington, DC in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed.\n\nThe revelations that Winer was consulted by Isikoff and Corn before publishing their articles concerning Steele's charges is not the only such disclosure in the book. The two also write that Nuland gave her approval for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his wild claims about Donald Trump and Russia.\n\nThe book documents Steele told Fusion GPS co-founder Simpson that he believed the claims he uncovered about Trump represented a \"grave national security threat\" that needed to be reported to the FBI. Simpson eventually allowed Steele to report the dossier's claims to the FBI, the book reports.\n\nSteele sought out Rome-based FBI Special Agent Michael Gaeta, with whom he had worked on a previous case. Before Gaeta met with Steele on July 5, 2016, the book relates that the FBI first secured the support of Nuland, who at the time was assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs specializing in Russia. Nuland currently serves as chief executive officer at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nRegarding the arrangements for Steele's initial meeting with the FBI about the dossier claims, Isikoff and Corn report:\n\nThere were a few hoops Gaeta had to jump through. He was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome. The FBI checked with Victoria Nuland's office at the State Department: Do you support this meeting? Nuland, having found Steele's reports on Ukraine to have been generally credible, gave the green light.\n\nWithin a few days, on July 5, Gaeta arrived and headed to Steele's office near Victoria station. Steele handed him a copy of the report. Gaeta, a seasoned FBI agent, started to read. He turned white. For a while, Gaeta said nothing. Then he remarked, \"I have to report this to headquarters.\"\n\nThe book documents that Nuland previously received Steele's reports on the Ukrainian crisis and had been familiar with Steele's general work.\n\nAfter his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele.\n\nWiner further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an \"old friend.\" Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal - which Winer in turn gave to Steele - originated with Cody Shearer.\n\nShearer has numerous close personal and family connections to the Clintons and has reportedly been involved in numerous antics tied to them. National Review previously dubbed Shearer a \"Creepy Clinton Confidante\" and \"The Strangest Character in Hillary's Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy.\"\n\nIn the Post piece, Winer related that while he was at the State Department, he repeatedly passed Russia-related documents from Steele to Nuland, a career diplomat who worked under the Clintons and served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under Kerry. \"Over the next two years, I shared more than 100 of Steele's reports with the Russia experts at the State Department, who continued to find them useful,\" he wrote.\n\nWiner stated that in the summer of 2016, Steele \"told me that he had learned of disturbing information regarding possible ties between Donald Trump, his campaign and senior Russian officials.\"\n\nWiner says that he met with Steele in September 2016 to discuss details that would later become known as the anti-Trump dossier. Winer wrote that he prepared a two-page summary of Steele's information and \"shared it with Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.\"\n\nBesides bringing Steele's dossier information to the State Department, Winer conceded that he also passed information from Blumenthal to Steele, specifically charges about Trump that originated with Shearer.\n\nWiner described what he claimed was the evolution of his contacts with Blumenthal regarding Shearer's information:\n\nIn late September, I spoke with an old friend, Sidney Blumenthal, whom I met 30 years ago when I was investigating the Iran-Contra affair for then-Sen. Kerry and Blumenthal was a reporter at the Post. At the time, Russian hacking was at the front and center in the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails of Blumenthal, who had a long association with Bill and Hillary Clinton, had been hacked in 2013 through a Russian server.\n\nWhile talking about that hacking, Blumenthal and I discussed Steele's reports. He showed me notes gathered by a journalist I did not know, Cody Shearer, that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature.\n\nWhat struck me was how some of the material echoed Steele's but appeared to involve different sources.",

This is an alarm signal for me, so it is right and important that the penalties are tightened.\"\n\nSince 2014, the nationalities of foreign suspects has also dramatically shifted with Turks making up the majority of foreigners involved in sex attacks while Afghans topped the list in 2017.\n\nAfghans accounted for only 64 suspects in 2014, a number which grew to 306 in 2016 and fell only slightly to 263 in 2017. Syrian migrant suspects have also seen a dramatic rise with Syrians accounting for only 3 suspects in 2011 and 63 in 2017.\n\nMigrant Sex Attacks Increased 133 Per Cent This Year https://t.co/OWtSDnRfWa pic.twitter.com/YLsbFIL1LV\n\n-- Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 8, 2016\n\nSex attacks have also grown more violent on average since the height of the migrant crisis. In 2014, the ministry recorded only four sex attacks involving weapons like knives, while in 2017 the number of cases jumped to 17.\n\nThe statistics come only a week after Interior Minister Kickl pledged to look into potential changes to the asylum laws in Austria following a series of violent attacks by asylum seekers in Vienna. The Interior Minister, known in Austria as a firebrand speaker, said he was already trying to increase deportations but faced heavy resistance from left-wing activist groups.\n\nKickl and the Interior Ministry also provided figures earlier this year showing that foreigners now account for almost half of the total criminal suspects in the country.\n\nLast year, a report from the previous government showed that asylum seekers were also straining the Austrian welfare system with 90 per cent of asylum seekers ending up on benefits, according to former Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka.",

Sandberg was interviewed by CNBC's Julia Boorstin, the topic of the interview mainly pertained to Facebook's latest user data scandal which involves the data of 50 million users allegedly accessed by data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica without the direct permission of those users. Facebook executives were extremely slow to respond to news of the data leak, something which Sandberg regrets, saying that if she \"could live this week again,\" she would have commented sooner.\n\nSandberg surprisingly stated that the company would be open to regulation, a point that CEO Mark Zuckerberg briefly touched on in an interview with CNN earlier this week. \"Mark [Zuckerberg] has said, 'It's not a question of if regulation, it's a question of what type,'\" Sandberg said. \"We're open to regulation. We work with lawmakers all over the world.\" Sandberg discussed the data scandal saying, \"We know this is an issue of trust. We know this is a critical moment for our company, for the service we provide.\" She continued to say, \"We are going to do everything we can.\"\n\nWhen asked about the huge hit that the company took to their stock price following news of the scandal, Sandberg stated \"That's not how we look at it. We don't look at these trade-offs like, oh it's going to hurt our business in the long run and in the immediate term,\" Sandberg said. \"People's trust is the most important thing we have, and that is how we make those decisions.\"\n\nDiscussing the delay in comment from Facebook executives, Sandberg said, \"Sometimes, and I would say certainly this past week, we speak too slowly.\" She continued, \"If I could live this past week again, I would definitely have had Mark and myself out speaking earlier, but we were trying to get to the bottom of this.\" In an interview with CNN, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed regulation saying \"I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated. There are things like ad transparency regulation that I would love to see.\" Zuckerberg has since been asked to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Congress.",

Every day things change,\" Puigdemont said in Helsinki, where he was on a visit.\n\nHe also aimed criticism at the judge's decision, suggesting Llarena was influenced by the political climate. \"It is not right for a judge to do politics,\" Puigdemont said.\n\nIn a letter addressed to her party followers and posted on ERC's website, Rovira didn't say whether she had left Spain already or where she might go.\n\n\"I'm sad, but it's been more saddening to lead a silenced life,\" Rovira wrote, announcing that she had chosen to take \"the path to exile.\"\n\nFive other Catalan politicians, including Puigdemont, fled to Brussels following the failed secession attempt in late October. An anti-establishment party's former lawmaker, Anna Gabriel, fled to Switzerland earlier this year.\n\nThe unity of Spain is enshrined in the Constitution, which says the country is \"indivisible,\" and courts have blocked Catalonia's independence efforts at every turn. Secession is not allowed without a reform of the top law.\n\nTwelve of the former regional ministers are also charged with misuse of public funds. And seven other lawmakers are charged with disobedience.\n\nThe judge also required the 14 ex-members of the Catalan Cabinet to pay 2.1 million euros ($2.6 million) as a collective deposit before the trial establishes whether they need to pay back misused public funds.\n\nThat figure includes 1.6 million euros that, according to the judicial investigation, were used to pay for the Oct. 1 referendum that set the turbulent events in motion.\n\nLlarena described the case as \"an attack on the constitutional State that, through the desire to impose a change in the form of government for Catalonia and the rest of the country, is of unusual gravity and persistence.\"\n\nHis ruling also warned that the strategy to secede Catalonia is \"dormant and awaiting resumption\" once separatists regain control of the regional Catalan government.\n\nSix of the politicians, including Rovira, had been summoned to court on Friday -- an indication that the judge may later in the day order them jailed pending trial.\n\nEU on the Brink: Hundreds of Thousands March in Catalonia to Demand the Release of 'Political Prisoners' https://t.co/zhxDUb1fkL\n\n-- Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 12, 2017\n\nThey include Jordi Turull, a former minister of the ousted regional Cabinet, who on Thursday failed in his initial bid to be elected as the region's new president.\n\nHe has a second chance to be voted in by simple majority on Saturday, but that would be thwarted if Turull ends up being preventively jailed on Friday.\n\nThat would leave in limbo the immediate future of a government in the northeastern region, possibly heading to a new election later this year.\n\nThe semiautonomous region has been without a leader for nearly five months after central authorities took control following October's illegal independence declaration.\n\nPolls show Catalans are equally divided on the secession issue, although a vast majority supports solving the issue through a legal referendum agreed with central authorities.",

I hope they get what they asked for in November. When will these RINO wimps stop sticking their asses in the air for the Democrats to violate?\n\n-- James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) March 23, 2018\n\nThis massive omnibus bill, which only funds the government for six months, is widely seen as a total capitulation to Democrats. Although Americans put Republicans in charge of all three branches of government, Planned Parenthood remains fully funded, while there is virtually no funding for President Trump's wall or border security. The bill is expected to add another trillion dollars to a national debt that is already over $20 trillion.\n\nIn other tweets, Woods also hammered Trump over his broken promise to build a border wall:\n\nAlthough Trump at first signaled that he would sign the massive and massively unpopular bill, the growing fury in his own political base appears to have changed his mind. The president is now threatening a veto.\n\nWoods' frustration speaks for many -- not in far-left Hollywood but in Middle America, who time and again see the GOP rolling over, even though they are completely in charge of the government. Moreover, all the wasteful spending on utter nonsense continues while priorities like border security remain under-funded.\n\nOn his nationally-syndicated radio show Wednesday, Rush Limbaugh said that he believes Trump signing this omnibus bill could be the kind of act that at long last creates a rift between the president and his loyal base of support.\n\n\"I predict this is going to be the first phase of Trump voters beginning to go wobbly. This is the swamp on steroids. This was not supposed to be happening anymore, this kind of thing,\" he said.\n\n\"My fear is that this could be the issue, the item that begins to cause Trump voters to go wobbly, 'cause this was not... Let me put it another way. This is the kind of thing that was going to stop -- specifically under that umbrella, definition, 'draining the swamp.' My sense is that this is going to cause a massive amount of anger and opposition,\" Limbaugh warned.",

                "body": "One of Mexico's top cartel leaders made the public claim that the sitting governor of Michoacan paid him a large sum of money for votes and recently offered more cash for peace. The cartel leader claims that since he turned down the second offer, he is now a target for execution.\n\n\"Why is Silvano doing this? The problem is I am not convenient to him-I know too much,\" said Nicolas \"El Gordo\" Sierra, the top leader of the Los Viagras, a group considered by law enforcement to be the armed wing of La Nueva Familia Michoacana Cartel. In the video released through social media, Sierra claims his reluctance to make a new deal with Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo and the fact that \"he knows too much\" triggered the state government to send police forces to kill him.\n\n\"At the start of your campaign you sent me $1 million pesos to help you with votes,\" Sierra says. \"Twenty days ago, you tried to offer me $10 million pesos to ensure the safety of the state-to hook me into making a commitment to you and if I didn't keep my part, you would send the government against me ... You are mad because I turned down the money.\"\n\nThe accusations come days after the Mexican Army was shamed into arresting one of the chief enforcers for Los Viagras. Mexican soldiers and Michoacan police tracked down Jordy \"El H\" Oseguera aka Jordi Villa Patricio; his capture came six days after Breitbart Texas published a series of exclusive photographs that showed the Oseguera and Mexican soldiers apparently interacting in a friendly fashion. Following the apparent crackdown on Los Viagras, cartel gunmen spent several days torching vehicles throughout the state to pressure authorities into releasing Oseguera.\n\n\"We are puppets of the politicians, we are distractions-that's how they want to keep us,\" Sierra said.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

                "title": "Nolte: Arguments Against Breaking up Facebook Do Not Hold Water",
                "body": "Wednesday afternoon I published a piece explaining why it is time for Facebook to be regulated like a public utility or even as a public utility. Since then, people have made a number of arguments against that idea. Because this is a serious (and fascinating) debate about when a corporation should (or should not) assume a larger civic responsibility, it is worthwhile to address these rebuttals specifically.\n\nThese are pulled directly from the comments on the original piece:\n\nChristian bakers have not vacuumed up a near monopoly on wedding cakes. There are plenty of professionals willing to bake same-sex wedding cakes. Additionally, demanding someone use their labor and artistry to create a same-sex wedding cake is a belligerent act that forces speech from the cake artist, that uses the power of the state to compel a violation of conscience.\n\nThe Christian baker is not silencing or purging the same-sex couple. Rather, the baker is merely refusing to violate his or her own beliefs and sending the same-sex couple down the road to someone who will bake the cake. This is no different than a Muslim caterer referring you to someone who will serve pork chops at your wedding.\n\nNo one is asking Zuckerberg to do anything that violates his conscience. We are merely asking him to allow us to express ourselves freely.\n\nAdditionally, unlike the Christian baker who has not cornered a market, Facebook has monopolized a vital part of the online public square where almost all of the civilized world (two billion users!) communicate with friends and family.\n\nAnd now that Facebook has trapped all of us onto its platform, thus ensuring there is no alternative, Facebook is arbitrarily censoring conservative ideas and speech.\n\nWorse, in some cases, Facebook is violating our right to free assembly by purging us entirely from its public square -- greatly restricting our right to free association and deciding what real news is.\n\nA better question would be, Why is a monopolistic behemoth like Facebook allowed choose its customers, but not a cake shop or florist?\n\nThis is part of the problem, the reason why Facebook should be regulated. As of right now, Facebook so dominates social media, so dominates our ability to spread our ideas and have them shared throughout the country, a real \"alternative\" is impossible.\n\nBasically, if you were to move to an alternative platform, you would be removing yourself from the public square that is Facebook, and as a result your ideas and arguments would be at a major disadvantage.\n\nUnfortunately, like the telephone (Ma Bell) and U.S. Post Office monopolies of 35-years-ago, there is no effective way to replace the power and reach of Facebook with something else.\n\nThink of it this way: if 35 years ago, Ma Bell did what Facebook does now -- took telephones away from those who express certain opinions -- how could you possibly compete on the level playing field of ideas? How could you join the debate, effectively organize, etc?\n\nYou could not.\n\nAnd this is why Facebook needs to become a public utility or be regulated like one, needs to become a place where the only rules governing our speech are the actual laws written by our elected (and accountable) representatives.\n\nA corporation monopolizing one of our primary means of assembly and expression and then imposing arbitrary rules is un-American.\n\nOur government is awful, but at the very least it is our government. I wish there was a better solution than to turn this problem over to government, but it actually is the government's primary responsibility to protect our individual rights. The one place where government does belong is in ensuring we do not lose those rights.\n\nAs of now, Facebook is unaccountableand stripping us of our rights. There is no government regulation protecting our free speech from Zuckerberg's authoritarian whims, and there is no competition because Facebook vacuumed up this space.\n\nWithout any accountability, Zuckerberg is able to not only violate our rights by censoring our speech and even purging us, he is able to possibly affect the outcome of elections by combining those purges with algorithms that control how much a \"favored\" opinion is allowed to spread while stifling \"unflavored\" opinions.\n\nWith all due respect, I find this default \"conservative opinion\" lazy.\n\nThere is nothing conservative (or American) about a corporate monopoly. What makes America America are things like competition and free enterprise, things that are stifled by monopolies.\n\nIn the case of Facebook, it is even worse because we are talking about a monopoly on how we as a society communicate, how we assemble to exchange ideas. With the arbitrary click of a switch, Facebook can remove our ideas and even us from the modern public square. This is intolerable.\n\nA fascist world where a corporation is not only in charge of the public square but goes even further in assuming the role of Decider when it comes to what we can and cannot say -- when it comes to what is and is not approved speech.\n\nThat world is called a Dystopia.\n\nIt is madness and cultural suicide to allow a corporation to control the means by which we communicate and assemble, and to then allow that corporation to control what we say.\n\nFacebook should be regulated like the mail and Ma Bell were 35 years ago, because Facebook is just as vital of a free speech tool as the phone and mail once were.\n\nYes, but nothing is anywhere near as established, powerful, or central as Facebook.\n\nLeaving Facebook, or being purged from Facebook, is like leaving the public square. You are at an immediate disadvantage. You can no longer address the crowd. You have been removed from the primary gathering place where important debates and decisions take place.\n\nHere is another analogy: Facebook is the latest version of the printing press -- the sleekest, fastest, most effective printing press there is. If that printing press company refuses to sell you its product, you and your ideas are in the wilderness.\n\nAnother analogy: Facebook has cornered the market on firearms and only sells to the like-minded, while everyone else scrounges. How safe are your rights in that situation?\n\nWe are talking about two fundamental rights Facebook has captured a huge chunk of -- our right to speak and our right to associate.\n\nAt the very least, the government is accountable to voters. AND there are checks and balances in all three branches of government. This is not a perfect solution, but it is preferable to an unaccountable corporation.\n\nAlso, it is much, much harder for the government to censor its citizens than it is for an unaccountable corporation.\n\n--\n\nI do not call for government regulation of Facebook lightly. But I will not stand idly by as a left-wing Tech Tyrant captures the way in which we communicate and then arbitrarily singles my ideas out for censorship.\n\nYes, maybe we are idiots for handing our fundamental right to speak and assemble over to a Mark Zuckerberg, which in turn gave him the power to shape the outcomes of elections and who governs us. But it is never too late to fight for your rights.",

Flames poured out the windows as firefighters stormed into the five-story building, dumping water on the blaze to get it under control.\n\nFirefighter Michael R. Davidson of Engine Company 69 was assigned to the nozzle on the lead hose-line. He got separated from other firefighters inside the building as conditions deteriorated, fire officials said, and had lost consciousness when he was found. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\n\"It's an awful night,\" Eric Philips, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said in a tweet. \"You haven't heard a scream until you've heard the scream of a mother who's seen her son give his life to protect us.\"\n\nThe cause of the fire was under investigation. The building was home to the former St. Nick's Jazz Pub, a venerable bar that was closed in 2011.\n\nIt was being used to film the adaptation of the Jonathan Lethem novel of the same name. Norton was directing and starring, along with Bruce Willis, Willem Dafoe and Alec Baldwin.\n\nNeighborhood resident Daquan Evans, 28, told the New York Post he saw Norton at the scene, and he looked shaken.\n\n\"That actor Ed Norton walked right by. He looked pretty upset,\" Evans said. \"This is crazy, this fire. You think a movie comes up here and it is good for the neighborhood. Not a fire . . . damn.\"\n\nTwo other firefighters suffered burns and were in serious condition, and three others were injured, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said.\n\n\"Our department and our entire city mourn this tragic loss of a very brave firefighter,\" Nigro said.\n\nProducers sent condolences to the family of the firefighter, according to a statement given to WABC. They said crews immediately called the fire department when they noticed smoke on the set.\n\n\"We watched firsthand with astonishment as they charged into the smoke to make sure all were safely out and then fought to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading, putting their lives on the line as they do every day,\" the statement read.\n\nNeighbors said the movie crew had set up a sign that read \"King Rooster Jazz Club\" about two weeks ago. Cars from the 1950s era lined the street.\n\n\"They started building the set two weeks ago and have been here every day,\" Nathan Monroe-Yavneh, a neighbor, told the Daily News of New York.\n\nDavidson had been a firefighter about 15 years. He leaves behind a wife, Eileen, and four children, three daughters aged 7, 3, and 1, along with a 6-year-old son. He was the son of retired firefighter Robert Davidson.\n\nA Pennsylvania fire department suffered tragedy this week when two firefighters were fatally injured in the partial collapse of a former piano factory in York.",

                "body": "I'm referring, of course, to the case of the blogger Markus Meechan - Count Dankula - who has now been convicted by the Scottish courts of the \"odious criminal act\" of teaching his pug dog to do a Hitler salute. He is facing a possible prison sentence.\n\nThis is appalling. What's almost more appalling, though, are the people I've heard - even clever, savvy people on my side of the argument - who don't seem to get why it's so appalling.\n\nSince when did we get to the stage where free speech needs defending? Where jokes - in however poor taste - suddenly become justification for a prison sentence?\n\nLet me spell it out.\n\nAll that matters is this: in 2018 - the age of Islamic State terror; underage girls groomed and raped by mostly Muslim gangs; Antifa thuggery; epic financial fraud; acid attacks; an epidemic of knife violence; and flagrant assassination attempts by foreign powers - the British justice system (of which Scotland's is regrettably a part) now considers it a priority to employ valuable police, courts, and jail time punishing cheeky young men for winding up their girlfriends.\n\nThat's how it started, remember. Meechan, a straight speaking, shambolically entertaining, libertarian-leaning social media shit-poster decided to wind up his more PC girlfriend by teaching her pug dog how to give a Hitler salute. Then he posted the video on the Internet, where, of course, it went viral.\n\nSure it was tasteless. But then, so was Mel Brook's \"Springtime for Hitler\" routine in The Producers. (Made in 1967, by the way, when there were many, MANY more Holocaust survivors still alive to be offended.) So was the stunt pulled by The Who's Keith Moon and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band's Viv Stanshall when they went out drinking in London's Chelsea dressed as Nazis. So was John Cleese doing his Nazi goosestep in the \"Don't Mention the War\" episode of Fawlty Towers...\n\nThat is, after all, the point of tasteless jokes: they're not in good taste. They push the bounds of acceptability. They taunt social squeamishness. They say the unsayable. And, in doing so, they serve both an entertaining low purpose and an edifying higher one.\n\nThe low purpose is that they provide some people with a cheap, naughty, schoolboy laugh: the peculiar kind of laugh you can only enjoy when you're laughing about something you just know you're really not meant to laugh about.\n\nThe edifying higher purpose is that, whether they intend it or no, stunts like Count Dankula's are an affirmation of perhaps the most valuable commodity in our entire culture: the right to free speech.\n\nWithout free speech, we are little more than slaves. It's what separates the civilized world from theocracies like Iran, dictatorships like North Korea, eunuchcracies like President Bieber's Canada, authoritarian states like China: we can say whatever the hell we like, without fear of punishment. This not only frees us from the fear of having to censor ourselves before we speak, but it also enables us to challenge bad ideas wherever they are aired. Countries that celebrate freedom are more prosperous, happy, and advanced than those that don't.\n\nOh - and as I'll explain in this week's podcast with Brendan O'Neill, and also in the videoed discussion we recorded at Radley College - free speech is free speech. Free speech does not include a clause that begins, \"But...\"\n\nI've heard the \"but...\" line being used quite a lot by people who think that this decision by the Scottish legal system to prosecute Meechan was proportionate and fair and just.\n\nTheir argument seems to depend on the notion that some subjects are out of bounds for humor, that to mention them in a jocular context is no defense.\n\nThis is the only way the prosecution was able to secure their conviction: by stripping Count Dankula's pug joke of its tone and context.\n\nIt will have taken any objective observer all of a few seconds to appreciate that Count Dankula is not a Nazi, but a mickey-taking shit-poster enjoying a bit of banter with like-minded folk on the Internet.\n\nAs Andrew Doyle says at Spiked:\n\nThe case appears to rest on the assumption that Meechan's video was an attempt to incite religious hatred. During the trial, it was described as 'an odious criminal act that was dressed up to look like a joke'. Even if you don't consider the video itself to be funny, surely the concept of attempting to inflame anti-Semitism through the medium of pugs is inherently laughable.\n\nAn important aspect of the prosecution's strategy was outlined by Meechan himself in a statement after the verdict. For the Nazi pug video to be deemed both threatening and offensive, it was essential that the judge disregard the principles of context and intent. In other words, the joke had to be wilfully misunderstood in order to justify the conviction. Accordingly, the prosecutor described the 'inclusion of the dog' as 'an attempt to muddy the waters around [Meechan] making, producing and posting the video. He says that he knows the context of the video, but in a criminal court in Scotland he does not decide the context of anything, the court decides the context.' It's astounding that such a farcical trial could produce such sinister pronouncements.\n\nFarcical and sinister, indeed.\n\nBut what's perhaps most extraordinary about this case is that, outside libertarian, conservatarian, and anarcho-capitalist spheres, it has caused remarkably little public outrage.\n\nTwo comics - Ricky Gervais and David Baddiel - have spoken out:\n\nA man has been convicted in a UK court of making a joke that was deemed \"grossly offensive\". If you don't believe in a person's right to say things that you might find \"grossly offensive\", then you don't believe in Freedom of Speech.\n\n-- Ricky Gervais (@rickygervais) March 20, 2018\n\nI am that stupid, Karen.

                "body": "As forces in Britain declare tackling so-called hate crime a \"priority\", the police watchdog has released a report revealing officers are taking days to respond to emergency calls.\n\nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) asserted that \"the system is under severe strain and in some forces the cracks are showing\" in its annual review of policing in England and Wales, which found that there were \"considerable delays\" in response to 999 calls for assistance in two forces.\n\nVulnerable people are being put \"at risk\" by the lack of timely response from some forces, according to the report, which disclosed that between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of reports requiring police to send a unit within 24 hours missed the target in one region.\n\nThough HMICFRS emphasised most forces were managing to keep the public safe at a time when officers are under \"significant stress\" from rising crime and reduced budgets, the watchdog noted that \"too often\", victims were not getting a prompt response.\n\nUK: Huge Rise in Knifepoint Rapes, Fatal Stabbings While Police Focus on 'Hate Crime' https://t.co/94QbsNMvXR\n\n-- Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 9, 2018\n\nWith thousands of 999 calls assessed as requiring action within an hour, police took hours, or in some instances several days, to respond.\n\nIn the case of Cambridgeshire, inspectors found that officers took 15 hours on average to respond to 999 calls from the public.\n\nHM Inspector Zoe Billingham said: \"About a quarter of forces are all too often overwhelmed by the demand they face, resulting in worrying backlogs of emergency jobs.\n\n\"We can see people waiting a long, long time for that 999 response and our concern here, in particular, is where there are vulnerable victims in that backlog.\"\n\nPolice Scotland Create 'Hate Crime Files' on over 900 Young Teens in One Year https://t.co/j4FjmLuOHD\n\n-- Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2018\n\nOther problems highlighted by the review include that, with a large number of crimes being simply \"written off\", victims are being denied the service they are entitled to, while police were failing in some cases at basic tasks such as checking CCTV at crime scenes or neglecting to carry out house-to-house inquiries to look for witnesses.\n\nWith more than 60,000 \"wanted records\" on the national police database, including 374 relating to homicide and more than a thousand to rape, forces were found to be failing to track suspects and identify their whereabouts, according to the inspectorate.\n\nThere was also concern in the report over forces failing to carry out background checks with national intelligence records when arresting people from abroad.\n\nWhile HMICFRS pointed to funding having fallen by a fifth since 2010 as a big contributor to the increased stress on police, critics have suggested their reduced resources are not being wisely deployed with forces embarking on high profile campaigns to \"raise awareness\" of so-called hate crime.\n\nLondon's Met Police Won't Investigate Minor Crime, Only 'Hate Crime' https://t.co/EFdGOslNUp\n\n-- Raheem ἟a἟8 (@RaheemKassam) January 2, 2018\n\nWhile the number of arrests has seen a dramatic fall in recent years, despite large increases in recorded crime, arrests over \"hateful\" comments posted online have risen as much as 877 per cent in some parts of England, as the Metropolitan Police boasts of having more than 900 specialist \"hate crime\" investigators.\n\nWith dedicated \"hate crime coordinators\", forces across the country have officers touring mosques, colleges, schools, and community centres urging people to report any perceived slights to their \"identity\" following the government's 2016 release of an 'action plan' in which 'success' is defined as maximising the number of 'hate' complaints.\n\nPolice dedication to driving up the number of so-called hate crime reports is such that three forces in the northwest of England recently held a weeklong campaign out of concern that officers \"see a reduction in reports of hate crime at this time of year\".",

                "body": "On Thursday, the Rome-based Sovereign Order of Malta, which reports directly to the Holy See, suspended historian Henry Sire after he was revealed to be the author of the bestselling book The Dictator Pope: The Inside Story of the Francis Papacy, a critical examination of the pontificate of Pope Francis.\n\nMeanwhile the Vatican has hired the international law firm of Baker McKenzie to force a small Spanish website called InfoVaticana.com to close its doors, allegedly for its sometimes critical tone toward aspects of the Francis papacy. The firm recently threatened a lawsuit if Infovaticana isn't shut down and \"its internet domain transferred to the Vatican.\"\n\nThe Order of Malta announced its decision Wednesday to suspend the British historian Henry Sire, a member of the order, calling his book a \"vile attack\" on Pope Francis.\n\n\"Following the press articles reporting the name of the author of the book 'The Dictator Pope' the Grand Magistry of the Order of Malta has taken the decision to suspend Henry Sire, author of the book and member of the Order of Malta. The provisional suspension from membership has immediate effect and an investigation is being launched,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIn January, 2017, the Vatican took control of the Knights of Malta after ousting its Grand Master Matthew Festing for his \"defiance of papal authority.\" The pope asked Festing to resign following a dispute over sovereignty with the Vatican, replacing him with papal delegate Archbishop Angelo Becciu as interim leader of the order.\n\nUnder the pen name Marcantonio Colonna, Sire published The Dictator Pope electronically in November of 2017, first in Italian and then in English, after spending a four-year residence with the Knights of Malta in Rome from 2013 to 2017, during which time he conducted his research for the book. Only on Monday did Sire acknowledge that he was the author of the book.\n\nIn it, Sire portrayed Francis as an authoritarian leader who does not brook opposition or criticism. Contrary to his public persona as a jovial man of the people, Sire wrote that Francis has turned out to be \"a papal tyrant the like of whom has not been seen for many centuries\" and under his administration, \"the Vatican is systematically silencing, eliminating and replacing critics of the Pope's views.\"\n\n\"When the publicity cameras are off him, Pope Francis turns into a different figure: arrogant, dismissive of people, prodigal of bad language and notorious for furious outbursts of temper which are known to everyone from the cardinals to the chauffeurs,\" he declared.\n\nUnfortunately for the Vatican, the immediate suspension of Sire from the Order of Malta will play as a confirmation of the author's allegations that under Francis the Holy See deals swiftly and ruthlessly to eliminate those it views as enemies.\n\nAttacks on Infovaticana.org have seemed to follow a similar pattern.\n\nAs the Associated Press (AP) reported, many commercial websites use the Vatican name, and yet the only one that has come under fire from the Holy See has been infovaticana, which would seem to confirm statements by the website's founder, Gabriel Ariza, that the Vatican is deliberately targeting his site because of disagreement with its content. Ariza has called the Vatican's measures a \"political witchhunt.\"\n\nVatican spokesman Greg Burke has denied these allegations, saying that the dispute with Infovaticana \"is not a matter of ideology or freedom of expression, but one of officialdom.\"\n\nOther sites and outlets that have \"Vatican\" in their name include Vatican.com, a news portal and travel site; the Vatican Insider, a religion site with its pages published by the Italian daily La Stampa; and Inside the Vatican, a monthly magazine that publishes both print and digital editions.\n\nNone of these other sites have been asked to change their names, charged with copyright infringement, or threatened with lawsuits, which makes the case of Infovaticana.com something of an anomaly.\n\nAccording to AP, some people within the church have been angered by \"content opposing abortion, same-sex marriages and adoptions by gays and lesbians,\" which, on the other hand, tends to square with official Catholic teaching on these matters.\n\nSpain's trademark office ruled last year that Infovaticana had infringed copyright by featuring the gold and white colors of the Vatican flag and the crossed keys of St. Peter in its masthead, after which the website removed these symbols.\n\nNow the Holy See has turned its attention to the name of the website.\n\nAriza said that the Vatican's law firm has rejected all efforts to reach an amicable agreement, noting that \"we have already taken down previous logos and other vestiges that can relate us to the Vatican, but they just want to shut us down.\"\n\nBreitbart News has obtained a copy of one of the letters sent by Baker McKenzie, which, on behalf of the Holy See, insists that the owners of the portal \"immediately transfer the domain name of www.infovaticana.com to the Secretary of State (or to whomever they designate).\"\n\nIf this does not happen, the letter warns, the Vatican is prepared to exercise \"all the legal actions at its disposal\" to stop the use of the name and to obtain \"the due indemnification for damages suffered and legal costs incurred.\"\n\nOn its own website, Baker McKenzie has announced \"record global revenues of $2.67 billion\" for its most recent fiscal year.\n\nThis past February, Pope Francis explained his approach to dealing with opposition and criticism.\n\n\"I cannot deny that these resistances exist. I see them and I know them,\" the pope said. \"There are doctrinal resistances. For my mental health I do not read the websites of this so-called 'resistance.' I know who they are, I know the groups, but I do not read them, simply for my mental health. When there is something very serious, people inform me so that I know. It is displeasing, but we must move on.\"\n\nThe pope said that his response to opposition depends on the good faith he perceives in those who are opposing him.\n\n\"When I perceive opposition, I try to dialogue, when dialogue is possible; but some resistance comes from people who believe they have the true doctrine and accuse you of being a heretic,\" he said.\n\n\"When I do not find spiritual goodness in these people, because of what they say or write, I simply pray for them. It pains me, but I don't dwell on it, for the sake of my mental health.\"",

It has been five months since he confirmed he would not pursue election as governor of California in 2018. In that announcement, he explained his decision, in part, by stating that his family and the city he was passionate about, were both in Los Angeles.\n\nGarcetti has been a staunch defender of sanctuary city policies and has expressed particular defiance against President Donald Trump and his administration's policies.\n\nThe Los Angeles mayor may, however, face trouble when it comes to his city's failure to effectively deal with its homeless crisis.",

                "title": "Blue State Blues: Republicans Are at Bat, but Democrats Score the Runs | Breitbart",
                "body": "It happened again. Congress let a funding debate come down to the last minute. And once again, Democrats won.\n\nThe new omnibus spending bill is a wretched monument to the Swamp, a time capsule of government waste and broken promises that future generations will unearth when they want to understand how they were saddled with mountains of debt they have no hope of repaying.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) gloated Wednesday evening that the bill does not fund the border wall -- only \"fencing that was already authorized under current law.\"\n\nYes, there are a few good things, like expanded defense spending and the Taylor Force Act to defund Palestinian terrorism. But it virtually guarantees a return to trillion-dollar deficits. It also funds Planned Parenthood and even makes concessions on gun control.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) seems to be the only one who is actually reading the bill, and is tweeting its craziest provisions -- such as $10 million for disadvantaged Egyptian students (my favorite).\n\nNick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, pushed back against the idea that Republicans had failed despite controlling all of the branches of the federal government. He argued that since Republicans only hold 51 seats, nine short of the 60 needed to break a filibuster under Senate rules, the GOP really co-governs with the Democratic Party and must therefore obtain the opposition's assent to pass most legislation.\n\nTechnically, that is true. But it is also absurd.\n\nBy that standard, Republicans have not \"controlled\" the Senate for nearly a century. (The last time Republicans enjoyed a filibuster-proof majority was in the 67th Congress, from 1921-23; Democrats last held that power in 2009-10, and also held it several times in the 1930s and postwar era.)\n\nMulvaney suggested that the only way for Republicans to achieve what they want is to change the rules of the Senate -- something that President Donald Trump wants to do, but which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will not, and for good reason: Democrats would eagerly abuse that power at the first chance. Alternatively, Republicans could win 60 Senate seats at the polls -- not impossible, but looking harder than it did a year ago.\n\nAll of that misses the point. Republicans do not need total control of the Senate to achieve better outcomes in budget negotiations. They simply need backbone, and stronger leadership. The simple reason that Republicans capitulate to most Democratic demands on spending is that Republicans are still afraid that they will be blamed by the mainstream media for any government shutdown that results from the failure to reach an agreement in time.\n\nRepublicans continue to believe that, even though Democrats bore the brunt of the blame for the last shutdown, earlier this year. Perhaps that is why Democrats did not insist on protection for the so-called \"Dreamers\" in the omnibus spending bill, despite heavy pressure from amnesty groups and the party's progressive base. But at least Democrats went to the wall for a core constituency. Republicans will not defend even their most basic promises.\n\nNo one expects Republicans to get everything they want. But the point of having the majority in both houses is being able to get most of what they want. Mulvaney and Republican leaders in Congress describe the agreements they reach as the only possible deals under the circumstances. But in fact there are other deals that Democrats might also accept -- deals more favorable to Republican priorities -- if the governing party properly used its leverage.\n\nHere is how it ought to be done -- and how it is actually done, when Democrats are in power. 1. Pass a budget in the House that represents a general consensus within the ruling party. 2. Take that budget to the Senate and dare the minority party to filibuster. 3. Let the government shut down, and blame the opposition. 4. Wait for the minority party to fold, or make a token concession to the opposition that allows it to save face, and re-open the government.\n\nSomehow Republicans seem unwilling, or unable, to govern. Yes, they passed more defense spending -- one of the only compromises Democrats allowed. But they failed to fund the wall, a core promise from 2016. They also failed to cut federal spending and move toward a balanced budget, as promised in every election since 2010.\n\nAs a result, the Republicans are losing the confidence of their own voters. Nothing Democrats could do is as damaging as that.",

President Dalia Grybauskaite of former Soviet state Lithuania said she was considering expelling Russian diplomats in the wake of the March 4 attack.\n\nWhite House Stands with United Kingdom; Blames Russia for Attack on Former Spy https://t.co/FGjTUCv7Gu\n\n-- Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 15, 2018\n\nRutte said over the coming days or weeks, \"we and our partners must see what the logical next steps are.\"\n\nHe insisted that any measure \"must have an added value to this extremely strong political declaration.\"\n\nThe unanimity was a victory for May. She had been striving at a summit in Brussels to persuade her EU colleagues to unite in condemning Moscow over the attack on Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter, Yulia.\n\nRussia strongly denies responsibility and has slammed Britain's investigation.\n\nDuring a summit dinner, May laid out the reasons Britain is convinced Moscow was behind the attack, including the type of poison used -- a Soviet-developed nerve agent known as Novichok -- and intelligence that Russia has produced it within the last decade.\n\nBritain argues the attack is part of a pattern of behavior by an increasingly assertive Russia whose muscle-flexing, cyber-meddling and law-breaking on foreign soil pose a threat to the international rule of law.\n\nMay said Thursday that \"it is clear that the Russian threat doesn't respect borders.\" She said \"the incident in Salisbury was part of a pattern of Russian aggression against Europe and its near neighbors, from the western Balkans to the Middle East.\"\n\nBut European politicians and leaders varied in how far they were willing to go in blaming the Kremlin.\n\nRussia President Vladimir Putin's office said Thursday that Greek leader Alexis Tsipras had called Putin to congratulate him on his re-election and discuss issues, including the Salisbury poisoning.\n\nBritain and Russia have expelled 23 of each other's diplomats in a dispute showing no sign of easing.\n\nRussia's ambassador to the U.K., Alexander Yakovenko, accused the U.K. Thursday of having a \"bad record of violating international law and misleading the international community.\"\n\n\"History shows that British statements must be verified,\" he told reporters in London, demanding \"full transparency of the investigation and full cooperation with Russia\" and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.",

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is at 21%, according to the analysis\n\nAt least two of the primary polls (RABA, Politico/Morning Consult) had Oprah Winfrey as one of the potential candidates, and Biden finished ahead of Winfrey and the other Democrats in those polls. CNN, which acknowledged that it is \"entirely unreasonable\" to forecast a winner this early, also pointed out that Biden is even currently leading in New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary after the Iowa caucuses. A February University of New Hampshire survey found Biden defeating Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), both of whom are from the region, by double digits.\n\nBiden, whose advisers are reportedly planning a 2020 run, and Trump got into a war of words this week after Biden said he would take Trump behind the \"gym and beat the hell out of him\" if they were in high school and Trump made lewd remarks about women. Trump responded on Thursday by tweeting Biden is \"trying to act like a tough guy\" and \"would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.\"\n\nCrazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018\n\nAccording to CNN, \"Biden versus Trump is probably the highest probability matchup compared to all the others at this moment in time, though it's still a relative long-shot.\"\n\nBiden's first presidential run was derailed by a plagiarism scandal, and the former vice president will face much more scrutiny after the publication of Breitbart News Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer's blockbuster new book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.\n\nIn the book, the esteemed Clinton Cash and Throw Them All Out author reveals that Biden's son Hunter's investment firm signed a $1.5 billion deal with the Chinese government just 10 days after Joe and Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two in 2013.\n\nSchweizer told Breitbart News Tonight on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125 this week that the \"Chinese government has figured out that the way to get favorable treatment from policymakers in Washington, DC, is by, basically, signing sweetheart deals with the children of politicians because they think by doing so, they'll get better policy positions from our government, and the history indicates in the Obama administration that that's exactly what happens.\"\n\n\"Here's the thing people have to keep in mind: Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from the Chinese government,\" Schweizer added. \"He has no background in private equity. He was a lobbyist before his father became vice president for the casino industry. He has no background. He has no business getting a deal like this. He got this deal, pure and simple, because he is the son of a vice president, and the Chinese said, 'We give him this deal, and his pal, who's a former aide to John Kerry, they're going to run it, and by doing so, we are going to curry favor with these guys,' and you know what? Based on the track record, based on the response of the Obama administration of Secretary of State John Kerry and of Vice President Biden, that's exactly what they got. They got good action for their money.\"",

                "body": "The 2018 omnibus budget includes language barring any spending on President Donald Trump's concrete-and-metal border walls, but it does fund 33 miles of extra front-line fencing. The GOP and Democratic leaders directed the extra fencing be placed in the Rio Grande area of the border, leaving cheap-labor migrants with easy passage through hundreds of miles of unrestricted border, especially if they apply for asylum.\n\nDemocratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi taunted Trump during the House debate on the bill on March 22, saying:\n\nHe has said in one of his tweets this morning how happy he was because he got the $1.6 billion to start the wall and more to come. That's not completely true, Mr. President. There's some resources for fencing and repairs and the rest there. But some of that money is for technology and other ways to protect our borders. We all have a responsibility to protect our borders, north and south, but if you want to think that you're getting a wall, you just think it and sign the bill.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said the budget deal is only for six months, suggesting that Congress will approve another budget by the required October deadline, just before the November election. He said March 22:\n\nThis bill has funding that lasts for six months. Six months. And we're putting the administration's full request for the border and for border security and the wall in here for the next six months -- a one year's worth of requests in six months.\n\nHowever, \"not a single appropriations bill has been enacted on time since 2009,\" according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nAlso, the election is due in November, so Senate Democrats are very unlikely to approve wall funds in the 2019 budget by the October 1 deadline, especially because they successfully delayed the 2018 budget from October 2017 to March 2018 and also struck out all 2018 wall funding. Democrats -- aided by business-first Republicans -- also blocked wall funding in the May 2017 omnibus.\n\nRyan claimed that Congress followed requests from the Border patrol -- not the White House -- and is funding more new barriers that Trump asked for, and he described the additional fences as \"walls\":\n\nThis actually has more wall funding and more wall allotment than the administration's request had. So we even do more in this bill than what the President's budget asked us to do. So we're going to be getting a downpayment and starting on the border security -- and by the way, border security means a lot of things. It means a wall, it means a levee, it means see-through [fence], it means resources. It's a very diverse border. What we do is we listen to the Border Patrol; What do you need? where do you need it? And we listen to them tell us, based on conditions on the ground, 'These are the physical barrier structures that are necessary.' That's what we're funding here and we're getting a good head start on it.\n\nIn Ryan's opening remarks, however, he downplayed the importance of border security, saying \"the fundamental question is whether we're going to preserve the primacy of the American military.\"\n\nRyan's budget bill increased Pentagon funding by $78 billion, but only provided $641 million -- or five cents of every $100 -- for border fencing.\n\nMarc Short, the White House's chief outreach aide to Congress, echoed Ryan's six-month excuse in his appearance on MSNBC, saying \"the $1.6 billion is what we asked for, and keep in mind, Hallie, it is for six months.\"\n\nLike Ryan, Short also argued that the fence is a wall, and the mandated fencing has been approved by the border patrol.\n\nShort -- who worked as a top deputy and never-Trump aide for the pro-migration Koch brothers -- also said the federal government could not have spent additional funds efficiently in six months, even though agencies normally have up to five years to spend any money appropriated for construction.\n\nShort said Congress approved more miles of fencing than expected, even though at least 14 miles of fencing will be a second layer of fencing in a secure zone near San Diego.\n\nShort said:\n\nIn many cases, the wall that they are actually putting down, that they are actually providing funding for, is the wall that is CBP has asked for in many places. Additionally, it is $1.6 billion for the next six months. That is what we believe that we can financially do in a sustainable manner. More funding than that in the next six months would not have been able to be completed, so it is what we asked for.\n\nAdditionally, we ended up getting more miles in new construction than was in our initial plan ... there are naturally compromises that you need to make when you are working with Democrats ... you need 60 votes in the U.S. Senate.\n\nDid @POTUS get rolled on immigration in the new $.1.3T omnibus spending bill? @Marcshort45 tells me that although \"there are strings attached\" to the border wall piece, \"it is $1.6 billion for the next 6 months... so it is what we asked for\"\n\nhttps://t.co/06jLg53fXa\n\n-- Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) March 22, 2018\n\nDemocrats and business-first Republicans go to great lengths to protect the supply of cheap migrant labor.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.\n\nBut the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on Congress and a $1.3 trillion government spending bill (all times local):\n\nCongress has approved a $1.3 trillion measure bestowing hefty increases on military and domestic programs. It gives President Donald Trump just a nibble of the money he's wanted to build his wall with Mexico.\n\nThe Senate gave final passage to the bipartisan legislation by 65-32 early Friday. The House approved it 256-167 hours earlier.\n\nTrump is expected to sign the bill before Saturday. That would avert what would be a third government shutdown this election year, which would embarrass Republicans controlling the White House and Congress.\n\nTrump initially promised Mexico would pay to construct his \"big, beautiful wall.\" That country has refused, and Trump has sought $25 billion for the project and other border security efforts.\n\nA $1.3 trillion spending bill has cleared a crucial hurdle in the Senate. That vote has cleared the way for final passage of the measure, which would provide big spending boosts to defense and domestic programs.\n\nThe House approved the legislation Thursday afternoon. After hours of delays, the Senate voted 67-30 to topple procedural hurdles to passage -- seven votes more than the 60 that were needed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation.\n\nHad Congress not approved the bill by midnight Friday night, there would have been a government shutdown for the third time this election year. That would have been an embarrassment to Republicans, who control the White House and Congress.\n\nA fresh obstacle -- whether to rename a national forest in Idaho -- has been tossed in front of the mammoth spending bill Congress is trying to finish.\n\nIdaho Republican Sen. James Risch has objected to a provision in the 2,232-page bill that would rename a forest in his home state for Cecil Andrus. Andrus was a four-term Democratic governor who died last year.\n\nAides and lawmakers from both parties say Risch is delaying Senate approval of the $1.3 trillion spending bill unless the forest isn't renamed.\n\nIn response, the Senate passed language halting the renaming effort. That provision would require passage by the House, which has left town for a recess.\n\nSenate leaders are talking to Risch, hoping to resolve the issue and free the spending bill.\n\nA budget bill passed by the House does not include money for work to develop and build a nuclear waste dump outside Las Vegas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has proposed reviving a long-stalled nuclear waste repository at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, 100 miles from Las Vegas. The state's Republican governor and Nevada lawmakers from both parties oppose the plan.\n\nRepublican Sen. Dean Heller, who faces a tough re-election this fall, pushed to exclude funding for Yucca from the massive spending bill, as did Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.\n\nA spokesman for Cortez Masto says she was pleased that Congress \"has recognized this boondoggle for what it is.\" Spokesman Ryan King adds that Cortez Masto \"will continue to fight like hell to make sure any efforts to revive Yucca Mountain in Congress are blocked.\"\n\nThe House has easily approved a bipartisan $1.3 trillion measure handing huge spending increases to defense programs and domestic initiatives ranging from road-building to biomedical research.\n\nThursday's vote was 256-167. That shipped the 2,232-page package to the Senate.\n\nPassage there is assured. But some Republican senators upset that the measure spends too much could delay the bill. The question is whether it will be approved before midnight Friday night.\n\nIf it isn't, that would force the year's third government shutdown. That would likely be brief, but still embarrass Republicans controlling the White House and Congress.\n\nThe bill provides just $1.6 billion to start building pieces of President Donald Trump's wall with Mexico and for other border security steps. But it doesn't temporarily extend protections against deportation for young Dreamer immigrants.\n\nThe White House says President Donald Trump will sign a $1.3 trillion budget bill that boosts military spending, but does not include all the funding he sought for his promised border wall.\n\nWhite House officials say the plan includes key administration priorities, particularly defense spending. They argue they could not get everything they want because Democratic votes are needed in the closely divided Senate.\n\nBudget Director Mick Mulvaney said the bill was not perfect, but \"that's not how the process works.\"\n\nHe noted the deal includes at least some money for new construction along the border.\n\nTrump sounded less than enthused by the bill Wednesday night. He tweeted: \"Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.\"\n\nA sweeping $1.3 trillion budget bill that substantially boosts military and domestic spending but leaves behind young immigrant \"Dreamers\" has cleared a procedural hurdle.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House narrowly approved a measure allowing the bill to go forward as lawmakers struggle to meet a Friday night deadline to fund the government or face a federal shutdown.\n\nThe bill negotiated by congressional leaders deprives President Donald Trump some of his border wall money and takes only incremental steps to address gun violence.\n\nAlthough some conservative Republicans balked at the size of the spending increases and the rush to pass the bill, the White House says the president backs the legislation.\n\nThe 2,232-page text was made public Wednesday night. Democrats say lawmakers had little time to read the bill before voting.\n\nCongressional leaders hope to start voting as soon as Thursday on a sweeping $1.3 trillion budget bill that substantially boosts military and domestic spending.\n\nA stopgap measure may be needed to ensure federal offices aren't hit with a partial shutdown at midnight Friday when funding for the government expires.\n\nThe bill keeps the government operating but leaves behind young immigrant \"Dreamers,\" deprives President Donald Trump some of his border wall money and takes only incremental steps to address gun violence.\n\nThe White House says Trump backs the legislation, even as some conservative Republicans balk at the size of the spending increases and the rush to pass the bill.\n\nTalks continued into Wednesday evening before the 2,232-page text was released. House Speaker Paul Ryan says no bill that big is perfect.",

Up to $500,000,000 of funds appropriated by this Act for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency in ''Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide'' may be used to provide assistance to the Government of Jordan to support the armed forces of Jordan and to enhance security along its borders.\n\nOn page 375, the omnibus says:\n\nFor the ''Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Train and Equip Fund'', $1,769,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2019 ...\n\nThat these funds may be used in such amounts as the Secretary of Defense may determine to enhance the border security of nations adjacent to conflict areas including Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Tunisia resulting from actions of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria:\n\nThe U.S.-funded, $500 million, 274-mile Jordan-Iraq border wall was described by Vice.com, in a 2016 article titled \"The Great Wall of Jordan: How the US Wants to Keep the Islamic State Out\";\n\nThe wall, which began as a $20 million project in 2008 to erect a set of surveillance towers along a 30-mile (50 km) stretch of the border with Syria, has since expanded into a program costing half a billion dollars, according to defense officials who spoke to VICE News. Called the Jordan Border Security Program or JBSP, the wall is ostensibly meant to stop weapons of mass destruction from getting out, but since 2013 has refocused on detecting Islamic State fighters and arms smuggling, as well as refugees, on both sides of the border ...\n\nThe first phase of the JBSP, the erection of the towers, was completed in September 2009. Phase 1B, the beginning of the fence, was completed in March 2014. Phases 2 and 3, the building of a fully integrated and networked fence running along a 275-mile(442 km) stretch of Jordan's borders with Syria and Iraq and costing some $300 million, are scheduled to be fully operational this year. Further phases will extend the fence along the entire border and improve surveillance and detection gear. Mobile surveillance stations and quick reaction forces will be stationed at vulnerable points or emerging hot spots.\n\nIt's all paid for by the United States taxpayer.\n\nA Pentagon video explains the project, saying the border defense is 552 kilometers.\n\n\"Our team has delivered on that model supporting [U.S. government] DTRA border security contracts across the world in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and in Jordan.\n\n\"In total, the systems we have installed protect 4,500 miles of borders.\"\n\nThe Jordan wall is designed to block the movement of jihadis -- but the U.S. border wall is being designed by Republicans and Democrats is designed to leave large holes for migrants to move into U.S. jobs and into Democrat-run cities, where they force down wages earned by blue-collar Americans and paid by local businesses.\n\nFor example, the 2018 omnibus bill only extended the border fence by a mere 33 miles, even though Trump's deputies have developed a plan to close up 700 miles of open border.\n\nThe omnibus bill also reduced the number of detention beds kept to hold migrants prior to their asylum and deportation court hearings. Agency officials want additional beds because they are required to release migrants whenever the flood of migrants exceeds the detection capacity. Once released, the migrants move into Democratic-run \"sanctuary cities\" or to GOP-affiliated cheap-labor employers in the agriculture and food industries.\n\nThe 2018 omnibus bill also denies Trump's request for explicit authority to deny federal grants to cities who shield their large population of low-wage migrant workers from federal enforcement agencies.\n\nPage 376 of terrible, rotten, no-good budget busting bill:\n\nI found it! I found it! Border security, what President Trump wanted!\n\nno . . .wait a minute section says Defense can spend what funds it determines to enhance the border security of Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Tunisia\n\n-- Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 22, 2018\n\nDemocrats and business-first Republicans go to great lengths to protect the supply of cheap migrant labor.\n\nIn New York, for example, the city's government has declared itself a sanctuary city partly because upper-income residents and business groups are heavily dependent on the cheap labor supplied by a large percentage of the 500,000 illegal immigrants who live in the city. The huge labor force of illegals in New York has successfully kept food-industry wages extremely low, according to 2017 state data, despite the high cost of living in the city.\n\nNationwide, according to a February 2017 report by the Washington Post:\n\n\"In major cities, you're talking about a restaurant workforce that is maybe 75 percent foreign-born, and maybe 30 to 40 percent undocumented,\" said Saru Jayaraman, a labor activist and the founder of the worker group Restaurant Opportunities Center United. \"The restaurant industry in major cities would absolutely collapse without immigrants.\"\n\nNational Public Radio reported:\n\nTim Zagat, founder and CEO of the Zagat Survey, says that immigrant labor, legal and otherwise, is nothing short of vital to the inner workings of most New York City restaurants.\n\nMr. TIM ZAGAT (Founder and CEO, Zagat): I go into the backs of restaurants all the time. In most restaurants, and I'm talking about the better restaurants, there may be one European and everybody else is from South and Central America.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown defended his state's opposition to immigration enforcement, saying March 7 that enforcement agencies are \"going after men, women, and children -- some who have worked 10 or 20 years picking our food, washing our dishes, building houses.\"\n\nIn February, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf warned a local business association that enforcement agencies were planning to pick up numerous law-breaking migrants in the city. The businesses in the association include numerous restaurants and catering companies:\n\nThe inflow of cheap labor excludes lower-skilled Americans from jobs. In Chicago, for example, a federal investigation showed hundreds of illegals working at a bakery. Once the illegals were excluded, the bakery's management had to raise wages to attract American workers, including hundred of African-Americans.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.\n\nBut the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.",

We [love] supporting women in politics,\" read the initial caption on Salon Spa W's Facebook post.\n\nBut hundreds of social media users slammed the salon for styling and promoting the White House adviser on their Facebook page and threatened to take their business elsewhere.\n\n\"I prefer my \"women in politics\" to be both, a) elected, and b) principled. Salon Spa W, you've definitely lost my business with this cheap publicity ploy,\" one Facebook user wrote.\n\n\"You will never get my business based on this one post,\" another woman wrote, prompting many users to give her comment a \"thumbs up\" in agreement with her statement.\n\n\"I love all the wonderful things Salon W does for our community so it's such a bummer to see this post as a business brag. Only problem with supporting women in politics is when those women support decisions that weaken and disenfranchise other women,\" another Facebook user chimed in.\n\nAfter the salon received an outpouring of negative comments, Salon Spa W President China Wong issued a statement responding to the comments added to the photo's caption:\n\nIn response:\n\nWe believe everyone matters and deserves our indiscriminate care and kindness.\n\nWe were taken aback by the response to the image below of our Governor with Ivanka Trump who received services from our salon. We also recognize impact matters more than intent. While we are not a partisan organization we do see it as part of our mission to welcome people to Des Moines and serve everyone. We share images of our clients, some that are recognizable public figures, to showcase our work.\n\nWe are honored to serve clients from all walks of life. Our East Village location, with proximity to the State Capitol and Civic Center, provides a unique opportunity to serve musicians, actors, Broadway stars, presidents-elect (including Barack Obama), those in town for the Iowa Caucuses, lawmakers, activists, commentators, and artists of every medium -- we have shared images of many along the way.\n\nWe also serve you -- our beautiful, diverse, and passionate community. We proudly share our work and celebrate all of you because our purpose is making people look and feel beautiful.\n\nAgain, we believe everyone matters and deserves our indiscriminate care and kindness.\n\nChina Wong\n\nPresident, Salon Spa W\n\nAfter Wong issued her response, many Facebook users expressed support, telling Wong that they would gladly bring her salon business if they ever traveled to the Des Moines area.\n\n\"If I lived in Iowa, you'd have my business! The ones that are giving you a hard time aren't dedicated to you anyway ... your business will survive without them! They're just a bunch of childish bullies!\" one woman from Tennessee wrote.",

                "title": "'Antithesis of American Interests:' Immigration Reformers Blast GOP Omnibus as 'Betrayal' to U.S. Workers | Breitbart",
                "body": "Reformers -- who have been allies of President Trump for his efforts to reduce illegal and legal immigration levels -- are blasting Ryan's GOP spending bill, which has already passed the House.\n\nNearly halfway into the fiscal year, Congress has already passed five stopgap spending bills to fund the federal government, punctuated by two brief government shutdowns. This intolerable situation should have ended this week with the passage of a clean omnibus spending bill and a commitment by Congress that they would address other pressing issues, including immigration, later through regular order. Congressional leadership and the business lobby had other plans, however, as the omnibus released last night leaves our nation's security at risk and sets up a betrayal of the most vulnerable American workers who have seen their jobs and wages decimated by bad immigration policies. [Emphasis added]\n\nThis omnibus was an appropriate vehicle to provide full funding for the construction of a border wall - an essential tool for regaining control of our borders and stopping illegal immigration, drug smuggling, and terrorism. Instead, it contains a paltry $1.6 billion for repairs, drones, and pedestrian fencing - no wall construction. Even worse, the measure explicitly restricts funding for any of President Trump's border wall prototypes, only allowing spending for designs deployed before the prototypes were constructed. If Congressional leadership told the president he was getting money for his signature campaign promise, he was lied to. [Emphasis added]\n\nAnd while adequate funding for the wall was not included, powerful business interests are inappropriately using the must-pass spending bill to expand their access to cheap foreign labor. Congressional leadership included a provision in the omnibus that allows the Department of Homeland Security to double the number of H-2B visas available in the current fiscal year. Opening the door for a significant increase in guest workers is not only unwarranted, but harmful to the interests of American workers. Moreover, this controversial provision has no place in a spending bill and should instead be debated openly along with other unsettled immigration matters after the government is funded. [Emphasis added]\n\nIt was also troubling to see the White House push for the inclusion of a DACA 'fix' in the spending bill, especially after Democrats backed away from previous demands to do so. The deal that was pushed by the White House and rejected by Democrats would have traded border wall funding for an extension of the DACA program. [Emphasis added]\n\nAny action to resolve status for DACA beneficiaries before long-promised comprehensive enforcement provisions and legal immigration reforms are fully implemented is merely a crude attempt to deceive the American people. We know from long and bitter experience that enforcement promises will not be kept. Worse yet, amnesty will lead to a new and even greater wave of illegal immigration. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe bottom line is this: there are no immigration-related provisions in the omnibus that are consistent with what President Trump and congressional Republicans told the American people they would do when they were sent to Washington. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe spending bill:\n\nCenter for Immigration Studies Director Mark Krikorian -- a group that also represents Americans in the immigration debate -- called the spending bill the \"catch-and-release immigration budget\" because the legislation only funds about 40,000 beds in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers.\n\nThis provision will force federal immigration officials to continue releasing illegal aliens into the public, as they do not have the resources or space to detain them.\n\nIn other words, this is the catch-and-release immigration budget. https://t.co/Zm7G3BMcyQ\n\n-- Mark Krikorian (@MarkSKrikorian) March 22, 2018\n\nTrump's populist immigration agenda, wherein he has called on the Republican-controlled Congress to reduce overall immigration levels to raise the wages of American workers, has largely fallen on deaf ears in the GOP leadership.\n\nDespite immigration being the most important issue to Republican voters in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections, Republican lawmakers have refused to take up the issue, as Trump has. Instead, the Republican leadership is planning to tout their tax reform legislation as their biggest achievement, though half of swing voters say the tax cuts will have \"no impact\" on their vote in the midterms.",

                "body": "President Trump's populist pro-American immigration reform agenda is more important to swing voters in the 2018 midterms than the issue of taxes and the Republicans' tax cut plan.\n\nAccording to a new Quinnipiac Poll, swing voters in the 2018 midterm elections are more concerned with the issue of immigration than they are with tax reform.\n\nFor example, when swing voters are asked, \"What is the most important issue to you in deciding how to vote in this year's midterm election,\" Independents say immigration is their third most important issue. Meanwhile, taxes are dead last as an issue for swing voters.\n\nLikewise, half of swing voters, 50 percent, say the GOP tax cuts that were passed last year have \"no impact\" on their midterm election vote, a blow to the business-first wing of the Republican Party that has banked on turning out voters to re-elect them on the issue of tax reform, rather than Trump's popular immigration-reducing agenda.\n\nFor Republicans, as Breitbart News reported, immigration and the economy are tied as the number one issues for them as voters in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\"The poll found that Republicans say immigration is more important than taxes, healthcare, and gun policy when it comes to their vote in the 2018 midterms. The economy is the only issue that is as much of a priority for Republican voters as immigration.\" https://t.co/lkiGYKbSiB\n\n-- John Binder ὇d (@JxhnBinder) March 22, 2018\n\nThe poll found that Republicans say immigration is more important than taxes, healthcare, and gun policy when it comes to their vote in the midterm elections. The economy is the only issue that is as much of a priority for Republican voters as immigration.\n\nA Harvard-Harris Poll from last month told a similar story of what Republican voters' priorities are for the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nIn that poll, Republican voters said reducing overall immigration levels -- wherein the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants annually -- was a bigger priority for them than tax cuts, destroying the Islamic State (ISIS), and even replacing Obamacare.\n\nWhile immigration remains paramount for Republican voters, the Republican-controlled Congress has continuously been unwilling to take up the issue and push Trump's plan to reduce overall immigration levels to raise the wages and quality of life for America's working and middle class.\n\nInstead, as Breitbart News reported, tax cuts were prioritized in the 2017 Republican legislative agenda rather than building a border wall, reducing legal immigration, and ending programs like the Diversity Visa Lottery, which imports 50,000 random foreign nationals to the U.S. every year.",

                "title": "Revealed: Mark Zuckerberg Wants to 'Trade' Free Speech for 'Safety' And 'Having an Informed Community' | Breitbart",
                "body": "In an interview with Wired magazine, Mark Zuckerberg revealed Facebook's political agenda -- he wants to curb free speech and free expression on the platform in exchange for \"safety.\"\n\nI think at the heart of a lot of these issues we face are tradeoffs between real values that people care about. You know, when you think about issues like fake news or hate speech, right, it's a tradeoff between free speech and free expression and safety and having an informed community. These are all the challenging situations that I think we are working to try to navigate as best we can. (Emphasis added)\n\nZuckerberg's \"trade-off\" confirms Facebook's long-suspected agenda: to take the platform away from first amendment principles, towards a European understanding of speech, in which elites determine what ordinary people can and cannot say, based on vague, flexible terms like \"hate speech\" and \"fake news.\"\n\nSimilarly to YouTube's lurch towards censoriousness, this is a massive bait-and-switch. Silicon Valley promised users open platforms where they would be able to air their views on an equal playing field, without interference from corporate media, political elites, and gatekeepers.\n\nNow Zuckerberg wants to install himself as the ultimate gatekeeper, presiding over the speech and expression of the platform's 2 billion users. In order to ensure \"safety\" and an \"informed community,\" he is going to decide what information is allowed to spread on the platform, and what information is going to be suppressed.\n\nWe are already seeing the results of this approach. Facebook's recent changes to users' newsfeeds have caused engagement on conservative media and on President Trump's page to plummet, while left-wing and corporate media has received a boost.\n\nBy taking on an editorial role, Facebook may be violating the justification for Communication Decency Act's safe harbor provision, which grants online platforms legal immunity from content posted by their users.\n\nFacebook's decision to take a top-down, editorial view on the information shared on its platform was recently confirmed by the company's head of news partnership's Campbell Brown. Speaking at Recode's annual conference, Brown said:\n\nThis is not us stepping back from news. This is us changing our relationship with publishers and emphasizing something that Facebook has never done before: It's having a point of view, and it's leaning into quality news. ... We are, for the first time in the history of Facebook, taking a step to try to to define what 'quality news' looks like and give that a boost. (Emphasis added)\n\nAt a Senate hearing in January, Sen. Ted Cruz called out representatives from Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter over censorship of conservatives. Cruz told the representatives that if their platforms did not remain politically neutral, they could lose legal immunity for user content under the provisions of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Without this protection, social media companies would be legally liable for all content posted on their platforms - an existential threat to their business model.",

                "body": "The admission came in a series of Tweets from Schumer's spokesman which describe the weekend's three-cornered amnesty talks between Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Donald Trump.\n\nSchumer's spokesman, Matt House, pushed the Democrats' narrative -- that divided Republicans keep saying 'no' when Democrats accept the GOP proposals. He wrote:\n\nThere was no indication that the White House was on board [with Ryan's offer] ... At no point did Republicans show any willingness to address the full DACA-eligible population that the President supported making citizens [in his prior four-part immigration reform plan] ... they're not serious about solving the DACA problem the president created ... they turned down another chance for @realDonaldTrump to get the wall.\n\nTrump hinted at the failed negotiations in Tuesday and Wednesday Tweets:\n\nDemocrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy, but they just didn't care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018\n\nThe Democrats do not want to help DACA. Would be so easy to make a deal!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2018\n\nThe Democrats likely rejected the offers from Ryan and Trump because they think they can get a better deal if they win a House majority in November, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. In 2019, \"they could get green cards for them in exchange for nothing at all ...[or for] much less than full funding for the wall, \" he said.\n\nThe risk and potential loss for the DACA migrants is not a key factor in the party's calculations, he said. \"The Democrats have used the 'dreamers' as political p.r. for more than 15 years - why should they stop now?\"\n\nThe Democrats' use of the 'dreamers' is a \"marketing gimmick\" which is embraced by the establishment media, he added. Media outlets \"keep running the [DACA] sob stories, one after another,\" while downplaying the costs to Americans, he said.\n\nIn mid-February, Democrats and business-first Republicans united to block Trump's four-part reform plan, which offered citizenship to at least 1.8 million DACA illegals in exchange for the popular goals of ending chain-migration, ending the visa lottery, building a border wall and reforming legal loopholes used by economic migrants.\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper broke the news about the weekend amnesty talks after a conversation with a GOP source, who said Ryan offered his deal on Sunday night after Schumer had rejected Trump's three-for-three offer.\n\nTrump offered a three-year DACA extension in exchange for a three-year, $25 billion wall-construction fund.\n\nSchumer rejected that offer and demanded citizenship for the 1.8 million illegals. If approved, that demand would have delivered eventual citizenship to at least 2 million illegals, plus their illegal-immigrant parents and to millions of chain-migration foreign relatives because Schumer's offer did not include a reform of the chain-migration rules.\n\nRyan's subsequent Sunday-evening offer to Schumer reportedly was similar to the Trump's rejected offer. Ryan also sent his offer on Monday morning to the Democrats' House leader, Nancy Pelosi, according to Tapper's source.\n\nSchumer rejected Ryan's deal on Tuesday, ending the talks, said Tapper.\n\nAfter Tapper broadcast the GOP source's report, Schumer's press secretary, Matt House, sent out the Democrats' version of the negotiations.\n\nTrump's initial offer would have extended DACA for 690,000 illegals until late 2020, but Schumer wanted citizenship for 1.8 million illegals, said House, the spokesman.\n\nSchumer's spokesman also hinted Ryan split from the White House, and he touted the Democrats' p.r. narrative -- that divided and insincere Republicans keep saying 'No' when Democrats accept the GOP proposals.",

                "body": "But the first important contests of 2018 have raised new questions about whether the \"Blue Wave\" is going to be as strong, or as solid, as was once thought.\n\nIn Texas, the first state to hold its 2018 primary, Democrats did, indeed, flock to the polls, roughly doubling their turnout from the last midterm elections in 2014.\n\nBut Republican candidates did very well: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), for example, \"received more votes in the 2018 Republican primary election than the entire turnout of voters in the Democratic primary.\"\n\nIn the special election in Pennsylvania last week, Democrat Conor Lamb narrowly defeated State Representative Rick Saccone (R- Allegheny/Washington) in a district that Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016.\n\nBut Lamb ran far to the right of his party, openly opposing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and supporting many of President Trump's policies.\n\nAnd in the Illinois primary this week, Democrats turned out in droves, but most of their \"progressive\" candidates failed. The loss that hurt the \"Resistance\" most was in the third congressional district, where pro-life Democrat Dan Lipinski hung on to defeat challenger Marie Newman by over 2,000 votes.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Republican side, the conservative base showed signs of life as State Rep. Jeanne Ives (R-Wheaton) beat all the polls -- including her own -- and fell just short of knocking out incumbent Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, losing by just 2.8%.\n\nIn sum: Democrats are very enthusiastic to vote, but their left-wing candidates are not doing very well, while Republicans are still engaged.\n\nThat could mean trouble for Democrats in some places, such as Orange County, California, where Democrats are hoping to pick up U.S. House seats in Republican districts, but where the primaries might yield far-left challengers that cannot win in a general election.\n\nRepublicans faced a similar challenge in 2010, when they could have taken the Senate, but nominated a mixed bag of anti-establishment candidates, some of whom were not quite ready for prime time. The GOP re-lived that debacle on a smaller scale in U.S. Senate races in Missouri and Indiana in 2012, and in Alabama's special election in 2017.\n\nBut there is also something else happening this year. Democrats are favored to win the House, with Nancy Pelosi -- bizarrely, and incredibly -- poised to reclaim the Speaker's gavel, despite all the talk of internal revolt. Her party has led in \"generic ballot\" polls, except in the weeks after their botched effort to shut down the government.\n\nYet the GOP will probably expand its majority in the Senate, as Republicans now lead in five states where Democrats are up for re-election and where Trump won in 2016. President Trump's approval ratings are also rising as the tax cuts kick in, and as extraordinary talks with North Korea come together.\n\nWhat all of this means is that the \"Blue Wave\" of 2018 in the House could be accompanied by a \"Red Wave\" cross-current in the Senate. Both parties could score big on November 6, on different sides of Capitol Hill. And that, in turn, reflects underlying demographic and political changes.\n\nDemocrats are gaining traction in suburban areas, where moderate Republicans once held sway. Trump's tax cuts, ironically, have helped that process along, because the new cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction is hitting Republicans in high-tax blue states.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are gaining in the Rust Belt, thanks almost entirely to Trump's economic policies, which are focused on the blue-collar workers Democrats once took for granted. Trump has shrewdly focused his governance on those crucial regions, thinking not only of 2018, but also of repeating his 2016 triumph in the Upper Midwest in 2020.\n\nAnd Americans continue to vote with their feet, with homeowners and small business owners -- who tend to vote Republican -- leaving blue states for warmer, more affordable red ones.\n\nThe country continues to polarize. But there is also a political realignment going on, where moderate Republicans and Democrats are essentially switching sides.\n\nNo one can tell how long that realignment will last. Blue-collar workers switched back to the Democratic Party in Pennsylvania's special election. And Democrats, too, are fleeing high-tax blue states for low-tax red ones, turning them purple.\n\nBut in the short term, Americans may elect a Congress that is sharply split -- even more so than it was under Barack Obama.\n\nThat outcome is not guaranteed. There is still a long way to go until November. And President Trump would certainly prefer not to lose the House.\n\nStill, if there is any arrangement that would play directly to his skill set and reputation as a deal-maker, it would be one in which polar opposites have to sit down together to govern the country.\n\nIronically, a president whose election further divided America would then be well-placed to stitch it back together.",

                "body": "The House passed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on Thursday, sending it on its way for a vote in the Senate ahead of a midnight Friday deadline to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nBut whether House members read the bill or if members of the Senate will be able to read it before a vote seems unlikely, if not impossible. The 2,232-page Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 is 944 pages longer than the Gutenberg Bible.\n\nBreitbart News reported:\n\nThe House passed the omnibus 255-167, featuring bipartisan support despite conservative opposition to the legislation. The House voted to advance the legislation to a floor vote on Thursday morning 211-207. Republican leadership released the omnibus bill on Wednesday night giving legislators less than 17 hours to read the bill.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus urged President Donald Trump to reject the bill in a letter posted on Twitter Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the @freedomcaucus sent the below letter to the WH:\n\n\"Mr. President, we urge you to remember the countless forgotten men and women of America who placed their faith in you to change business as usual in Washington, D.C. We urge you to join us and reject this omnibus.\" pic.twitter.com/eO0B1PfCYl\n\n-- Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) March 22, 2018\n\n\"Mr. President, we urge you to remember the countless forgotten men and women of America who placed their faith in you to change business as usual in Washington, D.C. We urge you to join us and reject this omnibus,\" the letter said.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT) also tweeted about the length of the bill and the lack of time to read it, not to mention the high cost of the legislation.\n\n2,232 pages. $1.3 trillion. 48 hours.\n\n-- Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) March 22, 2018\n\nDespite opposition from conservatives, the White House is backing it after Trump met with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement:\n\nThe president and the leaders discussed their support for the bill, which includes more funds to rebuild the military, such as the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade, more than 100 miles of new construction for the border wall and other key domestic priorities, like combatting the opioid crisis and rebuilding our nation's infrastructure.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the omnibus spending bill contains language that bars funding for a southern border wall.\n\nThe omnibus also contains provisions that expand the H-2B visa-worker program, which would reduce market pressure on companies to offer American workers higher wages.\n\nRepublican leadership also included provisions that will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct gun research.\n\nThe omnibus also includes the Fix NICS Act, which would allow unelected bureaucrats to remove Americans' right to purchase firearms without due process.",

                "body": "The House Intelligence Committee voted on Thursday to approve their final report on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and alleged collusion, sending it to the Intelligence community to be reviewed and declassified for release to the public.\n\nThe vote fell along party lines, with all Republicans on the committee voting to approve the report, and all Democrat members voting against. The report comes after 14 months of investigation.\n\nCommittee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) said in a statement:\n\nThis report, based on 70-plus witness interviews and more than 300,000 documents collected, provides specific findings and recommendations to improve our election security before the mid-term elections. The report, which will include minority views if the minority submits them, presents the comprehensive results of what the Committee has learned during its fourteen-month-long investigation, and will be useful in thwarting any attempts by Russia or other foreign powers to further meddle in U.S. elections.\n\nThe committee also released a list of more than 40 findings from their investigation that shed more insight on the final report.\n\nMost significant is the finding that \"none of the interviewed witnesses\" provided evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n\nNotably, that includes Glenn Simpson -- founder of Fusion GPS, who hired ex-spy Christopher Steele to work on what became the Trump dossier.\n\nThat also includes former CIA Director John Brennan, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, former Acting Attorney General Mary McCord, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin, former FBI Director James Comey, former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power.\n\nIt also included Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Clinton campaign adviser Jake Sullivan, and former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz.\n\nAnother finding is that the committee found \"no evidence that President Trump's pre-campaign business dealings formed the basis for collusion during the campaign.\"\n\nThe committee also found \"no evidence that Trump associates were involved in the theft or publication of Clinton campaign-related emails, although Trump associates had numerous ill-advised contacts with WikiLeaks.\"\n\nThe idea that the Trump campaign had worked with Russia to steal Democratic National Committee and Podesta emails formed the original basis of the collusion claim by the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe committee also addressed former Trump campaign associates' contacts with Russians, which Democrats have alleged show collusion.\n\nIt found that former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page \"did not travel to Moscow in July 2016 on behalf of the Trump campaign. However, it added, \"the Committee is concerned about his seemingly incomplete accounts of his activity in Moscow.\"\n\nThe committee also said former adviser George Papadopoulos's \"attempts to leverage his Russian contacts to facilitate meetings between the Trump campaign and Russians was unsuccessful.\"\n\nOn the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, it said: \"Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort attended a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower where they expected to receive -- but did not ultimately obtain -- derogatory information on candidate Clinton from Russian sources.\"\n\nIt added that Trump Jr. \"briefly met\" with a Russian government official at the 2016 National Rifle Association annual meeting, but that there was \"no evidence\" that the two discussed the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe committee also cleared Attorney General Jeff Sessions, finding that: \"The Committee found no evidence that meetings between Trump associates -- including Jeff Sessions -- and official representatives of the Russian government -- including Ambassador Kislyak -- reflected collusion, coordination, or conspiracy with the Russian government.\"\n\nThe committee found that Steele's second- and third-hand information, purportedly from high-placed Russian sources, was provided directly to Fusion GPS and Perkins Coie and \"indirectly\" back to the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe committee also issued new findings on intelligence community leaks that suggested that intelligence officials under the Obama administration leaked information to media.\n\nIt said leaks of classified information regarding Russian intentions to sow discord in the elections began before the election, and \"increased dramatically\" after the election.\n\nIn addition, it said leaks prior to the classified Intelligence Community Assessment's publication, correlate to \"specific language\" found in the assessment.\n\nThe findings also appeared to corroborate a report by investigative journalist Sara Carter that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper had leaked to CNN that President-Elect Trump had been briefed on the dossier -- which set off a report by CNN and the subsequent publishing of the dossier by Buzzfeed.\n\n\"Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, now a CNN national security analyst, provided inconsistent testimony to the Committee about his contacts with the media, including CNN,\" it said.\n\nThe committee also released a finding that could raise questions about Flynn's guilty plea.\n\n\"General Flynn pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding his December 2016 conversations with Ambassador Kislyak, even though the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents did not detect any deception during Flynn's interview,\" it said.\n\nThe committee also issued a number of findings concluding that the Obama administration did not take sufficient steps to counteract Russian meddling before or after the election, and issued a number of recommendations on countering such interference.\n\nFor the intelligence community, it recommended it update its guidance regarding media contacts to \"ensure the guidance applies to every employee, including senior officials.\"\n\nThe committee recommended that Congress consider legislation on increasing penalties for leaks of classified information, and that the Executive Branch consider making all non-Senate-confirmed political appointees who have top secret clearances take mandatory polygraphs.",

                "body": "Last week, former 49er safety and noted anthem protester Eric Reid, said that he felt his protests were hurting his chances of landing a job.\n\nHe further said that if any NFL owners out there had a problem with him standing up against \"systematic oppression,\" that their \"mindset is part of the problem too.\"\n\nThis week, Eric Reid is singing an entirely different tune.\n\nReid, who was the first of Colin Kaepernick's teammates to join him in kneeling during the national anthem, says he will not protest the national anthem if he's signed to a roster in 2018.\n\n\"I'm just going to consider different ways to be active, different ways to bring awareness to the issues of this country to improve on,\" Reid told Matt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area. \"I don't think it'll be in the form of protesting during the anthem. And I said 'during' because it's crazy to me that the narrative got changed to we were protesting the anthem, because that wasn't the case. But I think we're going to take a different approach to how to be active.\"\n\nReid's about face on the issue should come as no surprise. Without the robust social justice backing that Colin Kaepernick has received as the face of the protest movement, Reid needs football a lot more than Kaepernick does.\n\nThough, Reid has more than just protesting hurdles to overcome. The LSU product was moved from his natural position of safety, to weakside linebacker last year. A player without a defined position, can be looked upon as an investment risk by some clubs.\n\nEither way, with the very real likelihood of not collecting an NFL paycheck looming over his head, it seems Reid has decided that the struggle has become a bit too real.",

Today, liberals and special interest groups received a present personally gift-wrapped by leaders in the House and Senate.\n\nThis massive spending bill would be more aptly named the OmniBUST Bill for busting through spending limits put in place in 2011. Worse, it provides funding for Planned Parenthood and blocks penalties for Sanctuary Cities. This pork-riddled bill forks over half a billion dollars to build a tunnel for liberal New York Senator Chuck Schumer. This bill also fails to fully fund President Trump's request for a border wall along the Southern border and does not include language allowing for carrying concealed weapons across state lines - a promise made to me and our entire Republican majority. Hidden in this bill is a section on school safety which prohibits money from being used for guns and gun training. In other words, none of the Omnibus funds can be used to arm teachers or school resource officers.\n\nSadly, the bill contains many more provisions that run counter to the conservative principles that we as Republicans were elected to implement. For example, the Omnibus includes provision inserted by liberal California Senator Dianne Feinstein which blocks a 56 million-ton sand and gravel mine from opening in the Soledad Canyon in California despite two contracts being competitively awarded to a company that has already invested $40 million. This amounts to nothing more than a land grab.",

Instead, America's departure unleashed one of the most horrifying tides of murderous cruelty ever witnessed by the human race.\n\nBill Murray is not an oblivious twentysomething whose left-wing teachers just kind of forgot to mention the killing fields of Cambodia when they taught him about the Seventies, so he should not need anyone to remind him of what actually happened, but here goes.\n\nSouth Vietnam was swiftly overrun by the savage North Vietnamese after the American withdrawal in 1975. The good guys with guns left, so the bad guys with guns rolled in and started murdering people on an industrial scale.\n\nPound for pound, Vietnamese Communism was one of the most bloodthirsty ideologies the world has ever known. They managed to kill ten percent of the national population by the time they were done with their wars and purges. The carnage was staggering. Up to 2.5 million South Vietnamese were marched off to \"re-education camps,\" where at least 165,000 of them died of starvation, disease, exhaustion from hard labor, summary execution, and exploding land mines.\n\nAnother million South Vietnamese were thrown out of their homes to make way for the conquering Communists and forcibly relocated to areas so uninhabitable that a journalist described them as \"a prefabricated hell and a place one comes to only if the alternative to it would be death.\" Up to 155,000 of them died out there.\n\nAnother two million gun-free Vietnamese decided to avoid the prefabricated hell their heavily armed conquerors planned for them, so they threw themselves and their families into just about anything that could float and set sail for Europe, America, and Australia. They were at sea for six months in some cases, facing everything from pirates and storms to malnutrition and disease.\n\nOf the two million Vietnamese Boat People who fled the Communist horror, an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 died at sea or in refugee camps.\n\nThe Vietnamese Communists had a lively spinoff franchise in Cambodia known as the Khmer Rouge, managed by a fellow called Pol Pot, a Hall of Fame monster in the annals of genocide. Two years after America pulled out of Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge overthrew the U.S.-backed government of Cambodia.\n\nA few days later, the gun-toting Communists marched the politically undesirable members of their gun-free captive populace into concentration camps even more brutal than those of Vietnam, or simply murdered them on the spot and shoveled them into mass graves.\n\nThere are individual fields in Cambodia where over 10,000 people were murdered. There is a concentration camp that took in 14,000 inmates, but only seven of them survived. The overall death toll from the four-year Cambodian genocide has been estimated at 2 million against a total national population of just 7 million.\n\nHere is a little irony for Bill Murray to savor: the Khmer Rouge leaders were highly educated student activists who were absolutely convinced they knew what was best for society. They were positively brimming with youthful idealism! They told their critics: \"To keep you is no benefit, to destroy you is no loss.\"\n\nSo no, Mr. Murray, we didn't all survive America's withdrawal from Vietnam. Peace and love did not blossom across the region as a result. And while Vietnam is doubtless much improved today over the first decades after the Vietnam War, and is becoming a significant U.S. strategic ally against China's regional ambitions, it remains a Communist tyranny with precious little political freedom or respect for basic human rights.\n\nFreedom of speech, opinion, assembly, and religion are highly restricted in modern Vietnam. Dissidents are harassed by the police, detained, and assaulted. \"Elections\" are even more of a joke than the one Russia just held. Human-rights activists are detained to keep them from meeting with foreign leaders. Surveillance is pervasive. Members of disfavored religious groups have been forced to renounce their faith in public. Legal processes are dubious at best. Modest improvements are noted from time to time, but Vietnam has a long way to go before it fits any rational definition of a liberal democracy.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints lodged by Vietnamese human rights activists is that people like Bill Murray keep pretending the place is a reformist paradise where the commie stuff happened a million years ago. U.S. administrations under both Republican and Democratic presidents have muted their criticism of the appalling police state in Hanoi as they seek improved diplomatic and economic ties. Activists have expressed disappointment in the apathetic response from the United Nations as well.\n\n\"The thing that's so powerful about students is that, when you haven't had your idealism broken yet, you're able to speak from a place that has no confusion, where there is a clear set of values,\" Bill Murray said on Thursday.\n\nThe thing that is so dangerous about the Left's cynical manipulation of youthful idealism is that complex truth is replaced with simplistic fairy tales, symbolic gestures, and emotional appeals. If your \"clear set of values\" is based on deceptively edited history, then it is time to get a new set of values.\n\nBill Murray could start by apologizing to all the families he wronged by airbrushing the horrors perpetrated against them, brushing up on the real history of Vietnam from 1975 to today, and understanding how that history makes the exact opposite point about gun control than the one he intended.",

The Ocean Cleanup Foundation has spearheaded the recently published research, explaining that the wind and convergence of ocean currents are what gather so much of it into one place.\n\nThe \"patch\" contains more than 1.8 trillion pieces of garbage and weighs approximately 88,000 tons. That is the rough equivalent of 500 jumbo jets -- and more than 16 times the size of previous estimates. It has nearly doubled the size of Texas -- and is bigger than France, Germany, and Spain combined.\n\nThe study required three years of careful mapping, a team of scientists, six universities, and even a company that develops aerial sensors. And it only covered this single largest island of pollutants -- there are four others floating around, waiting on the same level of scrutiny.\n\nThere is urgency inherent to the project. For now, the plastics are largely gathered in these centralized locations. However, tiny pieces are constantly breaking away and, every day, make the oceans more dangerous for continued marine life. If left unattended, there is no educated guess as to how long the process could continue.\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup Foundation's spokesman, Dubois, called it \"a ticking time bomb of larger material.\" He emphasized that \"we've got to get it before it breaks down into a size that's too small to collect and also dangerous for marine life.\"",

Such majors include marketing, management, graphic design, computer information systems, and chemical engineering would be expanded as a part of the proposal.\n\nThe university claims that 13 majors are facing elimination partially due to low enrollment. Those majors include American studies, Art, English, French, Geography, Geoscience, German, History, Music Literature, Philosophy, Political science, Sociology, and Spanish.\n\nThe school said in a statement that cutting the low enrollment majors would allow the university to grow in other areas that are more important to our evolving economy.\n\n\"To fund this future investment, resources would be shifted from programs with lower enrollment, primarily in the traditional humanities and social sciences,\" a statement from the school read. \"Although some majors are proposed to be eliminated, courses would continue to be taught in these fields, and minors or certificates will be offered.\"\n\nA group of 300 students, faculty, and staff, participated in a sit-in event on Wednesday to protest the proposed changes. The protesters occupied an administration building for 13 minutes, which represented each of the majors that are facing elimination as part of the new proposal.\n\nSome students are blaming the proposal on budget cuts put in place by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Republican lawmakers in the state legislature.\n\nHowever, Chancellor Bernie Patterson claims that the proposal is not merely a reaction to budgetary cuts. \"Doing nothing, keeping things as they are is not an option,\" Patterson said. \"I don't want to frame this just as a reaction to the budget,\" he said. \"We have an opportunity to do something different here.

The newspaper notes that a video surfaced of Olcay performing live and adding to the song, \"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, it's all empty, it's all a lie, life will end one day and you'll say 'I had a dream.'\"\n\nProsecutors also claimed that Olcay made an \"insulting hand gesture\" while singing about Erdogan, though Hurriyet does not specify what the gesture was or whether it was related to the song at all.\n\nTurkish courts convicted Olcay on Thursday as per Turkish Penal Code Article 299, which reads:\n\n(1) Anyone who insults the President of the Republic shall be imprisoned for a term of from one to four years.\n\n(2) (Amended by Law 5377 dated 29 June 2005/Article 35) Where the offence is committed in public, the sentence shall be increased by one sixth.\n\n(3) Initiation of a prosecution for this offence shall be subject to authorization by the Minister of Justice.\n\nProsecutors sought the maximum sentence of four years for the actress, but judges lowered the punishment to nearly one year.\n\nAccording to her website, Olcay came to fame working in the Istanbul theater industry as an actress in the 1970s and '80s, famously portraying Argentine first lady Eva Perón in the musical Evita in 1989. She turned to music full-time with an album in 2002 and has also been a consistent presence on Turkish television.\n\nTurkey has long been home to a vibrant television, film, and music industry. Founded as a secular republic by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1923, Turks - particularly those in the major cities, Istanbul and Ankara - have widely embraced Western cultural openness. Much of this has changed under Erdogan, whose Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) took control, with him as Prime Minister, in 2013. Erdogan has greatly expanded the powers of the presidency under his rule, an office originally functioning as a largely ceremonial one prior to his rule, and has urged a shift away from parliamentary democracy to a presidential system.\n\nIn early March, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) - the national broadcaster - published a list of 208 popular songs banned from government airwaves. The songs had been banned since 2016, but the public revelation only followed a recent parliamentary inquiry. While the government shut down secular voices, particularly Kurdish ones, government-friendly publications have placed a spotlight on \"Islamic art,\" instead.\n\nThousands of people have faced criminal charges for insulting Erdogan in the past five years, among them a man arrested for posting a meme on social media comparing Erdogan to the Lord of the Rings character Gollum, a German comedian who made fun of Erdogan on a German broadcast, two teens accused of taking down a poster with Erdogan's face on it, and the editors of the Turkish magazine Nokta, who published a cartoon depicting Erdogan taking a selfie in front of the coffin of a Turkish soldier.\n\nOpposition politicians have also found themselves facing criminal charges for insulting Erdogan in the process of making the case for their policies. In 2016, the head of the Republican People's Party (CHP), the secularist party founded by Atatürk, was sued under Article 299 for calling Erdogan a \"sham dictator\" in the context of widespread arrests of opposition pro-Kurdish politicians.\n\nLater that year, following a failed coup attempt against him, Erdogan announced a \"one-off gesture of goodwill\" in which he dropped all criminal charges he had levied for insults to his person, releasing 4,000 people from often cumbersome and time-consuming legal proceedings.",

                "body": "The Florida high school where 17 people died after being shot in February is requiring its students to wear clear backpacks in hopes that the move will prevent further gun violence.\n\nBroward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert W. Runcie announced Wednesday in a letter to parents of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students that all pupils will only be allowed to wear clear backpacks to school after next week's spring break.\n\nRuncie added that the district would provide those backpacks at no cost to students who cannot afford them once the rule goes into effect.\n\nThe move by the district comes as the school attempts to introduce other security measures -- including possible airport-style metal detectors at the entrance and identification badges for students, faculty, and staff members -- to prevent another shooting such as what took place on February 14.\n\nThe school already implemented heightened security measures Thursday ahead of the rules taking effect. Florida Gov. Rick Scott ordered eight highway patrol officers to provide security for the school after authorities arrested Nikolas Cruz's brother, Zachary, Monday for allegedly trespassing on school grounds after he was told to stay away from the campus.\n\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office also announced it arrested three high school students Tuesday -- one for allegedly making threats via Snapchat and two for allegedly carrying knives -- prompting Scott to offer assistance to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel and Runcie in the form of state patrol officers.\n\n\"Parents, students, and teachers have recently endured one of the worst tragedies in Florida history,\" Gov. Scott said. \"They must be assured that every necessary step is being taken to increase safety and ensure no unauthorized people are allowed on campus.\"\n\nThe patrol officers, along with Broward County deputies, will be on guard at every campus entry point and will remain there indefinitely.\n\nThe school had been patrolled by one armed deputy and several unarmed guards before the massacre.\n\nSome students decried the \"clear backpack\" rule and other security measures as inefficient, saying the proposed measures will not stop gun violence.\n\nOne student tweeted that the backpack rule would only make the school environment more like a prison.\n\n\"s/o to America for making my school seem like jail now because legislators don't have common sense gun reform on their agendas,\" the student, a senior, tweeted.\n\nOther students expressed concerns about the school district invading students' privacy and spending money to give students the backpacks.\n\n\"I know having clear backpacks will help with security, but now all my privacy will be gone. I wish it didn't come to this,\" another Marjory Stoneman Douglas student tweeted.",

                "body": "Following the passage of California's SB54 \"sanctuary\" law, Border Patrol agents were reportedly forced to release a suspected drunk driver after local police refused to take them into custody.\n\nIn a declaration submitted in the case of United States of America v. State of California, San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Rodney Scott revealed that the Indio Police Department refused to dispatch officers to take custody of a suspected drunk driver because Border Patrol agents initially stopped the driver for an immigration inspection, court documents obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed.\n\nBorder Patrol agents from the Indio Station conducted a traffic stop under their immigration enforcement authority, Scott stated.\n\n\"As the officers approached the vehicle, it was obvious that the driver was intoxicated,\" he said. The agents determined there were no immigration-related issues and contacted the Indio Police Department to send an officer to take charge of the suspected drunk driver. Police officials replied that they \"would not respond because the initial vehicle stop was immigration based,\" the chief said.\n\nBorder Patrol agents were forced to release the \"obviously intoxicated\" driver onto the public roadways, Scott explained. Further, he said Indio police officials notified the agents they would only respond to Border Patrol calls based on \"Officer Safety\" concerns.\n\nChief Scott said the SB54 law creates numerous situations that put the public, his agents, and local police officers in danger because of the refusal to cooperate.\n\nHe described a second situation where the El Cajon Police Department refused to send units to assist Border Patrol agents who were engaged in a high-speed pursuit.\n\nChief Scott reported:\n\nBorder Patrol Agents from the Campo Station attempted a vehicle stop on February 12, 2018. The vehicle failed to yield on Interstate 8 in California and fled west, traveling a distance of more than 20 miles, while being pursued by Border Patrol. Eventually, Border Patrol Agents assigned to the El Cajon station successfully deployed a controlled tire deflation device, and the vehicle came to a stop on Highway 67 in the city of El Cajon, California.\n\nThree people fled the scene after the stop. Agents arrested two of the subjects while the third escaped.\n\nScott said the agents requested assistance from the El Cajon Police Department during the pursuit. At the time, the agents had no knowledge of the driver's identity, immigration status, or why he chose to flee. \"The El Cajon Police Department declined to assist,\" Scott stated. \"After the event, it was determined that the officer declined the request to assist presuming it was an immigration matter as opposed to a fleeing subject whose identity/immigration status was not known at the time of the incident.\"\n\nThe Border Patrol sector chief said the declination by the El Cajon put the public and his agents at risk by failing to help stop a high-speed pursuit \"on a California Interstate and highway within their jurisdiction.\"\n\nScott said prior to the passage of SB54, his agents and local law enforcement officials enjoyed good relationships between the agencies and cooperation on matters like these were commonplace.\n\n\"In the law enforcement community, Border Patrol is committed to strong working relationships with state and local law enforcement partners,\" Chief Scott explained. \"Given the nature of itsmission, Border Patrol often acts within the same geographic area as state and local law enforcement entities, and relies heavily on these partnerships to ensure officer safety and public safety.\"",

                "body": "In a statement released on Tuesday, Education Minister Ahmed bin Mohammed al-Isa said that school curricula and books would be reviewed to \"ensure they do not reflect the banned Muslim Brotherhood's agenda.\"\n\nIsa said that materials in violation of these standards would be removed from schools and universities, as would employees who \"sympathize with the group its ideology.\"\n\nHaaretz notes action has already been taken along these lines, as one Saudi university announced it would sack employees suspected of ties to the Brotherhood in September. This raised understandable concerns about civil liberties, which the Saudi government addresses by saying the problem of extremist ideology is so serious that stern measures must be taken to combat it.\n\nThat was effectively Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's response when 60 Minutes asked about his anti-extremism program last week.\n\n\"Saudi schools have been invaded by many elements from the Muslim Brotherhood organization, surely to a great extent. Even now, there are some elements left. It will be a short while until they are all eradicated completely,\" he promised. \"Of course, no country in the world would accept that its educational system be invaded by any radical group.\"\n\nThe cynical view is that Saudi Arabia already has an extremist ideology, the Wahhabis, and they do not like the Muslim Brotherhood muscling in on their turf. Haaretz was a bit more generous in its assessment, arguing that the Wahhabis \"espoused a political philosophy that demands obedience to the ruler\" in addition to extremist lunacy.\n\nThis clearly made them more appealing to the Saudi monarchy than the Muslim Brotherhood, which \"advances an active political doctrine urging revolutionary action\" - in other words, overthrowing the government.\n\nThe Brotherhood threat is not fanciful paranoia -- the group really has held a substantial position in the Saudi education system, although its high-water mark was back in the Nineties. The Education Minister explained that Brotherhood members fled Egypt in the Seventies, settled in Saudi Arabia, and sought teaching positions at public schools and universities as well as organizing student groups.\n\nThe New Arab points out that while human rights groups have been critical of \"hateful and incendiary language\" toward religious minorities in Saudi educational materials, including some \"violent and intolerant teachings,\" they were largely attributed to Wahabi influences rather than the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThere is no question that Crown Prince Mohammed has made major progress toward modernizing Saudi life and pushing back against all sorts of extremist influences. The next step might require letting the Saudi establishment pretend they are thrashing the banned Muslim Brotherhood while they clean up all manner of extremist junk, move closer to the West, and put the looming threat of sanctions due to religious persecution behind them for good.",

                "title": "Xi Jinping Launches 'Voice of China' Network to Show China as 'Builder of World Peace'",
                "body": "The Chinese Communist Party announced this week the creation of a universal propaganda arm named \"Voice of China,\" which the regime hopes will \"ensure its voice is heard loud and clear around the world.\"\n\nThe broadcast media under Voice of China appear to aspire to be a mirror image of the U.S. government's human rights journalism network Voice of America, founded in 1942 as a counterbalance to the sophisticated Nazi propaganda machine. The organization will employ 14,000 people to spread Chinese propaganda globally.\n\nThe People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, explained in an article published Sunday that Voice of China \"is the combination of China Central Television (including China Global Television Network), China National Radio, and China Radio International, and it will serve as an institution directly under the State Council.\"\n\nIt remains unclear if, like Voice of America, Voice of China will also consist of an online print site. If so, it will join a crowded field of Chinese government English-language online publications that includes the People's Daily, the Global Times, China Daily, and the news service Xinhua, among other smaller publications.\n\nThe People's Daily reports Xi Jinping is personally overseeing the development of the site and has decreed \"the new media outlet should present China as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and an upholder of the international order, so as to work for the efforts to build a community of common destiny.\"\n\nThe newspaper asserts that the new media arm will \"give people a clearer picture of Chinese life, of China's unique development path, and of what China's rise means for the world, as well as broaden understanding and friendship between China and the world.\"\n\nThis, it claims, is especially necessary given that \"Cold War thinking is rampant in the West,\" citing several Republican congressmen arguing that China's attempts to set debt traps in Africa and Latin America, colonize neighboring countries, and insert itself into disputes in the Middle East are a clear threat to international stability.\n\nXi has repeatedly referred to China as \"keeper of the international order,\" implying that China alone creates and enforces international law. Xi's boldest attempt at putting this claim into practice has occurred in the South China Sea, where in July 2016, the Court of Permanent Arbitration at the Hague found that China's military constructions in Philippine and Vietnamese waters violated international law. Beijing vowed to ignore the case and continue militarizing international waters and has, indeed, done so with little pushback from its smaller neighbors.\n\nRadio Free Asia, which reports on human rights violations throughout the country, posits that the creation of Voice of China is also an attempt to elbow dissent out of the public conversation in China even more than it already is.\n\n\"The ruling Chinese Communist Party is strengthening its hold on all forms of public expression, enlarging its powerful propaganda department to absorb agencies responsible for regulating the mass media, and exporting its ideology to the rest of the world via a new mega-broadcaster,\" the outlet reports, citing announcements from the Communist Party itself that make the claim that the nation's social harmony requires extensive speech regulation.\n\nCombining all separate wings of broadcast propaganda into Voice of China will allow the government to more efficiently \"propagat[e] the party's theories, directions, principles and policies.\"\n\nAccording to a Radio Free Asia source, the fact that Beijing copied the name of Voice of America does not imply that it will also use its structure as a model, \"instead taking Russia Today (RT) as its model.\" RT, a Russian propaganda outlet, has branded itself as a source of hard news in the United States in contrast to the entertainment programming on cable news networks - a marketing ploy that has lost much of its effect as other networks emphasize the alleged role Russian propaganda played in \"hacking\" the 2016 election.\n\nVoice of China is not the first project that Xi Jinping has stolen an American title to create. For years, Xi has promoted the \"Chinese dream,\" a dystopian version of the \"American\" dream in which Chinese people enjoy a \"moderately prosperous society\" under his totalitarian control.\n\n\"We should pool the wisdom and strength of more than 1.3 billion Chinese people in more than 400 million households to strive for the great success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation,\" Xi said in a speech in February celebrating the Lunar New Year.\n\nThe Global Times recently admitted in an editorial that without stealing and repurposing American ideas, China \"is not ready\" to become a global superpower on par with the United States.",

Epstein states that the methods Cambridge used are not very powerful and are trivial compared to real threats on the internet:\n\nCambridge Analytica claims to have purchased 5,000 \"data points\" -- that is, digital facts -- about every voter in America before the 2016 election, as well as to have employed new psychometric techniques to figure out how best to influence those voters. Using Facebook's Ads Manager - as thousands of companies do each day to match up their products with potential buyers -- Cambridge Analytica's data and methodology allowed them to display their ads to hand-picked Facebook users, and that, in turn, should have increased what marketers call the \"clickthrough rate\" (CTR) -- the proportion of people who click on their ads.\n\nEpstein says that this is not a big deal as \"everybody does it,\" noting that Facebook itself brags about being able to \"drive a successful campaign\" and target \"constituents and supporters.\"\n\nEpstein notes that during the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton had access to a far greater amount of digital data than President Trump did, yet Clinton still lost the election:\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton had far more powerful digital tools at her disposal than Trump did. To give you just one example, in 2015, Google czar Eric Schmidt -- who, at one point, had offered to oversee Hillary's digital campaign -- set up a secretive tech company called The Groundwork, the sole purpose of which was to make Hillary president. It was staffed by many of the same people who served on Obama's 2012 tech team, which was also supervised by Schmidt.\n\n5,000 data points? P'lease. The Groundwork had access to Google's entire data base -- hundreds of thousands of digital facts about each of us, including our search histories and emails -- so much information, in fact, that Google could likely have computed the election results days before Election Day. (Although Google obviously screwed up on its Electoral College calculations, Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million, almost certainly with Google's help.)\n\nEpstein stated that the biggest factor in influencing the public is the platform they view information on, such as Facebook and Google, who decide exactly what the public sees:",

Feinstein has 42 percent support among likely voters compared with 16 percent for de León.",

                "body": "President Donald Trump emphasized the importance of \"reciprocal\" trade as he signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday to protect the United States from China's economic aggression and theft of intellectual property.\n\n\"We've lost, over a fairly short period of time, 60,000 factories in our country. Closed, shuttered, gone,\" said Trump. \"Six million jobs at least, gone. And now they're starting to come back. You see what's happening with Chrysler, with FoxConn, with so many other companies wanting to come back in to the United States.\"\n\nThe President said however, that the $504 billion trade deficit with \"friend\" China, is a problem. He prefaced his comments with China's help on the issue of North Korea. He acknowledged varying figures for the trade deficit, but added, \"any way you look at it, it is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. It's out of control.\"\n\nTrump then pointed to the \"tremendous\" problem of intellectual property theft, \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" annually. He said he's spoken to President Xi Jinping and other representatives from China.\n\nThe President then spoke of countries entering into trade negotiations with the U.S. including NAFTA renegotiations and new negotiations with the European Union. He accused the EU of erecting harshly restrictive trade barriers against the U.S. including tariffs.\n\nTrump said the new 301 action that \"could be about 60 billion dollars,\" but that that was merely a fraction of \"what we're talking about.\" He has asked the highest Chinese representatives and President Xi to \"reduce the trade deficit immediately by 100 billion dollars.\"\n\n\"When they charge 25 percent for a car to go in and we charge two percent for their car to come in to the United States, that's not good,\" said Trump. \"That's how China rebuilt itself.\"\n\nTrump talked about the \"tremendous money\" that the U.S. has paid since the founding of the disastrous World Trade Organization (WTO). He called the WTO arbitration and judging \"very unfair.\"\n\nFrom the WTO to NAFTA to China to the EU, \"every single one of them wants to negotiate,\" according to the President. \"I believe that in many cases...we'll end up negotiating a deal.\"\n\n\"We have right now an 800 billion dollar trade deficit with the world,\" said Trump. \"Some people call it a mirror tariff or a mirror tax, just use the word reciprocal. If they charge us, we charge them the same thing.\"\n\nPresident Trump said he believes other countries can't believe they've gotten away with taking advantage of the United States for so long.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer then took the podium to explain the section 301 statute. It gives authority to the U.S. President to \"correct actions in certain circumstances where there's unfair acts, policies or practices by our trading partners.\" Lighthizer pointed to the issue of technology in particular as the \"backbone of the future of the American economy.\" 44 million people in the U.S. work in the area of technology according to Lighthizer.\n\nUSTR conducted a study, held hearings and reviewed tens of thousands of documents, talked to business people, and ultimately \"concluded that in fact China does have a policy of forced technology transfer, of requiring licensing at less than economic value at state capitalism wherein they go in and buy technology in the United States in non-economic ways and then finally of cyber theft,\" said Lighthizer. The result of the 200-page study and President's analysis led to the decision to impose tariffs on \"appropriate products,\" put \"investment restrictions on China with regard to high technology,\" and will follow with a WTO case for a WTO violation.\n\n\"Intellectual property rights are our future,\" said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross as he took the podium. He said that in June 2018 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is on track to issue its 10 millionth patent.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said that the 301 action sends a clear message that the Trump administration is committed to putting \"American jobs and American workers first.\"\n\n\"We are in the midst of very major and very positive negotiations. Positive for the United States and actually very positive for other countries also,\" emphasized Trump who specifically noted negotiations with China.\n\nLockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson stepped up to call the action a \"very important moment for our country in that we are addressing what is a critical area for the aerospace and defense industry and that is protecting our intellectual property...that is the lifeblood of our companies.\"\n\n\"This is number one, but this is the first of many,\" said Trump as he signed the section 301 presidential memo.\n\nOther attendees of the signing, according to the White House, included Chief of Staff General John Kelly, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Tom Bossert, Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor for Policy Stephen Miller, Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President Don McGahn, Assistant to the President Peter Navarro, Acting White House Staff Secretary Derek Lyons, Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs Everett Eissenstat, Chairman and CEO of Raytheon Tom Kennedy, former Director of National Intelligence ADM Dennis Blair, President of General Atomics David Alexander, CEO of Leidos Roger Krone, and former Director of the National Security Agency GEN Keith Alexander.\n\nAhead of the signing, White House officials briefed reporters on the upcoming action. senior White House adviser Everett Eisenstadt identified that \"the end objective of these actions is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices.\"",

Scientists at Northwestern University did a study about the differences between men's brains and women's brains, and this is fascinating. It seems women's brains are located in their head. This explains a lot.\"\n\n\"In fact, I was talking about this just yesterday with my Uber driver, Kevin Spacey,\" Leno joked about the House of Cards actor who's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than dozen men.\n\nLeno then turned his attention to Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner, who was accused of sexual harassment last November by screenwriter Kater Gordon.\n\n\"Let me tell you something, okay, when your last name is Weiner just introducing yourself to people is sexual harassment, Leno quipped.\n\nTargeting Democrats with searing puns, something no Trump-era late-night host dares, Leno took aim at disgraced New York Congressman-turned sex offender Anthony Weiner.\n\nHe's in jail for sexting an underage girl. And what you might not know is when he got caught, he actually called Bill Clinton to apologize,\" Leno said, adding, \"that's when you know your life is going off the rails, when your sexual behavior offends Bill Clinton.\"\n\nThe former NBC funnyman then turned his attention to shamed former news anchors Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose.\n\n\"Matt Lauer: fired from the Today show,\" Leno said, joking: \"Matt had to learn the hard way: When Al Roker says no, he means no.\"\n\n\"Charlie Rose, walking around naked in front of interns? When did newsmen start behaving like this?\" he continued. \"I don't remember Walter Cronkite prancing around in front of Margaret Thatcher.\"\n\nKeeping his quips politically balanced, Leno joked about Trump's alleged sexual relationship with porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"As you know, President Trump allegedly paid a porn star $130,000 to cover up their affair,\" Leno said. \"If that turns out to be true, it'll be the first time Trump has fully compensated for all the work they did.\"",

                "body": "An editorial in China's state-run Global Times this week called for a national strategy to displace the United States as the world leader in artificial intelligence technology.\n\nIt is a field where China is arguably already Number Two in the world. Although the Chinese paper was uncharacteristically downbeat in laying out the case for America retaining its supremacy for the near future, it also made an ominous case for why China is better prepared to do what it takes to seize and retain the lead.\n\nThe Global Times approvingly cites a recent Financial Times (FT) article about China's surge in spending on A.I. research and its impressive output of scholarly papers on the subject. It should be noted that the Financial Times has published a long string of articles about China threatening to take the lead on A.I., based on research volume, investment, and businesses actually employing A.I. technology in a profitable manner.\n\nThe Financial Times article that made China so happy chronicled the explosion of research papers submitted by the Communist nation at the latest Association for the Advancement of A.I. meeting. China went from basically nothing to near-parity with U.S. researchers in ten years.\n\n\"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that China is now in serious competition with the U.S. for dominance in AI. No European nation remotely competes at these volumes and, even taken as a whole, Europe is not really in competition for gold or silver,\" FT concluded.\n\nThe Global Times cut in with a round of applause for companies like Alibaba and Tencent that are \"making hefty bets on A.I.,\" but then came the unexpected bucket of cold water on Chinese triumphalism:\n\nIt seems, nonetheless, that there's been too much excitement. A report jointly released by Chinese startup database IT Juzi and Tencent Research Institute in August 2017 revealed that as of the end of June 2017, there were 2,542 AI enterprises worldwide, with the US hosting 41 percent of the total and China second with 23 percent. The report also revealed that China trailed the U.S. in terms of AI-related investment and human resources.\n\nThese findings speak for themselves, and they're a reminder that China can't jump to the conclusion that it will surpass the U.S. in AI anytime soon.\n\nOne of the earlier Financial Times red-alerts about China's growing dominance of A.I. technology argued that China put more money into A.I. startups than the United States last year, and Chinese companies consumed almost half of the venture capital directed at artificial intelligence, an astounding increase from the 11.3 percent that went China's way in 2016. The Global Times might be underselling China a bit just to light a fire under Chinese investors and policymakers.\n\nThe ominous part of the story is a point both FT and the Global Times agree on: leaving money and scholarly research aside, the big reason to think China will pull ahead is that it can use the data harvested from its gigantic population, plus whatever data it can pinch from foreign sources, while openly expressing no concern for ethics or morality. As the Global Times puts it:\n\nThe rapid development of AI in China is in part due to the country's huge market, large population and fewer privacy concerns among the public, which means it's easier to collect data. But as the global race for AI intensifies, China may fall behind if it can't build a powerful talent base that matches its AI ambitions.\n\nLuckily, some leading Chinese universities including the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xidian University and Nanjing University have set up AI technology schools, in an effort to meet the country's thirst for AI talent. But that's just one early step on China's journey to AI dominance.\n\nThis comes at a moment when controversy (some would say hysteria) over Facebook's data mining practices is running red hot. The American public is likely to become even more concerned about its privacy, while the Chinese government will continue to not care the tiniest little bit about the privacy concerns of its citizens.\n\nThe danger is worse than China's authoritarian government disregarding privacy concerns in a mad dash to take the A.I. crown. China will actively desire and nourish the very capabilities that are making the West so apprehensive. Our bugs are their features.\n\nFor instance, the Financial Times mentions China's keen interest in facial recognition technology to advance \"the government's ambitious countrywide surveillance plans.\"\n\nThat is just the tip of the iceberg, though. Coincidentally, Google A.I. researcher Francois Chollet wrote a Twitter thread on Wednesday warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence technology intersecting with data mining and the use of \"digital information consumption as a psychological control vector.\" The whole thread is well worth reading, but this passage, in particular, stands out:\n\nIn short, Facebook can simultaneously measure everything about us, and control the information we consume. When you have access to both perception and action, you're looking at an AI problem. You can start establishing an optimization loop for human behavior. A RL loop.\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nA good chunk of the field of AI research (especially the bits that Facebook has been investing in) is about developing algorithms to solve such optimization problems as efficiently as possible, to close the loop and achieve full control of the phenomenon at hand. In this case, us\n\n-- François Chollet (@fchollet) March 21, 2018\n\nIn Chollet's opinion, the reason we are still arguing about pushy ad campaigns, crude bot swarms, and clumsy Silicon Valley censorship instead of full-blown psychological warfare and thought control is that A.I. technology is still lagging behind, but not for much longer. Chollet professes to be frightened of what comes next and concludes by pleading with A.I. researchers to \"show some conscience\" and refrain from helping Facebook develop its system any further.\n\nChollet's nightmare is a dream for authoritarian China. The tyrants of Beijing would read his tweetstorm like an advertisement for a product they would order right now if it were available. China currently employs millions of people to run a censorship engine that is nevertheless slow and clumsy enough to provoke laughter among the oppressed population. Nobody will be laughing once deep-learning systems are running the show.\n\nWhich leaves us with a final chilling thought: it is not so much that China is racing against America to take the gold medal in artificial intelligence research. Based on the amount of money spent, data collected, and practical applications envisioned for the technology, it is more like China versus Facebook.",

                "title": "Mark Zuckerberg's Promise: Zero Transparency, Zero Public Accountability | Breitbart",
                "body": "Mark Zuckerberg has just completed a non-apology tour around the media, conducting interviews with CNN, Recode, and Wired, in which he promised that Facebook would investigate itself, four years after the company first realized it had given developers too much access to data on the friends and families of their users.\n\nThis is the same approach that Facebook adopted during the trending news scandal, when the company came under political pressure for discriminating against conservative news stories in their \"trending\" column. Facebook investigated itself, and (surprise!) found itself innocent.\n\nThen they fired the entire team responsible for trending news, which is exactly what innocent companies do.\n\nIf Zuckerberg really wanted to show users that his company is changing its ways, he would promise a lot more than a Facebook-led investigation of data access.\n\nInstead, he would promise transparency around data. In particular, he would not keep Facebook's investigation internal. He would let users know which third-party apps had access to their data, their friends' data, and to the data of others on the platform -- and how much of it.\n\nTrue, the total number of apps, even if restricted to the pre-2014 period when Facebook's rules around data collection were weak, would number in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands. But cataloging vast amounts of information is the very business of a tech company like Facebook. So why don't they create a publicly-searchable list of every app that had access to user data prior to 2014, ranked according to how many users they collected data from?\n\nSomething tells me Cambridge Analytica wouldn't be close to the top of the list. But Obama's 2012 campaign might.\n\nUsers should also be able to search the database to discover which of the apps have their data. Because, remember, they might not know. Prior to 2014, an app didn't need your permission to grab personally identifying information from your profile -- they only needed permission from one of your Facebook friends.\n\nThat's the loophole that Obama's team exploited to harvest mass quantities of user data, and, quite possibly, win the 2012 election.\n\nIf Facebook wants to escape allegations of poisoning democracy, they also need to be transparent about their recent newsfeed changes, in particular, which sites have lost out and which have benefited. So far, the conservative media have had to highlight the fact that conservative sites, as well as Donald Trump, have been hit particularly badly by Facebook's recent changes. Why won't Facebook release engagement and reach rankings for all news sites that use their platform?\n\nProbably because it would confirm what we know already: that Facebook is now boosting corporate mainstream media at the expensive of the alternative media. After promising publishers an equal playing field for years, the social network has pulled a bait-and-switch, leaving users with the same corporate-controlled information environment that the internet was supposed to liberate them from.\n\nKowtowing to corporations and global elites is now the order of the day at Facebook. Read between the lines of Zuckerberg's media interviews, and you'll see it. He did address the issue of transparency, but only around ad buys, telling CNN that he wants to let users know who is paying for ads on the platform.\n\nBut while users are unlikely to complain about this suggestion, the idea of hostile ads manipulating voters is an obsession of global elites, who think voters are idiots, not ordinary Facebook users. Ordinary Facebook users care about who has access to their data, and why they are no longer allowed to see news organizations they like on their newsfeeds. If Zuckerberg was really interested in transparency, he'd be transparent about that.\n\nHe isn't really apologizing to users -- he's apologizing to politicians and global elites. That's who he really considers himself accountable to -- not the public.",

                "body": "The United States gained 700,000 new millionaires in 2017 due to increases in stock prices and housing values, according to a report released Wednesday.\n\nA report from the Spectrem Group, a firm specializing in providing research to investors, found that more than 11 million households in the U.S. are millionaires -- an increase of more than six percent from 2016.\n\nThe group, defining millionaire households as those having at least $1 million in \"investable assets,\" claimed that the number of new millionaires and number of millionaires overall in the U.S. shattered records.\n\n\"It was the equity markets that really pulled these folks up,\" George Walper, president of Spectrem Group, told CNBC. \"This is the group that has the most equity holdings, so the biggest change is at the high end.\"\n\nThe increase in the number of millionaires in the country largely reflects the country's economic recovery since the financial crisis. Since 2009, the number of millionaire households almost doubled, growing from nearly six million households in that year to more than 11 million households.\n\nWalper said he is optimistic that, barring a stock market crash this year, the number of millionaire households in the U.S. will continue to grow.\n\n\"I think people are pretty optimistic,\" he said. \"But a lot has to do with whether the Democrats take the House and whether we see changes in the tax law. But right now I could see a similar increase next year.\"\n\nSo far, the GOP's tax law has provided benefits to more American households than just millionaires, providing middle-income Americans the opportunity to be that much closer to achieving their goal of becoming millionaires.\n\nAmericans earning between $40,000 and $70,000 would see a 7.1 percent decrease in their taxes, while those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would see their tax bills fall by 10.4 percent.",

Paul has a bone to pick with video game culture. Why? Because video games often promote the notion most prepared or most skilled player should win.\n\n\"Games are based on leveling up and getting stronger,\" Paul said in an interview with Campus Reform. \"We expect the most skilled, hardest working player to win. The typical narrative in a game is a rags to riches story where the player propels the character into a key role and perhaps even attains god-like status.\"\n\n\"All those things shape our expectations and focus players on individuals, rather than the collective,\" Paul added. \"As actualized meritocracies, video games quickly become really toxic spaces where players are focused on individual glory, rather than creating positive spaces for interaction.\"\n\nA description of Paul's book from the University of Minnesota Press reveals that the book will also cover how \"video game's focus on meritocracy\" leads to \"deep-bred misogyny\" and an \"endemic malice of abusive player communities.\"\n\nGame designers, Paul explained in a bizarre paper published in 2012, aim to design games that reward players with better scores as their skills improve. Creating video games that reward players with better scores as their skills improve may seem intuitive but not to Paul.\n\nBecause this desirable reward mechanism is rarely replicated in the real world, Paul condemned the fact that video game designers aim to reward the players that are the \"best.\"",

You've marked the hundredth anniversary of women's suffrage; I'm sure you'll be marking the 50th anniversary of the death of Martin Luther King next month.\"\n\nAdding that, \"17.4 million people in the country voted for Brexit and 1.4 million people in London voted for Brexit - which is more than voted for you as Mayor (1.1 million).\"\n\nWATCH: I ask Remainer Sadiq Khan what he will do to celebrate Brexit Day on 29th March 2019.

Maybe we'll mark that day, when UKIP is finally abolished, with a celebration.\"\n\nMr. Kurten responded calmly, reminding the Mayor he will remaining in the London to at least 2020 and urging him to at least take down the EU flag flying outside City Hall.\n\nSadiq Khan was bitterly opposed to Brexit and has pushed to block it, or for London and the rest of the UK to remain tied to the bloc, ever since the British people vote to leave.\n\nIn September last year, he was agitating for the Labour Party to officially back a second referendum to reverse the vote, and he has consistently called for the UK to stay inside the EU's Single Market, subject to its many rules including open borders and Free Movement.",

                "body": "\"Smokescreens\". This, apparently, is the fancy new euphemism used by climate alarmists to describe what we on the skeptical side of the argument prefer to call \"facts.\"\n\nThe word appears in an interview given by Katharine Hayhoe, professor at Texas Tech where she is director of the Climate Science Center, and a leading member of the climate alarmist establishment. She was a co-author, for example, of the 2014 National Climate Assessment produced during the Obama era. She also featured prominently in the first episode of the global warming propaganda documentary series Years of Living Dangerously.\n\nHere she is, talking to someone calling themselves 'Sierra Club', at EcoWatch.\n\nHayhoe vehemently advises against engaging with the \"smokescreens\" skeptics tend to offer as the reasons they couldn't possibly agree with or act on the issue of climate change. \"There'll be no progress that way,\" she insists. \"It's a lot easier for people to say, 'I have a problem with the science' than it is to talk about what the real problem is.\"\n\nHayhoe might not realize this but she could scarcely have provided more damning evidence of the political nature of \"climate science.\"\n\nIf climate science were robust and real, it would be more than capable of standing up to questioning and debate. But because it's not really about science at all, only about propaganda used to push political outcomes, Hayhoe is only capable of recommending this response when asked challenging questions: change the subject.\n\nWhat about when you get stuck? Say you've landed on shared values -- you and a climate denier agree the weather has been wild, but they just insist, \"Oh, it's just part of the natural cycle.\" What then?\n\nHere's where you pivot and move on, beyond what they disagree on, to something you both agree on. You might offer one phrase of dissent -- perhaps, \"According to natural cycles we should be cooling down right now, not warming.\" But then, before the conversation becomes a game of whack-a-mole, change the subject. Try, \"Did you know that China and India have more solar energy than any other countries in the world? I'm a little worried the U.S. is falling behind; aren't you worried, too?\" At this point you've moved the conversation beyond what they don't agree on. Because whether it's a natural cycle or not, a lot of people are worried about losing the fight in the nuclear energy field. You want to acknowledge what people have to say but not to engage.\n\nEven when she's changing the subject, she can't get her facts right - as Paul Homewood notes here.\n\nKatharine Hayhoe was listed by Time as one of the '100 most influential people of 2014'. She has been described as \"perhaps the best communicator on climate change.\"",

Sarah Higgins, a Pentagon spokeswoman, told the news agency, \"The transfer process is moving forward.\"\n\nIn December, the White House National Security Council (NSC) revealed that it would make decisions on whether to release prisoners still held at Gitmo, \"on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nHowever, Tara Rigler, an NSC spokeswoman, acknowledged that Gitmo, will \"remain an available option in the war on terrorism.\"\n\n\"U.S. officials have not ruled out again adding to the prisoner population and have acknowledged trouble repatriating Islamic State fighters being held by U.S.-backed forces in Syria, raising the possibility that Guantanamo Bay could be seen as a viable option in the future,\" notes Reuters.\n\nGitmo still houses 41 detainees, including 26 who have been deemed \"forever prisoners,\" or too dangerous to release.\n\nNevertheless, the Associated Press (AP) has noted that \"forever prisoners\" may \"potentially be reviewed and added to the cleared list.\"\n\nThe news of the potential release of the Saudi prisoner comes as President Trump met with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), known for implementing wide-ranging reforms in the conservative Sunni kingdom.\n\nSaudi Arabia sends many of the accused and convicted jihadists repatriated from Gitmo to Saudi Arabia to the Mohammed bin Nayef (MBN) Counseling and Care Center.\n\nThe terrorist rehab center reportedly provides a life of luxury where recovering terrorists enjoy the comforts of an indoor swimming pool, sun-splashed patios, large-screen televisions, king size beds, conjugal visits, and lavish gym facilities, all courtesy of Saudi Arabia's deradicalization center.\n\n\"Our focus is on correcting their thoughts, their misconceptions, their deviation from Islam,\" Yahya Abu Maghayed, a director at the facility, told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency during \"a golf cart tour of the sprawling, palm tree-lined complex.\"\n\n\"We make the 'beneficiaries' feel they are normal people and still have a chance -- a chance to return to society,\" added Abu Maghayed, noting that the center avoids calling them prisoners or inmates.\n\nAbu Maghayed boasts that \"86 percent\" of the center's 3,300 graduates have successfully returned to civilian life.\n\nAl-Darbi, the Saudi who will likely be the first Gitmo prisoner released under Trump, became eligible for freedom under the terms of a plea bargain agreement reached under former President Barack Obama.\n\nUnder the deal, \"he admitted to his role in a 2002 attack of against a French-flagged oil tanker off the coast of Yemen and agreed to cooperate with U.S. authorities. He has been held at Guantanamo Bay for 15 years.\"",

                "title": "House Passes $1.3 Trillion, 2,232-Page Omnibus Spending Bill",
                "body": "The House passed the omnibus 255-167, featuring bipartisan support despite conservative opposition to the legislation.\n\nThe House voted to advance the legislation to a floor vote on Thursday morning 211-207.\n\nRepublican leadership released the omnibus bill on Wednesday night giving legislators less than 17 hours to read the bill.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) slammed the passage of the omnibus in a statement on Thursday:\n\nThis is wrong. This is not the limited government conservatism our voters demand. Our constituents -- our employers -- deserve better.\n\nRepublicans in Congress today were faced with a choice: Vote 'yes' and fund the military while embracing record levels of spending with a list of unfulfilled promises; Or vote no, go back to the drawing board, and get to work on a real proposal, with a real process, that funds our troops and actually fights to deliver the bill of goods that we promised the American people.\n\nMembers of the Freedom Caucus chose to vote no, because this omnibus doesn't just forget the promises we made to voters -- it flatly rejects them.\n\nThe White House backed the omnibus spending bill after President Donald Trump discussed the bill with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement:\n\nThe president and the leaders discussed their support for the bill, which includes more funds to rebuild the military, such as the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade, more than 100 miles of new construction for the border wall and other key domestic priorities, like combatting the opioid crisis and rebuilding our nation's infrastructure.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on Wednesday night, \"Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here, but at the end of the day we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included.\"\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Meadows lamented in an interview with Breitbart News Daily on Tuesday that the \"Senate Democrats seem to be calling most of the shots.\"\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the omnibus spending bill contains language that explicitly bars funding for a southern border wall.\n\nThe omnibus also contains provisions that expand the H-2B visa-worker program, which would reduce market pressure on companies to offer American workers higher wages.\n\nRepublican leadership also included provisions that will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct gun research. The omnibus also includes the Fix NICS Act, which would allow for unelected bureaucrats to remove Americans' right to purchase firearms without due process.\n\nThe omnibus spending bill includes funding for the New York Gateway Bridge project that will benefit Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus sternly opposed the omnibus bill; the conservatives sent a letter to the White House, urging president Donald Trump to reject the legislation.\n\nThe House conservatives said that the bill \"outright rejects\" the promises conservatives made to the voters.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) told Fox News on Sunday that Democrats have not abandoned their base by refusing to shut down the government over DACA illegal aliens.\n\nDurbin said, \"We're not going to have a shutdown, but I'm urging leaders to come together and understand there's an emergency here. We have to move on a bipartisan basis.\"\n\n\"We got about 80% of what we were trying to get, and if you can't accept 80%, then the system can't function,\" Congressman John Yarmuth (D-KY) said in an interview.",

                "body": "The funding proposal drafted by House and Senate leadership not only forgets the promises we made to the voters -- it outright rejects them. Below are a few of our specific policy concerns:\n\n* This bill does not provide adequate funding for border security. $1.5 billion will be minimally effective in delivering not just our promise, but your promise, to build a wall and keep our country secure. Sanctuary cities also continue to receive federal funds.\n\n* The bill includes the \"Fix NICS\" proposal, which provides a pathway for unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to revoke, without due process, the rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms.\n\n* The bill fully funds grants that will go to Planned Parenthood.\n\n* The bill does nothing to further our promise to provide Americans relief from Obamacare. We must continue to reduce burdensome regulations in the healthcare marketplace, return to free market principles, and empower consumers. This bill fails on all three fronts.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the omnibus spending bill contains language that explicitly bars funding for a southern border wall.\n\nThe omnibus also contains provisions that expand the H-2B visa-worker program, which would reduce market pressure on companies to offer American workers higher wages.\n\nRepublican leadership also included provisions that will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct gun research.\n\nThe omnibus also has the Fix NICS Act, which would allow unelected bureaucrats to remove Americans' right to purchase firearms without due process.\n\nFurthermore, the omnibus spending bill includes funding for the New York Gateway Bridge project that will benefit Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus came out against the omnibus on Wednesday night, calling the legislation an \"insult to American taxpayers.\"\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus chairman then suggested that Congress should pass another Continuing Resolution (CR) to \"deal with the omni in a more deliberate fashion.\"\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R-LA) said Wednesday that the omnibus spending bill \"is a Great Dane-sized whiz down the leg of every taxpayer.\"\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus continued in its letter to the White House:\n\nThe American people elected us not to buckle, but to deliver. We as the House Freedom Caucus exist to \"give a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them. We support open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the rule of law, and policies that promote the liberty, safety and prosperity of all Americans.\" Each of those principles -- fiscal responsibility, Constitutionalism and candor -- demand a no vote on the omnibus.\n\nThe House conservatives then said, \"We urge you to remember the countless forgotten men and women of America who placed their faith in you to change business as usual in Washington, DC.\"\n\nThe Freedom Caucus concluded, \"We urge you to join us and reject this omnibus.\"",

                "body": "The House Energy and Commerce Committee has asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify over the recent Cambridge Analytica data scandal.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that key congressional lawmakers from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, a group that oversees the actions of companies such as Facebook and Google, has requested that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appear before them to testify in a formal hearing. The chairman of the committee, Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) and the committee's head Democrat representative, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), said in a statement:\n\nThe latest revelations regarding Facebook's use and security of user data raises many serious consumer protection concern. After committee staff received a briefing yesterday from Facebook officials, we felt that many questions were left unanswered. Mr. Zuckerberg has stated that he would be willing to testify if he is 'the right person.'\n\nWe believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people. We look forward to working with Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg to determine a date and time in the near future for a hearing before this committee.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Post. The call to testify before Congress comes after the revelation that the user data of millions of Facebook accounts was allegedly compromised via a personality quiz app. Facebook stock dropped by 6.7 percent on Monday, wiping out all of the company's gains for the year so far. Bloomberg reports that Facebook lost more than Tesla's entire market cap over Monday and Tuesday's market sessions.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Zuckerberg said that Facebook would be reaching out to \"anyone whose data might have been affected\" by the Cambridge Analytica situation \"And going forward, when we identify apps that are similarly doing sketchy things, we're going to make sure that we tell people then, too.\" Surprisingly, the Facebook CEO also discussed the issue of tech regulation, stating that he was not entirely against the idea. \"I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" Zuckerberg said. \"There are things like ad transparency regulation that I would love to see.\"",

U.S Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will also initiate an action against China at the World Trade Organization for violations of international trade laws.\n\n\"The end objective of these actions is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\" Eisenstadt said in a briefing with reporters.\n\nThe U.S. had a trade deficit in goods of $370 billion last year, according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. The administration estimates that this translates into around 2 million lost jobs.\n\n\"China has sought to gain access to intellectual property and cutting-edge technology developed by U..S. business through such wrongful practices as systemic, government-driven investment in U.S. companies, unreasonable requirements and limiting restrictions intended to pressure U.S. firms, and cyber-enabled intrusions,\" Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. began an investigation into China's trade practices focussed on intellectual property, known as a Section 301 investigation, last year, after talks between the Trump administration and Chinese leadership failed to produce meaningful reforms of Chinese policies. That investigation concluded that China has forced U.S. companies to hand over technology to Chinese companies and partner with Chinese companies in order to obtain access to Chinese markets. In addition, the investigation found a concerted effort by the Chinese government to obtain U.S. technology by acquiring U.S. firms, according to Eisenstadt.\n\n\"The aim of the tariffs will be to compensate the U.S. for harm of China's restrictive ownership requirements,\" Narvarro said.\n\nThe administration developed a computer algorithm to calculate that harm, senior administration officials said. Following Thursday's announcement, the U.S. Trade Representative will have 15 days to produce a list of the Chinese products that will be subject to the tariffs. That list will then go through the normal administrative rule-making process, giving the public and companies affected a chance to comment and respond. It's likely that the list will be based on statements by Chinese officials about the areas of technology they seek to dominate.\n\n\"If China dominates the industries of the future, it will be very difficult for the U.S. to have an economic future,\" Navorro said.\n\nAdministration officials said they have engaged in \"significant outreach\" to U.S. allies and trading partners and expect international support for its anti-China program.\n\nThe Treasury Department will be given 60 days to present the president with proposed investment restrictions. According to senior administration officials, Chinese investments in U.S. technology companies are \"not aimed at earning a fair rate of return\" but instead based on strategic and military goals of the Chinese government.\n\n\"China is using its sovereign wealth funds and state-owned vehicles to buy up U.S. technology,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nThe restrictions on investment will go beyond the current process of review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the inter-agency panel that currently reviews acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign entities.\n\n\"The President is standing up for American corporations here. He has their back,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nThe administration says its aims are not to create a trade war but to force China to reform its unfair policies. It says that earlier efforts to get China to change course have failed.\n\n\"The dialogues with China failed under the Bush and Obama administrations,\" a senior administraiton official said. \"In this case, talk is not cheap. It has been very expensive.\"",

This is a complex challenge for U.S. national security and one that requires thinking outside the box.\n\nIncreasing evidence indicates that the Venezuelan regime is using its state apparatus to provide cover and concealment for terrorists and traffickers alike. It's time we consider designating their government as a state sponsor of terrorism and transnational organized crime.\n\nHumire testified among various other experts, warning lawmakers:\n\nThe convergence of criminals, drug traffickers, terrorists, insurgents, and organized crime has increased and evolved. ... No other organization on [the U.S. State Department's] FTO [foreign terrorist organization] list embodies the crime-terror convergence than Lebanese Hezbollah. Of the close to 2,000 actors designated by our government as Foreign Narcotics Kingpins, several are affiliated or connected to Hezbollah.\n\nBy 2014, the Combating Terrorism Center, using a sample of 2,700 known criminals and terrorists in more than 122 countries, determined that nearly all (98 percent) were linked to one another across various illicit sectors including money laundering, drug trafficking, and generating funds to carry out their objectives, which for some involve terrorist attacks. That revelation prompted Humire to note:\n\nNo longer do illicit actors work independently in time and space. ... More importantly, these crime-terror networks are now sharing operating areas, intelligence, tactics, training, and protocols to undermine nation-states and challenge Westphalian state sovereignty.\n\nThe long-time accepted dogma among national security authorities has been that criminal groups were not interested in increasing their profile and bringing law enforcement heat by working with sought-after terrorists.\n\nIf authorities accepted some sort of crime-terrorism relationship, they dismissed it as a business-oriented only transaction, rather than some sort close relationship.\n\nWith the help of its benefactor Iran, Hezbollah has expanded its criminal operations in Latin America, prompting a bipartisan House task force to acknowledged that the Shiite terrorist group is operating a \"virtually unopposed drug trafficking operation\" in South America with links to its fellow U.S.-designated terrorist group the FARC, the top cocaine producer in Colombia.\n\nThe Shitte militia uses its roots in Lebanon to attract supporters and funding from the large Lebanese community in Latin America.\n\nHezbollah terrorists are reportedly providing their services in moving illicit contraband into Europe and the Middle East to other drug trafficking groups in Latin America, including Los Zetas in Mexico.\n\nThe U.S. military has expressed concern that jihadi groups operating in Latin America, namely the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and Hezbollah, could exploit the knowledge of their new criminal partners to infiltrate the United States and bringing in weapons and operatives.\n\nISIS has expressed an interest in using existing smuggling routes used to move contraband out of Latin America into Europe through Africa in reverse -- to traffic potential supporters and even weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).\n\nHumire acknowledged:\n\nRegional cooperation with allied Latin American governments is sorely needed to counter the financial nexus of the crime-terror convergence. I pay special attention to Hezbollah as the gold standard of this convergence. ... For several years, Hezbollah has operated in a state of legal grace in Latin America. Of the countries that do have anti-terrorism laws in Latin America, none recognize Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nHumire pointed out that Hezbollah's involvement in criminal activity no longer renders it an Islamic group.\n\n\"Hezbollah's lust for illicit profits flies in the face of the Shi'a Islamic values it preaches. The recent spike in criminal investigations and drug trafficking indictments against Hezbollah facilitators and affiliates has hurt the legitimacy of the group,\" he said.\n\nThe SFS director urged the United States to label Hezbollah as a Transnational Criminal Organization (TCO) on top of the foreign terrorist organization designation,\" explaining:",

                "body": "The Wall Street Journal reports that a recently released video shows the moment that a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a pedestrian. Convicted felon Rafaela Vasquez, 44, was at the wheel of the car as it was in self-driving mode -- a feature being tested by Uber in many cities across the U.S. and Canada. 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg was walking a bicycle outside the lines of a crosswalk when the self-driving vehicle operated by Vasquez hit Herzberg who later died in a hospital. Vasquez appears to take her eyes off the road for a considerable period of time before the accident in the video.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson commented on the video in a statement saying \"The video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with Elaine's loved ones.\" They continued, \"Our cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state and federal authorities in any way we can.\" No charges have been filed yet against the operator of the vehicle or Uber as Tempe police continue to investigate the situation.\n\nThe car was traveling at approximately 40 miles per hour when it hit Herzberg and it appears as if the cars onboard sensors failed to detect her entirely. Herzberg's death is believed to be the first caused by an autonomous vehicle. Todd Humphreys, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who researches robot-perception systems said \"This video is damning for Uber. This appears to have been a serious failure of the Uber perception system.\" Humphreys said that if the laser sensors called the lidar failed to work \"this accident calls into question Uber's ability to correctly and promptly interpret its data.\"\n\nMissy Cummings, a professor of mechanical engineering and material science at Duke University, noted that Vasquez who was meant to be monitoring and operating the self-driving car was not paying attention to the road. \"The driver was eyes down most of the time, indicating complacency and not maintaining proper monitoring,\" said Cummings.",

The programme is said to reach \"at least 60 people\".\n\nThe Somali Relief and Islamic cultural centre -- which shares an address with the Learner's Academy -- will receive £6,337 \"to deliver five community consultation events for 100 Somali parents and young people in Southwark to raise awareness of knife crime\".\n\nKhan has maintained, throughout his tenure, that he cannot solve London's crime problems due to a lack of funding from central government. But the Mayor has blown millions on \"green\" initiatives, hate-crime monitoring, exclusive toilets for London bus drivers, and other vanity projects.\n\nHammersmith and Fulham Anti-Tribalism Movement -- another organisation already in receipt of UK tax payer cash via the Foreign and Commonwealth Office -- will receive £31,173 for the Anti-Tribalism Movement which will go towards tackling \"anti-social behaviour affecting young Somali men living in London\".\n\nMancunian Way will receive £8,650 to reach \"100 young estate residents engaged in or at risk of knife crime in Hackney\", while Dwaynamics CIC boxing club will receive £49,780.\n\nThe Flavasum Trust -- which produces anti-knife crime murals, theatre pieces, and school performances -- will get £14,016 \"to deliver awareness-raising workshops to 4,000 pupils in 20 London schools in areas worst affected by knife crime, including Newham, Lambeth and Tower Hamlets\", while Raw Material Music and Media Education will get £34,498 to help 50 young people in Brixton \"to engage in creative activities and training and employment workshops over 40 weeks\".\n\nThe final disclosed cash awards will go to the WISE Youth Trust (£20,000) \"to deliver workshops, music production and digital media skills courses for 150 young people in Hackney and Tower Hamlets\" and the ML Community Enterprise group (£32,664) which will \"deliver a therapeutic support project for 24 young male and female victims of crime and violence in Lambeth\".\n\nKhan said on the back of the announcement: \"As Mayor, I'm doing everything possible in London not only to be tough on knife crime, but tough on the causes of knife crime too.\n\n\"City Hall has stepped up where the government is letting our young people down. We are providing unprecedented additional funds to the Met police, driving forward a full and comprehensive Knife Crime Strategy and our new Young Londoners Fund will help many young people to thrive, prosper and make the right choices to avoid being sucked into a life of crime.\n\n\"Prevention is the most effective tool we have, and with the funds announced today, these community and grass-roots projects will be able to help root out violence within our communities and give more young Londoners the skills, support and aspirations they need to turn away from crime and fulfil their potential.\"\n\nThe London mayor has presided over one of the fastest growths in crime in recent history in the UK capital, with homicide rising by 27.1 per cent, youth homicide up by 70 per cent, youth violence up 19 per cent, robbery up 33.4 per cent, and home burglaries rising by 18.7 per cent.\n\nTheft went up by over 10,000 incidents in one year since Khan took office, representing a rise of 33.9 per cent. There have been more than 4,000 additional knife crime incidents under Khan than under his predecessor, a rise of 31.3 per cent.\n\nRape in the capital has risen by 18.3 per cent in the last year, while there were 2,551 incidents of gun crime, representing a rise of 16.3 per cent on the previous year.\n\nChild sex crimes are also up by 30 per cent under Khan, while London's Air Ambulance have been inundated by the increase in stabbings and related call outs in the last year.\n\nA London-based judge recently warned of the violent use of corrosive liquids, especially acid, in Sadiq Khan's London, calling it a \"serious and growing problem\", adding: \"I can state from my own knowledge of the offences arriving at this Crown Court that such offences have risen sharply in the last 12 months.\"\n\nThe Mayor has continuously blamed central government \"police cuts\" for the problems faced, but statistics reveal London only lost around 1,000 police officers (3 per cent) in the past year, reducing the workforce from 31,343 to 30,379. He announced a £6 million flush fund for exclusive toilets for London bus drivers, and a £34 million budget for green projects.\n\nLondon also boasts over 900 police officers \"dedicated to investigating hate crime\" -- one of Khan's top priorities as mayor.\n\nThe London mayor recently travelled to the liberal SXSW in Texas in the United States to bemoan mean tweets being sent at him, while threatening action against social media firms who don't crack down on what he calls \"hate crimes\".",

I think Mark knew, and I think Mark just turned a blind eye to it. ... It's hard for me to believe he just dealt with basketball operations. That's just an untrue statement.\"\n\nI was one of the women Terdema harassed and who spoke to Sports Illustrated for the story. My name is Melissa Weishaupt.\n\nAs is the case for so many females, the #MeToo movement has had relevance and resonance for, well, me too.

I could relate to women who just wanted to do their jobs but who instead had to devote so much time and energy to dealing with predators.\n\nI found myself skeptical of owners and CEOs who prided themselves on knowing the most minute details of their organization but who suddenly claimed to be clueless about a hostile workplace culture.\n\nUSA Today reported on the Sports Illustrated story where Weishaupt was not named.\n\n\"One of the most jarring details revealed in last month's in-depth Sports Illustrated piece detailing the corrosive and hostile work environment at the Mavericks concerned Ussery telling a woman she was going to get 'gang-banged.'\n\n\"As Weishaupt told the Dallas Morning News, she was that woman,\" USA Today reported.\n\n\"He would always bring up motorcycle riders like I was getting gang-banged by motorcycle riders,\" she said. \"It was so often I can't even tell you how many times he said it.\"\n\nShe also said that her attempts to report the misbehavior was ignored or outright rebuffed, according to USA Today.\n\n\"On Aug. 12, 2013, she tried talking to her direct boss, Paul Monroe, who was then the Mav's vice president of marketing,\" USA Today reported.\n\n\"We were in a car together, and he absolutely lost his mind with me,\" she said. \"He had locked me in the car for an hour.

The purpose of the meeting is reportedly to assure the ISBA that Facebook is capable of keeping the personal data of Facebook users safe. If the company is unable to do so, then advertisers may threaten to leave the platform. \"We want to understand the scope of the inquiry Mark Zuckerberg announced yesterday. We want reassurances for our members that it will get to the bottom of the issues and any implications for the public and for advertisers,\" Phil Smith, ISBA director general, told Fox News in a statement.\n\nDavid Kershaw, the founding director of advertising agency M&C Saatchi, stated \"I don't think they're bluffing. They are going to exert real pressure.\"\n\nKershaw said that many ad agency clients have become exasperated with Facebook's regular scandals. \"I think that clients have come to a point, quite rightly, where enough is enough,\" he said. He believes that advertisers pressuring social media companies is more likely to have an effect on the platform than outcry from users, \"It is much more likely to be hard money from advertisers rather than consumers running hashtags on Twitter,\" said Kershaw while discussing the recent #DeleteFacebook and #BoycottFacebook hashtags that became popular following Facebook's latest scandal.\n\nKershaw stated \"From the consumers' point of view, you have these extraordinary services you get from your social media and there's an exchange, you're giving your data. I think that most consumers accept that deal unless it comes to where we are now where that data is abused.\" Consumer goods giant Unilever threatened to pull advertising from Facebook and Google recently if they did not do more to crack down on extremist content online. Unilever's chief marketing officer Keith Weed, said: \"We cannot have an environment where our consumers don't trust what they see online.\"\n\nKershaw said that while companies have a choice of platforms to advertise their products \"we live in a very strong oligopoly with Facebook and Google.\" He added that M&C Saatchi is predicting that digital media advertising will grow by 10% this year but \"60p in every £1 of that increase will go to Facebook and Google and that's not healthy.\"\n\nThe CEO of WPP, the largest advertising company in the world, called Facebook and Google a \"duopoly\" in digital marketing last year.",

                "body": "John Dowd, the lead attorney representing President Donald Trump in dealing with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign, has resigned.\n\nDowd gave no reason for his resignation, but it came just days after Mueller had submitted a list of questions to the White House as the Special Counsel's office sought to interview the president. Following the submission of those questions, President Trump had posted several tweets criticizing Mueller's entire investigation: \"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" he tweeted on Sunday.\n\nDowd's resignation also came after the president appointed former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has been a harsh critic of Mueller's investigation, saying it was a political setup to hurt Trump.\n\nUntil now, President Trump's legal team has pursued a strategy of cooperation with Mueller -- a strategy that was reaffirmed Thursday by Jay Sekulow, another one of the president's lawyers. Ty Cobb, another attorney on the team, has repeatedly said in public that the investigation is winding to a close -- though he has been wrong every time.\n\nLast month, after Mueller indicted 13 Russians on charges related to meddling in the 2016 election -- though none of the charges affected the vote, and none involved collusion with the Trump campaign -- Dowd told the media that he was glad: \"I think the special counsel found the culprits. I think he did a good job. I think he did a hell of a job.\"\n\nThe days of applauding Mueller, however, may soon be over, as the Special Counsel appears to have left the question of Russian collusion behind in favor of the question of whether President Trump obstructed justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey. Comey testified to Congress last year that after Trump had fire him, he had leaked memoranda to the media specifically to prompt the appointment of a special counsel to probe Trump.\n\nDowd is well-regarded in Beltway legal circles. However, last September, he committed a major error when he and Cobb discussed the Mueller investigation openly at an outdoor table at a popular Washington, DC, restaurant. The conversation was overheard by New York Times reporter Ken Vogel, who happened to be seated at the next table.\n\nHere's a photo of Ty Cobb & John Dowd casually & loudly discussing details of Russia investigation at @BLTSteakDC while I sat at next table. pic.twitter.com/RfX9JLJ0Te\n\n-- Kenneth P.

The young warrior has spent the last 130 days in a tireless battle to strengthen her lungs and emerge from this tragic interruption to her life. She has already managed to eat tacos, visit the chapel, and now, pace the halls of the hospital itself.\n\nIt started with a bet: Uwadia was promised that if she could stand for five minutes on her own, the doctors would find a way to help her walk. She stood for seven. Inspired, the doctors created an ECMO rig specifically to allow her the mobility she craved. But for Uwadia, \"it was one step closer to getting home.\"",

We need to make sure that we don't make that mistake ever again, which is why one of the things I announced today is we're going to do a full investigation into every app that had access to a large amount of data from around this time, before we locked down the platform,\" declared Zuckerberg in an interview with CNN. \"And we're now just not going to take people's word for it when they give us a legal certification. If we see anything suspicious, which I think there probably were signs in this case that we could've looked into, we're going to do a full forensic audit.\"\n\n\"I think the question here is are app developers, people who have been given access to their data, are they doing something that people don't want? Or are they selling the data in a way that people don't want? Are they giving it to someone they don't have authorization to do? This is something I think we now need to go and figure out,\" he continued, adding, \"The good news here is we already changed the platform policies in 2014, but before that we know what the apps were which had access to data, we know how many people were using those services, and we can look at the patterns of their data requests, and based on that we think we'll have a pretty clear sense of whether anyone was doing anything abnormal, and we'll be able to do a full audit of anyone who is questionable.\"\n\nZuckerberg concluded that, \"It's hard to know what we'll find, but we're going to review thousands of apps. So, this is going to be an intensive process, but this is important.\"\n\nThe Facebook CEO also insisted on self-investigation and auditing in his statement on Wednesday.\n\nDespite this, Cambridge Analytica will be subjected to an audit conducted by a third party hired by Facebook.\n\nFollowing the Cambridge Analytica data controversy, Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook platform operations manager, claimed in an interview that Facebook routinely mishandled user data, allegedly giving it freely to many third parties, and expressing a lack of interest in finding out what the companies were doing with it.\n\nAlthough Facebook may insist it can investigate itself, its data security practices, and third-party app developers, it has been reported that the FTC is investigating Facebook as well.",

I don't think we told the voters when we were running for the job, and they gave us the privilege to come here and serve that continue to fund Planned Parenthood, and we were going to restrict Second Amendment liberties -- let some bureaucrat take away Second Amendment rights and a court of law. I don't think they said we were going to fund this gateway earmarked boondoggle project and not fund the border wall. The one thing we don't fund is the one issue we all campaigned on a border security wall, and that is not in the legislation. So it can't get any worse than this bill. We should stop. We should go back to the drawing board. If we have to do a short-term funding bill, do that. But go back and do something consistent with what the voters elected us to do.\"",

When asked would he be willing to testify before Congress about the situation, Zuckerberg stated, \"I'm open to doing that. We actually do this fairly regularly ... There are lots of different topics that Congress needs and wants to know about, and the way that we approach it is that our responsibility is to make sure that they have access to all of the information that they need to have.\" But Zuckerberg did hedge this offer by saying, \"the short answer is, I'm happy to if it's the right thing to do\"\n\nEssentially, Zuckerberg is saying that while he may be willing to testify before Congress if absolutely necessary, it's very likely that Facebook will once again send a panel of lawyers and executives in place of the company's CEO. Zuckerberg did admit that the company has made mistakes, however, saying that they possibly should not have opened up user data to third-party services so widely in 2007, and further exasperated that issue in 2008 with the launch of Facebook Connect which aimed to integrate users Facebook profile and friends group with other apps.\n\n\"Frankly, I just think I got that wrong,\" said Zuckerberg. \"There was this values tension playing out between the value of data portability -- being able to take your data and some social data, the ability to create new experiences -- on one hand, and privacy on the other hand,\" he said. \"I was maybe too idealistic on the side of data portability, that it would create more good experiences -- and it created some -- but I think what the clear feedback from our community was that people value privacy a lot more.\" Zuckerberg also stated that the company should have done more to confirm that Cambridge Analytica had deleted the data of 50 million Facebook users, as they had claimed they did. \"At the time it didn't seem like we needed to go further on that,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Given what we know now, we clearly should have followed up, and we're never going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nFacebook claims it will begin investigating other app developers to see if they violated users privacy as Cambridge Analytica allegedly did, but this will be no easy feat. \"The data isn't on our servers, so it would require us sending out forensic auditors to different apps,\" explained Zuckerberg. \"We do know all the apps that registered for Facebook, and all the people who were on Facebook who registered for those apps, and have a log of the different data requests that the developers made. So we can get a sense of -- what are the reputable companies? What are companies that were doing unusual things?\"\n\nZuckerberg seemed to express a desire to take a more hands-off approach to community decisions saying \"A lot of the most sensitive issues that we face today are conflicts between real values, right? Freedom of speech, and hate speech and offensive content. Where is the line?\" Zuckerberg's proposed solution is to give power to the Facebook community, \"What I would really like to do is find a way to get our policies set in a way that reflects the values of the community, so I am not the one making those decisions,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I feel fundamentally uncomfortable sitting here in California in an office making content policy decisions for people around the world.\"\n\n\"[The] thing is like, 'Where's the line on hate speech?' I mean, who chose me to be the person that did that?\" Zuckerberg said. \"I guess I have to, because of [where we are] now, but I'd rather not.\"",

And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change.\"\n\nThe Mail noted that the Obama's sent a handwritten letter to \"youth activists\" from from Florida's Parkland high school, urging them to keep up the fight.\n\nThe letter came just weeks after Barack praised the way students were organizing for gun control in response to the Parkland school shooting. He told them, \"How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We've been waiting for you. And we've got your backs.\"\n\nThe student march for gun control enjoys celebrity support from Julianne Moore, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Alyano Milano, Josh Gad, Amy Schumer, and others. George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, Jeffery Katzenberg, and Steven Spielberg have pledged to contribute $500,000 each toward the march.",

                "body": "Veteran actor Bill Murray praised the Parkland, Florida, students who became gun control activists after last month's mass shooting, comparing the teens in an NBC op-ed to Vietnam War protesters.\n\n\"I was thinking, looking at the kids in Parkland, Florida who have started these anti-gun protests, that it really was the students that began the end of the Vietnam War,\" wrote Murray, who rarely expresses a political opinion. \"It was the students who made all the news, and that noise started, and then the movement wouldn't stop. I think, maybe, this noise that those students in Florida are making -- here, today -- will do something of the same nature.\"\n\nThe famed Ghostbusters star said influencing lawmakers to pass gun control measures will require the same comprehensive campaigning that it took from student protesters to pressure President Richard Nixon to launch efforts to end the Vietnam War.\n\n\"You've got to surround a deeply political issue like gun control or a war, to come at it from every single direction,\" Murray wrote. \"You can't just focus on one thing, or aim for just the one goal.\"\n\n\"People will survive. If you can just stop shooting at them, they really do pretty well,\" writes the Golden Globe and Emmy-winning actor. \"It's the right idea for a human to live in peace, and a peaceful nature is a proper thing. For children to be concerned about going to school, worried about what could happen to them at school, that makes for a horrible moment. It's just a horrible place for us to be at.\"\n\nMurray marvels at the idealism driving the anti-gun student activists and insists that there are \"idealists left over the age of 18.\"\n\nThe Caddyshack star, who called the Republican tax cuts plan \"fantastic\" last month and slammed identity politics, is currently promoting his new Wes Anderson-directed animated movie Isle of Dogs.\n\nThe 67-year-old is the latest Hollywood star to come out in support of the student gun control activist, who are set to take center stage this weekend at the star-studded gun control March for Our Lives in Washington D.C.",

                "title": "Curtis Ellis on Trump's Tariffs: 'We Will Be an Agricultural Colony for China' if Trade Status Quo Remains",
                "body": "\"If we keep going the way we're going, we will be an agricultural colony for China,\" said Curtis Ellis, praising President Trump's tariff crackdown on China's trade abuses, during a Wednesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\n\nEllis, the senior policy advisor for America First Policies, said the Chinese state extorts American businesses by demanding access to intellectual property in exchange for entry into the Chinese market. American businesses, he added, were largely silent about the extortion due to fear of being shut out of the Chinese market.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\"The president is scheduled to announce $50 billion in tariffs against China as part of a year-long investigation that's been conducted by the U.S. trade representative and the Commerce Department into Chinese deliberate theft of intellectual property [and] theft of our trade secrets,\" said Ellis. \"They have policies in place where basically they steal what they don't extort from us. They tell American companies, 'If you want to do business in China' -- they hold out a carrot of this huge market of potential Chinese consumers -- they say, 'Well, you have to bring in a Chinese partner, and then you have to give us your blueprints, trade secrets, and technology if you want to do business over here.'\"\n\n\"That which our businesses don't hand over to them, they find a way to steal through cyber-espionage and other means,\" Ellis continued. \"This is well-documented, [and] it's been ongoing. What's changed, now, is that we have a president who's willing to call them out on it. Up until now, even the businesses who are being robbed blind were reluctant to speak out against it and speak out about it and actually were lobbying against our government taking any action because they were hypnotized by this dream of a huge market of Chinese consumers, and they did not want to get on the wrong side of the Chinese government, but it's become so egregious that even the businesses who have been lobbying against taking action against China are now saying, 'Enough is enough, we've got to do something.'\"\n\nThe Apparel and Footwear Association of America is a de facto voice of the Chinese state, suggested Ellis.\n\n\"The apparel and footwear industries are basically wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Chinese Communist Party [and] the Chinese government,\" assessed Ellis. \"So much of the textile and apparel and footwear business is sewn up by the Chinese. Basically, we're just importing everything. When you see a press release from the Apparel and Footwear Association of America, it's basically the Apparel and Footwear Importers from China Association. So they're going to be screaming, 'Oh my Gosh, Americans are going to be barefoot and dressed in rags because of these tariffs.'\"\n\nEllis also framed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as a de facto voice of the Chinese government.\n\n\"The U.S Chamber of Commerce, in anticipation of this a couple of days ago, put out a press release saying, 'Well, you know we don't want a trade war, and rather than imposing tariffs, these should be done very surgically and we should engage with China to correct this.' Well, that's exactly what we've been doing for the last few decades and it hasn't worked, but the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is basically the Importer's Chamber of Commerce.\n\nEllis echoed Steven Mosher's and Michael Pillsbury's warnings that China seeks to destroy certain American industries via predatory operations.\n\n\"The Chinese government is involved in subsidizing their state-owned enterprises for the explicit purpose of driving American free enterprise into extinction,\" declared Ellis. \"They are not engaged in free market activity over there in Beijing. It is a command economy, and they are looking at the long-term and the they are saying, 'We will subsidize our industries in the short-term in order to get the long-term advantage. Once we have all of the technology and have a corner on the world markets, then we will be free to do whatever want.'\"\n\nEllis described \"free trade ideology\" as myopic and reductionist as an analytical tool for international relations.\n\n\"The entire free trade ideology by the radical British Richard Cobden said, 'Since we have free trade, armies are going to become a thing of the past [and] divided nations will wither away,' which sounds a lot like what Karl Marx said about would happen under communism,\" Ellis said. \"That never happened. Under this what I call 'phony free trade' with China -- because they're a mercantilist country -- their military has only gotten bigger. They're now spreading their influence throughout South America, Central America, Africa, and elsewhere. So we have to do something. Thomas Jefferson was a free trader, but after the War of 1812 when he saw the White House burned by the British, he said, 'We must have our manufacturing industries. Even if costs a little more, we should be buying what's made in America.'\"\n\n\"We don't want blunt instruments,\" said Ellis of tariffs' application. \"We want to use this wisely, but we have to take some action because we are in an economic war right now with a country that does not have our interests at heart [and] does not share our values. If we keep going the way we've been going, this whole idea of free enterprise will be something we read about in history books, but of course those history books will be censored by the Chinese censors and it will become a forgotten dark age.\"\n\nMansour cast tariffs as an essential tool to combat China's theft of intellectual property.\n\n\"If we don't do this, then what are we going to do?\" asked Mansour. \"Do we just sit back and let them basically steal our intellectual property and extort our businesses who are trying to get entry into their market? ...We take everything they send us, but they don't take anything that we send them, or they make the rules of entry so ridiculous that we hand over our intellectual property. It ultimately comes down to, what are we supposed to do? Just nothing? Are we so wedded to this idea of free trade at all costs, regardless of whether it's killing us, that we'll just unilaterally disarm and say, 'Okay let the Chinese take over because we have to have cheap goods.'?\"\n\nChina violates the rules of the World Trade Organization ostensibly composed to protect free trade, said Ellis.\n\n\"The practices that China is engaged in are against the rules of the world trading system, of the actual institutions that were set up to promote so-called free trade,\" Ellis said. \"I say 'so-called' because I think it's managed trade. I think it's like dividing up markets the way a cartel would. What is called free trade under the World Trade Organization allows for tariffs to be imposed against those who aren't playing by the rules, but no one has had the courage to stand up and say, 'The Emperor has no clothes.' What China is doing is against the rules.\"\n\nMansour invited Ellis to comment on Peter Schweizer's latest book on governmental corruption, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.\n\n\"[The Chinese] typically buy off the big interests, political or financial interests in the targeted country and they turn those people into lobbyists for their interests,\" replied Ellis. \"So the Chinese have lobbyists inside the Fortune 50 companies on Wall Street. .. They know that Wall Street an the financial industry in America is the most powerful industry. ... It is classic Chinese military strategy, that you win the war without firing a shot, by getting the interests in your enemy's camp to do your bidding.\"\n\nEllis concludes by framing China's economic and trade policies as threats to American sovereignty and national self-determination.\n\n\"Have we become so addicted and fetishizing cheap goods that that's all we care about?\" asked Ellis. \"What price are we willing to pay to have an independent country and to be self-determinant of our future? If we keep going the way we're going, we will be an agricultural colony for China, we will be growing pigs, growing food for the Chinese industrial military machine. That is the direction we are going. That's what they have in mind for us. That may be fine for the senator from Nebraska, because he doesn't really care, it's good for his constituents in China, but I don't think that's the way it's supposed to be.\"\n\n\"I'm not really interested in living in the world of the Hunger Games,\" quipped Mansour.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live Monday through Friday on SiriusXM's Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).",

Mass migration has also forced the government to consider raising the retirement age to pay for the added strain on the country's social services and others have predicted that municipalities will be forced to raise taxes, as well.",

                "body": "While Trump's own numbers (in this particular poll) are nothing to shout about, he is in better shape than the media. For example, only 53 percent disapprove of the way Trump is doing his job (the lowest number yet in this poll), while 40 percent approve.\n\nTrump even scores a tad better with the way he handles the media, which is mostly with the contempt the disgraced institution deserves. A full 38 percent approve of the way Trump talks about the media, while 58 percent disapprove.\n\nPublic perception of the media might help to explain why -- despite a 24/7 onslaught against Trump using Putin, Playmates, and porn stars -- his approval rating has been steadily climbing. As of this writing, and over the last couple weeks, Trump's Real Clear Politics' average approval rating has edged up 2 points, to a relatively healthy 42 percent. His disapproval rating has climbed down by an equal amount.\n\nTwo points is not much and could just be statistical noise. Nevertheless, these numbers certainly prove that the public is tuning the media out. When Trump only receives 48 percent of the popular vote in 2016, but 59 percent still disapprove of the vehemently anti-Trump media's coverage of him, that shows how healthy our democracy is.\n\nOther poll results include mostly bad news for Trump, but I have bolded the good news:\n\nOn Quinnipiac's generic mid-term ballot, Democrats only hold a +6 point lead. A full 49 percent want Democrats to win control of congress, compared to 43 percent for Republicans. The overall trend is good news for the GOP. In February, Quinnipiac gave Democrats a +15 point led; earlier this month that lead was +10.\n\nThe latest Reuters poll shows the same trend. Currently, Democrats lead by just +3. But in February, Democrats had a +9 lead. Two weeks ago, it was +8.\n\nReuters also has Trump's job approval at healthy 44 percent, while his disapproval sits at 52 percent.\n\nThe other day I sat for a few minutes in a waiting room filled with strangers. CNN was on the TV, which means the coverage was all about a porn star who alleges she had an affair with Trump 12 years ago. To a person, we all quickly bonded in that little room by rolling our eyes at CNN in amused disgust.\n\nThe media no longer have the credibility or moral authority to affect public opinion. In fact, based on these poll numbers, it is not unreasonable to believe that the media's hypocritical, anti-Trump hysteria is benefiting the president -combined with the fact he is a doing a solid job as president.",

As these social media platforms emerged, Facebook, Twitter -- let's stick to Facebook, they basically said 'let's give people power, we're gonna put power back in the hands of people and this social media is going to a be a level playing field where people can communicate without corporate interference.' And now basically, after monopolizing social media, getting everyone onto their platforms, they just changed everything overnight and if you look at the numbers, it's been to the benefit of a very select few media companies and media executives.\"\n\n\"Fox, MSNBC, and CNN are the big winners with this change, and so Facebook has made this change veiled under 'oh we want to show more of what your friends want to see' well really they want to decide what news is real, what you should see and what they've decided is that the same corporate media establishment that's been deciding our narrative for the last 40 years, who sold us the war in Iraq and whatnot, are the people that we should be listening to. And what they're doing is marginalizing any voice that isn't in lockstep with really the party of one, this corporate media establishment which is really toxic to our democracy and to free speech everywhere.\"",

                "body": "Zuckerberg is currently on a public relations tour to clean up the mess created after news broke that a data firm, Cambridge Analytica, harvested data from tens of millions of Facebook users.\n\nThe media are primarily upset that Cambridge Analytica has some ties to President Trump. When the 2012 Obama re-election campaign did this same kind of data harvesting on Facebook, the media praised the genius of Team Obama's use of this ill-gotten information to micro-target voters. The idea that Trump might have done the same, however, horrifies the media, even though the president's campaign did not use the firm to target voters during the general election.\n\nIn other words, much of this scandal is a big pile of fake news, a way for the media to hang on to the fantasy that Trump cheated and is not legitimate.\n\nNevertheless, the idea that Facebook users are having their data harvested without consent is worrisome, so Zuckerberg came out of hiding with some well-rehearsed talking points Wednesday night. One notable statement was his claim that Facebook does not sell data to anyone -- which many believe is how Facebook makes a lot of its money.\n\n\"You know, one of the big misconceptions about Facebook is this idea that we somehow sell data. We don't sell any data to anyone and that's actually a really key part of the model,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Both for protecting people's personal data and privacy, but also because, you know the competitive advantage of a lot of our services[.]\"\n\nHe added that selling data to advertisers, which would allow them to target potential buyers, is not something Facebook does. \"We don't want data to be able to get out. When that happens, that's not good for people in our community, that's not good for our business. So, that's not actually how ads work on the service and it actually has never been.\"\n\nInstead, Zuckerberg explains, Facebook uses the user data to do the targeting on behalf of advertisers so the advertisers can still micro-target and get the best bang for the buck, but the user data stays inside Facebook. \"An advertiser can come to us and say, 'Hey, I'd like to reach women within this age range' and if we understand who is in that then we can show that ad but none of that information goes to the advertiser.\"\n\nBecause this is CNN we are talking about, naturally, Zuckerberg was not asked about the credible claim that the left-wing Facebook stood by and allowed the Obama campaign to harvest its data.",

We are grateful to Ranking Member Nita Lowey, our appropriators and staff for delivering progress on critical priorities, while successfully removing many dangerous poison pills.\n\n\"Thanks to the leadership of Democrats, the omnibus proposal contains bold investments in our veterans, the NIH, community health centers, and families fighting opioid addiction.

The bill does not allow any increase in deportation officers or detention beds. We are disappointed that we did not reach agreement on Dreamer protections that were worthy of these patriotic young people. We will continue to ask the Speaker to give us a vote to protect Dreamers and honor our values.\n\n\"House Democratic Members will now assess the whole package and weigh its equities.

There are days when we need to be the best news and information sports broadcast that there is; to cover a big story with the resources of ESPN.\"\n\nExecutive producer, Bill Wolff, was even more on topic with social justice issues saying, \"when players take a knee, then it deserves coverage and conversation.\"\n\nFor his part, Rose took it even farther by congratulating ESPN on allowing him to go off into politics whenever he feels like it.\n\n\"If something political makes itself part of our world, we are dishonest and inauthentic if we don't discuss it.\" Rose added that he has \"never been muzzled in any way\" at ESPN. \"I appreciate the fact that I'm able to talk about more than what happened in last night's NBA game.

Zuckerberg was notably silent about the data scandal until yesterday when he published a Facebook post addressing the issue that caused the company's stock value to plummet. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" wrote Zuckerberg. \"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.\"\n\nIn his interview with CNN, Zuckerberg seemed to echo many of the same talking points, stating at the start of the interview \"This was a major breach of trust, and I'm really sorry that this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect peoples' data.\" The Facebook CEO stated that the company will be \"restricting access\" that developers have going forward and will alert users to \"sketchy apps\" that may attempt to steal their data. \"That's definitely that something looking back on this, I regret that we didn't do at the time and I think we got that wrong and we are committed to getting that right going forward,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nZuckerberg gave some background info on the Cambridge Analytica situation, at one point stating that Facebook believed that the data analysis firm had deleted user info it had gained from Facebook app developer Aleksandr Kogan. \"In 2015 journalists from the Guardian told us that they had evidence that data that this app developer, Aleksandr Kogan, who built this personality app and a ton of people used it, had sold that data to Cambridge Analytica,\" Zuckerberg stated. \"And when we heard that, that's against the policy, we immediately banned Kogan's app.\" Zuckerberg stated that Facebook requested proof that Cambridge Analytica had deleted sensitive user info, \"We asked for a formal certification that they had none of the data from anyone in the Facebook community and if they had it they deleted it and provided certification of that.\"\n\nZuckerberg said that Facebook would be reaching out to \"anyone whose data might have been affected\" by the Cambridge Analytica situation \"And going forward, when we identify apps that are similarly doing sketchy things, we're going to make sure that we tell people then, too.\" Surprisingly, the Facebook CEO also discussed the issue of tech regulation, stating that he was not entirely against the idea. \"I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" Zuckerberg said. \"There are things like ad transparency regulation that I would love to see.\"\n\nWorryingly, however, the Facebook CEO also said that he believes someone may be attempting to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections. \"I'm sure someone's trying, right?\" Zuckerberg said. \"I'm sure there's, you know, version two of whatever the Russian effort was in 2016. I'm sure they're working on that, and there are going to be some new tactics we make sure we observe and get in front of them.\" Zuckerberg admitted that the company failed on a number of levels during the 2016 election, \"What's clear is that in 2016 we were not as on top of a number of issues as we should have, whether it was Russian interference or fake news.\" He continued to say, \"The reality here is that this isn't rocket science, I mean there's a lot of hard work that we need to do to make it harder for nation-states like Russia to do election interference, to make it so that trolls and other folks can't spread fake news.\"",

Speaking to a Sydney radio station 2GB on Thursday, he confirmed he wants to help the farmers come to Australia under humanitarian visas. Mr. Dutton said:\n\nAll the criticism over the last week has meant nothing to me. We're looking at ways we can help people to migrate to Australia if they find themselves in that situation. We've been inundated with messages of support and references for particular cases.\n\nIt concerns me that people are being persecuted at the moment, that's the reality -- the number of people dying or being savagely attacked in South Africa is a reality.\n\nThere's lots of outrage from some of the crazy lefties at the ABC, the Guardian and Huffington Post can express concern and draw mean cartoons about me and all the rest of it -- they don't realise how completely dead they are to me.\n\nMr. Dutton's push to help white South African farmers has been supported by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, who has described the situation in South Africa as a \"national crisis.\"\n\n\"There is a very serious situation developing in South Africa. Something like 400 white farmers have been murdered, brutally murdered, over the last 12 months,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\nThe farmers were being murdered by \"squatters intent on driving them off their land\", he added, and it would be a \"national crisis\" if the same thing were happening to Australian farmers.\n\n\"If the boot was on the other foot we would call it racism of the worst sort,\" Mr Abbott said.",

                "body": "Youth in the United Kingdom are among the least religious in post-Christian Europe, with some 70 percent self-identifying as having \"no religion,\" according to a new report.\n\nReligion in Europe is \"moribund,\" said Stephen Bullivant, the author of a report titled Europe's Young Adults and Religion. \"With some notable exceptions, young adults increasingly are not identifying with or practising religion,\" said Bullivant, a professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University in London.\n\n\"The new default setting is 'no religion,' and the few who are religious see themselves as swimming against the tide,\" he said.\n\nThe report analyzes data from the latest European social survey of 16- to 29-year-olds across 21 nations in Europe, plus Israel.\n\nWhile British youth are irreligious across the board, the Church of England has suffered particularly noteworthy losses.\n\nYoung Muslims in the UK are poised to overtake Anglicans, with the youth population of Britain's established church only one percentage point ahead of Islam, at 7 percent and 6 percent respectively. Given Muslims' significantly higher birthrate than that of Anglicans, it shouldn't be long before more young British self-identify as Muslim than as Anglican.\n\nThe number of young Catholics has already passed that of the Church of England, with some ten percent of British between the ages of 16 and 29 professing the Catholic faith.\n\nNot only are UK youth less likely to be affiliated with any religion, they also seldom pray, the report found. Among 16- to 29-year-olds, approximately two-thirds (63 percent) say they \"never pray,\" another 19 percent say they pray \"less than once a week\" and the remaining 18 percent say they pray once a week or more.\n\n\"Christianity as a default, as a norm, is gone, and probably gone for good - or at least for the next 100 years,\" Bullivant said.\n\nWhile many young Europeans are still baptized, he said, a good number of these \"never darken the door of a church again.\"\n\n\"Cultural religious identities just aren't being passed on from parents to children,\" he said. \"It just washes straight off them.\"\n\nAccording to Bullivant, while churches like the Church of England are losing members among the less actively religious, they are holding on to a fervent core of believers.\n\n\"In 20 or 30 years' time, mainstream churches will be smaller, but the few people left will be highly committed,\" he said.\n\nIn this regard, what is happening in the UK finds parallels in the United States as well.\n\nAnalysing recent scholarship, Glenn T. Stanton observed that while moderate religion is slipping in the United States, intense religious belief and practice, especially among Christians, is holding strong and even increasing.\n\nChurches in America, too, will have smaller congregations in the future, but they will be more highly engaged with the faith.",

                "body": "The GOP's business-first leadership has expanded the H-2B visa-worker program, so reducing marketplace pressure on companies to offer higher wages to Americans just months before the November election.\n\nThe pre-election giveaway is buried on page 1760 of the 2232-page 2018 omnibus bill, where language allows the Department of Homeland Security to greatly expand the size of the H-2B visa-worker program up to roughly 100,000 imported workers:\n\nSEC. 205. Notwithstanding the [66,000] numerical limitation set forth in section 214(g)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(1)(B)), the Secretary of Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of Labor, and upon the determination that the needs of American businesses cannot be satisfied in fiscal year 2018 with United States workers who are willing, qualified, and able to perform temporary nonagricultural labor, may increase the total number of aliens who may receive a visa under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b)) in such fiscal year above such limitation by not more than the highest number of H-2B nonimmigrants who participated in the H-2B returning worker program in any fiscal year in which returning workers were exempt from such numerical limitation.\n\nThe jargon gives the green light to Senators and Representatives to pressure DHS leaders until unless they agree to hand out more H-2B visas to the politicians' local employers.\n\nEmployers got their H-2B guestworker program expansion in the #omnibus - same as FY 2017, gives DHS discretion to increase the size of the program, up to approximately double the annual cap of 66,000. See page 1760: https://t.co/nDmEiR1l31\n\n-- DC (@costadaniel) March 22, 2018\n\nThe provision was pushed by Democratic and GOP politicians, led by North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\nMany thanks, @timkaine & @MarkWarner for signing the letter to our Senate leaders urging them to include language in the FY18 omnibus package requiring caps to be increased for temporary worker visas. #SaveH2B. Time is running out for many small businesses.\n\n-- Green Acres Lawn Care (@GreenAcresLawnC) March 15, 2018\n\n\"This shows that Congress uses the budget process to grant special access to insider lobbyists,\" said lawyer John Miano, who opposes visa-worker programs. \"By granting the ability to slip special interest provisions into a bill that must pass Congress, it rewards those who supply donations,\" he added.\n\nThe H-2B visa-workers are imported by landscapers, forestry companies, seafood processors, construction firms, resorts, hotels and restaurants to import foreign workers for seasonal work. The imported workers are not cheap -- see the data here -- but their arrival means that employers do not have to raise their wages to persuade Americans to take seasonal jobs.\n\nMoreover, if they raised their wages high enough to attract Americans to the seasonal jobs, then the companies would also have to raise wages for their year-round and supervisory workers.\n\nThose extra wages would reduce company profits, raise costs and reduce the number of customers, and shrink the number of companies. But the extra wages would also leave hundreds of thousands of American voters working in higher-wage jobs, and would also nudge many additional employers to raise wages.\n\nThat free-market outcome is anathema to many GOP leaders, including House Majority Leader Paul Ryan. He has repeatedly said that immigration rules should be tuned to help employers -- not employees -- and that CEOs should be allowed to hire \"any willing worker,\" even if those workers live far outside the United States.\n\nIn 2015, Ryan sharply increased the size of the H-2B program, but after Donald Trump's shocking victory in 2016, he let the program return to the 66,000 level.\n\nIn 2017, Ryan against pushed to expand the program with a 2018-style rule that encouraged legislators to pressure DHS officials for additional visas. Under then-DHS chief John Kelly, the agency reluctantly granted some additional visas, but far fewer than sought by business groups.\n\nIn 2018, the Department of Homeland Security has started distributing the 66,000 regular H-2B visas via a lottery because so many companies asked for a share of the H-2B visas.\n\nThe H-2B program is dwarfed by the size of the white-collar guest worker programs, via the H-1B, L-1, J-1, H-4, TN, and OPT programs. Collectively, these white-collar outsourcing visas keep more than 1 million foreign university graduates in healthcare, computer, business, and design jobs sought by American graduates.\n\nThe existence of the H-2B visa program creates a \"crony-capitalist\" economy. Companies which win the government-provided workers get to reduce their payroll costs, win more customers and generate more profits. Companies which do not get H-2B workers shrink and lose business. This dynamic forces many companies and labor-brokers to compete for the H-2Bs and to lobby for even more H-2Bs, so generating business donations and endorsements for politicians -- at the cost of cutting wages for many Americans.\n\nThe program also distorts local economies. For example, in forest towns, the program allows out-of-state forestry contractors to ignore local job-applicants in favor of foreign H-2B workers.",

                "body": "In the wake of the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, pundits and politicians have proposed dozens of ideas to prevent the next school shooting that range from banning semi-automatic weapons to arming teachers. When elected to Congress in the fall, I will put forward a bill with an America First answer to this problem.\n\nSchools have become soft targets for individuals suffering from specific mental disorders; this unfortunate situation has become our new normal. However, that doesn't mean we have to ban guns or arm teachers to combat this issue. As the nation saw from the school shooting on Tuesday at Great Mills High School in Maryland, the best way to defend students from mass shootings is to have armed guards on school property.\n\nThe America First position is for our federal government to pay unemployed or retired military and police officers to arm our schools, tackling two issues at once: Creating jobs for veterans and retired police while keeping our schools safe.\n\nAs of 2014, according to The National Center for Educational Statistics, there are 131,890 public and private elementary and secondary schools in the U.S., all of which need some form of armed security given our current state of affairs.\n\nIf the federal government were to hire one to two armed guards per school, approximately 250,000 in total, it would cost taxpayers an estimated $10 to $12 billion annually.\n\nBy redirecting funds already misused overseas, we could ensure safety for America's children without adding to our national deficit or disarming law-abiding citizens. A report from 2017 by John Sopko, special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, found that the federal government is spending millions of dollars a year paying for the salaries of Afghanistan soldiers that don't even exist. According to Sopko, the U.S. pays the wages of about 320,000 Afghan police and soldiers, but only 120,000 actually exist.\n\nAmericans are paying for Afghan soldiers that don't exist while our children are vulnerable; this is unconscionable.\n\nAnother area where the federal government could redirect funds from is United State Agency for International Developments which will spend $15 million by 2019 to train cashiers for Walmart in Mexico, Kenya, India, and Spain, another $21 million to purchase motorbikes for Pakistani Dairy Farmers, and $98 million to promote tourism in Jordan.\n\nBy redirecting these funds to protect our schools, we will not only ensure the safety of our students but employment opportunities to veterans and retired police.\n\nAll school safety employees would need to meet a specific list of standards that include physical and mental well-being, proper training to deal with a school shooter, as well as an honorable discharge. This plan could be one of the most significant job creators for unemployed vets, especially to the 188,000 unemployed who served in Gulf War I and II, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis America First approach will protect our children, redirect wasted federal funds, and neither be a burden on the taxpayer or legal gun owners. It's a win for all Americans and will be one my first priorities when elected in November.",

                "body": "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly bragged to a Middle Eastern leader that he had White House adviser Jared Kushner \"in his pocket.\" Kushner may have also violated federal law if he gave bin Salman classified information from President Donald Trump's Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) without Trump's authorization to help bin Salman put his political rivals under house arrest.\n\nAccording to a Wednesday report in the Intercept, before he had his security clearance downgraded from the temporary top-secret level, Kushner had access to the PDB, and he reportedly voraciously consumed information about Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter bin Salman ousted then-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and started to consolidate his power last year, Trump's PDB reportedly \"contained information on Saudi Arabia's evolving political situation, including a handful of names of royal family members opposed to the crown prince's power grab.\" Bin Salman arrived in Washington on Wednesday and he and his advisers dined with Kushner.\n\nIn October, Kushner made a secret trip to Saudi Arabia that reportedly deeply \"unsettled\" intelligence officials. The Intercept report sheds light on why national security officials were so troubled by Kushner's meeting at the time with bin Salman, who reportedly \"told confidants that Kushner had discussed the names of Saudis disloyal to the crown prince.\" Kushner's attorney's spokesperson denied that Kushner had such discussions.\n\nDays after Kushner left Saudi Arabia last October, bin Salman put many of his political rivals and prominent business executives under house arrest. \"Three sources who have been in contact with members of the Saudi and Emirati royal families since the crackdown\" told the Intercept that \"the Saudi figures named in the President's Daily Brief were among those rounded up\" and \"at least one was reportedly tortured.\"\n\nThose put under house arrest included: \"eleven senior princes, several current or former ministers, the owners of three major television stations, the head of the most important military branch, and one of the wealthiest men in the world, who has been a major shareholder in Citibank, Twentieth Century Fox, Apple, Twitter, and Lyft.\"\n\n\"It's the equivalent of waking up to find Warren Buffett and the heads of ABC, CBS and NBC have been arrested,\" a former U.S. official told the New Yorker. \"It has all the appearances of a coup d'état. Saudi Arabia is rapidly becoming another country. The kingdom has never been this unstable.\"\n\nBin Salman reportedly told United Arab Emirates (UAE) Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed about his discussions with Kushner, according to the Intercept, and bragged that even he had Kushner \"in his pocket.\" According to the report, if Kushner discussed classified information from the PDB with bin Salman without presidential authorization, \"he may have violated federal laws around the sharing of classified intelligence.\"\n\nKushner has reportedly gotten so close to Messrs. bin Salman and bin Zayad that he regularly communicates with them \"directly using WhatsApp,\" the messaging app that is reportedly \"popular in the Middle East.\"\n\nKushner reportedly lost access to his top-secret security clearance because of his secret meetings with foreign government officials and financiers. In addition, officials from at least four countries -- China, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Mexico -- have reportedly discussed how they can manipulate Kushner \"by taking advantage of his complex business arrangements, financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience,\" according to a Washington Post report.\n\nNational security and intelligence officials have reportedly been worried since Kushner's first days in the White House that his \"lack of government experience and his business debt\" were \"potential points of leverage that foreign governments could use to influence him.\"",

                "body": "\"The President wants the 2020 United States Census to ask people whether or not they are citizens,\" the email read. \"The President wants to know if you're on his side.\"\n\nArturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials' (NALEO) Educational Fund, told the Washington Post that the email was \"demoralizing\" and \"an assault on the constitution.\"\n\n\"The fact that the Trump campaign would start using this as a fundraiser just really is an assault on the constitution,\" which mandates as accurate a count as possible,\" Vargas said. \"It plays to the anti-immigrant nativist sentiments that the Trump campaign used to get elected, and it's a way to keep that kind of statement alive as the president goes into his second year.\"\n\nVanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, told the Post that the email casts \"doubt on the Justice Department's stated reasons for proposing this untested question at the 11th hour.\"\n\n\"We now know that support for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census goes all the way up to President Trump,\" she reportedly said.\n\nIn December, the Justice Department sent a letter to the Census Bureau asking for a citizenship question to be included in the next Census so it can better enforce the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"This data is critical to the Department's enforcement of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and its important protections against racial discrimination in voting,\" the letter read. \"To fully enforce those requirements, the Department needs a reliable calculation of the citizen voting-age population in localities where voting rights violations are alleged or suspected.\"\n\nTrump campaign fundraising off of proposed addition of citizenship question to 2020 census, which would almost certainly make the decennial census both more expensive and less accurate. pic.twitter.com/u5SKFHLlID\n\n-- Catherine Rampell (@crampell) March 19, 2018\n\nThis is nuts. Citizenship question hasn't been asked since 1950 & would massively suppress responses among immigrants experts say https://t.co/FV0ZYhS0SE https://t.co/GmZaoS6d5S\n\n-- Ari Berman (@AriBerman) March 19, 2018\n\nKansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach recently argued in Breitbart News that adding the citizenship question matters because \"the very principle of one person, one vote, is at stake.\"\n\n\"Right now, congressional districts are drawn up simply based on the number of warm bodies in each district. Not only are legal aliens counted, but illegal aliens are counted too. As a result, citizens in a district with lots of illegal aliens have more voting power than citizens in districts with few illegal aliens,\" Kobach wrote. \"Think of it this way. There are about 710,000 people in each congressional district. But, if half of the district is made up of illegal aliens, then there are only 355,000 citizens in the district. The value of each citizen's vote in such a district is twice as high. That is unfair.\"\n\nThe Census Bureau must finalize its questions by March 31 and send them to Congress. Ahead of the deadline, Democrats in the House and Senate, past census directors, and left-wing attorneys general have all lobbied to have the citizenship question removed.",

Chris Murphy's (D-CT) \"Fix NICS\" legislation but turns a blind eye to the national reciprocity legislation that was introduced in the Senate over a year ago.\n\nNational reciprocity for concealed carry was introduced in the Senate on March 1, 2017, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has been mum on it ever since. It was introduced in the House on January 3, 2017, but was not passed until conservatives banded together and overcame Speaker Paul Ryan's stonewalling on December 6, 2017.\n\nSo the common citizen waits, still unable to travel the country and freely carry his or her handgun for self-defense, even if he or she has a concealed carry permit.\n\nBut the Republican leadership made sure to include \"Fix NICS\" in the omnibus bill.\n\nPolitco reports that \"House conservatives were furious\" that \"Fix NICS\" was included in the omnibus bill. They said they had been told that Sen. Murphy's bill \"would only be considered along a gun-rights friendly measure to honor concealed carry permits across state lines.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), said, \"What we were told by our leadership is directly opposite what is happening today.\"",

Jay Dickey (R-AR), was put into a funding bill in 1996 and has been renewed every year since. It says, \"None of the funds made available in this title may be used, in whole or in part, to advocate or promote gun control.\"\n\nAccording to The Hill, Democrats claim the amendment put \"a chilling effect\" on gun violence research. Republicans responded by suggesting that the only censorship faced by the CDC was \"self-censorship.\"\n\nPresident Obama asked the Republican-controlled Congress to fund gun violence research fiscal years 2014 through 2017, but Congress refused. Now, however, the Republicans are prepared to clarify that the CDC is not barred from doing \"gun violence research,\" even with the Dickey Amendment in place.",
