                "title": "Trump Announces Restrictive Trans Military Policy",
                "body": "On Friday night, hours after another tumultuous week wrapped up in Washington, the Trump administration issued a vaguely-worded memo that would bar transgender people from serving in the military, while giving the Pentagon some discretion over how the policy is carried out.\n\nThe memo, signed by President Trump and filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, states that \"persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- including individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under limited circumstances.\"\n\nThe move is an extension of the policy announced impulsively by President Trump on Twitter last July, in which he vowed to ban all transgender people from the military.\n\nIn August, Trump directed the Pentagon to reverse an Obama-era policy that had allowed transgender people, or those with gender dysphoria, to serve.\n\nBut in the following months, multiple judges blocked Trump's ban as unconstitutional, preventing it from going into effect.\n\nTrump sought input from the military on the matter -- or at least pretended to. In a report released on Friday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis wrote that the new policy would \"place the Department of Defense in the strongest position to protect the American people, to fight and win America's wars, and to ensure the survival and success of our service members around the world.\"\n\nBut Slate's Mark Joseph Stern reports that, according to multiple sources, Mattis \"actually supports open transgender service,\" but was overruled by Vice President Mike Pence and other anti-trans forces in the administration, which were the real voices behind the report.\n\nThe new measures provoked a furious reaction from several civil rights and LGBT groups.\n\n\"What the White House has released tonight is transphobia masquerading as policy,\" said Joshua Block, a senior staff lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement.\n\nThe policy will face immediate legal challenges, and, given its similarity to last summer's version, has a strong chance of being knocked down again in federal court.\n\nIn a 2016 study, the Rand Corporation estimated that between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender people serve in the military, with 830 to 4,160 serving in the reserves. The study concluded that allowing transgender troops to serve would have \"minimal impact on readiness and health care costs.\"\n\nThough it is often a fool's game to read too much into the administration's motives, the announcement, with its odd timing, could be seen as an attempt to mollify Trump's hard-right base hours after he signed a massive spending bill that did not include significant funding for a border wall. Trump made a show of publicly considering vetoing the bill before grudgingly signing it into law.",

                "title": "Justice Department to Create New Rule Banning Bump Stocks",
                "body": "The Justice Department has proposed a new regulation effectively banning bump stocks, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Friday. The new DOJ rule will reclassify the gun modification devices, which are used to mimic automatic fire with a semi-automatic weapon, as machine guns, which are banned under federal law.\n\nThe Trump administration's strategy to ban the devices goes against the recommendations of federal law enforcement officials. In 2010, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives concluded that it could not regulate bump stocks since the devices could not be classified as machine guns since they do not permanently alter the trigger mechanism of a firearm. Another review conducted by ATF officials last year concluded that bump stocks could only be banned by an act of Congress. Sessions apparently hopes to get around that problem by reinterpreting the term \"machine gun.\"\n\nThe new DOJ-proposed rule will now go into the Federal Register and face a 90-day comment period before going into effect. If that happens, the possession of bump stocks would be criminalized and owners of the devices would have to immediately surrender or destroy them. But since bump stock manufacturers specifically designed the devices to avoid being classified as machine guns, expect the rule-based ban to face lawsuits from them and gun rights advocates, as a ban of the devices in Florida already has.\n\nThe DOJ rule change came on the eve of Saturday's nationwide March For Our Lives protests against gun violence, and Sessions's statement quickly followed a Friday tweet from President Trump announcing the ban.\n\nThe gunman behind last fall's mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas used a bump stock to allow him to fire more rounds into the crowd. 58 people were killed in that attack, and hundreds more wounded. Though bump stocks played no role in the mass shooting that killed 17 people at a Florida high school last month, President Trump and others quickly focused on banning bump stocks in their response to the outrage that followed.\n\nPresident Trump's Friday tweet also attempted to blame President Obama for having \"legalized\" bump stocks in the first place, a misleading reference to how the original ATF review of the devices happened during the Obama administration. At that time, law enforcement officials concluded that the federal government could not legally ban the devices without Congress. The Trump administration is now disregarding that conclusion and trying to impose the ban anyway. We'll soon find out who was right.",

                "body": "The political world has been transfixed this week with chaos in the White House, including the president's wildly mixed signals about the Omnibus Appropriations Bill that he finally signed on Friday. But the stock market is mostly worried about something else: the possibility that the tariffs on China Trump announced on Thursday could add to the already high risk he is courting of a global trade war.\n\nIt was part of a broader pattern, as the Associated Press noted:\n\nThe S&P 500 index dropped 55.43 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,588.26. The index skidded 6 percent this week, its worst since January 2016.\n\nCompounding the trade-war jitters is a growing suspicion among economists that the economic growth that seemed so apparent early in the year may actually be slowing down, as a leading bank analyst suggested:\n\nWe are NOT buyers of the tight labor markets-higher wages-higher inflation-higher bond yields story (check out insignificant wage growth in Japan and Australia -- both with very tight labor markets with very high labor force participation rates as examples of the weakening link between unemployment and wage growth) ...\n\nWe think the risk is that nominal global growth SLOWS a lot more than consensus believes.\n\nSo you've got some investors thinking that the big risk is higher interest rates and others thinking it's slower growth. And everybody's worried about the unpredictable direction of a trade war.\n\nTo the extent that the Trump administration is playing with economic fire on the trade front -- and the stable-administration-of-the-government front, too -- it could indirectly be playing with political fire as well. While partisan Democrats and Republicans may be largely impervious to the positive and negative economic implications of the president's style and substance, there's evidence that they do matter to the small but crucial number of persuadable voters:\n\nIn addition to that cold political reality, an unstable or declining stock market is one less thing the president would be able to tweet about triumphantly, at the expense of all of the scary things he is doing.",

                "title": "Everything You Need to Know About Stormy Daniels",
                "body": "Stormy Daniels is no stranger to the small screen. In her two decades as an adult entertainer, she's appeared in 275 films and directed 91. Her accolades include 19 awards as a performer, including three wins for \"Favorite Breasts,\" and another seven awards as a director. She also belongs to three different adult-industry halls of fame.\n\nEven with those credentials though, she's never had as many eyeballs on her as she'll have Sunday night when 60 Minutes airs a highly anticipated interview with Anderson Cooper. The sit-down concerns the affair she says she had with Donald Trump in 2006, and her lawyer has promised that it will reveal salacious new details about the dalliance.\n\nBefore the interview airs, let's learn more about Daniels. For those who want to see more of her, there are other websites for that.\n\nThe Early Years\n\nBorn Stephanie Clifford in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Daniels grew up with a single mother after her parents divorced when she was 4.\n\nIn high school, she was \"an unstoppable force for change,\" according to a bio on a website made to draft her into a run for the U.S. Senate. Daniels, the site says, was both the editor of her high-school newspaper and the president of the 4-H Club, jobs \"typically dominated by males.\" In a 2002 interview with Adult DVD Talk, Daniels said her ACT scores got her accepted into Texas A&M and Mississippi State, but she had other plans.\n\nWhile in high school, Daniels began going by Stormy for a couple of reasons. She hated her real name and she loved of Mötley Crüe. \"I wanted my cool new nickname to have some connection to the band. I did not like any of their names, but the bassist Nikki Sixx has a son named Storm. Perfect,\" she says in an archived FAQ on her website. (Storm Sixx is actually Nikki Sixx's daughter.)\n\nStardom\n\nDaniels began her adult-entertainment career as a 17-year-old stripper at a Baton Rouge strip club. She initially performed under the name Stormy Waters, but later changed her pseudonymous last name to honor Jack Daniel's.\n\nShe began her porn career in 2002 with a \"girl-girl\" scene in the movie American Girls, Part 2. Before long, she signed a contract with Wicked Pictures, a titan of 2000s porn, and began having sex with men onscreen in movies such as Revenge of the Dildos, Da Vagina Code, and Big Boob Bonanza.\n\nIn 2004, Daniels moved behind the camera and fell in love with directing. \"For years everyone was like, 'Stormy Daniels, she's the best female director.' That's always bugged me. What does my vagina have to do with directing?\" she told the Cut in 2016.\n\nShe learned some of her directing skills by watching Judd Apatow, who's cast her in several of his movies. The first came in 2005 when she landed a role in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. She appears briefly in the film taunting Steve Carell's character in a dream sequence and later made cameos in Knocked Up and Pineapple Express. \"She's very nice and super smart and great to work with so we just kept asking her to be in all of our movies,\" director Judd Apatow told Conan O'Brien.\n\nPolitical Ambitions\n\nIn 2009, Daniels made national political news when she began flirting with a run for the U.S. Senate against Louisiana's David Vitter, the Republican who was linked to a D.C. prostitution ring in 2007. A lifelong Democrat, Daniels switched her registration after it was revealed that the RNC spent nearly $2,000 at a California strip club. That, and her career as a porn star, had some treating her candidacy as a gimmick.\n\nBut Daniels took the bid seriously, telling CNN, \"I don't see how I can possibly embarrass him more than he's already embarrassed himself.\" In the spring of 2009, she embarked on a listening tour of Louisiana where she told voters about her stance against President Obama's economic stimulus and was in favor of bringing troops home from Iraq. Her campaign slogan: \"Stormy Daniels: Screwing People Honestly.\"\n\nThe dream ended in April of 2010 though, as it became clear that Daniels could not compete with Vitter's war chest. \"I am not running for the US Senate for the same reason that so many dedicated patriots do not run -- I can't afford it, \" she said in a statement.\n\nL'Affair Trump\n\nDaniels's alleged affair with Trump first made the news in January when The Wall Street Journal reported on a hush payment of $130,000 that Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen made to her weeks before the 2018 election.\n\nThe alleged encounter took place 12 years earlier at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. Though Daniels has professed a distaste for \"arrogant men who brag about how much money they make,\" she and Trump slept together, she says. In 2011, she spilled the details of the affair to In Touch Weekly, which held the story at the time, but published it earlier this year. \"I can definitely describe his junk perfectly, if I ever have to,\" she told the magazine.\n\nPR Prowess\n\nDaniels, who once said she's \"smarter than your average stripper,\" has made a killing off of the attention she's received for allegedly sleeping with Trump.\n\nIn January, she ended her long run as a contract director with Wicked Pictures and signed a new deal with Digital Playground. She's also launched the \"Make America Horny Again\" tour and become hugely popular on Pornhub.\n\n\"I would be a fucking idiot to turn it down,\" she told Rolling Stone about the lucrative offers coming her way. \"We live in a capitalist society. I think if anyone, in any field, was approached and someone said, 'Hi! You know that job you are already doing? Would you like to do it next week for quadruple your normal pay?' Show me one person who would say no.\"",

                "body": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is nothing if not consistent. He refused to call two legislative special elections-to fill vacancies his own appointments created-because he didn't want to risk the kind of embarrassing Democratic wins and near-wins that have been happening all over the country since Donald Trump took office. A state judge-one that Walker himself appointed, as it happens-told him the law required that he hold these election because otherwise the citizens in the affected districts would be denied representation.\n\nSo how are Walker and the state GOP responding? They're trying to change the law on which the judge based her decision. And this isn't just a recommendation, either, as TPM reports:\n\nRepublican legislative leaders in Wisconsin called lawmakers back to the Capitol Friday afternoon to change state law governing special elections....\n\n\"It's clear that little thought was given to the impact of the special elections ruling,\" Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said in a statement, saying an extraordinary session of the legislature was necessary to \"clean up\" the statute on special elections.\n\n\"In essence, there will be two elections occurring simultaneously for the two offices,\" the statement continued. \"It will undoubtedly lead to voter confusion and electoral chaos. Also, holding the special elections after the conclusion of the regular session is a waste of taxpayer dollars and local government resources.\"\n\nThere's nothing in this particular critique of special elections that isn't true of all special elections. Yet somehow it's these special elections that are so objectionable that a special legislative session-which might also represent a \"waste of taxpayer dollars\"-is necessary.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Wisconsin Democrats are going ballistic over this maneuver, calling it (among other things) a \"clear attack on democracy.\" But Scott Walker has always been impervious to this sort of criticism, and like a hammerhead shark, determined to continue his course of action, no matter what. Only the voters can deter him.",

                "title": "Report: Moore Supporters Wanted Accuser's Lawyer to Disavow",
                "body": "The Washington Post reported on Friday that two supporters of Roy Moore, the erstwhile Republican Alabama Senate candidate who was accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls, tried to convince one of his accuser's attorneys to drop the case and publicly disavow his client in exchange for money, favors, and exposure to Steve Bannon. The brazen strategy went as follows:\n\nThey asked lawyer Eddie Sexton to drop the woman as a client and say publicly that he did not believe her. The damaging statement would be given to Breitbart News, then run by former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon.\n\nIn exchange, Sexton said in recent interviews, the men offered to pay him $10,000 and promised to introduce him to Bannon and others in the nation's capital.\n\nSexton represented Leigh Corfman, whose allegation that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and he was 32 upended the Senate race. Moore ended up losing to Democrat Doug Jones in December.\n\nStrangely, the two men, Bert Davi and Gary Lantrip, business partners in a construction firm, are clients of Sexton's in another, unrelated case. Davi had also known Bannon for years, though it's not clear how.\n\nDavi and Lantrip approached Sexton with their offer, and later arranged a meeting between Sexton and two Breitbart reporters, Washington bureau chief Matt Boyle and Jerusalem bureau chief Aaron Klein. The reporters presented him with a written statement disavowing his own client, which Sexton refused to sign. Instead, he told multiple people about the shady goings-on, including a federal prosecutor. The lawyer said it did not constitute a federal crime.\n\nDavi and Lantrip acknowledged playing a role in the scheme, but deflected questions about paying Sexton off.\n\n\"Our effort was really to let the truth come out,\" Davi said.\n\nRoy Moore claims that he knew nothing of the plan. \"I nor anyone else in the campaign offered anyone money to say something untrue, nor did I or anyone else authorize someone else to do such a thing,\" he wrote to the Post.\n\nA spokesperson for Breitbart said that the reporters didn't know anything about paying Sexton, nor who wrote the statement Sexton was meant to sign. These claims are hard to square with Sexton's contemporaneous accounts of the events.\n\nAt the time, Breitbart was still run by Bannon, who pushed Moore relentlessly on the site as the kind of populist, Trump-like insurgent who could reshape Washington. The election had huge implications for Bannon, who at the time was pushing a slew of insurgent candidates to challenge established Republicans around the country.\n\nSince Moore's defeat, Bannon's role in domestic politics has greatly diminished, and his plans for national domination have fizzled. His role as a source in Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury, in which he leveled harsh criticisms against President Trump's children, prompted the president to excoriate him and his benefactors to jettison him from Breitbart. Recently, he undertook a European tour, meeting representatives of various extreme right-wing factions and telling members of France's National Front not to apologize for their racism.\n\nDoug Jones, meanwhile, gave his first speech to the Senate floor on Wednesday.",

                "title": "The Remarkable, Maddening Career of Zell Miller",
                "body": "Most people who hear about the death of former Georgia governor and senator Zell Miller will remember him, if at all, for his abrasive attacks on John Kerry -- the presidential nominee of the party to which Miller had belonged for his entire, long life -- at the 2004 Republican National Convention. Older readers may remember his keynote address at the 1992 Democratic Convention that nominated his close friend Bill Clinton.\n\nPeople in his home state of Georgia are probably aware of additional aspects of Miller's career, including his many years in elected office (he was lieutenant governor from 1975 until 1991, and governor from 1991 to 1999, before an appointed stint in the Senate from 2000 until 2005). They also know about his legacy initiative, the much-praised and imitated lottery-supported HOPE Scholarship program, which made college affordable for many hundreds of thousands of young Georgians while boosting academic standards at the state's public colleges and universities by getting talented kids to stay in-state.\n\nThe length of Miller's time in the public spotlight, and the wildly varying directions it took him, have often been encapsulated by the nickname he acquired from critics early on: \"Zig-Zag Zell.\" And the taunt goes back a lot further than his bookend Democratic and Republican convention addresses. Early on Miller ran twice for Congress in his native North Georgia mountains as an opponent of civil-rights legislation (a posture for which he later apologized), and then served as chief of staff for the state's infamous segregationist governor Lester Maddox. But by 1974, Miller had managed to reframe himself as a relatively progressive Democrat in running for lieutenant governor, and by 1980 was most definitely the \"liberal\" candidate challenging the old reformed segregationist Herman Talmadge (losing in a Democratic runoff).\n\nElected governor in 1990 by running to the left of former ambassador and Atlanta mayor Andrew Young and future governor Roy Barnes, Miller had a reasonably progressive record centered on HOPE and unprecedented appointments of women and minorities to executive and judicial offices. After his association with Clinton very nearly earned him defeat in 1994 (his Republican opponent ran hundreds of ads featuring Miller's Democratic Convention speech, particularly the line, delivered in Zell's mountain twang: \"BILL CLINTON FEELS YORE PAIN\"), he lost his zest for national Democratic politics. He was settling into multiple university teaching gigs and political retirement until he shocked most people he knew by accepting a Senate appointment when Paul Coverdell died in 2000.\n\nNo one was more shocked than I was, as his former (from 1992 through 1994) federal-state relations director, who had accompanied him to Washington often enough to understand his intense antipathy to the city and its culture. It surprised me less when he hated the Senate, and began lashing out at his Senate Democratic colleagues and the party to which he nominally owed allegiance. In 2003, he published a strange memoir (titled, for maximum book sales to conservatives, A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat), which enveloped a proud account of his own progressive record in brief but quote-worthy attacks on Democrats. Soon afterwards, he completed his apostasy with his RNC speech embracing George W. Bush and savaging his former colleague John Kerry.\n\nFor a while there, Miller was like fellow arch-Appalachian Andrew Johnson reincarnated, turning on former friends and embracing former enemies with equal passion. It seemed there was no GOP candidate he wasn't willing to support, the nadir probably being his establishment of a group called Democrats for Santorum, just as the right-wing senator was going down the tubes in the 2006 elections in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut in the last few years, as his health declined and he became more distant from politics, the fiery mountaineer seemed to mellow. He mended fences with old Democratic friends and advisers James Carville and Paul Begala (whom he first introduced to Bill Clinton). And in his last major political endorsement, in 2014, he supported Democrat Michelle Nunn's Senate campaign.\n\nYou can think of that as a final \"zig-zag,\" or as a bit of a homecoming. I personally think it reflected a complicated and conflicted man who often regretted his own political impulses, and had more of a sense of humor about it all than most people realized.\n\nI had some evidence for that suspicion. Back when it appeared, I wrote a review of A National Party No More that basically suggested Miller had lost his bearings after going to the Senate. The title was \"Zell Bent.\" A few months later a friend who had visited his Senate office brought me a handwritten note from my former boss (who was normally proper but not affectionate towards staff) that read: \"Your review was fair and honest, and I remain your friend and admirer.\" And he signed it \"Zell Bent.\"\n\nHe was one of a kind, and should be remembered for more than his zig-zags.",

                "body": "It used to be that wearing a black T-shirt meant you were trying to fade into the background, but as with the white T-shirt, it's a basic that -- done well -- can become something that actually helps you stand out. They're flattering enough to help downplay some flaws, too. To find the best black T-shirts (V-necks, crewnecks, gym versions, dressy ones, etc.), we asked 14 guys which ones they love the most. And if you're looking for more men's black T-shirt content, we talked to street-style photo fixture Nick Wooster about his favorites, too.\n\nBest black T-shirt for layering Calvin Klein Slim Fit 3-Pack Cotton T-shirt $28 (was $40, now 30% off)\n\n\"I've been wearing this T-shirt for over 20 years. It's the only T-shirt I wear to sleep, day-to-day use, vacation, etc. It fits just right without being too tight, and it's thick and presentable enough that I can wear it under a blazer, but lightweight enough that I'll wear it under my work scrubs, too. I'll keep the black T-shirts in the rotation for six to eight months before the fading kicks in.\" -- Gregory Vernet, licensed aesthetician, Heyday Noho and Tribeca\n\n$28 at Nordstrom Best V-neck black T-shirt Hanes Mens Luxury Essentials 3-Pack Black Dyed V-Neck Undershirt\n\n\"My favorite black T-shirt is Hanes. (Really.) But not just any Hanes -- it has to be the Luxury Essentials V-neck, which starts out in the deepest of blacks and as it ages takes on the perfect softness and most beautiful faded black ever. There are three in a pack, so I can never have enough. I actually wear them with suiting, or just casually with jeans. They're my go-to.\" -- Wouri Vice, stylist\n\n$20 at Amazon $20 at Amazon Best black T-shirt for the gym Lululemon 5 Year Basic Tee\n\n\"My favorite black T-shirt hands down is the Lululemon 5 Year Basic Tee. It goes with everything and is incredibly soft. That's because it has Lycra in it for some additional stretch (rather than being plain cotton). It makes it good for athletic stuff, too. What else do you need?\" -- Zachariah Reitano, CEO and co-founder, Roman\n\n$58 at Lululemon Best fade-proof black T-shirt American Apparel Men's Fine Jersey Short Sleeve Classic V-Neck T-shirt\n\n\"I like to put my creative energy into my work and not my clothes. Like many artists I know, we gravitate toward a self-imposed uniform, and the A.A. V-neck black tee works in the studio and looks good at the opening. The best part about the T-shirt is that it gets so much softer with time. It doesn't shrink. It doesn't fade. It just feels better and better. My wife, Jenni, makes me throw them out because it's hard to let go, no matter how many holes and cuts they endure.\" -- Barnett Cohen, artist\n\nFrom $11 at Amazon $11 at Amazon Best tall and skinny black T-shirt Gap Men's Essential Short Sleeve Crewneck T-shirt $13 (was $18, now 28% off)\n\n\"My current favorite is a solid black tee from the Gap that retails for about $20. The cotton is super soft and the fit is just right for my body type (tall and lean).\" -- Andrew Zaeh, photographer\n\n$13 at Spring Best tall and skinny V-neck black T-shirt Gap Men's Essential V-Neck T-Shirt $13 (was $18, now 28% off)\n\n\"I wear so many black tees that I feel borderline tropical if I so much as branch out into gray palettes. My favorite black T-shirt is the Essential V-Neck by Gap because it's one of the few I can find in a medium-tall size. I'm six-foot-four with a slender frame. If I buy a large, it's almost the right length, but I'm swimming around in it like scrubs. If I buy a medium, it fits better in the abdomen, but with the unfortunate side effect of showing off my happy trail to innocent bystanders. The medium-tall Gap V-neck hugs my shoulders and chest and stays slim down past my waistline. It's versatile, too: works just as well at the gym as at the restaurant.\" -- Hayden Frank, musician and EMT\n\n$13 at Spring Best black T-shirt with a thin collar Sunspel Short Sleeve Crew Neck Tee\n\n\"The Sunspel looks good when I wear it on its own or under a sweater, and what really sets it apart is the thinness of the little rib at the neckline. It's also just got a perfectly well-proportioned sleeve and body length. Note: If you machine-dry rather than hang-dry them, you might want to size up, as they will shrink just a bit.\" -- Michael Friedberg, marketing, Dummies\n\n$90 at East Dane Best trim black T-shirt Uniqlo Men's Supima Cotton Crewneck Short-Sleeve T-shirt\n\n\"They're the only black T-shirt I wear now that Calvin Klein stopped making it's cotton stretch 365 line, which was my go-to gym tee. The Uniqlo crewneck is less than $10; they feel soft, comfy, and kind of luxe. The fabric quality and make is so high for something so inexpensive, and they fit extremely well: high arm holes, a trimmer sleeve, and just the right length. They just look clean and sharp, and I actually own them in different sizes, depending on whether I'm wearing one as a base layer or on its own.\" -- Dan Reilly, analyst, American Express\n\n$10 at Uniqlo Best slim-fit black T-shirt H&M V-neck T-shirt Slim Fit\n\n\"After being a loyal consumer of American Apparel's V-neck tees, I have found my new favorite go-to tee to be H&M's V-neck slim fit. It feels great on, fits my slim frame, keeps it's shape all day long (5 percent spandex), and since it's less than $10, I can replenish them as often as needed without feeling any guilt. I wear one every day either as an undershirt or just on its own.\" -- Jude Scott, New York City event coordinator\n\n$10 at H&M Best not-too-slim black T-shirt Rag & Bone Base Tee\n\n\"Wearing black is an industry standard on film and photo sets -- and the Base Tee because it's something I feel good in on fashion sets or around the Ghetto Gastro guys and all their \"Rick Owens drip\" when we're traveling the world. It's a quality shirt that sits just right on my shoulders, but also tapers through the middle without being form-fitting. I'll buy a bunch because you can never have too many on any given day.\" -- Jose D. Cota, director and editor, Ghetto Gastro\n\n$75 at Rag & Bone Best stretchy black T-shirt Calvin Klein Men's Cotton Stretch Crew-neck Undershirt 2-Pack $26 (was $37, now 30% off)\n\n\"Lately, I really like the Calvin Klein black crewneck tee in the two-pack. It's the best, as the cotton wears well, and over time, I think it fades really well. It's got elastane in it, which you should know, because some people don't like that clinginess. If you like V-necks, theirs isn't so deep that you look like J.Lo if you go out, though I prefer crewnecks these days. I also find C.K. a lot more durable than other brands (I'm looking at you, Polo).\" -- Parker Wertz, vice-president, Merrill Lynch\n\n$26 at Macy's Best (slightly) graphic black T-shirt Comme des Garçons PLAY Appliquéd T-shirt\n\n\"I'm definitely the textbook T-shirt-and-jeans guy -- I've pretty much worn this as a uniform for most of my life. This also means I've worn a shit-ton of T-shirts. My favorite go-to black tee is the appliquéd tee from Comme des Garçons Play. It's a perfect black, a perfect fit, and I love the heart insignia because it adds some cool playfulness to my uniform. I particularly love how it's cut -- just long enough to look great untucked or tucked in and slim-fitting without being tight (I'd suggest going down a size for a tighter fit). The sleeves are the perfect kind of short sleeve, that flatters the arms, and has enough length to roll just a bit, or leave down. It's rare to find a simple black tee that allows for so much versatility.\" -- Jake Pegler Morgan, senior communications manager, Malin+Goetz\n\n$100 at Saks Fifth Avenue Best \"fashion\" black T-shirt Yohji Yamamoto Layered T-shirt\n\n\"Two words -- quality and versatility. Japanese cotton is the best on earth, and the double layer gives you multiple looks and styles. A great way to turn a basic black into a fashion statement. It's not cheap, but only gets better with age. Size up though, as Y.Y. is cut for smaller bodies!\" -- Jeff Rabhan, chairman, Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music NYU\n\n$439 at FarFetch Best black T-shirt in pima cotton Mack Weldon Pima Crewneck T-shirt\n\n\"I recently started getting Mack Weldon shirts because I love their underwear. Their focus is on comfort, which is perfect for me because I'm usually running around. The classic pima also has a higher-quality feel than you'll get in a normal cotton (it comes from Peru) and in black is perfect for almost all situations.\" -- Will D'Agostino, founder, Nutshell\n\n$32 at Mack Weldon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nAs I figured out firsthand this week, there's a lot of competition out there when it comes to vacuums, but only a select few that are up to snuff. We've heard from robot-vacuum experts and yours truly on the best \"smart\" cleaning vacuums, but we thought we'd ask for a third opinion on the best vacuums overall, from the people we trust to make our homes squeaky-clean. Here, three New York City cleaning-service experts give their recommendations (many that are on the cheaper end) on the best vacuums for a range of needs, whether you're looking for something compact to fit in your tiny apartment, want a robot that can clean up spills, or own pets.\n\nThe Best Bagless Vacuum for Pet Hair Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner\n\n\"One vacuum cleaner I like is the Bissell Pet Hair: The 1650A, the upright one, is really good for everyone who has pets. It's great quality and it's fairly priced. The Bissells aren't really known for their suction, but the overall performance is really good. It's the way the filtration system works that makes the vacuum work so well. The pet-hair brush works on various different types of floors, and you get a lot of extra attachments with this, too.\" -- Antonio Sheman, owner of Klean Freaks NYC\n\n$178 at Amazon $178 at Amazon The Best Canister Vacuum Under $100 Eureka Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum\n\n\"Eureka canisters are an option if you need a cheap and compact vacuum. It's a simple vacuum that is also very affordable and does a good job. The shortcoming is that it will not last you ten years like a Miele would. It's not quiet and it does not have a special floor attachment that automatically adjusts to the type of your floor. It doesn't have a fancy filter that cleans your air. But in my opinion, it's the best budget-friendly vacuum out there.\" -- Kadi Dulude, owner of Wizard of Homes NYC\n\n$60 at Amazon $60 at Amazon The Best Canister Vacuum Under $300 Kenmore 81614 Bagged Canister Vac\n\n\"I also recommend the canister Kenmore. That vacuum cleaner also has a few models, so it depends which one you choose. What's good about this canister type is that you can reach behind the couches, the corners, and the bags are not too expensive. All of the attachments are stored in the vacuum cleaner, so you don't have to run to the closet to pick up another attachment.\" -- Anna Harasim, owner of Anna's Cleaning Service NY\n\n$270 at Amazon $270 at Amazon The Best Canister Vacuum Cleaner Under $400 Miele Complete C2 Hard Floor Canister Vacuum Cleaner\n\n\"We would recommend any Miele canister vacuum. Wizards prefer canister styles because most of the upright vacuums are no good and too bulky. Canister vacuums are much smaller, so they save space, but they're also lighter to carry and easier to use on surfaces like couches or stairs. Miele does a great job at vacuuming and is also very quiet. It's expensive, but it lasts a long time, doing the same great job year after year. Although I've never liked vacuums that require the use of dust bags, Miele's new 3-D efficiency dust bags are great at keeping dust in the vacuum instead of filtering it back into the air, and changing out the bag is easy and mess-free. Miele also has a very efficient filtering system that tells you when it's time to change the filter again. They promise that the air that blows out of the vacuum is cleaner than the air in the room. So you're basically not only cleaning your home, but also purifying the air.\" -- Dulude\n\nEditor's note: We've written about this, too.\n\n$349 at Amazon $349 at Amazon The Best Lightweight Vacuum Cleaner Shark Rocket HV302 Ultra-Light Upright Vacuum\n\n\"My first choice for vacuum cleaners is the Shark Rocket, the newest models. These are really handy, and they're bagless, so you don't have to spend money on bags. They have a lot of attachments. It's so good to use if you have pets at home, and bagless vacuums in general are better for pets. The Shark Rockets have attachments to vacuum the couches and furniture. And the price is quite good, though it depends what model you choose. Most New York apartments are small, and with the Shark Rocket, in my experience, it's the easiest to store in the closet or under the bed.\" -- Harasim\n\n$157 at Amazon $157 at Amazon The Best Mini-Vacuum for Mopping Ecovacs Deebot Pro Robot Vacuum Cleaner\n\n\"I also use this Ecovacs Deebot robot in my own home, and I don't know how I was ever able to live without it before. It vacuums and 'wet sweeps' -- they call it mopping, but I wouldn't go that far -- at the same time. I run it about every other day, and when I empty the (surprisingly big) dust collector, I'm always amazed how much dust and hair it picks up.\" -- Dulude\n\n$230 at Amazon $230 at Amazon iLife V5S Pro Robot Vacuum Cleaner\n\n\"I also use a robot vacuum for picking up dust, hair, and crumbs. It doesn't suck the dust from rugs, but it's really helpful, especially since I have two dogs: a German shepherd and a Pomeranian. I run it in my house every day. One robot vacuum that I love is the iLife because it has a container for if you've spilled water or juice or milk on the floor, so it also mops.\" -- Harasim\n\n$198 at Amazon $198 at Amazon The Best Commercial Vacuum Oreck Commercial Pro 5 Super Compact Canister Vacuum\n\n\"We also carry these commercial vacuums that are really, really good and really, really cheap. There's one called the Oreck Pro 5 Commercial. They're kind of like dinosaurs. They look like old-school, retro vacuum cleaners, to tell you the truth. I have a couple of them that work really well, and they come with a whole bunch of different parts and pieces, so it would be great for someone who works with cars in a shop. They're affordable, really powerful, and they're commercial-grade.

There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nIf you're wondering if it's maybe time to give your area rug or wall-to-wall carpet a deep-clean, or hire home carpet cleaners, it's probably too late. \"The biggest problem that we have in the industry is that people don't clean, period,\" says Paul Iskyan, president of ABC Rug & Carpet Cleaning Service, the only professional carpet cleaners affiliated with ABC Carpet & Home. \"And then they don't clean frequently enough, then they wonder why their carpet doesn't look good, or they wonder why their kid is at the doctor with big allergy problems.\"\n\nAccording to Iskyan, you should be getting your area rugs professionally cleaned every year or two, especially if it's in a high-traffic area like a living room or if you have pets or kids. And for these big, intensive cleans, you're better off hiring a professional who takes the rug out of the house and into a carpet-cleaning facility. There, they beat out the excess dirt that's stuck deep in between the fibers with high-powered machines, things you can't reach even with the most high-powered vacuum.\n\nThey then properly soak, lather, and rinse the rug. \"If we took a 9-by-12 rug and we cleaned it in the factory, we would use hundreds of gallons of water. If we took a 9-by-12 wall-to-wall carpet and cleaned it in the home, we would put two gallons of water in and extract out about a gallon and a half,\" Iskyan explains. \"It's almost like someone washing their hair in the shower, versus someone taking one of those spray bottles when their hair is dry and just buff it up a little bit.\"\n\nThose regular, professional cleaning sessions can do wonders for keeping your carpet or rug dust-free and looking nice. But that doesn't mean you should let your rug sit there collecting dirt and stains in the interim. There are a few things you can do to keep carpets clean like a professional carpet cleaner, including investing in a good vacuum and learning how to deal with spills before they become stains. Below, some tips from Iskyan about what carpet spot cleaners and carpet-cleaning tools a responsible rug-owner should keep at home, just in case.\n\n(One quick disclaimer: Though these tips are good for \"98 percent of the rugs and carpets in homes,\" according to Iskyan, including short-pile rugs, shag carpets, or synthetic fibers, you \"always want to test for color fastness\" before applying any sort of new cleaners.)\n\nVacuum With Clear Cover Dyson Ball Multifloor 2 Upright Vacuum in Iron/Satin Yellow\n\nThe easiest way to keep your carpet or rug clean is to vacuum regularly because, as Iskyan explains, most of the dirt that can damage your rug can be removed just by vacuuming regularly. But that also means regularly maintaining your vacuum cleaner. \"You actually change the filter bag,\" says Iskyan. \"We occasionally go into a customer's home, and they say, 'Oh, I'm having a problem with allergies.' And we look at the vacuum-cleaner bag, and it's blowing up, it's so old, and there's so much dust and dirt in it.\" That's one reason why Iskyan prefers vacuums with clear bodies, like Dysons, where you can see the dust building up. \"If it's a paper bag inside the canvas bag, you don't change [the filter] because you don't see it,\" he says. \"If you see it, you change it.\"\n\n$300 at Bed Bath and Beyond White Towels Flour Sack Towels -- 12 Pack, White\n\nIf you do spill something on your rug (because you're human, and accidents happen), the first step is to blot up any excess liquid with a white towel as quickly as possible. \"Blot it up as much as you can. Then you just want to blot it up and eventually call for help if you can't get it out.\" Of course, Iskyan notes, \"if it's something more solid like mayonnaise or ketchup, you want to scrape it up first; you don't want to spread it.\" You should also use a clean, dry white towel to blot up any excess cleaner you might apply to the problem area.\n\n$15 at Amazon $15 at Amazon \"Neutral\" Carpet Spotter Folex Professional 34 oz. Carpet Spot Remover\n\nOnce the spill has been blotted up, don't run back to the kitchen and grab a bottle of whatever all-purpose cleaner you have. \"What you don't want to do is start attacking stains with those types of products, because you can permanently set them and actually damage the fibers,\" says Iskyan. Instead, he recommends keeping a \"neutral spotter\" on hand, which is more often referred to as a carpet or stain spotter. It's a carpet-specific cleaner with a neutral pH, which means it's not going to be tough on the fibers or damage the dye. \"The homeowner can't make a mistake if they go a little too strong on it; they're not going to hurt something or hurt themselves. And if a young child were to get into it in the home, it's not going to hurt the child.\" But it's effective at removing the signs of even the toughest spills, including nail polish or blood or vomit, if it comes to that.\n\nAll you have to do is spray the spotter onto the spill, and move the product around with a white towel until the stain lifts. Iskyan's company sells a spotting kit that includes a neutral spotter, but if you just want a bottle of spotter, Folex is a readily shipped option. It's water-based and nonionic, meaning it has neither a positive nor negative charge, and therefore won't attract more dirt to the area, and though it starts off with a slightly basic pH in the bottle, it becomes more acidic -- and therefore more neutral in composition -- when it's applied to a stain.\n\n$9 at Bed Bath and Beyond Woolite Woolite Extra Delicates Care Detergent\n\nTaking soap to stains on your carpet is also a less-than-ideal way to deal with pet stains and the like, especially if you don't rinse it out fully. \"Soap is stupid, soap doesn't know what to do. All soap wants to do is attach itself to dirt,\" Iskyan explains. \"If you leave it, it will attract dirt faster.\" A good alternative to using straight hand soap or detergent -- or if you need something that you can get from the grocery store now, unlike a spotter -- is Woolite. Just be sure you dilute it; the ratio Iskyan recommends is a teaspoon of Woolite to a cup of warm water. With this mix, you can tackle things like grass stains, urine stains, wine stains, and coffee stains. Just be sure to dry it fully so that soap itself doesn't become a dirt magnet. \"Get a hair dryer out, in case they over-wet it. It's not hard to do.\"\n\n$4 at Walmart GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "If you're like us, you've probably wondered what famous people add to their carts. Not the JAR brooch and Louis XV chair, but the hand sanitizer and the electric toothbrush. We asked Phoebe Robinson, co-host of the podcasts 2 Dope Queens and Sooo Many White Guys, about the orange mints, lipstick, and face cream she can't live without.\n\nFenty Beauty by Rihanna Stunna Lip Paint Longwear Fluid Lip Color\n\nI'm obsessed with the Fenty beauty line. It's like, finally women of color get good makeup. I really like a red lip as my go-to when I go out. It lasts and it looks cool, and you feel like this must be what Rihanna feels like when she goes out. I'm going to pick up my laundry and she's going to the klerb, but I'm pretty sure we feel the same. I'll buy three at a time because I use it so much. It's a different, deeper red that really works for me, and it doesn't smudge either.\n\n$24 at Sephora Dr. Bronner's Lavender Pure-Castile Liquid Soap\n\nFirst of all, I have to give it up to my parents. They turned me on to this stuff because I was always getting generic Target soap, and my parents were like, \"L-o-l, get it together.\" This is all they would use, and I love it because it's lavender-scented, so you're starting the day off like Jessica Alba. It leaves my skin clean and smooth because there's just not a lot of junk in it. It's like a massage and pedicure and a getaway every day. I truly only use it for my body because I'm suspicious when people use it for 20 different things.\n\n$7 at Ulta Dr. Brandt Do Not Age Time Reversing Cream\n\nI'm in my early 30s and people are like, \"You gotta care about your skin now.\" But I'm like, \"I'm black,\" and they're like, \"Girl you still gotta care.\" I had a makeup artist who told me this was the absolute best cream. I put this on, and it goes so clear and smooth that I forget I'm wearing it. It's not a lot of junk because my skin can be very sensitive and oily and combination and break out, and no matter what it wants to do, this doesn't upset it. It's a bit on the pricey side, but it will last three or four months.\n\n$132 at DermStore J Brand Maria High Waist Skinny Jeans\n\nI am five-ten and pear-shaped, and a lot of times you see supercute jeans, but they're cut really straight, so they won't go completely over my butt or thighs. These, though, have a lot of stretch and are higher-waisted, so I never have plumber's crack, which was a big epidemic in the early aughts. It is not the cheapest thing in the world, but if there's one thing that I will splurge on, it will be jeans. I will wear Converse sneakers, but give me my J Brand jeans.\n\n$198 at Nordstrom U2 -- The Joshua Tree\n\nI just wanna go on the record to say I talk about U2 so much, I should be their publicist. I should be added to the PR team. U2 is my favorite band of all time. I love them so much. And they just did the 30th-anniversary Joshua Tree tour last summer, and it's my favorite album on earth. You can put it on when you're on a road trip or puttering around the apartment or having a cute barbecue and want a break from Rihanna. You can put on some Irish white dudes. It fits everything.\n\n$11 at Amazon Vaseline Cocoa Radiant Smoothing Body Butter\n\nOoh. So I, especially in the winter, get very dry skin, and I find myself having to constantly lotion. I feel like with this, because it's a combination of cocoa and shea butter and petroleum, does keep my skin moisturized longer than anything I've ever used. And a lot of times if you use body lotion for a long time, you feel greasy and gross, but that never happens with this. You don't leave a filmy residue on everything you touch. It's pretty affordable, too!\n\n$6 at Target Tic Tac Orange Bottle Pack\n\nI'm a nail biter and have been my whole life. I know. It's totally disgusting. I watch Dr. Oz sometimes, and there was an episode where he said, \"Your nails are filthy!\" So now I try not to bite my nails, and the best way to keep me from doing it is with these Tic Tacs. People who know I love orange Tic Tacs will think I buy a 99-cent box from CVS, and I'm like, \"No, I don't fuck with that.\" I need the biggest box and I will down them in an hour. Why orange? It tastes great! I know it's an artificial flavor, but who cares, y'all? People will sometimes give me mint, and I'm like, Who are you kidding?\n\n$10 at Walmart Gratitude Glass Jar\n\nI am truly obsessed with Oprah, and once she put in her favorite-things list this gratitude jar, and it was only $45, so I immediately thought, My price range! It's a glass jar with the word gratitude on it, and it comes with little notes. Every night before bed, I write one thing I'm grateful for, and it can be something that happened that day, like \"I paid my bills on time\" or \"I'm so grateful for my fans,\" and at the end of the year, you look at all the things that happened in your life, and it reminds you that whatever your stresses are or whatever didn't go your way, a lot of things did go your way. I loved it so much, I got one for my parents, and they're nuts about it. I didn't get them two. They have one to share. They're married!\n\n$45 at Amazon Alexander Wang Kori Oxford with Rose Gold Heel\n\nSplurge-item alert. I was turned on to these shoes by Ilana Glazer who has them in a different color. I saw her in them, and I told her they were cool, but I can't get hers, and she just told me to get them in a different color because she's cool like that. I'm a sneaker person, so I don't always like to wear heels unless I'm going to an event, but these are just like a two-inch heel, so you get that height while still being comfortable. I also think they're worth splurging on because they're classic rather than trendy. I can wear them for the next 20 years, and they'll be in style.\n\n$595 at Saks Fifth Avenue Juice Generation Supa Dupa Greens, 6 Pack\n\nIt's so good. This is going to sound so pretentious of me, but I discovered it at Equinox. Because I'm always running around and on the go, having a green juice really helps. I want to preface this by saying that it doesn't have fruit in it, so it won't taste incredible. I want people to know that. It will taste like a well-manicured lawn -- but the healthiest lawn. That's not the best endorsement, but it's pure vegetables, and if I've been eating unhealthily and drink this juice, my skin clears up so quickly.\n\n$58 at Juice Generation GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

This bodes very ill for Chief of Staff John Kelly, who is one of the few remaining officials whose termination has been floated in the media repeatedly but has not yet been terminated.\n\nEarlier this week, Gabriel Sherman reported that, according to an outside adviser, President Trump \"has recently mulled the concept of creating a new West Wing structure without a chief of staff, one that would instead have four co-equal principals reporting directly to him.\" Of course, if you have four \"chiefs of staff,\" you have none. And that might be the idea. NBC today reports Trump \"considered firing his chief of staff this month and not naming a successor\" and \"envisioned a scenario in which a handful of top aides would report directly to him -- bypassing the traditional gatekeeper position.\" This would be \"a more open-door policy that allowed him unfettered access to outsiders and fewer roadblocks to decision making.\" In other words, total chaos.",

                "title": "The 8 Zaniest Things About Trump's Omnibus Veto Threat",
                "body": "After turning the world upside down on Thursday by launching a potential trade war with China and replacing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster with John Bolton, the president lobbed a grenade down Pennsylvania Avenue with an early Friday morning tweet:\n\nThis could turn out to be just a smoke grenade if Trump dials back the threat, or a real grenade that blows up months of negotiations and creates the sort of crisis that would shock the political world if it involved any other president at any other time.\n\nLet us count the ways this is just weird:\n\n1) It directly contradicts a presidential tweet from Wednesday night in which Trump conveyed his grudging support for the bill.\n\nThis big-picture assessment of the giant bill is notably missing from the latest tweet, which focuses strictly on the immigration stuff.\n\n2) It directly contradicts Trump's own personal assurances to Republican congressional leaders, and the White House's public assurances to the whole world soon after.\n\nBefore the resigned-sounding Wednesday night tweet, Trump had let it be known privately he was considering a veto of the omnibus (just as it was being finalized for release), which caused Paul Ryan to scurry over to the White House and talk POTUS off the ledge. He reportedly told Ryan (and Mitch McConnell, who was on the phone) he'd sign the bill. Then on Thursday, as the House prepared to vote on it, the White House confirmed the decision in a public briefing:\n\n\"The president supports the bill, looks forward to signing it,\" Mulvaney said, alongside White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short.\n\nAgain, that was less than 24 hours ago. Nothing in the bill changed between now and then.\n\n3) Trump himself caused the DACA problem that he's now pitching a fit about Congress not fixing.\n\nLest we forget, before any Democrats were in a position to \"abandon 800,000 plus DACA recipients\" Trump abandoned them by rescinding the executive order that created DACA in the first place. And as a matter of fact, DACA recipients are not in any imminent danger purely and simply because two federal judges struck down Trump's action (it's now pending before the Supreme Court).\n\n4) Negotiations leading to the omnibus -- including the immigration provisions and the lack thereof -- have been going on for more than six months.\n\nTrump's back-and-forth on the 2,232-page omnibus at the last minute might create the impression that Congress -- the Congress controlled by his own party -- has blindsided him with this huge bill and its unsatisfying immigration provisions.\n\nIn fact, it's the product of negotiations that have been going on since last summer, when it became obvious that the regular appropriations process would, as has become customary, fail to get the job done. Congress has passed, and Trump has signed, five stopgap spending bills during these negotiations, in which the White House has been involved at every single step. Acting surprised about the omnibus's content or process now is very weird if not blatantly dishonest.\n\n5) Trump has moved the goalposts on immigration policy, making a deal all but impossible.\n\nSome sort of simple border-wall-for-DACA deal was very much on the table until quite recently. Chuck Schumer famously offered such a deal\n\nto Trump over cheeseburgers in mid-January during earlier negotiations to head off a government shutdown. But soon thereafter the White House announced a new proposal making a \"path to citizenship\" for Dreamers contingent on major changes in (and restrictions of) legal immigration, which was very much a nonstarter for Democrats.\n\nDuring the very latest negotiations, every time a renewed DACA-for-border-wall deal seemed imminent, the White House's position kept blurring; at any given moment, it wasn't clear whether Trump's most pressing demand was border-wall funding, or legal immigration changes, or even punishment of \"sanctuary cities.\" Support for a true \"path to citizenship\" for Dreamers among Republicans receded as well, in favor of short-term DACA protections for a limited population. In the end, as Dara Lind explains: \"Congressional Republicans wrote the omnibus bill the way they did because they didn't seem that interested in trying to guess what the president will actually sign.\"\n\n6) Trump waited until Congress was heading out of town before his latest veto threat.\n\nIt was not exactly a secret that Congress was embarking on a two-week Easter recess the minute the omnibus was cleared from its dockets. And members were leaving Washington for all sorts of reasons: Many were attending Representative Louise Slaughter's funeral; some were on a long-planned trip to Africa; still others were going back home to campaign for reelection. Now they are stuck in transit, waiting to see if Trump's veto threat was just a temper tantrum or a real problem.\n\nIt's entirely possible that Trump did what he did, consciously or subconsciously, to remind Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and every other member of Congress that he is the one in charge, their travel plans be damned.\n\n7) Trump may have issued his veto threat because of a Fox and Friends segment.\n\nThe weirdest possibility of all is that the president of the United States went back on his word, made his own staff and his congressional allies look like fools, and threatened a government shutdown because he woke up and saw people trashing the omnibus on Fox and Friends.\n\nAnd it's weirder yet that this theory is so plausible.\n\n8) If Trump vetoes this bill, his biggest fan will be Bob Corker.\n\nOne of the president's intraparty enemies, lame-duck senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, was leading cheers for a veto: \"Please do, Mr. President. I am just down the street and will bring you a pen.\"",

Grossman was one of the distinctive visual voices of New York magazine, starting in its very earliest issues. \"He had an intuitive sense of the relationship between cartooning and drawing and caricature and storytelling,\" Milton Glaser, New York's co-founder and original design director, recalls. \"He was a kind of natural comedian, a joke-teller, and also had such a strong visual sense that his work was always of a sort that made you pay attention.\"\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, a product of Midwood High School and Yale, he lived in a Soho loft back then, and drew for everyplace from Time to the counterculture newspaper East Village Other. If he had a specialty, it was political caricature, and Glaser recalls that he could count on Grossman to deliver something strong, and sometimes better than that, overnight. That made him extra-valuable to a magazine that was at least partially driven by news, and (in its early days especially) was often produced in a terrible rush.\n\nHe drew nearly every New York power figure of that era for this magazine, John Lindsay and Harry Van Arsdale and Ted Kheel, but if he had a recurring character it was Richard Nixon. Those jowls and fleshy folds were perfect fodder for Grossman's airbrush and pen, and his Nixons, even at a remove from the news cycle they inhabited, are still delightful.",

Just this month, the former U.N. ambassador told Fox News that Trump's upcoming summit with Kim Jong-un was a positive development -- because moving right to high-level talks would accelerate the inevitable failure of diplomacy, thereby clearing the way for war between the United States and a nuclear power.\n\nA recent Pentagon simulation projected that a nonnuclear military conflict between the United States and North Korea would come with a daily civilian death toll of 20,000 in South Korea alone.\n\nTrump's meeting with Kim is tentatively scheduled for May. That same month, he will need to reaffirm the nuclear agreement with Iran -- or else, withdraw from it, thereby informing the North Koreans that America's promises cannot be trusted. Which is to say: Within two months, Bolton will have the opportunity to sabotage diplomacy with Tehran and Pyongyang simultaneously.\n\nStill, when news of Bolton's hiring first broke Thursday night, there were a couple tenuous sources of consolation. One was this report from CNN's Kaitlan Collins:\n\nAnother was the notion that Bolton's ideology had been incidental to his selection. The president's decision to make Larry Kudlow his new economic adviser did not mean that Trump had come around to the CNBC personality's views on free trade. Thus, it was possible that he'd picked Bolton solely for the communications skills that the latter had displayed as a cable-news talking head -- one White House official had told Politico that Trump \"was impressed by [Bolton's] many appearances on Fox News.\"\n\nSo, maybe Bolton's maniacal hawkishness would be as irrelevant to White House policy as Kudlow's anti-protectionism. After all, didn't Trump reportedly resent H.R. McMaster specifically for strong-arming him into sending more troops to Afghanistan? And hadn't the mogul delivered withering assessments of George W. Bush's trigger-happy foreign policy -- not just during his 2016 campaign, but for years prior?\n\nAnd wouldn't striking an unprecedented peace agreement with North Korea be more satisfying to the master deal-maker's ego than initiating a war whose chief protagonists would be other men? Wasn't it plausible that John Bolton would just be a glorified cable news surrogate -- and Defense Secretary James Mattis, the true brains behind the administration's foreign policy?\n\nAlas, new reporting from Axios Friday morning appeared to eviscerate those slender reeds.\n\nSources close to President Trump say he feels John Bolton, hurriedly named last night to replace H.R. McMaster as national security adviser, will finally deliver the foreign policy the president wants -- particularly on Iran and North Korea.\n\n... Until now, Mattis and Tillerson have been trying to restrain what they consider some of the president's more dangerous instincts, and have been on the opposite side of major issues, including moving the U.S embassy to Jerusalem and trying to persuade Trump not to tear up the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nSources who know Bolton expect he will stare down Mattis, tell him when he's wrong, and will be a Henry Kissinger-type presence in the room. Now that Tillerson is gone, he could fundamentally tip the balance of power on Trump's national security team, senior officials expect.\n\n... A source who has spoken to Bolton said he told Trump he was only interested in two jobs: Secretary of State or national security adviser. \"He said, 'Mr. President you ran on this agenda. You ran against Iran. And if you want to hire me, that's what I'm going to produce for you.'\"\n\nAll this would be alarming enough if Trump hadn't recently taken to making enormously consequential decisions unilaterally, on a whim, without consulting his senior staff. But he has -- and late Thursday, Politico revealed that Bolton's hiring was itself the result of such a spur-of-the-moment decision.\n\nAmerican voters, elected officials, policymakers, political operatives, and journalists shoulder a responsibility much greater than that borne by their counterparts in most (if not all) other countries. How the greatest military power in world history chooses to govern itself has implications for people far beyond our borders. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis aren't walking the Earth today because of the invasion our government launched 15 years ago this week.\n\nPicture them alive, standing before you in a crowd stretching out past the horizon. Hear the cacophony of their collective conversations, prayers, children's laughter. Look into their faces. See the weddings they did not celebrate, the babies left unborn. Read the poems they did not write. Rue the apologies left undelivered, unrequited loves left unlamented, parents unmourned, friendships unformed and un-betrayed, amends left unmade, and all the other sorrowful, wondrous gifts of human existence that were incinerated by our cruise missiles, eviscerated by our assault rifles, or snuffed out by the fascistic death cult that both left in their wake.\n\nImagine 20,000 South Koreans joining them, each day.",

                "body": "A gunman in Trèbes, France, who pledged allegiance to ISIS, killed at least two people and injured a dozen more at a supermarket Friday before he was shot dead by police. He is believed to have killed one other person prior to the attack on the market.\n\nThe man entered the supermarket just after 11 a.m., according to local media reports. Holding grenades, knives, and a gun, he shouted his allegiance to the Islamic State, and yelled \"Vengeance for Syria!\" before he began shooting. The store's butcher and a customer were reportedly killed, but a local police chief said the death toll is expected to rise.\n\nAfter the killings, the gunman took several customers hostage. Others escaped or hid from him.\n\n\"I saw a door into a freezer room and I told other people around me to come and take refuge there. There were ten of us and we stayed there for an hour,\" one hostage told France Info radio. \"There were more shots and we eventually got out through an emergency exit at the back.\"\n\nFrench prime minister Édouard Philippe called the incident \"a terrorist attack.\" In addition to shouting his allegiance for ISIS, the gunman also demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the main suspect in the 2015 Paris terror attack that killed 130.\n\nPrior to the attack on the supermarket, the suspect, identified as a Moroccan man in his 30s, is believed to have killed a motorist before stealing their car. He then shot a police officer who was jogging with colleagues in the nearby town of Carcassonne.",

                "title": "America Takes the Next Step Toward Tyranny",
                "body": "Every now and again, when I find myself buried in the latest blizzard of invariably disturbing news emanating from the Trump White House, I go back and remind myself of the core narrative. I read Plato's Republic again, the prism through which I first raised the alarm about Donald Trump's emergence. The prism is essentially how a late-stage democracy, dripping with decadence and corruption, with elites dedicated primarily to enriching themselves, and a people well past any kind of civic virtue, morphs so easily into tyranny.\n\nWhen Plato's tyrant first comes to power -- on a wave of populist hatred of the existing elites -- there is a period of relative calm when he just gives away stuff: at first he promises much \"in private and public, and grant[s] freedom from debts and distribute[s] land to the people and those around himself\" (or, say, a trillion-dollar unfunded tax cut). He aims to please. But then, as he accustoms himself to power, and feels more comfortable, \"he suspects certain men of having free thoughts and not putting up with his ruling ... Some of those who helped in setting him up and are in power -- the manliest among them -- speak frankly to him and to one another, criticizing what is happening ... Then the tyrant must gradually do away with all of them, if he's going to rule, until he has left neither friend nor enemy of any worth whatsoever.\"\n\nThis is the second phase of tyranny, after the more benign settling-in: the purge. Any constraints that had been in place to moderate the tyrant's whims are set aside; no advice that counters his own gut impulses can be tolerated. And so, over the last couple of weeks, we have seen the president fire Rex Tillerson and Andrew McCabe, two individuals who simply couldn't capitulate to the demand that they obey only Trump, rather than the country as well.\n\nAnd because of this small gesture of defiance, they deserved especial public humiliation. Tillerson was warned of his impending doom while on the toilet -- a nice, sadistic touch. McCabe was fired hours before his retirement, a public execution also fraught with venom. What kind of man is this? We have become numb to it, but we should never forget how our president is a man who revels in his own cruelty. Revenge is not a dish best served cold for him. It's the reddest and rawest of meats.\n\nNo one with these instincts for total domination over others is likely to moderate the longer he is in power. Au contraire. It always gets worse. And so Tillerson has been replaced by a fawning toady, Mike Pompeo, a man whose hatred of Islam is only matched by his sympathy for waterboarders. Pompeo has been replaced in turn by a war criminal, who authorized brutal torture and illegally destroyed the evidence, Gina Haspel. Whatever else we know about Haspel, we know she follows orders.\n\nGary Cohn has been replaced by Larry Kudlow -- a sane person followed by a delusional maniac Trump sees on Fox, who instantly thought up ways for the president to cut taxes further without congressional approval. And the State Department, indeed the entire diplomatic apparatus, has, it seems, been replaced by Jared Kushner, a corrupt enthusiast for West Bank settlements who no longer has a security clearance.\n\nThen the president's legal team was shaken up -- in order to purge those few who retain some appreciation for the rule of law in a constitutional republic and to replace them with conspiracy theorists, thugs, and the kind of combative, asshole lawyers Trump has always employed in his private capacity. Trump is self-evidently -- obviously -- preparing to fire Mueller, and the GOP's complete acquiescence to the firing of McCabe is just a taste of the surrender to come. \"Now I'm fucking doing it my own way!\" was how he allegedly expressed his satisfaction at the purge, as his approval ratings from Republicans increase, and as the GOP's evolution into a full-fledged cult gathers pace.\n\nAnd then last night, we saw McMaster fall on his sword, replaced by John Bolton, an unrepentant architect of the most disastrous war since Vietnam, a fanatical advocate for regime change in Iran, an anti-Muslim extremist, and a believer in the use of military force as if it were a religion. And this, of course, is also part of the second phase for Plato's tyrant: war. \"As his first step, he is always setting some war in motion, so that people will be in need of a leader,\" Plato explains. In fact, \"it's necessary for a tyrant always to be stirring up war.\"\n\nTrump somewhat confused us on this score at first, because of his contempt for the Bushes and the Iraq War and his use of the term \"America First.\" For many excited (but utterly conned) conservative realists, he seemed to be returning to an older Republican non-interventionism. But of course, we now realize that his campaign screeds against the Iraq War were just his strategy to take out Jeb Bush and appeal to middle America; and that \"America First\" can also mean pure nationalist aggression overseas.\n\nAnd everything we know about Trump's character tells us that war is probably the only aspect of foreign relations he intuitively understands. He cannot exist as an equal party in an international system. He has to dominate other countries the way he does other human beings. And, when you look back, you see this has been obvious all along. On trade, he has long been rhetorically at war with our closest neighbors and trading partners, and now he has unveiled the contours of a major trade war with China; we already have a renewed and deeper presence in Afghanistan; and we have long been supporting the Saudi monarchy's proxy and inhumane war with Iran in Yemen.\n\nThe real possibility of a nuclear conflict with North Korea is getting more real by the day (can you imagine Bolton's counsel for the Kim Jong-un meeting?); and with Bolton in place, the groundwork for ending the Iran nuclear deal is also finally complete. And what's noticeable in all this is the irrelevance of the Senate. They refuse to reclaim their treaty-making powers with respect to trade (they could end Trump's China shenanigans overnight); they have abdicated any influence on foreign policy and war just as they have done nothing to protect the special counsel. They are just like the Roman Senate as the republic collapsed. The forms survive; there is nothing of substance behind them.\n\nWhen the U.S. detonates the Iran Nuclear Accord, the European alliance, in so far as it still staggers onward, will reach crisis point; and the Iranian regime will likely accelerate its nuclear weapons program. They'd be crazy not to. At which point, the path to war starts (or rather is very hard to stop). Kushner is the key figure here, I suspect. His support for the Israeli hard right (he doesn't just support the West Bank settlements, he funds them) and his very cozy relationship with the new Saudi prince/dictator both point in one direction: war with Iran. Getting the Americans to launch such a war is Jerusalem's and Riyadh's wet dream - which is why the reports of the Crown Prince's boasting about Kushner being \"in his pocket\" are far from implausible.\n\nAll of these developments, I bet, have reached a new intensity because of Robert Mueller's cumulative legal cornering of Trump, especially the special counsel's recent crossing the line into the finances of the Trump Organization. At that point, I suspect Trump realized he was more vulnerable than he previously believed, and went on full offense everywhere. I was long a skeptic of Trump's alleged conspiracy with Russia in 2016, but every single development in the last few months keeps pointing in the same direction -- and it isn't Trump's exoneration.\n\nYesterday, we discovered that Guccifer 2.0, Roger Stone's online pen pal, is actually a Russian agent. Trump's initial refusal to say -- even through his spokeswoman -- that Russia is clearly responsible for the release of a nerve agent in a country which is one of our closest allies was simply staggering. As is his continued refusal to confront seriously the threat Putin clearly poses to democratic elections in the West. The extraordinary leak of the warning from his national security team not to congratulate Putin during the recent call is yet another sign, it seems to me, that even those working closest to the president want to alert the world about the threat to our national security that is coming from the Oval Office itself.\n\nPart of me, of course, has long worried and hoped that my assessment of Trump as truly the tyrant of Plato's imagination is melodramatic overkill. I'm given to excitability, even catastrophism. I've been wrong before. And there are many ways in which American life still seems the same. Political tribalism didn't begin with Trump; neither did the appeal of populist authoritarianism, or the celebrification of politics. We still hold elections -- even if the president asserts that they are all rigged against him. In November, we have a chance to use the ballot box to save this country, and there are some signs that a wave is building. The courts still have some independence and feistiness; the media is still free, if now accompanied by a full-bore state propaganda channel.\n\nBut I worry that the more Trump is opposed and even cornered -- especially if he loses the House this fall -- the more dangerous he will become. If Mueller really does have the goods, and if the Democrats storm back into congressional power, then Trump may well lash out to protect himself at all costs. We know he has no concern for the collateral damage his self-advancement has long caused in his private and public life. We know he has contempt for and boundless ignorance of liberal democracy. We know he is capable of anything -- of immense cruelty and callousness, of petty revenge and reckless rhetoric, of sudden impulses and a quick temper. We also know he is commander-in-chief, who may soon need the greatest distraction of all.\n\nWar is coming. And there will be nothing and no one to stop him.\n\nBorn Trans\n\nIs being transgender a biological reality in the brain? It's a fascinating question that we're just beginning to answer. A recently published study of transgender women (both untreated with hormones and treated for one year with hormones) found structural differences between cisgender and transgender brains:\n\n\"[B]oth groups of transgender women had variations in the volume of the insula in both hemispheres. The insula is a region of the brain that reads the physiological state of the body, thus being responsible for body image and self-awareness ... Giancarlo Spizzirri, the first author of the study, highlights the fact that transgender people do display structural variations and characteristics that bring them closer to the gender with which they identify. Evidence of particularities in their brain also suggests the differences may begin to occur during gestation.\"\n\nBorn that way, perhaps. Here's another study:\n\n\"Scientists have uncovered 20 genes linked to being transgender - supporting claims that the condition has a physical basis. Researchers believe the gene variations may contribute to people identifying with the opposite sex. Presenting their research at the Society for Reproductive Investigation conference, the researchers said: 'We identified genetic variants in 20 genes that may play a role in transgender identity.\n\n'The most promising of these include variants of genes involved in neurologic development and sex hormones.' Dr Ricki Lewis, a geneticist, said: 'These are highly reputable folks going about this exactly the right way, searching the genomes of transgender people to highlight which genes they have variants in. It lends legitimacy, if that needs to be added, that transgender is not a choice but a way of being.'\"\n\nNote the provisionality of the results. We currently have some clues, and not an answer. The debate is ongoing. My view, and it is also provisional, is that being transgender is probably mixture of genetics, hormones, and very early environment -- which is roughly what I've come to believe about being gay as well (see my extended discussion of the roots of homosexual orientation in the second essay in my book, Love Undetectable).\n\nThis recourse to science was very helpful in the long campaign for marriage equality, and is a line of argument that can appeal to the sane right and left, which is why it is so bizarre that it should be playing almost no role in the current discussion. The reason for this is that the right, by and large, wants to insist that being transgender is some kind of mental illness, and the left is committed to the notion that everything is a social construction and nothing else. (Science itself is a social construction as well, and for many postmodernists, it is a function of \"white male supremacy\" and therefore inherently suspect.) And so an insight that would help clarify the dignity of trans people is left on the table.\n\nThere are, mercifully, some transgender activists who have taken up the biological argument. One of them is a friend of mine, Dana Beyer. She's blunt as well as scientifically trained: \"Trans men and women know full well who they are, and there is no flexibility involved,\" she argues. \"We are of one brain sex and the opposite genital sex. We identify as our brain sex, because our minds are functions of our brains, and our brains determine our gender identity. It's not something we make up, or choose on a whim -- it's who we are.\" That formulation strikes me as a brilliant one. It doesn't overturn the vast majority's sense of their own sex and gender; it bases its compassion in a scientific discourse, not an ideological one; and it may even have the virtue of being true. Here's hoping it will play a greater role in deepening our understanding, even though so many transgender people (not ideologues) have been telling this story about themselves forever.\n\nIn Praise of Charlotte Pence\n\nAfter Stormy Daniels, Charlotte Pence, daughter of Vice-President Mike Pence, deserves some kind of award for her response to controversy. She penned a children's book, as we all now know, about her family's pet rabbit, called Marlon Bundo's Day in the Life of the Vice President. John Oliver decided to spoof it by creating another book about Marlon, wherein said bunny is a sodomite in a bow tie, and has a different kind of story to tell. Spoiler alert: In Oliver's version, Marlon gets married!\n\nBoth Spence's book and Oliver's are donating their revenues to charity, Pence's to A21, a charity to stop human trafficking, and Tracy's Kids, which funds art programs for kids with cancer, and Oliver's to AIDS United and the Trevor Project, a charity to help bullied gay youngsters. But Oliver's is aimed at Mike Pence, and his alleged homophobia. (Pence is definitely opposed to marriage equality, is embedded in the anti-gay religious right, but has not, to my knowledge, ever smeared or slurred gay people as such. He's an orthodox Evangelical, in other words. And there are aspects of the ad hominem hate campaign against him personally that I find distasteful and cheap.)\n\nYou might imagine his daughter would bridle at the trolling. But no. Here's what she said to Fox Business Network: \"I mean, I think, you know, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery in a way. But also, in all seriousness, his book is contributing to charities that I think we can all get behind. We have two books giving to charities that are about bunnies, so I'm all for it really.\"\n\nI have to say I'm impressed. Both books, because of the publicity, have rocketed up the sales charts, producing a bonanza for the charities they help. I'm pretty sure Oliver's is funnier, and he could have left off his \"fuck off\" to the vice-president. But this was a public spat, which did not degenerate into culture war, and which was defused by a 24-year-old's good humor. You'd almost think we've retained some measure of civilization in this sewer of a culture, wouldn't you?\n\nSee you next Friday.",

                "body": "Back before matching algorithms and swiping left and right were the only ways to find love (or lust) online, there was a thing called Craigslist. The idea behind Craigslist is \"what if the classified ads, but online?\" Aside from selling things, one of the most popular parts of the site was for finding dates -- or paid companionship.\n\nThis week, the House of Representatives approved a bill known as FOSTA (Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017), which places legal responsibility for sex-work interactions on platform holders, rather than individual users. It's a dramatic shift, since platform holders have, for years, been immune to legal responsibility for what their users do on their platforms, provided that they responded to inappropriate behavior effectively.\n\nUnlike companies like Facebook or Google, however, Craigslist is and has always been stubbornly simple. It doesn't use advanced AI or whatever to root out bad posts. Because of that, the site announced last night that it was taking down the Personals section entirely.\n\nA brief note reads:\n\nUS Congress just passed HR 1865, \"FOSTA\", seeking to subject websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties (users) misuse online personals unlawfully.\n\nAny tool or service can be misused. We can't take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day.\n\nTo the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through craigslist, we wish you every happiness!\n\nThis sort of reaction is one that those who oppose the bill feared; that it would cause a chilling effect on legitimate platforms that would shut down functionality entirely rather than assume the legal risk. In the meantime, the one guy still in charge of personal ads at your local print paper is doing backflips.",

As always, please comment with one of your own -- we're here to help.\n\nQuestion: Looking for a men's tank top. Something I could wear to yoga but also out in the NYC summer (i.e., not a \"gym\" tank). Loose, comfortable, fashionable, but not fashion-y. If Outdoor Voices made one, I'd probably buy it. I still own a few from Industry of All Nations, but now it seems like they only make a few with printed patterns, and I want something more basic. Looking at the American Apparel site, but not sure I'd trust it (though I guess the tri-blend tank gets closest to what I'm looking for). Like something Miles McMillan would be spotted wearing. Help!\n\nTo search for this rare specimen -- a men's tank that actually looks good and doesn't shout \"overeager bro at a music festival\" -- we heard from our in-house menswear expert. That's Jason Chen, our deputy editor and all-around well-dressed man. His first suggestion: \"I thought, for more of a city vibe, there's this Saturdays tank, which is a bit more substantial.\" I enjoy the scoop-neck cut on this one and it's made out of pima cotton, a really soft material that sheets are often woven from.\n\nRosen Pima Tank Natural Heather $55 at Spring Tank Top With Chest Pocket\n\nI reached out to Miles McMillan's agent to learn what he's actually wearing in all of those pap shots, but we didn't hear back in time for this post. Instead, Jason says, \"I actually suspect that the tanks Miles wears are more like H&M things! A few of them have that shlubby thing going on.\" Exhibit A.\n\n$6 at H&M Cotton Jersey Tank Top\n\nExhibit B, this time with a higher neckline, if you're not as excited about your chest hair.\n\n$7 at H&M Industry of All Nations Men's Clean Tank\n\nThat was all from Jason (thank you, Jason!), but I dug around a bit more and it's worth noting that there is literally one solid-color Industry of All Nations tank still available on Amazon. Don't miss out!\n\n$48 at Amazon $48 at Amazon ATM Anthony Thomas Melillo Modal Tank Top\n\nIf Anthony Thomas Melillo's aptly named Model Tank is not what McMillan actually wears, it's at least what menswear designers imagine he's wearing.\n\n$70 at Saks Fifth Avenue MPG Spark Essential Tank\n\nMeanwhile, MPG's tank has a similar, just a bit slimmer look for nearly half the price.\n\n$38 at Saks Fifth Avenue Tidal Tank\n\nNative Youth's Tidal Tank has a bit of a boxier cut, but I like the texture of the indigo pinstripe. Click on the link to get an up-close view.\n\n$50 at Nordstrom Theodore Tank\n\nAnother striped tank from RVCA.\n\n$35 at Nordstrom Sunny Gang Tank\n\nThis one's a little long, but I think it'll look great tucked in (like Miles does), and the pigment-dyed coloring is great for the summer. Pairs well with light-wash jeans.\n\n$45 at Nordstrom Tri-Blend Tank\n\nAnd one last thing. Since you were wary of American Apparel, I reached out to Gildan, the clothing manufacturer that makes every blank T-shirt the world has ever screen-printed on, and that also purchased American Apparel last year. Gildan reopened the American Apparel website in August and brought back all of the basics. They're made of the same materials, fabrics, colors, and cuts they've been designing with all along, but the only difference is that some products, including this tank, are now manufactured in China, not the USA.\n\n$18 at American Apparel GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "Trump Hired Bolton to Make Foreign Policy Exciting Again",
                "body": "The news of John Bolton's appointment as national security adviser frightened the foreign policy community, which has long shunned him as a true believer in his own belligerent credo. But the real danger it reveals is in Trump himself. The foreign policy apparatus really has been engaged in an unprecedented campaign of leaking, the only possible motivation for which is its white-knuckled terror of a president who clearly lacks the mental capacity to handle the awesome power he has gained.\n\nEvery account of Trump's decision to replace H.R. McMaster with John Bolton reinforces this narrative. Trump's main problem with McMaster was that his briefings were not dumbed-down to a low enough level. McMaster \"is an intensely focused intellectual whose detailed briefings, by all accounts, drove the president crazy,\" reports Politico. \"Trump took to mocking him openly in the Oval Office, asking other White House aides why McMaster was so serious.\"\n\nThe Post has previously reported that Trump had registered a somewhat similar complaint with his now-fired secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. (\"The president has long clashed with Tillerson, who he believes is too 'establishment' in his thinking.\") One might think \"establishment\" would be a positive association for a job like secretary of State. It makes sense to want somebody who's lax and easygoing to handle jobs like, say, arranging hotel-room dates with porn stars you meet on the golf course, but \"establishment\" would convey the proper set of attributes for a job involving complex international diplomacy.\n\nBut Trump seems to find normal foreign policy boring, and craves the kind of narrative drama found in the manufactured cartoon moralism found on Fox News, where evil abounds, and the only question is whether it will be faced down by tough guys or by sniveling wimps.\n\nBolton was constantly appearing on Trump's television screen delivering thrilling vows to take on evildoers. Meanwhile, McMaster was in his office every day giving boring lectures. \"When the president would receive his morning schedule and see that he was expected to spend 30 minutes or longer with McMaster outside of his intelligence briefing, Trump would complain and ask aides to cut it back,\" two sources tell the Washington Post. \"At times, Trump would tell McMaster that he understood an issue largely to make him stop talking, these people said. 'I get it, General, I get it,' Trump would say, according to two people who were present at the time.\" The Post also notes that Trump would tell his staff some days he \"did not want to see McMaster at all,\" like a child asking to skip school.\n\nThe New York Times account is similar: \"McMaster's didactic style and preference for order made him an uncomfortable fit with a president whose style is looser, and who has little patience for the detail and nuance of complex national security issues.\" The Times also notes, as does the Post, that Trump's hesitation to bring on Bolton was \"in part because of his negative reaction to Mr. Bolton's walrus-style mustache.\" The Post had also stated in December 2016 that Bolton's mustache played a decisive role in his failing to get a post at the outset of the administration. \"Donald was not going to like that mustache,\" a source reported. \"I can't think of anyone that's really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes.\"\n\nBoredom with McMaster, and a craving for the excitement of Bolton's slashing rhetoric, ultimately prevailed over Trump's disdain for mustaches. One report had claimed Bolton had promised Trump he would not start any wars. But a source close to Bolton insists to Jonathan Swan he made no such commitment. And why would he? Bringing in Bolton to not start a war would be totally perverse.\n\nThe level of deliberation likely to occur between Bolton and Trump will be perilously thin. Another source tells Axios that Trump's decision to pull the trigger on McMaster came with surprising speed, after having lingered for months: \"He's impulsive. He makes snap decisions but they're weird snap decisions ... He publicly ruminates for six months and then says: 'I have to do this right now.'\" And now imagine that decision-making process applied to a major military conflict.",

                "title": "Bolton, Lover of Drama and Wars, Is a Terrible Fit for NSA",
                "body": "John Bolton has been one of liberals' top bogeymen on national security for more than a decade now. He seems to relish the role, going out of his way to argue that the Iraq War wasn't really a failure, calling for U.S.-led regime change in Iran and preventive war against North Korea, and writing the foreword for a book that proclaimed President Obama to be a secret Muslim. He is a profoundly partisan creature, having started a super-PAC whose largest donor was leading Trump benefactor Rebekah Mercer and whose provider of analytics was Cambridge Analytica, the firm alleged to have improperly used Facebook data to make voter profiles, which it sold to the Trump and Brexit campaigns, among others.\n\nRecently Bolton's statements have grown more extreme, alarming centrist and conservative national-security professionals along with his longtime liberal foes. He seemed to say that the United States could attack North Korea without the agreement of our South Korean allies, who would face the highest risk of retaliation and casualties; just two months ago he called for a regime change effort in Iran that would allow the U.S. to open a new embassy there by 2019, the 40th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution and the taking of Americans hostage in Tehran. His hostility toward Islam points toward a set of extreme policies that could easily have the effect of abridging American Muslims' rights at home and alienating America's Muslim allies abroad.\n\nAs worrying as these policies are, it's worth taking a step back and thinking not about Bolton, but about his new boss, Donald Trump. Trump reportedly considered Bolton for a Cabinet post early on, but then soured on him, finding his mustache unprofessional. His choice of Bolton to lead the National Security Council reinforces several trends: right now, this administration is all about making Trump's opponents uncomfortable and angry. Internal coherence and policy effectiveness are not a primary or even secondary consideration. And anyone would be a fool to imagine that, because Bolton pleases Trump today, he will continue to do so tomorrow.\n\nYes, Bolton has taken strong stances against the policies of Russian president Vladimir Putin (though he has also been quoted praising Russian \"democracy\" as recently as 2013). That's nothing new: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, incoming Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and outgoing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster have called for greater pushback on Russia as well. But there's every reason to think that, rather than a well-oiled war machine, what we'll get from Bolton's National Security Council is scheming and discord -- which could be even more dangerous.\n\nPresident Trump was said to complain that Tillerson disagreed with him and McMaster talked too much. Bolton seems likely to combine both of those traits in one pugnacious, mustachioed package. Their disagreements are real -- Bolton has famously pooh-poohed the kind of summit diplomacy with North Korea that Trump is now committed to. While Trump famously backed away from his support for the 2002 invasion of Iraq, courting the GOP isolationist base, Bolton continues to argue that the invasion worked, and seldom hears of a war he would not participate in. Trump attempted to block transgender people from serving in the military, but Bolton has declined to take part in the right's LGBT-bashing, famously hiring gay staff and calling for the end of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\n\nThat's all substance. What really seems likely to take Bolton down is his style, which is legendary -- and not in a good way. His colleagues from the George W. Bush administration responded to Trump's announcement with comments like \"the obvious question is whether John Bolton has the temperament and the judgment for the job\" -- not exactly a ringing endorsement. One former co-worker described Bolton as a \"kiss up, kick down kind of guy,\" and he was notorious in past administrations for conniving and sneaking around officials who disagreed with him, both traits that Trump seems likely to enjoy ... until he doesn't. This is a man who can't refrain from telling Tucker Carlson that his analysis is \"simpleminded\" -- while he's a guest on Carlson's show. Turns out it's not true that he threw a stapler at a contractor -- it was a tape dispenser. When Bolton was caught attempting to cook intelligence to suggest that Cuba had a biological-weapons program, he bullied the analyst who had dared push back, calling him a \"mid-level ... munchkin.\" How long until Trump tires of the drama -- or of being eclipsed?\n\nBolton may find that in this job, he's the mid-level munchkin. Remember, the national security adviser is supposed to be the coordinator, conciliator, and honest broker among Cabinet officials, managing a process by which all get a fair say and the president makes well-informed decisions. Outgoing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster reportedly lost favor with Defense Secretary Mattis and Chief of Staff John Kelly for failing to defer to them, and for being too emotional. Love Bolton or hate him, no one imagines he will be a self-effacing figure, and no one hires him to run a no-drama process. It's also hard to imagine that many of the high-quality professionals McMaster brought into the National Security Council staff will choose to stay. McMaster repeatedly had to fight for his team within the Trump administration, but Bolton seems unlikely to follow that pattern, or to inspire the kind of loyalty that drew well-regarded policy wonks to work for McMaster, regardless their views of Trump.\n\nSo even if you like the policies Bolton espouses, it's hard to imagine a smooth process implementing them. That seems likely to leave us with Muslim ban-level incompetence, extreme bellicosity, and several very loud, competing voices -- with Twitter feeds -- on the most sensitive issues of war and weapons of mass destruction.",

                "title": "Trump Sabotages His Shot at a Peaceful North Korea Solution",
                "body": "If President Donald Trump wants to resolve the nuclear standoff with North Korea by diplomatic means, he sure has a funny way of showing it.\n\nIf the upcoming meeting between Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un actually results in a deal to denuclearize the isolated rogue state and restore it as a member of the international community in relatively good standing, it will be perhaps the greatest diplomatic breakthrough in American diplomacy since the end of the Cold War. For all his many shortcomings, Trump would deserve praise for this, in a Nixon-in-China sort of way.\n\nUnfortunately, since agreeing to meet with Kim earlier this month (likely without realizing what he was agreeing to), Trump has steadily undermined this goal with every foreign policy-related word and deed. Hopes were already dim for such a breakthrough, but his two headline decisions announced on Thursday -- $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports and the appointment of John Bolton as his new national security adviser -- may have been the final nails in its coffin.\n\nTo start with the obvious, Bolton's reputation as a neoconservative war hawk precedes him. An architect and unrepentant champion of the Iraq War, Bolton consistently prefers the use of force as the primary means of solving America's problems around the world. In Bolton's dictionary, cooperation, international law, and multilateralism are all dirty words. Hardly anyone who has carried the title of \"diplomat\" shares his utter contempt for diplomacy as a means of solving problems in the world.\n\nFrom his last government perch in the George W. Bush administration, as ambassador to the United Nations (an institution he openly despises), Bolton could damage little beyond what remained of the United States' reputation and international standing. As national security adviser to Trump, however, Bolton may be substantially more dangerous, as he is likely to encourage rather than temper Trump's worst impulses.\n\nBolton is due to take office April 9, meaning he will have plenty of time at the president's side to shape his thoughts and actions before the two consequential diplomatic events coming up in May: the meeting with Kim and Trump's next opportunity to tear up the nuclear agreement with Iran. Bolton, of course, is a longstanding advocate of war with Iran, so the odds that Trump decides to pull out of that deal are even slimmer than they already were.\n\nAs for North Korea, Bolton was recently seen on television cheering for diplomacy to fail, so that the U.S. can proceed with the war he sees as inevitable and desirable. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published last month, Bolton laid out his view of the legal case for a preventive strike on North Korea. A month of Bolton whispering in Trump's ear that the North Koreans and the Chinese (and the Russians, and the Iranians, and the Arabs, etc.) are congenital liars who can't be trusted outside the range of a Patriot missile, and these talks become less likely to actually happen and more likely to fail by design if they do. Of course, Trump should not take Kim at his word, but neither should he pass up the opportunity this diplomatic opening presents to avoid war and put North Korea on a path toward denuclearization.\n\nIf Bolton's appointment pushes us one step closer to war with North Korea, so too does Trump's decision to slap China with punitive tariffs. China is a key player in Northeast Asia and the only country that appears to hold any kind of sway over Pyongyang's behavior. Enforcing any hypothetical agreement with North Korea to slow down, scale down, or dismantle its nuclear weapons program is inconceivable without Chinese help.\n\nChina has a strong and sincere interest in resolving the Korean crisis peacefully. No country welcomes the prospect of a war next door, least of all one with a nuclear dimension. A war would devastate North Korea and send refugees pouring across the Chinese border by the thousands if not the millions, particularly if the North Korean state collapses (an outcome Bolton, incidentally, appears to favor).\n\nIn comments earlier this month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed enthusiasm about the potential breakthrough between North and South Korea and encouraged the parties to pursue parallel dialogues on denuclearization and security normalization, addressing North Korea's legitimate security concerns as well as those of South Korea, the rest of the region, and the U.S.\n\nChina's strategic interests in the Korean peninsula are unchanged by the Trump administration's trade policy, but it's hard to see Beijing being eager to help shepherd the best possible outcome for the U.S. and its allies when we are actively engaged in a trade war. Whether we like it or not, China is a major global power just like the U.S. and has lots of options for making things difficult for Washington if it so chooses, from blocking our initiatives in the U.N. Security Council to building new frameworks for international trade in which the U.S. is not a leader or even a participant.\n\nAn administration less fixated on zero-sum fantasies of foreign trade and international relations might take the opposite tack and make a deal whereby China quietly ends some of its unfair trade practices in exchange for the U.S. agreeing to put all parties' security concerns on the table in the Korea talks, not just those of our side. At the very least, a government with a less one-sided worldview might have the sensibility to treat China like a formidable rival and potential partner worthy of respect, rather than a misbehaving child that can be easily pushed around.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration is antagonizing China at a moment when we could really use its cooperation in solving the world's most pressing security problem, while welcoming an adviser who sees a catastrophic war as the only viable solution to that problem. Just as Trump was beginning to steer the U.S. away from its collision course with North Korea, he has taken a violent turn back toward it.",

                "title": "Bolton's Ineptitude May Be More Dangerous Than His Ideology",
                "body": "John Bolton has been one of liberals' top bogeymen on national security for more than a decade now. He seems to relish the role, going out of his way to argue that the Iraq War wasn't really a failure, calling for U.S.-led regime change in Iran and preventive war against North Korea, and writing the foreword for a book that proclaimed President Obama to be a secret Muslim. He is a profoundly partisan creature, having started a super-PAC whose largest donor was leading Trump benefactor Rebekah Mercer and whose provider of analytics was Cambridge Analytica, the firm alleged to have improperly used Facebook data to make voter profiles, which it sold to the Trump and Brexit campaigns, among others.\n\nRecently Bolton's statements have grown more extreme, alarming centrist and conservative national security professionals along with his longtime liberal foes. He seemed to say that the United States could attack North Korea without the agreement of our South Korean allies, who would face the highest risk of retaliation and casualties; just two months ago he called for a regime change effort in Iran that would allow the U.S. to open a new embassy there by 2019, the 40th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution and the taking of Americans hostage in Tehran. His hostility toward Islam points toward a set of extreme policies that could easily have the effect of abridging American Muslims' rights at home and alienating America's Muslim allies abroad.\n\nAs worrying as these policies are, it's worth taking a step back and thinking not about Bolton, but about his new boss, Donald Trump. Trump reportedly considered Bolton for a Cabinet post early on, but then soured on him, finding his mustache unprofessional. His choice of Bolton to lead the National Security Council reinforces several trends: right now, this administration is all about making Trump's opponents uncomfortable and angry. Internal coherence and policy effectiveness are not a primary or even secondary consideration. And anyone would be a fool to imagine that, because Bolton pleases Trump today, he will continue to do so tomorrow.\n\nYes, Bolton has taken strong stances against the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin (though he has also been quoted praising Russian \"democracy\" as recently as 2013). That's nothing new: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, incoming Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and outgoing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster have called for greater pushback on Russia as well. But there's every reason to think that, rather than a well-oiled war machine, what we'll get from Bolton's National Security Council is scheming and discord - which could be even more dangerous.\n\nPresident Trump was said to complain that Tillerson disagreed with him and McMaster talked too much. Bolton seems likely to combine both of those traits in one pugnacious, mustachioed package. Their disagreements are real - Bolton has famously pooh-poohed the kind of summit diplomacy with North Korea that Trump is now committed to. While Trump famously backed away from his support for the 2002 invasion of Iraq, courting the GOP isolationist base, Bolton continues to argue that the invasion worked, and seldom hears of a war he would not participate in. Trump attempted to block transgender people from serving in the military, but Bolton has declined to take part in the right's LGBT-bashing, famously hiring gay staff and calling for the end of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\n\nThat's all substance. What really seems likely to take Bolton down is his style, which is legendary - and not in a good way. His colleagues from the George W. Bush administration responded to Trump's announcement with comments like \"the obvious question is whether John Bolton has the temperament and the judgment for the job\" - not exactly a ringing endorsement. One former co-worker described Bolton as a \"kiss up, kick down kind of guy,\" and he was notorious in past administrations for conniving and sneaking around officials who disagreed with him, both traits that Trump seems likely to enjoy ... until he doesn't. This is a man who can't refrain from telling Tucker Carlson that his analysis is \"simpleminded\" - while he's a guest on Carlson's show. Turns out it's not true that he threw a stapler at a contractor - it was a tape dispenser. When Bolton was caught attempting to cook intelligence to suggest that Cuba had a biological weapons program, he bullied the analyst who had dared push back, calling him a \"midlevel ... munchkin.\" How long until Trump tires of the drama - or of being eclipsed?\n\nBolton may find that in this job, he's the midlevel munchkin. Remember, the national security adviser is supposed to be the coordinator, conciliator, and honest broker among Cabinet officials, managing a process by which all get a fair say and the president makes well-informed decisions. Outgoing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster reportedly lost favor with Defense Secretary Mattis and Chief of Staff John Kelly for failing to defer to them, and for being too emotional. Love Bolton or hate him, no one imagines he will be a self-effacing figure, and no one hires him to run a no-drama process. It's also hard to imagine that many of the high-quality professionals McMaster brought into the National Security Council staff will choose to stay. McMaster repeatedly had to fight for his team within the Trump administration, but Bolton seems unlikely to follow that pattern, or to inspire the kind of loyalty that drew well-regarded policy wonks to work for McMaster, regardless their views of Trump.\n\nSo even if you like the policies Bolton espouses, it's hard to imagine a smooth process implementing them. That seems likely to leave us with Muslim ban-level incompetence, extreme bellicosity, and several very loud, competing voices - with Twitter feeds - on the most sensitive issues of war and weapons of mass destruction.",

                "title": "Nobody is Left to Save the World From Trump Now",
                "body": "From the outset of his presidency, to which he was elevated with barely any preparation, Donald Trump was surrounded by a protective cordon of advisers, as a child monarch might. In return for absorbing his tantrums, they would educate their unsteady charge, who would wind up, after pratfalls and drama, inflicting no more ruin on the country than a normal modern Republican president might. (Which, to be sure, it quite a bit of ruin). Somehow it seemed we might muddle through.\n\nNow Trump is breaking through the protective cordon. The people who joined the government to save Donald Trump from himself, or to save the world from Trump, are leaving. Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson are gone. Trump is reorganizing his legal team, mobilizing for war against the special counsel. And now he has finally cast off his most important minder, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, and replaced him with John Bolton.\n\nBolton is in some ways the foreign policy analogue of his domestic counterpart, Lawrence Kudlow, the incoming head of the National Economic Council. Like Kudlow, Bolton is a true believing ideologue firmly encamped on his party's right flank, who appears regularly on Fox News to propound ultrasimplistic solutions to the world's problem, which Trump can easily grasp on his sofa. Also like Kudlow, Bolton has given every indication of being personally committed to Trump, and has not condescended to him.\n\nThe difference, however, is that Kudlow's kooky ideas have little chance of enactment given the tenuous Republican control of Congress. Bolton's foreign policy notions can be quickly operationalized, given the near-total command the executive branch has over foreign policy. What's more, those ideas have the potential to kill large numbers of people.\n\nBolton has long been estranged from a substantial segment of his own party, which regards him as dangerous. He served as undersecretary of state of arms control in the Bush administration, and while many of his colleagues came away at least somewhat chastened by their errors, Bolton did not. \"I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,\" he said in 2015. Bolton spent the end of the Bush administration bitterly criticizing its pragmatic turn, as figures like Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld were replaced by moderates like Robert Gates, and vice-president Dick Cheney began losing some internal battles. Bolton likewise attacked Bush as dangerously weak on North Korea: \"'Not only was [policy] moving in the wrong direction, it was going to continue in the wrong direction no matter what I did,\"\"\n\nIn 2005, several Republican Senators joined Democrats to block Bolton from an appointment as ambassador to the United Nations, a rare rebuke. (Bush then appointed Bolton during a Senate recess.) After the 2016 election, when Bolton sought a position within the State Department, Republican foreign policy veterans again rallied to block him.\n\nBolton is considered so dangerous, even by many Republican hawks, because he is a true believer, deeply in the grips of black and white notions of simple morality that are difficult to reconcile with the messy reality that is the world. There is a long history of ideologues joining a presidential administration and terrifying the establishment, only to be assimilated into its bureaucratic routines. But Bolton's character and history seem to defy any such domestication. During his time in the administration, he not only ignored but bullied staffers who presented analyses that questioned his prior assumptions. His brain is impervious to complication.\n\nThe combination of Bolton and Trump poses an especially potent danger. Trump once declared \"I love war, in a certain way.\" Both men think in terms of zero-sum conflict and harbor an obsession with dominating their adversaries. They are temperamental twins. In North Korea or elsewhere, Bolton could goad Trump into dangerous reaction. Some people fooled themselves into believing Trump would govern as a dove of some kind. But any dovish impulses he had were a product of his lack of control over the government. Trump might dismiss the use of power by people who aren't Trump, but is not inclined to be shy about wielding power that he commands himself.\n\nThe great danger of a Trump presidency has never been the things that are the most likely to happen. It has been the tail risks - any number of low-probability, high impact events that are far more likely to occur with an authoritarian buffoon in the White House than under a normal president. Trump has spent his presidency surrounded by people who were at least attempting to contain these risks - say, a Constitutional crisis, or a meltdown of the international order. As awful and comically surreal as the first year and a quarter of his term has been, after Trump has taken full command of his administration, we may see it as a golden age.",

                "body": "Following months of rumors that his exit was imminent, the White House announced on Thursday evening that Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster will resign as national security adviser. He will be replaced by John Bolton, who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush.\n\n\"H.R. McMaster has served his country with distinction for more than 30 years. He has won many battles and his bravery and toughness are legendary,\" Trump said in a statement. \"General McMaster's leadership of the National Security Council staff has helped my administration accomplish great things to bolster America's national security.\"\n\nIt was reported last week that Trump had decided to fire McMaster, but his exit might be delayed by weeks or months so the White House could arrange a non-humiliating exit. According to the New York Times, McMaster decided to accelerate his departure, partly because rumors about his status were casting a shadow over his interactions with foreign officials.\n\nThe latest change comes after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired (in a quite humiliating fashion) last week, and replaced by CIA director Mike Pompeo. Officials said Trump's goal is to have his new security team in place before he meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Unlike Tillerson's exit, McMaster's departure is said to be amicable. McMaster will retire from the military.\n\nBolton, one of the most hawkish neoconservatives, will take office on April 9. He was said to be on Trump's short list of candidates for a national security position as far back as the transition, but due to his role in pushing for the Iraq war, his arguments in favor of bombing Iran, and claims that he bullied subordinates, he was seen as too controversial at the time - but lately, Trump seems even less concerned about such things.",

                "body": "It's not surprising that Republicans are wary of special elections in the Trump era. As Nathaniel Rakich observed earlier this month, Democrats around the country have over-performed based on voting history:\n\nThere have now been 127 special elections in 28 states since President Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. In the 95 of those races to pit at least one Democrat against at least one Republican, Democrats have outperformed the normal partisan lean4 of their districts by an average of 13.2 percentage points.\n\nYou can now add in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district as another data point that should trouble the GOP.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker, never one to put fairness ahead of partisanship, has found a convenient way to avoid embarrassing special election losses: by not holding special elections.\n\nAs is the case in most states, in Wisconsin the governor is responsible for calling special elections when legislative vacancies occur. Said governor has some leeway about when to hold said elections. But until Walker, it had not occurred to anyone to answer the question of \"when\" with \"never.\" Talking Points Memo explained:\n\nWalker's office has said it's not worth the cost or effort to hold the votes, since regular congressional races will take place in November. But Democrats and their allies say Walker is just scared to lose.\n\n\"This is about them not wanting to be embarrassed by losing races in districts they have traditionally won,\" Wisconsin Democratic strategist Sachin Chheda told TPM. \"Everybody knows it, and I think it's embarrassing that they'd make a decision on that basis rather than the small 'd' democratic tenets of giving people the right to choose their own representative.\"\n\nWhat makes the inaction especially ironic is that Walker created these vacancies his own self by appointing the two legislators in question (one member of the Senate, one member of the Assembly) to positions in his administration. So having removed representation for the 229,904 affected residents, Walker is now ensuring they lack representation for the rest of 2018, during a very lively period of activity in state government.\n\nIn February the governor was sued by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, headed by former Attorney General Eric Holder (and focused on states like Wisconsin with competitive balances in state legislatures), who called Walker's action \"an affront to representative democracy.\" On March 22, a local judge in Madison -- one appointed, as it happens, by Walker -- ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered the governor to call elections, as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports:\n\nDane County Circuit Judge Josann Reynolds -- whom Walker appointed to the bench in 2014 -- determined Walker had a duty under state law to hold special elections so voters could have representation in the Legislature. She said failing to hold special elections infringed on the voting rights of people who lived in the two districts.\n\n\"To state the obvious, if the plaintiffs have a right to vote for their representatives, they must have an election to do so,\" said Reynolds.\n\nYes, that is kind of obvious. Walker is now undecided as to whether he will comply with the order or appeal it, giving himself some more bad publicity. The judge added to that bad publicity with a pretty direct shot at the governor's motives:\n\n\"I cannot reconcile the incongruity between Gov. Walker's administration's very vocal and consistent policy advocating for strict constructionism and the position taken by the attorney general in this case involving the most basic constitutional guarantee,\" Reynolds said.\n\nOuchy ouchy.\n\nThere's obviously no guarantee the special elections, when they are finally held, will produce Democratic gains, or even the kind of over-performance that could be an omen for wins in more competitive districts in November. But it does not look like Walker's attempt to reduce the risk of an unhappy result to zero will fly.",

Citi says it will cut ties with any companies that refuse to abide by the new standards.\n\n\"We have already begun to engage with them in the hope that they will adopt these best practices over the coming months,\" says a memo written by CEO Michael Corbat. \"If they opt not to, we will respect their decision and work with them to transition their business away from Citi.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, the move is \"unlikely to directly affect a large share of business at the bank\" with the \"weapons industry represent[ing] a small slice of Citi's overall business.\"\n\nStill, the move is drawing praise from gun-control advocates. Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, wrote in a tweet: \"This is what corporate responsibility looks like.\"\n\nFlorida Democratic representative Ted Deutch, whose district includes Parkland, Florida, tweeted that \"More companies - and Members of Congress - need to follow\" Citi's lead.\n\nThe company is also experiencing blowback, which Corbat tried to quell in his memo by calling himself \"an avid outdoorsman and responsible gun owner.\" He also wrote that the policy \"was designed to respect the rights of responsible gun owners while helping to keep firearms out of the wrong hands.\"\n\nHe added: \"We don't have the perfect solution to supporting our Constitution while keeping our children and grandchildren safe. Best practices are going to continue to change, and we understand the limitations of our efforts. But we shouldn't let that stop us from doing our part.\"",

                "title": "Trump: The Campus Free-Speech Crisis Is 'Highly Overblown'",
                "body": "The past few weeks (and/or months, and/or years) have witnessed a heated, intra-left debate over \"political correctness\" on America's college campuses. Some liberals contend that the campus left's embrace of illiberal tactics like \"no-platforming\" right-wing speakers -- or attempting to shut down conservative college newspapers -- poses a threat to progressive values. Such commentators argue that this \"illiberal left\" is undermining vital norms of free speech and toleration that ultimately protect marginalized people and viewpoints against suppression, and promote critical thinking and rational discourse.\n\nOther progressives counter that it's perfectly legitimate for left-wing activists to contest how universities allocate the limited resources available for bringing public intellectuals to campus; a paid speaking gig is not a constitutional right, and protest is its own form of speech. Further, some would continue, almost no one believes that no speech is so vile as to merit the heckler's veto -- few would complain if students tried to shut down the speech of an Islamist cleric who defended the legitimacy of the September 11 attacks. There are always boundaries to what kind of speech we, as a society, are willing to tolerate in the public square -- and progressives are well within their rights to try and move those boundaries.\n\nRecently, though, the most vigorous iteration of this back-and-forth has been a meta one: How significant a phenomenon is the anti-free speech left, anyway? On this point, the \"anti-anti-PC left\" argues that \"no-platforming\" protests are a tactic popular with a small number of students on a small number of elite college campuses: In the aggregate, millennials are actually more tolerant of freedom of expression than their predecessors. And even if one stipulates that the illiberal campus left is a problem of some kind, isn't it possible that the media's excessive focus on that marginal phenomenon might have even more deleterious effects? At a time when the U.S. Justice Department is attempting to imprison protesters en masse, ICE agents are targeting immigration activists for deportation, and states are passing blatantly unconstitutional \"anti-BDS laws\" -- and the reactionary coalition behind such illiberal efforts is itself working to exaggerate the prevalence of extremism on the American left -- is it not a dereliction of duty for the nation's largest newspapers and magazines to run more columns bemoaning the heckling of Christina Hoff Sommers, than ones condemning the prosecution of the J20 protesters?\n\nLiberals who are less sanguine about developments on campus, like New York's Jonathan Chait, counter that such meta-complaints are self-refuting (\"If the real problem with anti-PC columns is that they ignore more important issues off campus, then doesn't that criticism apply with equal force to anti-anti-PC columns?\"), and that it is important for those on the left to police illiberalism within their own tribe, because doing so fortifies the left's intellectual dexterity, and undermines the right's attempts to discredit progressivism.\n\nAll of which is to say: This is a very complicated debate, you know, a lotta ins, a lotta outs, a lotta what have yous. And given all the compelling points on both sides, it can be difficult for some open-minded progressives to know what to think.\n\nFortunately, the one public intellectual with enough authority on the American left to settle this dispute, once and for all, just put his thumb on the scales:\n\nSo there you have it: The illiberal left is officially a marginal force that's enjoyed an amount of media attention grossly disproportionate to its significance; conservatives are not being oppressed at America's colleges; and beyond \"one campus or two campuses,\" support for Donald Trump among American college students is overwhelming!\n\nNow, America's pundits can finally move on, and turn their attentions to other, more important intra-left disputes.",

                "body": "It's now spring, which means it's nearly the season of cleaning and organization. There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nWith more and more tricked-out robot vacuums coming out every year, it feels like we're entering the golden age of smart cleaners. Outsourcing your cleaning duties to a literal robot might seem like supreme laziness, but when you see one that's equipped with fancy lasers, the ability to map your floors, and even mop them, you might be okay accepting that.\n\nScroll through Amazon robot-vacuum reviews, too, and you'll learn that people are attached to these little guys. So attached, they will give their robots names and speak of them as if they're family members. In preparation for this story, colleagues shared stories of friends being so enamored with their robot buddies that they consider them tiny pets. Because I am now a vacuum aficionado, I had to know more. I talked to vacuum experts on which ones are the best, called in a couple to try, and set out to answer the question, \"Should I buy one?\"\n\nThe Experts Say ...\n\nAs a general FYI on robot vacuums, these are autonomous (so you don't have to drag them over your floors), are bagless, and can be scheduled to clean while you're away. To get a better sense of the robot-vac landscape, I talked to an internet-famous vacuum-repair technician who goes by the name of Touchmyfuckingcoffee on Reddit (he's also the moderator of the vacuums subreddit). Though he doesn't own a robot vac himself, he says they're especially useful for people who are working long hours, or just want the place swept on a daily basis. \"The prices have gotten affordable enough that people with expendable incomes can have the luxury,\" he says, though if you have rugs or carpeting, you'll want a conventional vacuum. \"Robot vacs are only an accessory to have in your floor-cleaning arsenal.\"\n\nHe recommends prioritizing vacuums with a good warranty, and finding something affordable that can both clean and map your apartment. \"The top-three brands, as I see it, are Miele, for its great warranty network; Neato, for its awesome mapping algorithm and price; and then the Roomba, just because they've been at it the longest,\" he says.\n\nAnthony, the editor of vacuum-reviews website Best Vacuum Expert, told me that for a top-down clean, robo vacs are still a bit gimmicky. \"I don't think you get the same suction as a heavy-duty upright vacuum, but for pet hair it's nice, and they work great on tile and hardwood.\" As someone with kids, he also finds that the robot vacuums are ideal for cleaning up messes before they get out of control. He pointed me in the direction of the Shark vacuums, for their design, and the Neato. \"The Neato scans the room for dirt and dust and then goes after it, and has a shape with square corners, so it can get into spots more easily.\"\n\nI Say ...\n\nSince my experts told me that robots are best suited for hardwood floors, I called in a few of their recommendations and let them loose in my spacious living room, which has lots of floor space, furniture traps, and hard-to-reach spaces.\n\niRobot Roomba 690\n\nThe Roomba's as synonymous with robot vacuums as Kleenex is to tissue, so I tried the iRobot Roomba 690 first. This is one of the most popular Roomba models, but as an older prototype, it's definitely lacking some bells and whistles. I'm sad to report that it maneuvered around my living room with the grace of a blind dog (though less endearingly so). It does do a decent job of picking up dust and dirt where it finds it, but has the tendency to whirl around in circles and ram into things over and over again. I was also dismayed by how little run time this Roomba has (40 minutes at best) before its battery gets pooped out. Online reviewers say that it does get better at navigating an area over time, so maybe the key is a little more patience.\n\n$300 at Amazon iRobot Roomba 960\n\nNext was Roomba's top-of-the-line 960. I heard that the Wi-Fi mapping on this guy (which can tell you where the Roomba actually cleaned) was not to be missed, and was generally really impressed with this model. The first thing I noticed was how systematically it cleans, moving back and forth in a grid pattern so that it doesn't miss much, and without bumping into furniture too often. It doesn't dwell on one area too frequently or circle back to the same spots, so it's very good at efficiently using its battery life to clean the room. The Wi-Fi mapping can also help you schedule where you want your Roomba to clean, and this model does a good job of picking up dirt and dust.\n\n$700 at Amazon Neato Botvac D5\n\nI was most curious about the Neato, the D-shaped vacuum that's designed for backing into small spaces and also connects to Wi-Fi. The cool thing about the Neato is, it's equipped with laser sensors to sniff out dirt and dust, it can work in the dark, and has \"spin flow\" power-cleaning capabilities. I like the way it navigates and skirts around objects, but the Wi-Fi connection was very difficult to sync up. And while I was frustrated to see the Neato circle back over the same spots again and again, when I checked the dustbin, it was clear that the Neato picked up the most dust, hair, and dirt -- it seems to be the best at thorough deep-cleaning.\n\n$578 at Amazon The Verdict\n\nWhile I see the appeal of having a little robot to clean up my messes, and recognize that they are hardworking little dudes, they wouldn't be part of my regular cleaning routine. As someone who already outsources my house cleaning and am comfortable around a broom, buying one feels a little excessive. I did feel a certain kinship to the iRobot 960, though, and would definitely recommend it for a busybody who wants something efficient and reliable, and can drop $700 on a tiny vacuum. The Neato is another great option if you want a workhorse that can deep-clean your apartment floors. If you're on a budget, I'd recommend looking into something like the Eufy 11 (peep the rave reviews from verified buyers!) over the iRobot 690. If you like it, you might even make a new friend along the way.\n\nGET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nAmélie has recently come to Netflix, and inspired by a plane viewing of The Shape of Water (really, just a merman Amélie!), I decided to rewatch the older film for the first time in years. With the first lilting note of the accordion, it all came rushing back: how I did up my college bedroom in a palette of reds and greens and thought Mathieu Kassovitz was the most attractive actor in the world, and even wondered if I could pull off a pointelle sweater. Some things change, of course, but there's one legacy of that bit of post-9/11 escapism that has stayed with me into adulthood.\n\nDo you remember when, early in the film, Amélie's mother is shown polishing her apartment's parquet with a pair of slippers? (It's listed as one of the things Amandine Poulain likes, along with reorganizing her purse.) Well, a few years ago, I ran across a pair of these polishing slippers, and I must tell you that -- unlike spying on shut-in neighbors, stalking strangers in photo booths, and playing mind games with co-workers like you have some kind of manic-pixie god complex -- whimsical polishing slippers age just fine.\n\nThe pair of polishing slippers I have is microfiber, so basically it's like wearing a couple of dust-attracting Swiffers on your feet (you could even stick them on your Swiffer broom, as shown above). They're too thin to wear outdoors. And you wouldn't want to, you know, mop up a bunch of mud in them, but it's very satisfying to slide around your apartment and pick up hairs and dust and particles that you know won't strike your line of vision the next time the light hits the floor. Best of all is the sense of multitasking; just by wearing slippers, and going between the bathroom and the sofa and the kitchen, you're cleaning.\n\nThey're good for polishing, too. I don't wax my floor often -- too much work -- but once every six months or so, I'll do a little patch. When you're using the old-fashioned oil wax -- the stuff that makes the floor really shine -- you have to let it dry, wipe it up, and then buff it to a high sheen. Tedious, right? Not when you're wearing your polishing slippers. I alternate between dancing around and switching the chair I'm working in, so those little patches get extra shined while I sit and type. Yann Tiersen soundtrack optional.\n\nKamlif Washable Dust Mop Slippers, 3 Pairs $12 at Amazon More Strat-endorsed cleaning things Better Life What-Ever All-Purpose Cleaner in Clary Sage & Citrus\n\nNatural cleaning products aren't that hard to come by, but which ones are actually effective? Ecoexpert Danny Seo recommended the Better Life All-Purpose cleaner as a plant-based cleaner that works just as well as the chemical-filled ones.\n\n$5 at Bed Bath & Beyond Bona Multi-Surface Floor Care Kit\n\nIf you're looking for an actual mop, writer Ashlea Halpern suggests the one used at Nike headquarters: \"I can't believe I'm typing this, but the Bona made mopping kinda fun. The flat-head mop is wider than a Swiffer, covering more ground faster while still swiveling under furniture and into hard-to-reach corners. The microfiber pad gripped the mop firmly and didn't get filthy as fast as the Swiffer pads do: I mopped both the living and dining rooms before stopping to clean the pad and reattach it. That action alone addressed my biggest beef with the Swiffer.\"\n\n$30 at Amazon Evercare Mega Cleaning Roller With 3-Foot Extendable Handle\n\nWanna get rid of hair or dust on upholstery? Writer Hilary Reid discovered a \"broom\" that's essentially a giant sticky roller: \"The jumbo lint roller on a long stick quickly became the essential cleaning tool I never knew I needed. Here's how it works: Extend the handle to a comfortable length, and then roll the sticky adhesive part across the rug, so that it picks up hair, dirt, and whatever else is lurking within. Once the adhesive sheet is covered, tear it off and begin again. Roll and repeat, until you've finished its surface area.\"\n\n$18 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "Everything I Bought at the New Upper East Side Ulta Store",
                "body": "I am psychotically obsessed with Ulta, the beauty chain megastore that carries skin care, cosmetics, fragrances, and hair products. Don't get me wrong, I love Sephora (the Soho staff know my name and are familiar with my passion for Tatcha and Giorgio Armani foundation), but there's something about the high-low nature of the Ulta experience -- the ability to buy both NARS and Revlon, Bumble and Dove, all in the same place -- that really gets me going. Generally, when I walk in, I black out from overstimulation and only come to on my way home. The downside of having such a massive selection (I swear, I'm not sponsored by Ulta -- not that I'd say no if they asked), is that it can be tough to sort through what's worth purchasing. But the Ulta beauty empire is home to some of the best products available -- some of which are exclusives, like my beloved Tarte Shape Tape and It Cosmetic brushes.\n\nAs a rule, I tend to reserve my visits to Ulta for when I am reaching the last drop of all the products in my cabinet and am in dire need of a big, dupe-and-splurge beauty haul. When I go in, I like to swatch new foundations, concealers, and shadows, and ask the Ulta salespeople every annoying question I might have. Since I've been doing this for, well, years, I consider myself a seasoned expert at navigating the Ulta world in person and online.\n\nFor years, my Ulta obsession forced me to trek from the city out to Marine Park -- i.e., very deep into Brooklyn -- if I wanted my fix. So you can imagine how ecstatic I was when they opened their first Manhattan location in November on the Upper East Side. But, because I have Ulta rules I'm intent on keeping, I wouldn't let myself visit until I was nearly out of products. Which finally happened last week. The new location is, as expected, vast and overwhelming -- but seeing as I walked through every aisle at least seven times and pestered every sales clerk for information, also at least seven times, I'm fairly confident that I didn't miss anything. Below, everything I purchased during my first visit to the instantly iconic NYC Ulta.\n\nEstée Lauder Pure Color Envy Sculpting Blush in Sensuous Rose\n\nI have dry skin, so I've always gravitated toward cream blushes and bronzers. I had long been convinced that powders would make my skin look weird, dry, and cakey. However, this trip I asked an Ulta employee if she could recommend a cream blush, and she essentially told me to cancel everything I previously thought about powder blushes and give this a go. I was hesitant enough that I considered taking it out of my shopping bag several times, but ultimately decided to keep it. And now I am so, so obsessed with this blush that I actually find myself angry at the thought of being without it. The Sensuous Rose color is this beautiful browny-pink, the perfect in between blush and bronzer color. And it literally melts into my skin, giving no powdery or dry effect whatsoever. Since purchasing this, I have worn it every single day, morning and evening, on my cheeks and on my eyelids. It's the perfect product for a pretty, natural, cohesive look. I'm obsessed.\n\n$34 at Ulta Love Beauty Fully Flawless Blush Brush #227\n\nBefore this Ulta trip, I'm ashamed (yes, ashamed!) to admit that I had literally no idea It Cosmetics made brushes. I was in the market for a blush and bronzer brush, and this one is so good. It picks up pigment really easily, and does the best job of distributing powder evenly but subtly across your skin. This paired with the Estée Lauder blush is to die for.\n\n$28 at Ulta Cover FX Correct Click in Peach\n\nThe other day, my YSL Touche Eclat fell into my toilet and I mourned for days. So during this Ulta trip, I decided to try out this cute, teeny-tiny peach stick from Cover FX and have been pretty smitten with it. I don't apply it directly onto my skin; I instead warm it up on my fingertips, and then go in on my under-eyes. It's a little thicker than the Touche Eclat, but does just as good of a job at canceling out my serious dark circles. I also love that it's so small that I can take it pretty much anywhere.\n\n$18 at Ulta Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser\n\nMy go-to when my very pricey Biologique Recherche Lait U cleanser runs out. I've been using this cleanser for years, as I truly believe it's one of the best affordable cleansers for those with dry, acne-prone, and sensitive skin. A bathroom staple of mine!\n\n$14 at Ulta Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge\n\nThis is a serious case of \"YouTube Made Me Buy It.\" I had heard endless YouTubers rave about how this sponge was so incredible and so much better than the original beauty blender that when I saw it, I absolutely had to get it. Guys, I think they're right. The Real Techniques brush has both a flat edge for really getting up in your under-eyes and the original pointed tip for concealing any imperfections. I dampened this with water and applied my NARS foundation with it, and I was beyond impressed with how evenly and smoothly it distributed my makeup, and also how well it covered areas I didn't even know I was missing out on before. If you're a beauty-blender person, definitely try this out.\n\n$6 at Ulta Nivea Essentially Enriched Body Lotion\n\nAs spring approaches, I try to wean off of the steroid I'm prescribed for my eczema and start incorporating regular lotions more frequently into my routine. This lotion from Nivea is so nice, thick, and great for soothing. But it also adds a really natural, non-glitter shimmer to the body that makes it the perfect lotion to apply both before bed and before a night out.\n\n$7 at Ulta Tarte Double Duty Beauty Shape Tape Contour Concealer\n\nA really special concealer to me that is sold only at Ulta. I had originally purchased this concealer in the summer, and the shade was too dark for my pasty winter skin, so I decided this was the perfect opportunity to buy a new one. I know I've mentioned her a few times, but this concealer is the most incredible dewy yet full coverage look. I'm fair neutral in the winter, and neutral sand in warmer months. There's a reason why everyone is so obsessed with this concealer -- it's a must-have.\n\n$27 at Ulta M.A.C Prep + Prime Fix+ Little M.A.C\n\nGood old M.A.C Fix+. I really love a face spray for giving me a nice pick-me-up throughout the day, but I find that a lot of them actually don't do that great of a job at setting my makeup, especially at night when I'm applying a little more than usual. This cult-favorite setting spray from M.A.C makes sure everything is locked the hell in, and when you're using any kind of powder (like the blush I mentioned above), it's also great for that extra boost of hydration to make sure it melts seamlessly into your skin so that it doesn't look powdery or dry at all. Also, for those who are acne-sensitive, this has never broken me out.\n\n$12 at Ulta Bumble and Bumble Travel Size Bb. Thickening Spray\n\nI've had short hair for a while, but I took it to another level a few days ago by cutting right above my jawline. I'm obsessed, but it's also been a task to ensure my very short bob looks as full and voluptuous as possible. My hairdresser, Mio, recommended getting a thickening spray, which she explained is very different from the sea-salt, crunchy, messy, beachy spray I had been previously using. This is so good; it gives your hair volume without too much texture, so you can still have a sleek, flat bob while also getting some lift.\n\n$11 at Ulta Anastasia Beverly Hills Eyeshadow Single\n\nI lost my last Brick and I was so, so happy to get another one. This is a going-out staple of mine. This shadow provides your lids with some subtle, chic warmth while also looking sexy and flirty. This is the kind of product where, when you see it on someone, you're like, Wow they look great, and can't figure out why. If you're into browny tones, fun but subtle eye shadows, or bronzy looks, definitely give this a go.\n\n$12 at Ulta Tweezerman Slant Tweezer\n\nI'm obsessed with losing my tweezers, and I don't know why. These Tweezerman tweezers are my everything when it comes to getting out those tiny, irritating eyebrow hairs that just don't want to leave. I bought two during this Ulta trip.\n\n$23 at Ulta Klorane Dry Shampoo With Oat Milk for Brown to Dark Hair\n\nThis dry shampoo from Klorane is everything. It somehow managed to get rid of my oiliness quickly and with little product wasted. Not to mention, this was one of the top-listed dry shampoos when I crowdsourced hair-care products a few weeks ago. The scent is clean and subtle, and it will really give your hair some lift. If you haven't tried her yet, you really should.\n\n$20 at Ulta Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz Pencil\n\nEven though my brows are pretty dark on their own, this brow pencil is the best of the best for shaping and filling in any little patchy bits while making sure they remain natural-looking. The pencil is super thin, allowing you to easily draw on tiny little hairs for maximum effect.\n\n$21 at Ulta GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "Police in Sacramento shot and killed a 22-year-old black man Sunday night after mistaking an iPhone he was holding for a gun. Body-camera footage of the shooting, which is sparking protests in the California capital, was released Wednesday and it shows that mere seconds passed between police encountering Stephon Clark and shooting him dead.\n\n\"Hey, show me your hands. Stop. Stop,\" one of the officers is heard yelling on the video seconds after spotting Clark in a driveway. Two officers then chase him into a yard where one can heard saying, \"Gun. Gun. Gun.\"\n\nThen both officers opened fire.\n\nIn a statement, Sacramento police say Clark \"advanced towards the officers while holding an object which was extended in front of him.\" The officers believed this to be a gun and \"fearing for their safety,\" fired on him. What the SPD statement does not say is that Clark was not holding a gun. He was holding a white iPhone.\n\nThe incident began just after 9 p.m. Sunday when police received a report of a man breaking car windows. A police helicopter spotted Clark and followed him as officers on the ground tried to locate him. They found him in the driveway of his grandmother's house and he was soon dead.\n\nThe SPD has said that Clark is the same man who was reported breaking car windows but his grandmother told the Sacramento Bee that they are mistaken. \"You guys are murderers, murderers, murderers,\" Sequita Thompson recalls telling the officers. \"You guys killed that baby for nothing. You took him away from his kids, for nothing.\"\n\nActivists in Sacramento and beyond have questioned the police's actions. \"We need answers. The family needs answers,\" Black Lives Sacramento organizer Tanya Faison said at a City Council meeting Tuesday night. \"We need those officers to be fired because this was obviously a very huge injustice.\"\n\nReverend Al Sharpton said he's traveling to the city, and the local NAACP condemned the killing in a statement:\n\n\"While we respect the role of (SPD) in our community ... these shooting(s) have angered, frustrated and frighten(ed) people in our community,\" the statement said. \"We are also frustrated with the justice system which fails to indict such killings. We are a community experiencing post-traumatic stress and as such the community and police relations(hip) remains one of mistrust.\"\n\nSacramento's Democratic mayor was not so quick to criticize though. \"Based on the videos alone, I cannot second guess the split-second decisions of our officers, and I'm not going to do that,\" Mayor Darrell Steinberg said in a statement.",

                "title": "Trump Hits China With $50 Billion in Tariffs",
                "body": "Last week, Donald Trump's top trade adviser presented him with a plan to make Beijing rue the day that it had decided to steal American intellectual property. The staunchly protectionist U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer advised the president to impose tariffs on $30 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\nSuch an aggressive move was bound to provoke retaliation, if not full-blown trade war -- as many congressional Republicans were eager to remind the White House. And so, after carefully weighing the pros and cons of the measure, the president told Lighthizer to toss his proposal -- and come back with tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, instead.\n\n\"This has been long in the making,\" Trump said Thursday, at a news conference formally announcing the levies. \"We've lost, over a fairly short period of time, 60,000 factories.\"\n\nThe president went on to lament the death of American manufacturing; condemn the anti-U.S. trade system propped up by the WTO and NAFTA; and inform the public that the leaders of Japan and the European Union smile sheepishly when he brings up their unfair trade practices, while (presumably) thinking to themselves, \"I can't believe we've been able to take advantage of the United States for so long.\"\n\nNone of this had anything whatsoever to do with the policy the president was there to announce.\n\nThe official purpose of the tariffs that Trump unveiled Thursday is not to protect American manufacturing against unfair Chinese competition -- but rather, to protect the intellectual property of major U.S. businesses.\n\nFor the past seven months, Lighthizer's office had been investigating allegations that the Chinese government violates American firms' patent and copyright protections. That probe uncovered evidence that Beijing uses restrictions on foreign ownership of companies within China to coerce American corporations into transferring their technology to its own domestic enterprises. Lighthizer's report also alleges that China steals trade secrets through cyberattacks, and directs its firms to invest in U.S. companies, so as to gain access to information about strategic technologies and then transfer it to the Chinese government.\n\nThe basic charge here -- that the Chinese government does not respect other nations' intellectual property laws -- is not terribly controversial. A U.S. International Trade Commission investigation conducted during the Obama years found that IP theft cost American firms nearly $26 billion in 2009, while a study from the U.S. software industry put that figure as high as $60 billion in 2011.\n\nBut whether ordinary Americans actually have an interest in policing such theft is less clear. When China violates an American drug company's software patents, said company's profit margins (and thus, shareholders') may take a hit -- but American consumers likely benefit from the lower prices on software. And the same holds for other patent-protected products like pharmaceuticals (which Trump has repeatedly argued are far too expensive in the United States).\n\nIt makes sense then, that Trump took pains to frame the move as one piece of a broader, protectionist agenda -- and made no effort whatsoever to convey the substance of the former.\n\n\"This is the first of many,\" Trump said as he signed the order. \"This is number one -- but this is the first of many.\"\n\nSpecifically, the president promised to establish a \"reciprocal\" tariff policy -- putting an equal and opposite levy on any country that imposes duties on American goods. \"We want reciprocal -- mirror -- some people call it a mirror tariff or a mirror tax,\" Trump explained. \"If they charge us, we charge them the same thing.\"\n\nIf we take the president at his word, then this statement augurs a radical transformation of American trade policy -- and the beginning of massive, global trade war.\n\nFortunately, no one takes Trump at his word, least of all on this particular subject. Thus, rather than tanking global markets, Trump's remarks actually soothed them -- apparently many traders had misinterpreted early reports about the tariffs, and thought that the president was proposing a somewhat more robust package than he actually did.\n\nNonetheless, the move comes with significant downside risks. On Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce warned that it is \"firmly opposed to the U.S. side's unilateralism and trade protectionism,\" and \"will certainly take all necessary measures to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests.\"\n\nThose measures will include retaliatory tariffs targeting industries in pro-Trump regions of the country, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf China's response is exactly proportionate -- inflicting $50 billion of tariffs on U.S. goods -- the macroeconomic impact would be significant but not massive. But matters would become more grave if the trade war escalated from there, as Bloomberg explains:\n\nA simulation by Oxford Economics suggests a 25 percent U.S. tariff on $60 billion worth of Chinese exports, with comparable retaliation, would reduce China's growth by about 0.1 percentage point this year and a little less next year, chief Asia economist Louis Kuijs in Hong Kong said in a recent note. There would be a slightly smaller impact on the U.S. economy, he said.\n\n\"The key risk is that it does not end with this modest baseline scenario,\" said Kuijs, who formerly worked for the World Bank in Beijing. \"More measures may follow, and tit-for-tat responses could lead to escalation. Collateral damage in other economies will be significant and could further complicate the trade friction.\"\n\nThere will now be a 30-day comment period before the tariffs take effect. That coming debate is likely to scramble partisan allegiances, as the Chamber of Commerce works to water down the tariffs, and Democrats exploit an opportunity to let their vulnerable incumbents align themselves with Trump - and against the Republican Party: On Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said of Trump, \"I want to give him a big pat on the back ... I'm very pleased that this administration is taking strong action to get a better deal on China.\"",

                "body": "In the end, Paul Ryan just didn't worry about appearances. He invited mockery by rushing the 2,232-page Omnibus Appropriations Bill -- first unveiled last night -- through the House today. Now the Senate will have the luxury of dealing with the bill about 30 hours before appropriations run out and the government shuts down -- if, of course, Rand Paul doesn't decide to filibuster it like he did a previous stopgap measure in February.\n\nRyan's task was complicated by Nancy Pelosi's decision to ask her caucus to oppose the rule for consideration of the omnibus (which she fully intended to support once it did get to the floor) to protest the continued inability or refusal of Congress or the White House to offer protections to Dreamers. All but one Democrat complied, which meant that the Speaker had to lean on Republicans to supply the critical margin (the rule was adopted by a spare 211-207 vote). Even then, corners were cut, according to Politico: \"Some members complained they were still waiting to vote when the gavel came down.\"\n\nThat hurdle out of the way, the omnibus itself passed by a much more comfortable 256-167 margin.\n\nThe Senate could move on the bill right away, but the senior senator from Kentucky is waiting on word from the junior senator from Kentucky about his intentions:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Senate Appropriations ranking member Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont outside his office that the Senate will vote on omnibus \"whenever Sen. Paul decides we can,\" a nod to Kentucky Republican Rand Paul's possible objection to moving to the bill.\n\nPaul said he is \"on page 56 right now and so I've got a few more pages to read\" of the omnibus but did not reveal whether he will delay a vote.\n\nAt least somebody's reading it. But it's probably fortunate for the prospects for final enactment of this vast bill that the president doesn't much like to read.",

                "body": "\"I'll be back,\" Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator character famously said, again and again. And the former California governor was back this week at the debut of an organization calling itself New Way California that's aimed at pushing the Republican Party away from Trumpism and toward the political center. Headed up by Chad Mayes, a former GOP leader in the California Assembly who was purged for working with Democrats on a climate-change initiative, the group is fighting the prevailing winds in both the state and national parties.\n\nAs the New York Times reports, Schwarzenegger made it pretty plain where he laid the blame for the GOP's bad immediate prospects:\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger said the Republican Party had to be \"environmentally progressive, socially liberal and fiscally conservative\" in order to be competitive.\n\n\"Our party is giving them Twitter fights instead of answers,\" Mr. Schwarzenegger said. \"And it is sinking us. It is time to return to the issues.\"\n\n\"The politics of division and anger and resentment can drive a strong base to the polls, yes,\" he said. \"But it is tearing our country apart at the seams. And nothing is getting done.\"\n\nSince the GOP is current environmentally reactionary, socially conservative, and fiscally profligate, that's quite the 180-degree turn Schwarzenegger is demanding. And his concerns aren't exactly resonating even in California, where despite the party's parlous state (it could have a catastrophic midterm election this year, losing a number of congressional seats and not even looking competitive in most statewide races) the most notable leaders keep tacking to the right. The two Republican gubernatorial candidates, for example, are competing to see who can most slavishly pledge support for Trump.\n\nBut Schwarzenegger and Mayes had at least some star-power support for their protest about the future of the GOP: They were joined by none other than Ohio governor John Kasich, who offered some vague words of encouragement:\n\n\"Look, we want this party to survive, but we've got to stop playing ideological games, and start thinking about the customers,\" Kasich said, referring to voters. \"And, help these folks. Help Chad. It's going to be lonely for a while.\"\n\nThat's for sure. If Schwarzenegger and Mayes are naïve for thinking the California GOP is going to spurn hard-core conservatism and the 45th president, Kasich is really dreaming if he thinks the national party is doing anything other than embracing Trump.\n\nThe self-congratulatory big-tent atmosphere of the New Way California event was brought back to reality by a remark from one attendee, as reported by Sacramento's Capital Public Radio:\n\nPolitical consultant Cassandra Pye suggested organizers could still broaden their appeal.\n\n\"We've got to have more women in the room next time,\" Pye said.\n\nThat could be said of the entire GOP, regardless of faction.",

Folks, this is not happening. In case that rumor earlier this month got your hopes up, let me say it again: Instagram is sticking with its algorithm; you are not getting a feed sorted by the order photos were posted. As something of a consolation prize, Instagram announced that it is testing a new feed-related feature on Thursday that will let users manually choose when their feeds update. The company also said that it is \"making changes to ensure that newer posts are more likely to appear first in feed.\" Kind of like, well, a chronological feed.\n\nFrom Instagram:\n\nWe've heard it can feel unexpected when your feed refreshes and automatically bumps you to the top. So today we're testing a \"New Posts\" button that lets you choose when you want to refresh, rather than it happening automatically. Tap the button and you'll be taken to new posts at the top of feed -- don't tap, and you'll stay where you are. We hope this makes browsing Instagram much more enjoyable.\n\nWhich, sure, thank you, Instagram. It is annoying when my feed jumps while I'm in the middle of reading a caption, and then can't for the life of me and all the scrolling in the world seem to find that photo again. But, also, you know was else is annoying? The algorithmic feed. Reverting to the chronological feed would also \"ensure newer posts are more likely to appear first in feed.\" Just a thought.",

There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nIf you've ever felt overwhelmed by the sight of your desk, it's probably time to do a round of office organization. But before you invest in a brand-new paper organizer for your desk or a whole new desk organization set, take a second to think about what you actually need to do your job. \"It's two things: What do you do within any given week or two, and what do I need to support my life?\" says Ann Lightfoot, co-founder of the professional organizing company Done & Done Home. She adds, \"Very little should be in your desk that you're not using within two weeks.\"\n\nOnce you've cleared out the junk, the next step is to maintain the order. And to help you figure out the best way to clean out your desk drawers and keep your work space clear of miscellaneous papers, once and for all, I talked with two professional organizers about their favorite desk- and paper-organizing strategies and asked them to share some of the organizers they use to keep their own offices in good, working order.\n\nBest Paper Organizers U Brands Mesh Steel Desktop Hanging File Holder, Letter Size $12 at Amazon $12 at Amazon AmazonBasics Hanging File Folders - Letter Size, 25-Pack $9 at Amazon $9 at Amazon\n\n\"What I would do is gather all the paperwork and put it in a pile to sort through. Because if everything's spread out, your mind is going to be overwhelmed, and the more streamlined you can make it, the better. I get a file box and put hanging files in it, just to act as a sorting tool. So instead of creating more piles, I just put the papers in the stand-up file and create temporary files. Once you're done going through everything, you can see, within a very small amount of space, everything that you've got, and then you can make some better decisions about what to do with it and how you're going to create your system. I like more of a paperless office, so I don't really care what the hanging file is.

I always work in the kitchen; my home office is the kitchen, so I just have two little magazine files that live in my kitchen cabinet, and that's where the paperwork goes, so it's not out and annoying to everybody else that lives there. Especially if you don't have a dedicated office space, I find it's really important to be able to put stuff somewhere and have a home for that.\" -- Penn\n\nPendaflex 22100 Reinforced Top Tab File Jacket, 1 Inch Expansion (Box of 50)\n\n\"I recommend a very simple filing system because I find that the more complicated it is, the less likely you are to file, and the more homes you create for things to live, the more things tend to get lost. So utilize things like straight-line files, which means all the tabs are in the same place -- you're not doing zigzag placements of your file tabs. You're coming up with very broad categories, so instead of a name for each credit card, it just says, 'Credit Cards.' You want to create less work on the front end and more work on the back end. The likelihood of you having to go in there and search for anything is unlikely. So what you want to do is create an easy spot to drop stuff. Yes, I'm creating more work on the back end, maybe I have to flip through some stuff, but the chances of me actually having to do that is unlikely.\" -- Penn\n\n$23 at Amazon $23 at Amazon Pendaflex January-December Vertical Expanding File\n\n\"If you're running your own business from home, and you have your tax files: I use an expandable monthly file. We throw all our receipts in each month, but by the time the taxes are done, we put the year, and it goes out into storage. We get it out of there. When Kate and I started out, we had envelopes -- it just took too much time. Having the 12-month expandable, we wrap the band around it [at the end of the year], and then we're done.\" -- Ann Lightfoot, Done & Done Home\n\n$26 at Amazon $26 at Amazon DII Collapsible Burlap Storage Basket (Brown Ikat, Small)\n\n\"Anyone who has even the slightest fear of identity theft, they hang on to everything. So if that's the fear, have a box or a bag in or near where you work for shredding, and drop [those papers] off at Staples, where shredding is a dollar a pound, or something. But sitting there, feeding those home shredders one page at a time is a total waste of time. Have a bag, like a tote tag or the shopping bag you'd take to the grocery store. If it's a box, it just gets too heavy for most people to carry. Once a month, walk it over to Staples, have it shredded and handled, so you're not having that problem. And when it has a place to go, it doesn't gather up in your working files.\" -- Lightfoot\n\n$7 at Amazon $7 at Amazon Best Desk-Drawer Organizers Our Sweater Box\n\n\"We take everything out of the place where it 'lives.' When you take everything out, you have to touch it all, and move it all out. Really take a good, hard look at that junk drawer: the extra cord, the clips, the stamps, whatever you might be using. Keep the things in there that you use on a weekly basis. And [put] a bin with a lid in the closet in your office for the three-hole punch -- the stuff you occasionally use but if you didn't have it, you'd be screwed. Look at your junk drawer as a support drawer for what you're trying to accomplish in any given week, and that's what should be in there.\" -- Lightfoot\n\n$6 at The Container Store JAM Paper Office & Desk Sets, White\n\n\"I try to file [office supplies] away, as much as possible, in a desk drawer. What I typically have done with clients is to take everything off the desk. Have nothing on it, and as you use it, pull it out. You might be surprised at how rarely you use a lot of that stuff. Keeping it one color scheme and limiting the amount of things keeps it from being a distraction.\" -- Penn\n\n$23 at Amazon $23 at Amazon Best Organizers for Going Paperless LastPass\n\n\"I typically mirror what is paper in the digital space. So let's say we've got bills to pay. I would take that and go, 'Okay, so what of these bills can I get paperless, and can I go ahead and set them up through my banking system?' I recommend for people to get a password app because once you start living more of your financial and paperwork life online, you really do need good passwords for everything, and the only way to do that is by using a password app, and that alone is a process. All of this stuff takes time, so I think people need to get in the mind-set that it's not going to happen overnight, but it's going to save you a lot of time in the long run, so it's okay.\" -- Penn\n\nFrom $0 at LastPass Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 Color Duplex Desk Scanner $420 at Amazon $420 at Amazon Scannable From $0 at Evernote\n\n\"Instead of paperwork going into my filing cabinet, it goes in my digital filing cabinet, which is Google Drive. Then the same files that I would've had paper, they exist in the digital works. So I find once you get the backlog scanned in with something heavy-duty, like a Fujitsu ScanSnap, that's a paper-fed scanner that can take many pages at a time, anybody can get by, for the most part, with an app [on their phone]. I love Scannable. It's a really good one, very easy to use, and I find it creates really high-quality PDFs.\" -- Penn\n\nGET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "John Dowd, the lead lawyer on President Trump's legal team for the Russia investigation, resigned Thursday, just 11 days after Trump tweeted that Dowd is doing a \"great job\" and he's \"VERY happy\" with him.\n\n\"I love the president and wish him well,\" Dowd told CNN in a statement.\n\nHe's also incredibly frustrated with Trump. Dowd, who has reportedly considered quitting in the past, finally made the decision to leave Trump's side because the president is \"increasingly ignoring his advice,\" the Times reports. The paper adds that the feeling is mutual. Trump was reportedly frustrated by Dowd over the weekend after the lawyer told the Daily Beast that Special Counsel Robert Mueller should be fired. After initially claiming to speak for Trump, Dowd walked back that claim.\n\nJay Sekulow, another of Trump's lawyers, praised Dowd in a statement: \"John Dowd is a friend and has been a valuable member of our legal team. We will continue our ongoing representation of the President and our cooperation with the Office of Special Counsel.\"\n\nThe Washington Post says Dowd's resignation marks a \"shake-up\" for Trump's legal team as he edges ever closer to agreeing to an interview with Mueller. The president recently hired former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova and has reportedly reached out to former solicitor general Theodore B. Olson and Emmet Flood, the lawyer who advised President Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.",

                "body": "Gillian Jacobs plays Mickey on the Netflix series Love, on which she's become a bit of an unlikely fashion icon for her Carhartt overalls. Here, as the show's third (and final) season premieres, we asked Jacobs to tell us the story behind her beloved 'hartts.\n\nI fell in love with overalls in junior high. They were roomy, had a lot of pockets, and in my mind, were very cute. I liked them so much, I owned a dozen pairs. Plaid, pastel, denim -- it didn't matter. If Gap made them, I bought them. Over time, I stopped wearing them because I'd decided that they were for little kids, and I wanted to be a grown-up.\n\nBut by the time I wandered through the kids' section of a Fred Meyer in Oregon, where I had been shooting a movie, my resistance had worn down. I picked up a pair of Carhartts and thought, These are cute! I loved the reinforced knees, the big pocket on the bib, and the nostalgic warmth I felt wearing them.\n\nHere's the thing: I didn't actually buy them that day, but I must have talked about them enough that Alison Carlos from the wardrobe department gifted them to me at the end of the film. When I brought them back to L.A. and asked my stylist Caley Rinker to have them tailored, she thought I had to be kidding. But little me said they were cute -- and I also liked the idea that I'd likely be the only one rocking a pair in Los Feliz or Silver Lake. My gut told me these were a special pair of overalls.\n\nWhen I wore them to rehearsal for Love, Lesley Arfin and Paul Rust recognized their potential, too, and asked that I wear them on the show. Our costume designer, Jennifer Eve, made them far cooler than I'd ever managed. She found the perfect T-shirt and gave Mickey the greatest rings and accessories.\n\nI looked in the mirror and saw that my vision was finally realized. These Carhartts weren't just cute -- they were cool. When the show was released on Netflix, I got messages from people wanting a pair and was tagged in Instagram posts of people rocking their overalls. I felt vindicated -- but now when I wear my Carhartts, people think I'm wearing Mickey's clothes and not the reverse.\n\nNow that the third and final season of Love is out, it may be time to say good-bye to my beloved Carhartts. I've been really into Dansko clogs lately. Some people think they're ridiculous, but I think I might be onto something.\n\nCarhartt Women's Sandstone Unlined Bib Overalls From $58 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "It's now spring, which means it's nearly the season of cleaning and organization. There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nHere at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we'd like to, we can't try everything. Which is why we have People's Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that's four-to-five-star reviews and lots of 'em) products and single out the most convincing. While we've written before about a certain age-defying German vacuum, the best vacuums on Amazon, the best handheld vacuums, and even reviewed the new Dyson, here we're breaking down the best robot vacuums on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nThe Best Robot Vacuum for Thick Carpets Eufy RoboVac 11+ (2nd Gen: Upgraded Bumper and Suction Inlet) 4.3 stars, 2,776 reviews\n\n\"I work in industrial robotics and motion control, so I might have different expectations for gadgets, but I've owned three of the better-known robot vacs and I always felt like none were really engineered to work in a real family environment (area rugs, pets,kids, etc. ...). They've always been noisy and not overly effective. I've run this one every day since I got it. It's quiet, and the amount of dirt, hair, etc. it picks up freaks me out a little. It easily navigates over the area rugs with ease. I'm pretty sure the algorithm for moving around objects in the other robot vacs was better, but that doesn't mean much when the gadget can't effectively do its main purpose. Thank you, Eufy, for showing me how a robot vac is supposed to work.\"\n\n$180 at Amazon $180 at Amazon The Best Budget Robot Vacuum Housmile Robotic Vacuum Cleaner 4.4 stars, 789 reviews\n\n\"If you are looking for a robot that heat-seeks dirt with laser beams, this is not your bot vac. It's not fancy, but it gets the job done. I have run this vacuum nonstop for three days. I charge it overnight or once I get home, and then set it off. I send it on its way when I go to bed, and my husband charges it when he gets home. This does not have a base to report back to. It will die in random places if you leave it to run until the battery dies. It runs 60 to 90 minutes per charge. It's no louder than a regular vacuum. It doesn't get everything, but it takes a huge stress off my shoulders because I run it when I leave the house, when we are in bed, or whenever it's charged. I'll be buying at least one more for my upstairs.\"\n\n$100 at Amazon $100 at Amazon The Best Roomba Robot Vacuum Cleaner iRobot Roomba 960 Robot Vacuum 4.3 stars, 832 reviews\n\n\"I find myself more impressed with Roomba the more I watch it navigate. I'm still not impressed with the path-planning algorithm, and I stand by my original statements, but after figuring out how the algorithm works for the most part, its simplicity is rather elegant. I only use it on hard surface floors, so I don't know about carpet, but it works incredibly well for the hard surfaces. I am shocked by how much it finds every day, with three cats and two kids, there are always messes, but this thing can keep up with it and more. Where I'm extremely impressed, given I've designed a control system for a four-wheel, independently actuated, autonomous rover, is the navigation system they designed. The mobility of this little rob is incredible, working its way around obstacles (furniture, shoes, random objects). It can get into tiny areas where it barely fits, then it can find its way out, which is not an easy feat.\"\n\n$699 at Amazon $699 at Amazon The Best Robot Vacuum for Cleaning Up Pet Hair Shark Ion Robot 750 Vacuum With Wi-Fi Connectivity + Voice Control 4.1 stars, 549 reviews\n\n\"I have an Australian shepherd who blows his coat twice a year (a.k.a. sheds all day, every day). If you don't keep up with the hair ... it's like the Wild Wild West. I came across this Shark Ion robot vacuum by chance. It has been well worth the $350 I paid. It does a wonderful job of picking up the dog hair; I was actually surprised of how much it actually picks up. It also does a really good job of picking up the fine debris such as dust, dirt, and sand. Also on larger debris such as dog food, leaves, grass, bark, and other things that get tracked in from the bottom of shoes. I have used my upright directly after a robot cleaning just to see how much more I would get up, and honestly, I was surprised that it was minimal hair and debris.\"\n\n$325 at Amazon $325 at Amazon The Best Mopping Robot Vacuum Cleaner iLife V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner With Water Tank 4 stars, 1,353 reviews\n\n\"I waited 'til I'd used this robot for a few weeks before reviewing it, thinking it might crap out on me somehow. After running it at least a dozen times, and also trying out the mop functionality, I gotta say this is the best robot slave I've ever used. Kicks the crap out of our old Roomba and costs half as much. This sucker comes with a separate water tank (which I absolutely loaded with Orange Glo hardwood-floor cleaner) and automatically goes in a slower, steadier pattern when mopping. It very slowly drips out the solution to be absorbed and mopped around by the microfiber cloth attachment covering the rear underside of the robot. Works really great.\"\n\n$200 at Amazon $200 at Amazon The Best Robot Vacuum With an Air Filter EcoVacs Deebot N79 Robotic Vacuum Cleaner 4.2 stars, 4,226 reviews\n\n\"This little bot is amazing. The first night I let him loose, I had to empty him six times. He pulled up dog hair from hell. I was in disbelief that my upright vacuum left my carpets so filthy. I was embarrassed. I have a huge downstairs that consists of hardwood, tile, regular pile carpet, rugs, and many, many obstacles. It transitions from all floors wonderfully. Out of four nights, it's gotten stuck two times. This thing is surprisingly quiet, especially for the suction power. It's super simple to set up, clean, empty bin, and program. It doesn't knock hard into my furniture, if it even touches it at all because of the amazing sensors. I'm not sure why I waited so long to own one of these amazing bots.\"\n\n$230 at Amazon $230 at Amazon The Best Laser-Sensing Robot Vacuum Neato Botvac D5 Connected Navigating Robot Vacuum 4 stars, 741 reviews\n\n\"This vacuum does it all! Our first floor is quite large, so more than one run was necessary. But she goes right back to where she left off when the battery is charged up. We love the way she glides over the carpets in a methodical way (unlike the Roomba) and gets up everything off the floor. We have three Great Danes, and there is no trace of them in the house when my Neato Botvac is finished! She runs in the dark with no problem at all! It's also quite amazing for it to know how to lower herself to go under my sofas! She shrinks down if she is too tall! We have a large, round table with six chairs. How she managed to maneuver around the pedestal and chairs amazed us! She can even lift herself to get out of a jamb!\"\n\n$548 at Amazon $548 at Amazon The Best Robot Vacuum With a Long Battery Life iLife A4s Robot Vacuum Cleaner 4.3 stars, 2,010 reviews\n\n\"My first robot vacuum ... WOW! I vacuumed last night, however, the A4S ran for more than two hours and 15 minutes; I emptied it three times. It picked up dirt, dog hair, small twigs, tree bark, and grass all tracked in by kids, dogs, or me. It's fascinating to watch it work. I'm wonder struck. I have all wood or tile floors with transition pieces, with a few rugs. It managed all surfaces well, though it did get stuck once under the piano pedals. It might have freed itself, but I helped it along. It found its way back to its dock without difficulty. My floors look great, and I'm really excited about this new addition.\"\n\n$200 at Amazon $200 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "The Strategist is hiring! We are looking for a writer to join our ranks -- to test new things, grill experts for their recommendations, and write enthusiastically about the things they love. You can read the broad strokes of the job requirements here, but for the real lowdown of what we're looking for, Strategist editor Alexis Swerdloff and deputy editor Jason Chen had a chat about what makes a great Strategist staff writer.\n\nJC: What are we looking for in a Strat writer!? There are so many qualities that it'd be easy to just start rattling off adjectives (smart, funny, nimble, obsessive), but I think firstly the person we're looking for is a hard-nosed journalist. If we're trying to suss out the deal with the smart-luggage \"ban,\" do they know who to call? Or if we need to talk to a dozen interior designers about the best sheets, can they figure out who (and fast)? The site also covers so many different things that we're really in search of someone with a generalist's curiosity about shopping. Someone who can be testing a vacuum today and investigating hangover cures tomorrow, you know?\n\nAS: Yes, I agree. Curiosity is so important: You have to really care about getting to the bottom of a question, like, 'What is the next Status Soap?' And the person should be \"with it\" enough to know that there is even such a thing right now as a Status Soap (and that it's Aesop). Remember when you wrote about your Japanese nail clippers that you found at that Narita Airport? That, one of our first posts on the site, helped us figure out what was possible with the Strategist, and how easy it is for a good writer to convince people that they want something they never knew they needed.\n\nJC: Definitely, and as the site has grown, we also need people who know how to make a very knowledgeable guide to, say, French presses, or create well-edited lists of things like Korean office supplies or less-expensive-than-it-looks home décor. I like to think of those as the impulse purchases at the Strat checkout line -- you might have come looking for bed sheets, but you're going to want to toss a pretty wastebasket into your cart, too. Getting that just-right mix of stuff is difficult.\n\nAS: Creative is also an adjective that springs to mind. During gift season, for instance, we have to come up with dozens upon dozens of gift-guide ideas that have never been done before -- so we want people who can rattle off ideas left and right, like the best gifts according to Santas, or what Eckhaus Latta models want for the holidays. And then just being a really nice writer! We want the Strategist to be fun and entertaining to read, even if you have no interest in buying what we're recommending.\n\nJC: Which means tone is a biggie, too. In the text and headlines and even photos, we're trying to signal our taste. I always feel like you get a real sense of Strat's guiding principles when you read our editors' hauls; we're picky (and a little bit insane).\n\nAS: Also important, I think, is respecting our readers: assuming a level of sophistication on their end, and not telling them about things they presumably already know about. That means being super explicit about our process for how we pick things, but also trying to surprise readers a lot. Like, you should use these nursing pads as makeup removers, or a plastic fishbowl to store your pens, and that these are the best dupes for Swedish Hasbeens. Those are some of my favorite Strat posts: They're weird and ultimately very useful.\n\nJC: And I'd wanna stress (in bold and underlined) that we're looking for ambition, too. Beyond the day-to-day, there's room to really go deep on topics related to re-commerce or an everything guide to buying a mattress online.\n\nAS: Hear, hear!\n\nIf this obsessive shopping journalist sounds like you, apply here.\n\nGET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "On Tuesday, in preparation for his phone call with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, President Trump was given a briefing paper directing him to condemn Russia's poisoning of a double agent on British soil and NOT to congratulate Putin on his rigged election. (\"DO NOT CONGRATULATE,\" read the all-caps, but apparently still too subtle, instructions.) Instead, Trump went the other way. He decided not to mention the awkward attempted murder and did congratulate Putin.\n\nRepublicans have responded to this episode with outrage. But their indignation is directed not at a president who has once again demonstrated his bizarre, deeply rooted affinity for Putin. Instead, they are angry that we know about this episode at all. \"I don't agree with congratulating #Putin but bigger outrage is this leak that could only come from someone in @POTUS inner circle,\" says Marco Rubio. Former Bush administration press secretary Ari Fleischer complains, \"Who leaks this stuff? This WH still is disloyal to the president and to each other. What a mess.\" White House chief of staff John Kelly \"is furious over the leak,\" reports Politico. A Republican aide gripes to Axios, \"It is a disservice to the president when every single thing and every single thought gets leaked out ... I don't understand why people don't get that. It's not fair to the president, to his agenda, and to those who work hard every day to move the ball down the field.\"\n\nIt is obviously natural to want the White House to avoid leaking. What's unnatural is the Republican belief that the leaking, rather than the subject of the leaks, is the underlying problem.\n\nThe predominant theory of the case in Republican circles, as I argued recently, is that Trump is an innocent man who acts guilty for no apparent reason. This explains their fixation with his tweeting, which is the safest and most common aspect of the Trump president for Republicans to question in public. Twitter is an open-access channel into his mind, into which Trump constantly feeds unfiltered confessions that defeat their efforts to spin on his behalf. Republicans are trying to make the case that, say, Andrew McCabe was fired for legitimate violations of FBI policy, and then Trump writes a tweet making it seem quite evident that he was fired because Trump personally hates and wants to discredit him.\n\nEd Rogers, the Republican lobbyist and America's worst columnist, has a new column noting that Trump is doing more things that make him seem extremely guilty, like hiring lawyers who want to shut down the investigation and cozying up to Putin over and over. \"Trump constantly does things to make himself appear guilty,\" observes Rogers. \"Let's not even talk about his 'congratulatory message' to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nWhy does Trump constantly say and do things that make him look guilty? Occam's razor would offer one explanation. The Republicans have a different one.",

                "body": "So the long-awaited Omnibus Appropriations Bill to fund the federal government for the rest of fiscal year 2018 finally saw the light of day at about 8 p.m. Wednesday. It came in at 2,232 pages, an impressive boost from the 1,665 pages of last year's equivalent legislation.\n\nYou'd think the 72 hours required in House rules (a requirement, by the way, that Republicans imposed by way of implementing a 2010 campaign promise) for time to consider legislation before a vote on it would be a laughably short allowance for a behemoth like this one. But in fact, the House is planning to waive the 72-hour rule and vote on the omnibus this very day. The reason is obvious, if pathetic: negotiators didn't reach a deal until the Friday night expiration of the previous stopgap spending bill was imminent. So the House needs to clear the monster bill today and the Senate tomorrow, lest a fifth stopgap spending measure -- or a brief government shutdown, the third of the fiscal year -- becomes a necessity.\n\nThere are two known threats to this scenario: House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is planning to oppose the rule for consideration of the omnibus to protest the failure to include protections for Dreamers. If enough House conservatives who intend to vote against the omnibus join House Democrats in this protest, they could slow down the process for a bit (Pelosi actually supports ultimate passage of the bill; this is all just a messaging gesture).\n\nOnce the bill reaches the Senate, Rand Paul could well filibuster it (as he briefly did with the last stopgap spending bill) as his own gesture against irregular budgeting practices and overall spending. If Paul does so, he will eventually be silenced by his annoyed Senate colleagues, but that takes time. And he might even interfere with another stopgap bill, shutting down the government for a day or three.\n\nIn the end, all of these obstacles to enactment of this mammoth pig in a poke are much like the president's threats yesterday to hold his breath until he is blue and/or veto the omnibus out of pique that he didn't get the border wall money he wanted. They won't derail the train heading down the tracks, but can create some havoc, some rebooked congressional travel plans, some momentary fear among federal employees, and quite a bit of well-justified embarrassment that more than halfway through the fiscal year the Congress run by those fine orderly white men of the Grand Old Party can't get their act together to perform the most basic functions in a timely manner.\n\nCome October we will almost certainly see more stopgap spending legislation to get the government past Election Day, and then the game will begin all over again, though quite possibly with the House under new management.",

                "title": "The Radical Proposal Moderate Democrats Should Be Running On",
                "body": "Last week, a self-styled moderate Democrat won a congressional race in the heart of Trump Country -- and the last-surviving \"Blue Dogs\" promptly declared their vindication. For the Democrats' right flank, Politico wrote, \"Lamb's successful center-left campaign is proof that the Democratic Party's 'big tent' mentality is still a winning electoral strategy, despite an aggressive push from liberals for candidates that more closely adhere to the progressive purity made popular by the likes of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\"\n\nThis analysis is at once banally true and insidiously misleading. There is no question that the Democratic Party would be unwise to trumpet the exact same message in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, as it does in Berkeley, California. And during his successful campaign in the former, Conor Lamb did hit culturally conservative notes on gun control and Nancy Pelosi, while saying as few words as he could get away with about immigration and Donald Trump. And yet, the suggestion that Lamb's win exposed the folly of \"progressive purity\" -- as preached by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren -- is an odd one.\n\nAfter all, those senators aren't known as \"purists\" for their hard-line positions on gun control, or effusive support for the House Minority Leader. In fact, Sanders's record on firearms and immigration includes stances about as conservative as those that Lamb just championed in southwest Pennsylvania. The reason why Sanders can nonetheless serve as a synonym for left-wing purity is precisely because the most salient divides in today's Democratic Party do not lie on \"culture war\" issues, but rather, on economic ones -- which is to say, on those issues where Conor Lamb strayed least from progressive orthodoxy.\n\nThere is a lot at stake in these distinctions. The Democratic Party's corporate wing has a vested interest in the idea that moderation on issues of regulation and redistribution is an electoral necessity in pro-Trump regions. Just last week, business-friendly Democrats helped Mitch McConnell make it easier for banks to discriminate against black people and evade regulatory scrutiny -- and justified their complicity (in anonymous quotes to the press) on grounds of political expediency: To get reelected in red and purple areas, Democrats needed to prove their \"bipartisan\" bona fides.\n\nBut there is little evidence that Democrats have any political incentive to broadcast their sympathy for Wall Street, or to demonstrate their sensitivity to corporate interests. In fact, there isn't even much basis for believing that running competitive campaigns in pro-Trump districts and championing far-left economic policies are incompatible objectives. On the contrary, there's actually some reason to think that Democratic candidates would have an easier time making inroads in Red America, if they ran on the right kind of radical fiscal policy -- like, for example, a federal jobs guarantee.\n\nThe idea that the federal government should serve as an employer of last resort -- by guaranteeing a public job to any American unable to find work in the private sector -- has a long history on the Democratic left. In the 1930s, the populist demagogue Huey Long popularized the concept as part of his Share Our Wealth plan -- a far-left alternative to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Three decades later, Martin Luther King Jr. called on the government to provide either guaranteed jobs -- or a guaranteed basic income -- to all unemployed Americans. And in the late 1970s, as U.S. workers suffered from the unholy combination of high unemployment and runaway inflation, the idea nearly made its way into law. But the proposal proved to be too left-wing for the Carter administration, and the Reagan Revolution banished it from the realm of \"reasonable\" debate -- until New York senator (and presumptive 2020 presidential candidate) Kirsten Gillibrand announced her support for the policy this week.\n\nIt isn't hard to see why the federal jobs guarantee has spent so many decades in the wilderness: It is a genuinely radical proposal. In setting a minimum standard for wages, benefits, and hours -- and giving every private sector worker the option to walk off the job without suffering unemployment -- it's a policy with the potential to drastically shift the balance of power between capital and labor. And given the scale of government intervention in the economy that it implies, it's at least as \"left-wing\" as anything in Bernie Sanders's 2016 platform; in fact, a jobs guarantee was ostensibly too radical of an idea for America's favorite democratic socialist two years ago.\n\nThus, if American politics works as Blue Dog Democrats often suggest -- if swing voters have coherent ideological views, and move back and forth between the two major parties because their policy preferences (on economic and \"identity\" issues) lie near the center of a left-right axis -- then support for a federal job guarantee should be minuscule at the national level, and virtually nonexistent in Red America.\n\nBut new survey data from the progressive think tank Data for Progress (DFP) demonstrates the very opposite. Now, when an ideologically motivated think tank puts out a poll showing that the public supports a policy it endorses, one should generally take its findings with a bucket of salt; in most cases, you'll find that the survey was strategically worded to yield the desired result. But as DFP co-founder Sean McElwee explains in the Nation, the think tank took pains to preempt that criticism:\n\nTo explore the possibility of Democrats' running on a guaranteed-job plan, we asked the respected data analytics firm Civis Analytics to not only poll guaranteed jobs, but poll it in the way that would be most likely to gain opposition from voters. They asked respondents: \"Democrats in Congress are proposing a bill which would guarantee a job to every American adult, with the government providing jobs for people who can't find employment in the private sector. This would be paid for by a 5 percent income tax increase on those making over $200,000 per year. Would you be for or against this policy?\"\n\n... The results of the Civis polling were nothing short of stunning, showing large net support for a job guarantee: 52 percent in support, 29 percent opposed, and the rest don't know. \"Even with explicit partisan framing and the inclusion of revenue in the wording, this is one of the most popular issues we've ever polled,\" said David Shor, a senior data scientist at Civis Analytics.\n\nThese results are broadly consistent with previous polling on a jobs guarantee (in 2014, YouGov found a plurality of Americans backing the idea of \"a law guaranteeing a job to every American adult, with the government providing jobs for people who can't find employment in the private sector\"). What makes DFP's research revelatory is that it includes an estimate of the policy's viability on a state-by-state basis. Using demographic data from a separate jobs-guarantee poll conducted by the Center for American Progress, the think tank modeled state-level support for the concept -- and found that \"guaranteed jobs\" is one of the least regionally divisive ideas in American politics.\n\n\"The urban-rural divide in support for the job guarantee is practically nonexistent,\" Colin McAuliffe, a co-founder of Data for Progress, told New York, in an email. \"We estimate 69% support in urban zip codes vs 67% in rural ones. On the other hand, for $15 minimum wage we estimate 69% support in urban zip codes and 49% support in rural zip codes.\"\n\nNow, these findings come with a small caveat: The CAP poll from which they derive did not include any mention of \"Democrats\" or tax increases. But it did describe a massive expansion of \"big government,\" asking voters if they agreed that \"for anyone who is unemployed or underemployed, the government should guarantee them a job with a decent wage doing work that local communities need, such as rebuilding roads, bridges, and schools or working as teachers, home health-care aides, or child-care providers\" -- and roughly two-thirds of rural America said yes.\n\nThis shouldn't be surprising. Decades of political research has established that most voters view politics through the lens of identity, not ideology. Ordinary voters do not cast their ballots for whichever party or candidate most faithfully represents their abstract political philosophy, but rather, whichever one appears to best represent their people -- a group they may define with reference to class, region, religion, gender, race, or partisanship itself.\n\nThus, when the typical \"conservative\" working-class voter hears a description of the federal jobs guarantee, she does not plot the proposal's ideological valence on the left-right spatial model she keeps in her head (or ask herself what Friedrich Hayek would think); she merely hears a common-sense idea for giving work to the idle, and providing employment security to working-class people like herself.\n\nAnd this is part of what makes the idea that Democrats must campaign as economic moderates in working class, pro-Trump districts so misguided. Reachable voters in such areas are almost invariably cross-pressured: Their racial or cultural identities pull them toward the GOP, while their class consciousness (however dim) makes them more sympathetic to \"liberal\" economic ideas. Such culturally conservative, fiscally progressive voters constitute a hefty chunk of the American electorate: A recent study of voter opinion by the political scientist Larry Bartels found that about one-fourth of Hillary Clinton's supporters espoused downright Trumpian views on \"cultural\" issues, while still endorsing (and, ostensibly, prioritizing) conventionally liberal convictions about the role of government in the economy. Meanwhile, Bartels found that a majority of Republican voters approved of \"government efforts to regulate pollution, provide a decent standard of living for people unable to work, and ensure access to good health care, while substantial minorities favor reducing income differences and helping families pay for child care and college.\"\n\nThis study, along with multiple others, testifies to a basic truth about American politics, circa 2018: If Democrats could only get voters to cast their ballots on the basis of their views on economic policy, they would dominate all levels of government.\n\nBut the party will make little progress toward that objective so long as it instructs its candidates in blue-collar, rural districts to disavow any policies that draw too sharp a contrast with Paul Ryan's agenda.\n\nIn reality, there's reason to suspect that bold, easy-to-understand progressive policies like a jobs guarantee might actually make Democrats more competitive in such places, by increasing the electoral salience of class identity. In the Data For Progress poll, Republicans who earned less than $25,000 a year were more supportive of a jobs guarantee than Democrats who made over $150,000.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that every progressive economic policy is a political winner in every district in the United States. Conor Lamb's reluctance to endorse a $15 minimum wage in rural Pennsylvania was not wholly irrational; given the median income in that part of the country, it's likely that the $15 figure strikes some of his constituents as too high (although Lamb could have explained that the new wage floor would be phased in gradually). The point is simply that, contrary to conventional wisdom, there is no ironclad relationship between how politically pragmatic a given policy idea is, and how far \"left\" it would fall on an ideological scale.\n\nA jobs guarantee is radical in theoretical terms, but has a strong claim to common sense in political ones: The idea that the government has a responsibility to provide opportunities for gainful employment to all its constituents is thoroughly bipartisan. Any speech about economic policy -- from any candidate from either party -- affirms this premise. There's no (official) disagreement about the goal of maximizing employment in American politics; only about the means through which to do so. Republicans insist that reducing taxes on the wealthy and regulations on corporations is the silver bullet; Democrats have generally told a more complicated story involving education, innovation, diversity, and redistribution.\n\nA federal jobs guarantee offers Team Blue a prescription for how the government can increase employment opportunities that's just as simple as the GOP's, but far more intuitive -- namely, \"directly hire all of the unemployed people.\" And once one stipulates that American voters do not actually have any implacable hostility to \"big government,\" it becomes obvious that this pitch should be an easier sell than the GOP's \"give yet another tax break to the rich.\"\n\nFor this reason, it's heartening that top Democratic think tanks are hashing out detailed versions of the policy, and that top Democratic presidential hopefuls like Kirsten Gillibrand are embracing it.\n\nPragmatic, moderate Democrats -- who wish to expand the borders of \"Blue America\" this fall -- would do well to follow her lead.",

Kushner accomplished this largely through his personal relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who ousted the heir to the throne last summer and later arrested dozens of business leaders and government officials in what was ostensibly a crackdown on corruption.\n\nThe Intercept reported on Wednesday that MBS, as the crown prince is known, bragged about his close relationship to Kushner, claiming he gave him the names of Saudis disloyal to him -- information Kushner might have gleaned from the president's daily brief. MBS reportedly remarked that Kushner was \"in his pocket.\"\n\nThat claim raises even more questions about Kushner's handling of classified intelligence, but when MBS visited the White House on Tuesday, President Trump seemed pleased with how he's handled the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Here's a closer at how de facto secretary of State Jared Kushner operates.\n\nKushner Befriends MBS\n\nWhile they'd met previously, the Kushner-MBS friendship started one year ago during a long lunch at the White House. A snowstorm bumped German chancellor Angela Merkel from the White House schedule, giving the president and his advisers more time with the Saudis. The Washington Post reported that the two 30-something princes connected over being tasked with solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict:\n\nAs their countries' chief negotiators on Israeli-Palestinian peace, Kushner and the Saudi prince were both seeking to prove their worth on the international stage. They consulted with one another frequently in private calls over the following months, according to people with knowledge of their communications.\n\nPrivate Communications\n\nKushner reportedly riled top national-security officials by arranging private calls with MBS and other foreign leaders. The Intercept reported that Kushner even used WhatsApp to communicate directly with Prince Mohammed, though his attorneys have advised him to stop. While Peter Mirijanian, a spokesperson for Kushner's attorney Abbe Lowell, told the Post that Kushner \"is in conformity with the Presidential Records Act and other rules,\" the paper reported that this was still an issue fairly recently:\n\nKushner's unique role was ­evident a few weeks ago when White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly asked a question in an intelligence briefing about a ­sensitive policy matter related to Saudi Arabia in preparation for the crown prince's visit.\n\nIn response, intelligence briefers told him that virtually all of the conversations that U.S. officials had with the Saudis on the matter had been between Kushner and Mohammed, according to several people familiar with the episode.\n\nTrump's Visit to Saudi Arabia\n\nKushner persuaded Trump to make Saudi Arabia the destination of his first foreign state trip in May 2017, though Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis were said to be opposed. According to the Post, Trump told his son-in-law that he would go to Riyadh if he could get the Saudis to purchase U.S. weapons and increase their counterterrorism efforts.\n\nTrump considered the trip a great success, and touted the sale of $110 billion of weapons to the Saudis as his signature achievement -- though the \"deal\" was comprised of letters of intent, not actual contracts, and they began under Obama.\n\nTrump and Kushner Back Blockade of Qatar\n\nClaiming that they were moved by Trump's call to crack down on terrorism, in June 2017 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates organized a blockade of Qatar, setting off an ongoing crisis. In reality, the move was sparked by a deep regional rivalry.\n\nAn hour after Tillerson called on Arab nations to ease the blockade, Trump voiced his strong support for the Saudi-led action, first on Twitter:\n\nThen in the White House Rose Garden:\n\nKushner was reportedly one of the only advisers who agreed with Trump's stance. His reasoning is unknown, but we learned recently that just weeks earlier, Kushner's father met with Qatar's minister of finance in an effort to secure funding for the family's troubled 666 Fifth Avenue property -- and was shot down.\n\nMirijanian, the spokesperson for Kushner's attorney, said the idea that he considered his family's business interests in any foreign interaction is \"fantasy and part of a misinformation campaign.\"\n\nHowever, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking into Kushner's pursuit of foreign financing, and NBC News reported that Qatari officials considered turning over evidence that he plotted against them with their neighbors:\n\nSeparately, Qatari government officials visiting the U.S. in late January and early February considered turning over to Mueller what they believe is evidence of efforts by their country's Persian Gulf neighbors in coordination with Kushner to hurt their country, four people familiar with the matter said. The Qatari officials decided against cooperating with Mueller for now out of fear it would further strain the country's relations with the White House, these people said.\n\nKushner Takes Secret Trip to Saudi Arabia\n\nKushner took an unannounced trip to Riyadh in late October, and according to David Ignatius, he and Prince Mohammed \"are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.\n\nLater the White House said the purpose of the trip was to discuss a Middle East peace plan, but declined to say who Kushner met with. Afterward, MBS reportedly bragged about Kushner tipping him off about disloyal Saudis. (Mirijanian denied this, saying: \"Some questions by the media are so obviously false and ridiculous that they merit no response. This is one.\")\n\nKushner was said to be keenly interested in the president's daily brief, which he lost access to when his security clearance was downgraded last month. Trump might have authorized him to share information with the Saudis, but passing on classified information without presidential authorization is a federal crime. As the Intercept notes, the crown prince probably didn't need Kushner to identify his critics, and it's possible he made the story up to inflate his status.\n\nTrump Backs Crown Prince's Crackdown\n\nDays after Kushner left Riyadh, MBS instituted his anti-corruption crackdown, arresting his rivals and many influential Saudis. Trump quickly tweeted out his support.\n\nEarlier this month the New York Times reported that detainees were forced to hand over massive sums of money, real estate, and shares of their companies, and also suffered physical abuse:\n\nDuring months of captivity, many were subject to coercion and physical abuse, witnesses said. In the early days of the crackdown, at least 17 detainees were hospitalized for physical abuse and one later died in custody with a neck that appeared twisted, a badly swollen body and other signs of abuse, according to a person who saw the body.\n\nThe Saudi government called these claims \"absolutely untrue.\"\n\nMBS Gets Warm Reception in D.C.\n\nThe crown prince will spend the next two weeks traveling throughout the U.S. in an attempt to secure new business deals. Trump's meeting with Prince Mohammed at the White House on Tuesday featured plenty of mutual praise, but there were no major announcements.\n\nWhile the prince was in D.C. the Senate rejected a resolution calling on the U.S. military to stop aiding its war in Yemen. While a senior official said the issue came up in private, Trump did not allude to it in his public remarks.\n\nThis is certainly not the first administration to put its relationship with a key partner in the Middle East ahead of condemning Saudi human-rights abuses. Some argue that Kushner cozying up to MBS was part of a cunning plan to cut a Middle East peace deal by getting the Saudis to bring the Palestinians to the table. If that was the strategy Trump seems to have derailed it by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\nFor whatever reason, Trump has made it clear that he intends to keep following Kushner's lead, going much easier on the Saudis than his predecessors.\n\n\"I would really have to say the relationship was, to put it mildly, very, very strained during the Obama administration,\" Trump said at his meeting with MBS. \"And the relationship now is probably as good as it's really ever been and I think will probably only get better.\"",

                "body": "If any foreign leaders are itching for a summit with the U.S., they should just give President Trump a ring. Earlier this month, South Korean officials summoned to the Oval Office mentioned that Kim Jong-un would like to meet with the president (which has been North Korea's stance for years). Trump said yes immediately, stunning both South Korean and American officials, who thought he might want to discuss the matter with his advisers first.\n\nSince then, it seems Trump has grown increasingly disinterested in his staffers' advice (and maybe the written word in general). Though Trump's advisers reportedly wrote \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE\" in his briefing materials for his phone call with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, he went ahead an commended the Russian president on his reelection (in a sham election). Trump's advisers were also taken aback when he told reporters that \"probably we'll be seeing President Putin in the not-too-distant future,\" as the two leaders are not schedule to see each other again until November, when they are both expected to attention the Group of 20 summit in Argentina.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that prior to the call there was no discussion of a meeting with Putin, and senior White House officials have previously argued against holding a bilateral meeting with the Russian leader. It appears they tried to keep the invitation private, but both Trump and Moscow made that impossible:\n\nHours before the White House even acknowledged that Trump had spoken to Putin, the Kremlin put its own spin on the call, saying that Trump had called to congratulate Putin and that \"special attention was paid to making progress on the question of holding a possible meeting at the highest level.\"\n\nThe Russian statement forced the hand of the White House, where advisers had disagreed on whether to include Trump's congratulations in the official U.S. account, two people familiar with the conversation said. When the official White House readout of the call emerged several hours later, it said Trump had congratulated Putin but made no mention of a discussion of a meeting.\n\nIt's understood that Trump often extends meaningless invitations to foreign leaders, and senior administration officials told the paper that they haven't been instructed to move ahead with plans to see Putin. White House officials may have to deal with a president who doesn't plan out what he's going to say, but at least they can bet that he doesn't mean what he says either.",

                "body": "One of those only-in-the-Trump era sagas rolled out at 6:52 a.m. this morning when the president tweeted out a comment that undermined his administration's legal position in its death struggle with California over sanctuary cities. To understand it, though, some background is necessary.\n\nOn Monday the U.S. Supreme Court refused (without comment, which is normally the case) to hear the State of Arizona's appeal of a 9th Circuit decision invalidating its cancellation of driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants protected by DACA. The Justice Department did not join the petition for high court review because the 2012 case had been \"overtaken by events,\" presumably meaning all the twists and turns in DACA policy since the suit was filed.\n\nThere the matter would have rested had not Lou Dobbs heard about the matter and freaked out.\n\nAfter demonstrating his ignorance about how the Supreme Court works (guest Alan Dershowitz tried to educate him to no avail), Dobbs decided (with an assist from Dershowitz) to blame their refusal to hear the case on the Justice Department for not supporting Arizona's barnacle-encrusted appeal. And this came to the attention of the Fox News devotee in the White House:\n\nTrump didn't tweet that this inaction was being placed in the lengthy debit column of his assessment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, though you can almost see the thought-bubble.\n\nBut as legal beagles everywhere immediately realized, POTUS had in fact thrown shade on the very strategy Sessions and company were pursuing in connection with the administration's war with California over immigration enforcement. Ian Millhiser explains:\n\nBrewer [the decision SCOTUS refused to review] stands for the proposition that the federal government generally reigns supreme in matters of immigration policy. In the words of the law, Arizona's anti-immigrant policy is \"preempted\" by the web of federal immigration laws and policies determining which non-citizens are and are not permitted to live and work in the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration's suit against California, known as United States v. California, rests on a similar legal theory. California passed a handful of laws which effectively make it more difficult for federal immigration officials to crack down on undocumented immigrants.\n\nJust as he did in the travel ban case, Trump's loose lips are creating a world of trouble for his lawyers. As Millhiser concludes:\n\nIt is clear that Trump neither understands the legal arguments being made by his administration, nor cares to learn what those arguments are. That could make him California's best friend in court.\n\nTempting as it might be for the Justice Department to maintain that the commander-in-chief doesn't set policy for the administration when he's ranting and raving on Twitter, there's no established \"Trump Twitter\" exception to the general proposition that the president speaks for everyone in his employ. He's a lawyer's worst nightmare.",

                "title": "Open Primaries Are a Double-Edged Sword for Progressives",
                "body": "During the 2016 Democratic presidential nominating contest, it became an article of faith among Bernie Sanders supporters that \"closed\" primaries that prevented non-registered-Democrats from participating were a key part of the \"rigging\" of the process in favor of Hillary Clinton. While it was really a stretch to claim that election systems created years ago by state legislatures, many of which were controlled by the GOP, were designed to defeat candidates like Sanders, there was a plausible case to be made that in 2016, at least, closed primaries (particularly those like New York's that prevented changes in party registration for months before a primary) kept a lot of left-leaning independents from turning out for the insurgent candidate.\n\nIt is somewhat embarrassing to Berniecrats, then, that an open primary in Illinois may have materially contributed to the defeat of their very favorite insurgent candidate of the young 2018 election season: IL-03's Marie Newman, who lost by an eyelash yesterday to incumbent Democrat. Newman, who was endorsed by Sanders (and by Jan Schakowski and Luis Guiterrez, progressive colleagues of Lipinski from Chicago), ran against Lipinski's record of opposition to abortion rights, Obamacare, the Dream Act, and other Democratic priorities. Somewhat ironically, if predictably, Lipinski was backed by the House Democratic leaders and the AFL-CIO.\n\nBut what in the end may have saved the incumbent was cross-over voting from Republicans, particularly anti-abortion Republicans, as Ryan Grim reports:\n\nSophia Olazaba, a field manager for the Newman campaign, said she doesn't doubt that some Republican voters crossed over. \"Even when we were canvassing, a lot of homes have had both Jeanne Ives and Dan Lipinski signs, so those people could have crossed over,\" she said, referring to the GOP gubernatorial candidate whose entire campaign was premised on her opposition to legal abortion.\n\nThe anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List became heavily invested in Lipinski's survival. And easing the way for Republicans to vote for him was the fact that the GOP discouraged its voters from casting a ballot for the only IL-03 candidate who qualified for the Republican primary, neo-Nazi Art Jones.\n\nYes, most of the state's anti-abortion activist energy was focused on Ives' challenge to pro-choice Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, which came nearly as close as Newman's campaign to pulling the upset. But Ives' most prominent national backer, National Review magazine, explicitly encouraged Republicans in the 3d District to cross over and vote for Lipinski.\n\nYes, it's also possible the Newman campaign pulled some pro-choice Republicans across the line into the Democratic primary, and independents may have backed both candidates; it's hard to tell without exit polls, particularly in a state with no voter registration by party. Moreover, one can always cite multiple factors that \"decided\" very close elections.\n\nBut the possibility open primary rules saved Lipinski should serve as a reminder that open primaries are no panacea for progressive Democrats, even if they might have helped Sanders in 2016 with his disproportionately youthful (and thus disproportionately likely to register as independents) following. Primary interlopers can come in all shapes, sizes, colors and ideological preoccupations.",

While the Trump White House did slow-walk some sanctions, in some respects, it has taken a more hawkish approach to Russia than its predecessor, approving lethal arms sales to anti-Russian forces in Ukraine, and abetting the slaughter of dozens of Russian soldiers in Syria.\n\nAnd yet, even as his administration's posture toward Russia has been rather hostile, Trump's personal posture toward Vladmir Putin has been relentlessly friendly -- and, on occasion, downright adulatory.\n\nThe president's irrepressible fondness for his Russian counterpart made headlines (yet again) this week, when Trump congratulated Putin for winning \"reelection.\" The Washington Post subsequently revealed that Trump's national security advisers had included a note in his briefing materials that read \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE.\" But the president (reportedly) ignored his counsel, along with a request to denounce Russia's apparent decision to spew a bunch of toxic nerve poison in the middle of London earlier this month.\n\nOn Wednesday, the president offered the following defense of this \"maverick\" approach to diplomacy with a homicidal tyrant.\n\nThis is a persuasive defense of Trump's decision to ignore his national security advisers' counsel for at least three reasons:\n\n1. If there's been one consistent theme in Donald Trump's foreign policy, it's his profound reluctance to say or do anything that would make it more difficult for the U.S. to \"get along\" with other countries. Whether the issue is trade, climate change, or immigration this president has always prioritized maintaining good relations between the U.S. and its allies above all else. Thus, no one could fairly accuse Trump of selectively applying this \"live and live\" stance to Putin's kleptocracy.\n\n2. No one can deny that the conflict in Ukraine and \"the coming Arms race\" are American problems that Vladimir Putin has been helpful in solving.\n\n3. It is totally normal for the president to say that George W. Bush was too dumb for Putin, and Obama too low energy, but that he is just right, as if the Russian leader were Goldilocks, and he, a warm bowl of oatmeal.\n\nSo while there did appear to be something odd and unseemly to Trump's relationship with Putin before, the president has now successfully put such concerns to rest.",

                "title": "Congress Adds Last-Minute Gun Regulation to Spending Bill",
                "body": "So a couple of days late, but hardly any dollars short, the long-awaited spending bill -- the one that will stave off yet another government shutdown -- is ready for votes in Congress after some tense last-minute negotiations. There were no big surprises, though the inclusion of legislation to tighten the firearms background-check system without additional concessions to gun fanciers is annoying some conservatives.\n\nOn the issues that were still hanging fire yesterday, decisions were mostly made to avoid major controversy, according to an account in Politico. There's no explicit funding for the Gateway tunnel project connecting New York City and New Jersey that the White House opposed. But the project was indirectly accommodated by boosts in transportation grants that could later go to Gateway. There's $1.6 billion for border security, but none of it will go for a concrete wall (as opposed to fencing). A real deal was cut in which Republicans got a \"fix\" to the so-called \"Grain Glitch\" in their tax bill, which gave a large advantage to farmers who sold grain to cooperatives, while Democrats got a temporary low-income housing credit increase. The bill will include money for the FBI and for states to safeguard against Russian cyberattacks on election systems, but will not include safeguards against the president firing Robert Mueller.\n\nThe modest gun-regulation tweak made it into the bill after Fix NICS co-sponsor Senator Chris Murphy talked Democratic leaders out of demanding more on the firearms front; House conservatives, always on the hunt for signs of betrayal, are reportedly steamed that the concealed-carry reciprocity measure attached to Fix NICS in the House was dropped by their leaders.\n\nAll in all, the omnibus negotiations were notable for what stayed out rather than what got in, as controversial demands on immigration, abortion, Obamacare stabilization, and internet sales taxes fell by the wayside.\n\nBut it wouldn't be the Trump era without the president creating some last-minute drama, as HuffPost reports:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is having second thoughts about supporting the omnibus spending deal that was reached Wednesday morning, according to a source familiar with the president's thinking....\n\nTrump is apparently most upset about the spending deal's lack of funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The deal would fund the government until October but would only provide $1.6 billion for border funding and only $641 million for a wall.\n\nThe White House, of course, was privy to all of the negotiations over this bill, which have been going on since last fall. So you'd have to guess his people will talk him down and keep him from triggering a government shutdown and a major fiscal crisis.\n\nAssuming nothing blows up at the last minute, the bill should now be set for a virtually sight-unseen vote in the House on Thursday, followed by quick Senate action. With previous appropriations running out at midnight Friday, and terrible weather afflicting Washington, there's a chance Congress will miss this deadline and trigger another short government shutdown. But it seems the 2017 version of Congress's dysfunctional process for funding the federal government will come to a close -- until October, when a new fiscal year arrives and we start all over again.",

                "title": "14 Tiny-Apartment Solutions From a Professional Organizer",
                "body": "It's nearly spring, which means it's nearly the season of cleaning and organization. There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nTiny apartments are the running joke of New York City real estate. And if you live in one, every little square foot counts. So making it a functional, yet still open space does require some creativity. Don't have a closet? Find a slim clothing rack. Have a tiny kitchen? Maximize your shelf space. And so on. To find some inspiration for creating order within the confines of a small living area, we talked to someone who would know best. Laura Cattano, a professional organizer in New York City who lives in a small, 335-square-foot alcove studio, says that her philosophy on small spaces is all about living better with less. \"Anyone with a small space should start by thinking about what activities they want their space to support first and then set things up accordingly.\"\n\nFor her, that meant making sure she had sufficient desk space, a sitting area, and a queen-size bed, and then working around that. \"I wanted everything to feel spacious and still allow me to do what I need to do. That should be the basis of any space, but especially for a small apartment where you want things to be multifunctional and have purpose.\" To do that, she recommends balancing what's seen and what's not with open storage (like shelving) and closed storage (like cupboards). \"It's not only balancing what is out and what's put away but that it looks good and that it's seamless with your aesthetic.\" Here, her ideas on how to spruce up a cramped space.\n\nEntryway Leaning Edge Matte Black Wall Hook\n\n\"Starting at the front door, creating an entry is important. Having a couple of hooks or a coat rack is helpful for a few reasons. Even if you have a coat closet, most people (especially in the city), don't have room in their closet for guest coats. And it's great to have a spot to drop your coat and bag instead of tossing it on a chair.\"\n\n$9 at CB2 Steel Wall Hook $32 at Ahalife Multi-Hook Wall Shelf\n\n\"Having a mirror, floating shelves or even a floating nightstand where you can drop your mail and put your keys can be decorative and create a space for your stuff. I love the floating shelf as it's simple, clean, and doesn't take up floor space. You can hang multiples: a lower shelf for mail and an upper for a basket with keys. Having a dedicated spot for your keys means you'll always know where they are, and a spot for mail means it doesn't end up in a pile on the kitchen counter\n\nor dining table.\"\n\n$24 at Urban Outfitters Living Room Best Box\n\n\"If you have open shelving, put boxes on the shelves to hide the stuff that doesn't tell a story about you, like Band-Aids and pens and stationery and office supplies and brushes and hair spray. No one wants to see any of that. I want to see your art, your books, your decorative accessories. I want to see photos. When you look around your apartment, you should really only see things that you love.\"\n\n$4 at The Container Store Kitchen Muuto Restore Basket\n\n\"I recommend boxes for above the cabinets and above the refrigerator because people like to throw stuff up there and it looks terrible. I have about six boxes on top of my refrigerator because there's no cabinet up there. That's a great way for people to add storage without feeling like it's too much. Any boxes for over the kitchen cabinet or fridge should be plastic, or something easy to clean if you cook a lot and have a small kitchen, but you could also put a basket like this over your refrigerator for snacks and bread, which will save you cupboard space.\"\n\n$106 at Amara 3M Command Clear Caddies\n\n\"These are super cute. They're these clear bins that stick on the wall, but you can take them off, so there's no installation necessary. I'll put those on the insides of cabinets so people don't have too many packets of tea and spices lying around, whatever packets of food you have.\"\n\nFrom $8 at The Container Store Lynk Professional Roll-Out Under-Sink Single Drawer\n\n\"I really like adding drawers on the lower cabinets of the kitchen so you're not crawling around looking for your saucepans. Clients call it life-changing. You do lose space with them, but they make your life a lot easier. Just be sure to measure the space between the cabinet hinges and the back of the cabinet to ensure a good fit.\"\n\nFrom $45 at Bed Bath & Beyond Closets 3M Command Nickel Modern Hooks\n\n\"Adhesive hooks are game changers. Use them in closets for belts (the small utensil ones), or get larger ones for handbags, tote bags, hats, scarves, umbrellas, and necklaces. They're handy in the bathroom, too, for hanging up robes, towels, and shower brushes.\"\n\nFrom $10 at Bed Bath & Beyond Real Simple Over-the-Door Shoe Organizer\n\n\"Instead of using those over-the-door shoe organizers with the canvas pockets over the door (which I don't like because there's a tongue that hangs over the door), I use an Ook hook, which is a picture hook, to hang these organizers on the side wall of the closet for shoes, hats, gloves, scarves. You can use them for anything. The clear ones are really good for cords, or for kids' things, so you can see what's in there.\"\n\n$20 at Bed Bath & Beyond Joy Mangano Black Huggable Hangers\n\n\"If you don't have a ton of hanging space, you can use these slimmer, huggable velvet hangers, which I recommend if you have a limited amount of hanging space.\"\n\n$9 at Bed Bath & Beyond Cotton Soft Box With Lid\n\n\"I love Muji for good-quality stuff that really lasts. This is a zippered, structured canvas box. You can stack them if they're really filled. I like those for blankets, for off-season clothes, for anything really. I like those in a closet on a top shelf or on the floor of the closet.\"\n\n$18 at Muji Bathroom Acrylic Risers\n\n\"These are little acrylic risers, which are like mini-shelves to stick in the medicine cabinet. You can stack them on top of each just to give you more shelf space. The six-by-three size fits in most medicine cabinets.\"\n\n$4 at The Container Store Lighting Eden White Pendant Light\n\n\"Lighting is so important in any space, especially a small space. It helps set a mood, and who couldn't use more light in their homes? I love a plug-in sconce or overhead plug-in lighting for saving floor and table space. They also help define a space. A lot of apartments don't come with overhead lighting, so I'll add some. Beside my closet and my bathroom, I have nine light sources and added seven of them.\"\n\n$70 at CB2 Bedroom Nest Storage Bed\n\n\"I do not believe in storing things under the bed because people don't clean under the bed. It's like the basement, where you put your stuff that you don't want to deal with. What most people stick under the bed is crap that they don't use. But if you have a storage bed with drawers, then that's fine. And if you're going to do that, I suggest keeping often-used things in there, so you're actually going in there regularly, or off-season clothes. I like storage beds best for kids, so they can put away their toys.\"\n\n$2,465 at Design Within Reach GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "It's now spring, which means it's also the season of cleaning and organization. There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nMy life has gotten seriously better this year, and here's why: I decided to finally take my eye doctor's advice to wear my glasses as much as possible. Wearing glasses that often, though, also means my spectacles are often getting greasy, smudged, and streaked. After purchasing (and discarding) multiple spray cleaners, polishing cloths, storage systems, and gadgets, I've finally hit on the perfect arsenal for keeping my grimy glasses crystal clear (and right where I can find them) all day long.\n\nShield 34108COMB Lens Cleaner Combo\n\nMy eyelashes are constantly brushing up against the lenses of my glasses, causing them to get filthy within an hour of putting them on. After a lot of trial and error, I can report with 100 percent certainty that the very best eyeglass cleaner currently on the market is made by Shield, and is available in a handy two-pack that includes a mini-bottle perfect for stashing in your purse or tote bag.\n\nIt cuts through oil like crazy and leaves zero streaks -- even on lenses with hard-to-clean anti-reflective coatings. While most lens cleaners tend to just smear around the oil, this stuff cuts right through it (and removes it) while still being gentle enough not to scratch the lenses. And even if your glasses don't get smeared and greasy like mine, you should still be cleaning them every few days -- lenses, frames, and all. That cloudy, impossible-to-get-off film that gets on plastic or acetate frames? It's actually the frames breaking down from body oils, hairspray, and environmental grime. This helps mitigate it.\n\n$10 at Amazon $10 at Amazon Campanelli Premium Microfiber Towel Set (40 pieces)\n\nUsing the right lens cleaner is only half the battle -- you've got to use it with the right cloth to really get things spick-and-span. Those tiny, silky squares that come with your glasses are a joke, but these soft, superabsorbent microfiber cloths are a magnet for dust and dirt -- and are large enough to polish your glasses to a shine without touching them with your dirty hands, immediately undoing everything you just accomplished. Used in conjunction with the Shield cleaner, it's a one-two punch that gets even the dirtiest glasses polished and clean. Note: These cloths come in a set of 40, which sounds ridiculous until you stash them all over to clean anything you can think of: your computer screen and keyboard, phone and tablet, even the light-up display in your car. Once they get dirty, toss 'em in the wash and use them until they're threadbare.\n\n$20 at QVC Generic Sonic Wave Ultrasonic Jewelry & Eyeglass Cleaner\n\nUsing old-fashioned elbow grease to get your glasses clean regularly is practically mandatory, but it's also a good idea to give them a whirl in this little glasses-cleaning robot every so often as a low-effort way to get them truly, sparkling clean. The directions say to use plain water, but I've had better luck filling it with a dedicated lens cleaner. The ultrasonic waves get the cleaner into every nook and cranny, vibrating out even stuck-on dirt that has managed to worm its way behind the hinges and screws of your favorite reading glasses or shades.\n\n$29 at Amazon $29 at Amazon Upright Eyeglasses Holder, 2-Pack\n\nI've talked about these fuzzy eyeglass nests before, but it's worth repeating. I learned about these from my grandmother, and now, instead of searching on the floor or somewhere under my pillow to find my glasses when I wake up, they're always right where I put them -- unscratched and unscathed, but most importantly, unsmudged. See, when you aren't half-blindly grabbing your glasses by the lenses to pick them up off your nightstand, they stay cleaner way longer. Since using and loving it, I've bought two more -- one for my office and another for my desk at home. (Though I opted for a subtle, plain leather-esque version for the office.)\n\n$13 at Amazon $13 at Amazon MyGift Deluxe 8 Slot Sunglasses Organizer Box\n\nI don't own just a single pair of glasses -- I have a proper collection of frames that match whatever I happen to be wearing that day, so storing them has become a bit involved. This fabric-lined, eight-slot storage case has a clear window, so you can find what you're looking for at a glance, and the case is flat enough to slide into a drawer or slip underneath a cabinet.\n\n$19 at Amazon $19 at Amazon Nerdwax\n\nI bought this stuff on a whim from my optometrist because my glasses would not stop sliding down my nose as I read in bed, which drove me nuts. It's a tube of beeswax, coconut oil, gum rosin, and peppermint oil that you roll onto the clean nose pads of your glasses, which causes them to stay put on your nose while you read or work. It lasts for at least two hours and wears off naturally by the facial oils your skin produces.\n\n$11 at Amazon $11 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Breaks Silence On Cambridge Analytica",
                "body": "Waiting days before addressing a major scandal involving Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has finally spoken out about Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm that acquired data on more than 50 million users from a researcher years ago. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he wrote. He also said the company was cooperating with authorities and that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to a forensic audit.\n\n\"This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it,\" Zuck wrote. \"We need to fix that.\"\n\nZuckerberg is in a bit of a bind right now, given that this scandal shines a light not on obviously illegal practices, but on the shady and arguably invasive data collection and transfer that lies at the heart of Facebook's business strategy. Cambridge Analytica was not an outlier when it came to siphoning Facebook data, as at least one employee has already alleged.\n\nRather than dwell on the past, Zuckerberg outlined data protection steps going forward. The gap that Cambridge Analytica benefited from -- that users could share their friends' data with third-party apps -- was mostly closed in 2014. Still, Zuckerberg says Facebook will \"conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity,\" though what that actually means is anyone's guess. Developers in violation will be banned and affected users will be notified (a measure Facebook has often resisted). He did not specify if the the users included in Cambridge Analytica's dataset will be notified.\n\nFacebook will also kill a user's connection to an app if it lies unused for more than 3 months. In other words, if you log in to a site through Facebook once and then don't do so again within a three-month period, the developer won't still maintain access to your account. In addition, signing in through Facebook will only provide developers with your name, profile picture and email address -- much less data than developers would receive in the past.\n\nAnd lastly, users will get an audit tool as well: \"In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you've used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to your data.\" The prime news feed placement is important. In contrast, the tool Facebook released a few months ago to allow users to see if they had interacted with accounts tied to the Internet Research Agency was buried in the site's Help section. The new tool will roll out in the next month.\n\nTaken as a whole, the measures show an effort towards transparency that Facebook has, in the past, shied away from. At the very least, Zuckerberg is aware of Facebook's dwindling trustworthiness, and parts of it are technical in a way Facebook often tries to avoid.\n\nAnd as usual, Zuckerberg closed on a note about \"community.\"\n\n\"I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform. I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community,\" he wrote, adding \" I want to thank all of you who continue to believe in our mission and work to build this community together.\"\n\nWell, at least he didn't say anything about \"time well spent.\" You can read the full statement embedded below.",

                "title": "What We Know About Austin Bomber Mark Conditt",
                "body": "Several weeks after his reign of terror began and just hours after blowing himself up with his own bomb, 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt was identified as the person behind a recent string of bombings in Austin, Texas that killed two and injured five more. He is thought to be responsible for at least six bombs, but Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said Wednesday morning that there could be more.\n\n\"We don't know where this suspect has spent his last 24 hours, and therefore we need to remain vigilant to be sure no other packages have been left throughout the community,\" Manley said at a press conference.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Conditt detonated a bomb inside his vehicle on the side of the interstate as SWAT officers approached him. \"The suspect is deceased,\" Manley said at the press conference. One SWAT officer sustained minor injuries from the bomb.\n\nA resident of the Austin suburb Pflugerville, Conditt was identified as the suspect thanks to surveillance footage, cell phone records and his online orders of \"exotic\" batteries,\" NBC News reports.\n\nReporters in Pflugerville have descended on Conditt's home and have begun speaking to friends and family who variously describe him as a \"deep thinker,\" a \"very normal kid\" and \"peaceful.\"\n\nConditt was homeschooled as a child and attended Austin Community College from 2010 to 2012, though he didn't graduate. A series of blog posts he wrote for a U.S. government course at the college provide a glimpse at Conditt's political views. The Austin-American Statesman reports that Conditt wrote about his opposition to gay marriage and abortion, and his support for the death penalty. He also advocated for the abolishment of sex offender registries.\n\n\"Just look at the male and female bodies,\" he wrote in one post. \"They are obviously designed to couple. The natural design is apparent. It is not natural to couple male with male and female with female. It would be like trying to fit two screws together and to nuts together and then say, 'See, it's natural for them to go together.'\"\n\nIt's not clear if Conditt's political views, which he described as conservative, motivated the bombings, which began on March 2 when Anthony Stephan House was killed after picking up a package on his porch in Austin. Two more package bombs exploded on March 12, killing 17-year-old Draylen Mason injuring two others. Another bomb injured two men on an Austin sidewalk Sunday and one Tuesday a package exploded at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio. A sixth bomb that did not detonate was discovered at another FedEx facility in Austin Tuesday.\n\nAfter his time at Austin Community College, Conditt worked at Crux Manufacturing in Pflugerville, KVUE in Austin reports. The station spoke to Conditt's former boss, who said he was \"very quiet and introverted\" and acknowledged that Conditt was fired last summer. The owner added the Conditt \"seemed like a smart kid who showed a lot of promise.\"",

                "title": "The 10 Best Vacuum Cleaners, According to Amazon Reviewers",
                "body": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy (like pillows), but as much as we'd like to, we can't try everything. Which is why we have People's Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that's four-to-five-star reviews and lots of 'em) products and single out the most convincing. While we've written about our favorite vacuums and brand-new Dysons here before, we dove back in for a more comprehensive look into the best shapes and styles of sucking. Below, you'll find the best in robotic vacuums, hand vacuums, even table vacuums, and everything else that falls in between. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nBest Robotic Vacuum for Removing Fur iRobot Roomba 690\n\n4.1 Stars, 1,321 reviews\n\n\"This thing has been a lifesaver. We recently built a decent-size home, and our downstairs is around 2,800 square feet. Keeping up on vacuuming and sweeping was almost impossible with two young kids, a cat, and a dog. My mom talked me into one of these, swearing by it. I was super skeptical of spending the money on a machine that I may need to sweep up after frequently, but I haven't touched a vacuum in two weeks!!! Our great room, kitchen, dining, and laundry are all hard surfaces (tile and hardwood), and this thing picks up nearly EVERYTHING that falls on the floor! It picks up MORE than sweeping. Every other day when we empty the bin, there is so much more than just the crumbs the kids drop. This thing goes under our couch. Ask yourself, How often do you successfully vacuum under the couch? Well, I do it every day now! The 690 also navigates around multiple chairs very well. It's not that tall of a lip, but I'm okay with that, since 98 percent of the other surfaces are clean. There's been one time over the past two weeks he caught up a string from a cat toy and stopped. Other than that, I'll drop him in our master or master bath and closet and hit clean while we are in the other rooms.\"\n\n$300 at Amazon $300 at Amazon Best (and Cheapest) Canister Vacuum With an Automatic Cord Rewind BISSELL Zing Bagged Canister Vacuum, Purple, 4122 - Corded\n\n4.3 stars, 2,077 reviews\n\n\"Just received this and tried it out on the carpeted stairs. Worked really well. Super light, and with cord and wand fully extended and the canister halfway up the stairs, I got all the way to the top landing. Then I tried it out on my oak hardwood floors. Again, worked really well. So then I switched out to the mini attachment, and did the cat tree and the windowsills. With the carpeted area, I pushed the brushes down to pick up cat hair, which I did pull off and let get sucked into the house. On the bare floor, I toggled to retract the brush. The suction is great and adjustable. Also, pulling toward you works better, as the brush doesn't have wheels like larger, more expensive canister vacuums. I am thrilled with this little machine, and can see it helping get all kinds of nooks and crannies clean, because it is lightweight and easy to take around.\"\n\n$50 at Amazon $50 at Amazon Best German-Made (But Expensive) Canister Vacuum Miele Complete C2 Limited Edition - Corded\n\n4.7 stars, 233 reviews\n\n\"I love it! It is worth the price. It is light enough for me to carry up the stairs. I like the adjustable suction dial, too. It comes with its own filter, but I did purchase a separate HEPA filter. Everything is so easy to change; the attachments store right in the top of the machine; and the cord and telescoping wand are the perfect length. I have hardwood floors and only a few rugs to deal with. The combination floor tool switches back and forth between hardwood and carpets. It has a roller and bristles that pop out for hardwood, and pop back in for rugs. It is okay for touch-ups on my rugs, but the separate carpet-brush attachment works much better for that. I have two dogs that shed a lot. Before I started using this, my allergies were horrible, and it's so much better now. My kids aren't getting head colds as much, either. My house is much easier to clean now, and everyone is healthier!\"\n\n$450 at Amazon $450 at Amazon Best Upright Vacuum That Can Also Separate Into a Canister Shark Navigator Lift-Away Professional with Dust-Away & 2 Microfiber Pads\n\n4.5 stars, 7,557 reviews\n\n\"The box came, and I opened it and felt a little intimidated, since putting things together is not my strong point. But to my surprise, there were written instructions with step-by-step procedures. I had that vacuum together in no time. It works great!! I have flat rugs and terrazzo in my beach house, where sand finds its way in. It works wonderful with the terrazzo without a brush, and great with the rugs with a brush. The unit is very easy to come off and clean your lampshades, sofas, etc. I love the fact that I can see the dirt coming up in the see-through canister. I have bought vacuums much more expensive than this one, and they haven't work half as well. By the way, I have two little dogs, and this got up all the dog hair from the floor and rugs. And my last comment -- very light in weight, which is great for someone that doesn't have that strong of an upper body.\"\n\n$180 at Amazon $180 at Amazon Best Upright Bagless Vacuum for Carpets BISSELL 9595A Vacuum with OnePass - Corded\n\n4.3 stars, 9,266 reviews\n\n\"This is what a vacuum cleaner is supposed to do, and this one does it very well. I received my package tonight, and had it unpacked and assembled in less than ten minutes. All of the attachments mounted nicely on the vacuum, which is a definite plus for me. My bedroom rug (five-by-eight) had suffered for about a month since the brushes on my old vacuum died. A few minutes later, I was amazed at how much stuff there was in the canister. Where did all that stuff come from? I decided to try it on my other rug, which is about a year old and didn't look at all dirty. Much to my alarm, the canister came away almost full, and the rug now looks amazing. A lot of stuff in the canister is very fine dust that my old vacuum probably never had the strength to get.\"\n\n$80 at Amazon $80 at Amazon Best Upright Bagless Vacuum for Hardwood Floors Dirt Devil Power Air Corded Bagless Stick Vacuum for Hard Floors SD20505\n\n4.3 stars, 941 reviews\n\n\"We have 2,400 square feet of hardwood floors. And a toddler. Which means we have 2,400 square feet of cereal crumbs to step on as well. Other vacuums I had purchased in the past (for hardwood floors) would either blow the crumbs around the floor, while only picking up a few, or just miss them altogether, since they were too light for the vacuum to pick up. This vacuum is great; it picks up just about anything, heavy or light, that may be lying around. The vacuum itself is also very light, but has a very powerful suction. It's a bit louder than I had expected, but the trade off over having to sweep is well worth it. My main concern was how well this vacuum would preform around edges, baseboards, and underneath cabinets. The suction is so powerful that this definitely is not a problem. Gets the job done. My husband, who has swept the floors maybe three or four times in the three and a half years we've been in this house, was very impressed with it as well -- so much so that he decided to vacuum the entire house.\"\n\n$34 at Amazon $34 at Amazon Best Low-cost Vacuum Dirt Devil Vacuum Cleaner Simpli-Stik Lightweight Bagless Corded Stick and Handheld Vacuum SD20000RED\n\n4 stars, 11,575 reviews\n\n\"I don't move anywhere without this vacuum. I've used it for three-plus years, and can definitely say that it works as well or better than bigger, more powerful household vacuums -- as long as you regularly empty the dirt cup and give the filter inside a good rinsing. I lived with two massive Siberian huskies who were blowing their coats -- meaning piles, and piles, and piles of fur littered everywhere. This allowed me to clean up their daily shedding in a pinch, and even vacuum it from the dogs directly. The narrow attachment is great for cleaning up dirt and dust along the baseboards of a room, on windowsills, and corners.\"\n\n$20 at Amazon $20 at Amazon Best Very Skinny Stick Vacuum Shark Rocket Ultra-Light Upright (HV302)\n\n4.5 stars, 2,158 reviews\n\n\"One of the best investments I have made in some time. I have three birds, four cats, and two dogs. It's safe to say that we have a mess every day. The seeds from the birds are enough to drive you crazy. Then figure in the other six pets, and I could try to clean every day and still not keep the house clean. So I bought this Shark Rocket. Wow! The Shark does the job, and I only have to vacuum every other day (except for the birds). The only thing I would do differently would have been to spend the extra money and buy the Shark with the bigger cup (collection cup). I don't mind the long cord. I actually think that is a plus.\"\n\n$158 at Amazon $158 at Amazon Best Handheld Vacuum BLACK + DECKER CHV1410L 16V Cordless Lithium Hand Vac\n\n4.3 stars, 11,409 reviews\n\n\"This thing is magic. I have a Siberian husky who sheds like mad and tends to own my backseat, and my car has never been cleaner. This little guy can do everything I need it to. It has a charging base that I can tuck inconspicuously out of sight, a reassuring blue light when it's charging, a really decent battery life, and comes apart for cleaning like a dream. It picks up both heavy items (the food my dog throws across the wood floor) and light items (dog fur, even off carpet). The brush head is especially great for getting fur off of car seats. In a perfect world, the battery would last for 30 minutes going full blast, but let's be realistic. I have to charge it a couple of times to get my car fully clean, but I expect that because it's cordless and also has great suction. Other things I like about this: the extendable locking nozzle. The color blue. Its relative lightness. The ease of disassembly. The fact that I no longer drive around in a cloud of fur.\"\n\n$45 at Amazon $45 at Amazon Best (and Cutest) Table Vacuum niceeshop(TM) Mini Table Dust Vaccum Cleaner Red Beetles Prints Design\n\n4.2 stars, 138 reviews\n\n\"I saw this gadget first at Walmart and laughed at how ridiculous it is: 'for the person who has everything.' Then I started thinking about it solely for crumb pick up on my kitchen countertops. I proved myself wrong on the idea, and I love it. No more wiping or sweeping crumbs onto the floor to then step on or have to pick up. It is quick and easy -- swipe across the countertops and done! It takes two batteries. It is powerful (but rather quiet), obviously, because when you open up the bin, you will be so surprised how much is in there. No wonder why I had to vacuum my hardwood floors all the time. The only downside is that it is not good at corners or edges -- those you are still going to have to pick up the old-fashioned way, but this has saved me time. My husband laughs because I use it constantly, because it is so easy (and don't tell him I said this, but it's fun haha).\"\n\n$8 at Amazon $8 at Amazon\n\nGet the Strategist in your inbox.\n\nEmail\n\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

                "title": "The Best Closet Organizers Used by Professional Organizers",
                "body": "It's now spring, which means it's also the season of cleaning and organization. There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nIf you're going to go through the trouble of cleaning out your closet, you're also going to want to find a way to keep your clothes organized. But with so many different closet organizers out there -- from space-saving hangers to wall ladders that function as secondary closets -- it can be hard to find the right ones for you and your organizational needs. So to help you conquer your messy closet once and for all, and find the best wardrobe organizers for small and big spaces alike, I asked three professional organizers to share their favorite closet organization ideas along with the closet organizers and storage bins they use to tame their clients' wardrobes.\n\nBest Closet Organizers and Hangers Real Simple Slimline 12-Count Flocked Shirt Hangers in Dove\n\n\"I recommend getting the skinny velvet flocked hangers for tops and light jackets and dresses. I personally like the Real Simple brand; you can get them at Bed Bath and Beyond. They absolutely do save space for items that are relatively thin. If you've got a big, bulky men's jacket, putting it on a thin hanger is not going to save any space, but for tops and stuff, it does. It also just looks better when everything is matching. Your eye is not glancing from type of hanger to type of hanger. It's form and function. Plus, there's a nice, smooth metal hook that glides easily on a closet rod, as opposed to those bulky, plastic hangers that don't move around too easily.\" -- Lisa Zaslow, Gotham Organizers\n\n$10 at Bed Bath and Beyond Honey-Can-Do Crystal Patterned Skirt Hangers (5-Pack)\n\n\"For skirts and pants, I do like regular, clear plastic hangers with springy metal clips. The metal clips hold better. Also, what I like about them is the straight hanger; it doesn't take up as much room between the rod and the clip, so you can have some extra space underneath your hanging clothes, where you can put your shoes or a hamper.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$6 at Bed Bath and Beyond Simple Division Garment Organizers\n\n\"In your closet, put similar things together. Put all the pants together; put all the tops together. Something that I use all the time, and my clients really like them, are Simple Division Garment Organizers. It's basically a plastic divider that just fits over the closet rod, so you can see at a glance your different types of clothes. They've got labels that come with it, or you can make your own labels, but you can separate dressy dresses from work dresses. Even just so you can see where the shirts are -- and next is jackets, and next is pants. You can even do things like 'Wear This Next' for things you forget to wear.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$16 at Amazon Bintopia Polyester Carry Hamper in Black/White\n\n\"We always like to leave our clients a donate bag in their closets. You know when you put something on, and you're like, 'Eh, no.' And you take it off and put it back? If I do that two or three times, it goes right in the donate bag. Once I've rejected it a few times, it goes into the bag. One of the big problems in New York with donating is that stuff gets too heavy. So if you know where your donate places are, on your way home, just drop in what you can carry, it makes a huge difference of keeping on top of it.\" -- Ann Lightfoot, Done & Done Home\n\n$29 at Bed Bath and Beyond John Louis Home Pull Out 12-Inch Valet Rod\n\n\"Another thing I love for closets are valet rods. It's this horizontal rod. You mount it on the edge of the shelf, and then you can pull it forward when you need it. It basically makes a little closet rod that goes perpendicular to your shelf, and it's great if you're planning an outfit or if you've got something that isn't quite clean, but you're going to wear it again, or when you're packing or just got dry-cleaning. It just gives you a little extra space to hang garments, and then it retracts if you don't need it anymore.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$10 at Bed Bath and Beyond Command Designer Hooks, Medium, White, 6-Hooks\n\n\"I like the Command hooks by 3M that you can just stick on and remove. It's great on the walls of your closet or on the closet door itself. You can hang belts, jewelry, small accessories, a robe. It's just a great way to use more of the space of your closet besides the shelves and the rod.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$10 at Amazon Best Closet-Shelf Organizers Jumbo Vinyl Sweater Bags by Richards Homewares, Set of 2\n\n\"If there are sweaters or bulky things you don't wear very often, you can put those into a container. They're kind of like the Ziploc bag of clothing storage; they're zippered, vinyl box, but it's floppy. The company Richards makes a really nice version, and it's great because it's clear, so you can see what's inside it. They've got little rope handles, which makes it easy to pull it off a shelf, and again, because it's soft, it doesn't take up any extra space. If you don't fill it to the brim, you're not going to have any wasted space from the container itself.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$9 at Walmart Best Dresser-Drawer Organizers Lynk Short Shelf Divider in White\n\n\"It's tempting to throw bulky items in a drawer, but one sweater can take up a whole entire drawer. So I definitely recommend storing things that are bulky on shelves. What can help contain them are shelf dividers that clip on to the edge of a shelf, like a bookend, so that keeps things from toppling over.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$7 at Bed Bath and Beyond 4-Inch Dream Drawer Organizers\n\n\"For regular clothing drawers, they make drawer dividers that are on springs, so they adjust to fit your drawer perfectly. Those are great. Again, you can position it exactly where you need it in your drawer so you can divide up socks from underwear, dress socks from gym socks, even keep different types of T-shirt stacks separate. And if you do want to do, which I do recommend, that vertical folding of shirts, it'll keep your stacks together. There's one at the Container Store: the Dream Drawer Divider. It's just plastic, very springy. Be careful when you put it in. But it stays put, which is great.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$16 at The Container Store Underbed Clear Rolling Storage Box\n\n\"Some people like to use underbed storage boxes, some people don't. I understand the whole feng shui of it all, you don't want to interrupt the slumber and have things cluttering up underneath the bed. That being said, sometimes you really don't have the room. And things that are great for underbed boxes are seasonal stuff like bathing suits and shorts. I typically don't do a ton of under-the-bed storage because I try to get people to get rid of stuff, and that's enabling people to keep stuff. But you can do it, I would definitely think of that space more as a garage, it's not really accessible, and it's not for anything you would use often.\" -- Beth Penn, Bneato Bar\n\n$10 at Bed Bath and Beyond Best Shoe Organizers White Mesh Stackable Shoe Shelf\n\n\"Personally, I like to store shoes low down. They're walking around outside on the sidewalk; they're dirty. I don't like them to be up high where dirt falls down onto your clothes or onto your face. I like to use, as much as possible, the floor of the closet, and there are certain shelves from the Container Store. They're stacking mesh shoe shelves, and I love them. It's a very fine mesh, so that you don't have to balance a heel. A lot of shoe shelves are just two rods, so if you've got heels, they can fall through. So it's just really easy to keep your shoes on the shelf. They're big enough for men's shoes, and what's great is they can stack together, so you can build it up as high as you need. They're also high enough for most high heels.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$13 at The Container Store White 4-Shelf Shoe Stacker\n\n\"For me, I do fancier shoes either really high up or in a different space because I don't wear them as often. So I find that a lot of people have shoes like that, that are taking up prime real estate. Maximize the space with shelf-risers. The Container Store has one that I really like that you can add on to, just think vertically when it comes to shoe storage.\" -- Penn\n\n$30 at The Container Store Real Simple Shoe and Boot Organizer\n\n\"What also can be good are these hanging shoe shelves. They're made out of cloth, and it hangs off the closet rod. So if you have a lot of closet-rod space and a lot of shoes, those can work well, too. Again, the shoes aren't totally low down, but the only thing that's beneath them is other shoes, in a vertical column.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$30 at Bed Bath and Beyond Household Essentials Water Hyacinth Wicker Basket With Handles\n\n\"If there's a place in the entryway to put everyday shoes, you can start to free up space in the closet, just because typically, there isn't a lot of room in people's closets for shoes. So trying to get crafty and storing them in other places that make sense. I typically like baskets, especially if you can get away with your shoes not getting damaged, if they're sneakers and things that are okay to live harmoniously together. It's easy to throw them in there.\" -- Penn\n\n$50 at Bed Bath and Beyond GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "Everything I Use to Keep My Glasses Spick-and-Span",
                "body": "My life has gotten seriously better this year, and here's why: I decided to finally take my eye doctor's advice to wear my glasses as much as possible. Wearing glasses that often, though, also means my spectacles are often getting greasy, smudged, and streaked. After purchasing (and discarding) multiple spray cleaners, polishing cloths, storage systems, and gadgets, I've finally hit on the perfect arsenal for keeping my grimy glasses crystal clear (and right where I can find them) all day long.\n\nShield 34108COMB Lens Cleaner Combo\n\nMy eyelashes are constantly brushing up against the lenses of my glasses, causing them to get filthy within an hour of putting them on. After a lot of trial and error, I can report with 100 percent certainty that the very best eyeglass cleaner currently on the market is made by Shield, and is available in a handy two-pack that includes a mini-bottle perfect for stashing in your purse or tote bag.\n\nIt cuts through oil like crazy and leaves zero streaks -- even on lenses with hard-to-clean anti-reflective coatings. While most lens cleaners tend to just smear around the oil, this stuff cuts right through it (and removes it) while still being gentle enough not to scratch the lenses. And even if your glasses don't get smeared and greasy like mine, you should still be cleaning them every few days -- lenses, frames, and all. That cloudy, impossible-to-get-off film that gets on plastic or acetate frames? It's actually the frames breaking down from body oils, hairspray, and environmental grime. This helps mitigate it.\n\n$10 at Amazon $10 at Amazon Campanelli Premium Microfiber Towel Set (40 pieces)\n\nUsing the right lens cleaner is only half the battle -- you've got to use it with the right cloth to really get things spick-and-span. Those tiny, silky squares that come with your glasses are a joke, but these soft, superabsorbent microfiber cloths are a magnet for dust and dirt -- and are large enough to polish your glasses to a shine without touching them with your dirty hands, immediately undoing everything you just accomplished. Used in conjunction with the Shield cleaner, it's a one-two punch that gets even the dirtiest glasses polished and clean. Note: These cloths come in a set of 40, which sounds ridiculous until you stash them all over to clean anything you can think of: your computer screen and keyboard, phone and tablet, even the light-up display in your car. Once they get dirty, toss 'em in the wash and use them until they're threadbare.\n\n$20 at QVC Generic Sonic Wave Ultrasonic Jewelry & Eyeglass Cleaner\n\nUsing old-fashioned elbow grease to get your glasses clean regularly is practically mandatory, but it's also a good idea to give them a whirl in this little glasses-cleaning robot every so often as a low-effort way to get them truly, sparkling clean. The directions say to use plain water, but I've had better luck filling it with a dedicated lens cleaner. The ultrasonic waves get the cleaner into every nook and cranny, vibrating out even stuck-on dirt that has managed to worm its way behind the hinges and screws of your favorite reading glasses or shades.\n\n$29 at Amazon $29 at Amazon Upright Eyeglasses Holder, 2-Pack\n\nI've talked about these fuzzy eyeglass nests before, but it's worth repeating. I learned about these from my grandmother, and now, instead of searching on the floor or somewhere under my pillow to find my glasses when I wake up, they're always right where I put them -- unscratched and unscathed, but most importantly, unsmudged. See, when you aren't half-blindly grabbing your glasses by the lenses to pick them up off your nightstand, they stay cleaner way longer. Since using and loving it, I've bought two more -- one for my office and another for my desk at home. (Though I opted for a subtle, plain leather-esque version for the office.)\n\n$13 at Amazon $13 at Amazon MyGift Deluxe 8 Slot Sunglasses Organizer Box\n\nI don't own just a single pair of glasses -- I have a proper collection of frames that match whatever I happen to be wearing that day, so storing them has become a bit involved. This fabric-lined, eight-slot storage case has a clear window, so you can find what you're looking for at a glance, and the case is flat enough to slide into a drawer or slip underneath a cabinet.\n\n$19 at Amazon $19 at Amazon Nerdwax\n\nI bought this stuff on a whim from my optometrist because my glasses would not stop sliding down my nose as I read in bed, which drove me nuts. It's a tube of beeswax, coconut oil, gum rosin, and peppermint oil that you roll onto the clean nose pads of your glasses, which causes them to stay put on your nose while you read or work. It lasts for at least two hours and wears off naturally by the facial oils your skin produces.\n\n$11 at Amazon $11 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "Peter Peterson, the former secretary of Commerce under Richard Nixon who later co-founded the private-equity firm Blackstone Group, died Tuesday at the age of 91.\n\nThe sun of Greek immigrants, Peterson \"lived a long, wonderful life that embodied the American Dream,\" his family said in a statement.\n\nBorn in Kearney, Nebraska, Peterson landed in Washington in the early '70s as Nixon's assistant for international economic affairs. He was a promoted to Commerce secretary in 1973 and spent a year in the job before leaving to serve as chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers.\n\nAfter turning around the struggling bank, Peterson teamed up with Stephen A. Schwarzman to found Blackstone Group in 1985 with $400,000. By the time the firm went public in 2007, it was managing more than $88 billion. With his retirement the following year, Peterson became billionaire.\n\n\"Pete and I worked together for 35 years,\" Schwarzman, who remains Blackstone's CEO, told Bloomberg Tuesday. \"He was a great partner. We both had no idea when we started Blackstone in 1985 that the firm would grow to this scale and importance. The firm was his pride and joy.\"\n\nAfter leaving Blackstone, Peterson focused on philanthropy and his twin crusades against government debt and for the \"reform\" of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.",

                "title": "The Best Women's Running Clothing, for Every Kind of Weather",
                "body": "I am a year-round runner. Polar vortices and full-on downpours don't deter me. And I'm not even especially crazy: Through trial and error and a stint working in a specialty running store, I've simply built out a running wardrobe that's ready for any weather condition. The right outfit can make bad weather almost irrelevant.\n\nI've done this by organizing my arsenal of gear around temperature, moisture management, and layering. First up: In deciding what to wear, temperature is the most obvious factor to consider. Personally, I warm up very quickly on a run, so I follow a rule of dressing as if it's 20 degrees warmer than it actually is outside. This means I accept feeling cold for the first five minutes of my run as a trade-off to overheating on the first mile of a several-mile run.\n\nNext, you'll want to manage moisture. This includes both the sweat coming off your body and any external moisture like snow or rain. You want to keep your skin as dry as possible to help regulate your temperature. I sweat a lot, so moisture-wicking fabrics -- such as synthetic blends of polyester, nylon, and spandex -- are allies in my war against chafing. If you want to keep it all-natural, choose wool, which actually wicks moisture well, but avoid cotton, which will leave you feeling soaked.\n\nAnd finally, layering. All running outfits are built out of some combination of three types of layers: base layers, to keep sweat away from your skin; middle layers, to insulate you from the cold; and outer layers, to protect against elements like rain, snow, and wind. I might wear all three layers on an ice-cold day with biting winds, but only a base layer on a mild day. But I have tried-and-true combinations for every kind of weather in between, and they are as follows.\n\nHot and sunny weather (65 degrees and up) Lululemon Swiftly Tech Racerback\n\nI've worn Swiftly tank tops on everything from casual jogs to full marathons. They are soft to the touch, lightweight, and sweat-wicking. Since Lululemon releases new colors in this style each season, I like to stalk its sale section for deals on older seasons' colors, like this hot-pink one. I also really like the short-sleeve and long-sleeve versions for when it gets chillier.\n\n$58 at Lululemon Nike Tempo\n\nA true workhorse, these shorts are cheap, come in a bunch of colors, and last forever. I have pairs that are eight years old and they look good as new. The three-inch inseam is the sweet spot for keeping me cool on the hottest days without being so short that they're constantly riding up. With flat seams that glide over skin, they also work to prevent the dreaded inner-thigh chafe.\n\n$20 at Amazon $20 at Amazon Tifosi Jet Wrap Sunglasses\n\nI resisted wearing running sunglasses for a long time, thinking they'd bounce around and annoy me. That all changed when I tried a pair of Tifosi shades. They weigh next to nothing and fit snugly around the temples and nose bridge, so they don't move around at all. On several occasions, I've actually forgotten that I was wearing them. They're also good for winter days when the sun is bouncing off snowy streets.\n\n$35 at Amazon $35 at Amazon Body Glide\n\nI always choose flat-seamed and seamless garments to avoid chafing, but if I run far enough -- especially in hot weather -- I'll need a little something extra to protect my skin. Swiping Body Glide on areas I normally chafe (inner thighs and underarms) works wonders. Vaseline will work in a pinch, but Body Glide is much less greasy.\n\n$10 at Amazon $10 at Amazon Swiftwick Aspire Zero\n\nWhen I worked at the running store, most people didn't believe that running socks were worth more than $10 for a single pair, when you can get a six-pack of cotton socks for the same price or cheaper. And I get it; when I started running, I felt that way, too. But over time, like most of my customers, I realized that speciality socks are worth every penny, for one reason: They prevent blisters. A wet, sweaty sock creates friction and rubs against your foot, leaving you with painful, open blisters. Suck it up and buy socks made of moisture-wicking material, and that won't happen. Plus, some colors are cheaper on Amazon.\n\n$8 at Amazon $8 at Amazon Saucony Triumph ISO 4\n\nThis is actually my shoe for any kind of weather, besides snowy and icy conditions (more on that later), and I've found that I like to have more soft foam underfoot to absorb impact before it gets to my joints. Saucony has been making the Triumph for over a decade. It's always been a favorite among runners who want maximum cushioning, but four years ago Saucony actually revamped it with new technology that cut down on its weight without losing any softness.\n\n$160 at Zappos Mild days (50 degrees to 65 degrees) Nike Dri-Fit Knit Short Sleeve Top\n\nWhen the temperature dips below 60 degrees, or the wind starts to blow, I'll reach for a short-sleeved shirt for more shoulder coverage. I love how soft and breathable this Nike top feels.\n\n$42 at Amazon $42 at Amazon Oiselle Flyte Shorts\n\nThis may be completely psychological, but I think that when it's verging on too cold for shorts, fitted styles like these keep me warmer, since they allow for less airflow than loose ones. I'm also a little obsessed with Oiselle because the brand has female founders who design clothes for women's bodies. In this case, that means perfectly fitting shorts that will never distract you by pinching, sagging, or riding up mid-run.\n\n$29 at Amazon $29 at Amazon Chilly but not cold (40 degrees to 50 degrees) Harrier Long Sleeve\n\nThis is a recent favorite of mine and a good choice if you prefer natural over synthetic fabrics. Made from merino wool, this shirt is so soft and cozy, it makes me excited to go for a run even on days when getting out of bed is a struggle. Tracksmith has a New England prep school kind of aesthetic, so these shirts are also stylish enough to keep on for a post-run errand or a meal.\n\n$78 at Tracksmith Saucony Women's Dash Seamless Long Sleeve\n\nAnother long-sleeve option that's just as soft as a Lululemon Swiftly top.\n\n$10 at Amazon $10 at Amazon Saucony Bullet Capri\n\nThese were very popular at my running store, since the wide waistband and gentle compression make for a smooth and flattering fit for women of all body types. I also like the generously sized back and side pockets for storing my phone, keys, or food packets, for a long run.\n\n$47 at Amazon $47 at Amazon Balega Hidden Comfort\n\nWhen it gets colder, I like socks that are a little thicker and warmer than my Swiftwicks. Balega socks feel truly luxurious, since they have very plush cushioning underfoot. I also love collecting all the fun colors.\n\n$12 at Amazon $12 at Amazon Legitimately cold (30 degrees to 40 degrees) Lululemon Fast As Light 1/2 Zip\n\nOnce it hits 40 degrees, it's finally cold enough for me to add a mid-layer. I think Lululemon does a really good job on its mid-layer tops, because they have features that let you adjust for changing conditions. The built-in mittens fold back if you don't need them, and a half-zip provides adjustable airflow when you're heating up or cooling down. This helps me rationalize spending too much money at Lululemon, since I'll wear this jacket in a wider range of temperatures than one without all the bells and whistles.\n\n$98 at Lululemon C9 Champion ½ Zip Pullover\n\nIf you're testing the waters of cold-weather running and don't want to splurge on Lululemon, I like this well-priced Champion jacket that has similar functionality.\n\n$30 at Target Athleta Stealth Tights\n\nIt's time to swap out the Capris for full-length tights. I'm short, so I appreciate when running tights come in different lengths and then don't need to be hemmed. These tights have a snug fit that feel supportive on my running muscles and come in petite, regular, and tall lengths.\n\n$98 at Gap Old Navy Mid-Rise Compression Run Leggings\n\nFor a cheaper option that also comes in a wide range of lengths and sizes, these Old Navy tights offer a good bang for your buck. Compared to other tights in this price range, these are surprisingly thick and don't stretch out after washing or wearing.\n\n$22 at Old Navy Saucony Ulti-Mitts\n\nConvertible glove-mitten hybrids are awesomely multifunctional. For most of the winter, I'll wear just the liner gloves (with smartphone-friendly fingertips!) until it gets super cold, when I'll flip the mittens over the gloves.\n\n$18 at Amazon $18 at Amazon Below freezing (20 degrees to 30 degrees) Craft Zero Long Sleeve Base Layer\n\nEvery fall, the arrival of the first shipment of Craft base layers generated a palpable level of excitement among my running-store co-workers. This cult favorite lasts forever and will be your staple base layer all winter. The mock turtleneck insulates your neck better than a regular crewneck shirt, and the thermal material is ideal for locking in warmth.\n\n$42 at Jet Sugoi Midzero Tights\n\nIf I could only recommend one product for surviving winter, it would be a pair of these tights. With fleece lining on the inside and a weather-resistant exterior, the Midzero tights make winter running possible.\n\n$80 at Amazon $80 at Amazon Sugoi Midzero Zip Top\n\nPlease be aware that this article is a bit of a Sugoi Midzero lovefest, as I adore the brand's entire range of thermal products. Including this mid-layer that provides next-level warmth.\n\n$58 at Amazon $58 at Amazon Smartwool PhD Run Cold Weather Mid Crew Socks\n\nAlthough I usually wear no-show socks, I like going crew-length in colder weather to close any gap between my tights and my feet. I've made the mistake of not wearing long-enough socks and ended up with a ring of red, wind-bitten skin on each ankle. Since these are wool, they keep my feet and ankles toasty without soaking up sweat.\n\n$21 at Smartwool Smartwool Merino 250 Cuffed Beanie\n\nThe oft-quoted statistic that 50 percent of your body heat escapes from your head has been debunked, but regardless, covering your head is going to keep you warmer on a run. I love how this cap has an additional layer around the brim to keep the wind from wreaking havoc on my ears.\n\n$28 at Smartwool Frigid and forbidding (0 degrees to 20 degrees) Sugoi Speedster 4\n\nA mid-layer with a hood. I'll throw this on over my Craft base layer for ultimate upper-body warmth.\n\n$72 at Sugoi Icebreaker Merino Sprite Hot Pants\n\nCan we discuss butt freeze? If you've ever run in very cold weather, only to come home to a hot shower and have the water burn your ice-cold behind, you know what I'm talking about. Icebreaker's wool underwear is lightweight and breathable, but offers added warmth for my backside, especially when paired with my Midzero tights. If you want to think in layering terms: You're adding underwear as a base layer and your tights are now your mid-layer.\n\n$40 at Amazon $40 at Amazon Smartwool Merino 250 Neck Gaiter\n\nYou're probably sensing a pattern of piling on more and more wool layers as it gets colder. I like this gaiter for keeping my neck warm and making breathing in cold air less painful.\n\n$28 at Smartwool Only lunatics are out running now (Below 0 degrees) Brooks Canopy Jacket\n\nEven though I only whip out my outer layer on very, very cold days, it's still not very thick. That's because I get most of my warmth from my base and mid-layers and rely on the outer layer for protection against strong wind or extremely cold air. The Brooks Canopy jacket is perfect for this because it's lightweight, and can pack inside itself if I heat up later in the run.\n\n$120 at Amazon $120 at Amazon Sugoi Midzero Bun Toaster\n\nJust like the Icebreaker underwear above, these prevent cold butt while providing extra thigh coverage, and are made of my favorite fabric.\n\n$45 at Sugoi Brooks Threshold Pants\n\nIn extreme temperatures, an outer layer over your tights might be necessary. Brooks Threshold pants are a long-time favorite among running-store staffers since they're warm and soft, yet still flexible and stretchy enough for comfortable running.\n\n$77 at Amazon $77 at Amazon Icebreaker Merino Oasis Balaclava\n\nPeople are going to call you crazy for running in this weather anyway, so you might as well embrace the bank-robber-ski-mask look. With nearly full face coverage, this wool balaclava guards against cold air, and warms up the air I'm breathing in before it hits my lungs.\n\n$35 at Amazon $35 at Amazon Rain Saucony Speed Run Cap\n\nIf it's raining but warm out, the only adjustment I'll make to my running outfit is to add a hat to keep rain out of my eyes. This minimal, affordable cap gets the job done.\n\n$25 at Amazon $25 at Amazon Brooks LSD Jacket\n\nI also like to keep my rain jacket simple -- it's essentially just an outer shell to keep the rain from getting through. I love this packable jacket, since it's easy to throw in my bag if I'm traveling for an out-of-town race and am not sure what the weather will be. Fun fact: The LSD in this jacket's name refers not to the psychedelic drug but stands for \"long slow distance,\" runner-speak for those high-mileage runs meant to build endurance and mental toughness.\n\n$50 at Amazon $50 at Amazon Patagonia Houdini\n\nThese tend to go on sale regularly as new colors are introduced.\n\n$160 at Amazon $160 at Amazon Snow and ice Asics Storm Shelter Jacket\n\nThe Storm Shelter jacket may get the least use out of all the pieces in my running closet, but on the rare days when I have to break it out -- think bomb cyclones and blizzard conditions -- it's completely indispensable. Thick and water-resistant, it can handle whatever the skies are serving up. It also has reflective details, so it'll be easier for cars to spot you on predawn runs, or when a storm limits visibility.\n\n$60 at Amazon $60 at Amazon Yaktrax Run Traction Cleats\n\nThe one weather condition I used to refuse to run in was ice. I'm clumsy to begin with, so slippery ground is a recipe for a twisted ankle, skinned knee, or worse. Yaktrax are the only things that give me the confidence to run on ice. Like the snow chains that attach to tires, Yaktrax cleats fit over the bottom of your running shoes for reliable traction on icy grounds.\n\n$33 at Amazon $33 at Amazon Brooks Ghost Gore-Tex Shoes\n\nIf you regularly run on trails or in very icy, slushy, or muddy conditions, it's worth checking to see if your favorite shoe comes in Gore-Tex, the lightweight, waterproof material found in all kinds of outdoor gear. These shoes are more rugged and durable than their standard versions.\n\n$150 at Amazon $150 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "I just went live a minute ago. Here's what I said:\n\nRecently, many of you in the community have expressed concerns over [INCIDENT]. Some of you don't think that Facebook and the users who rely on our platform should be able to [PRIVACY-RELATED VERB]. Let me say this: We hear you.\n\nAt its best, Facebook has always been about forging connections between you and your friends and third-party data brokers. Facebook is powered by data. In a sense, Facebook is powered by you: the community.\n\nI'd like to clear up how Facebook works and what we do in service of building global community. Some have said that this most recent incident, which we knew about [WHEN WE ACTUALLY KNEW], is \"[PHRASING WE DON'T LIKE].\" I want to be clear: It is not. This happened in accordance with Facebook's official policies, and so by definition, it was not wrong to do, and in fact the right thing for us to do. Also, we changed those policies, but not because they were wrong.\n\nOur community of millions of developers is one of the most important communities I can think of, and I know a lot of communities.\n\nThis is a difficult problem to solve for many reasons. When I traveled the country last year, speaking with working Americans, and angling myself to look taller than most of them in photos, I learned that some were concerned with [ISSUE]. Others told me that they wanted to see [OPPOSITE SIDE OF DIFFERENT ISSUE]. Facebook should be a platform for all ideas, whether that's securing data or not securing it. Facebook is about giving everyone the power to share their experience, as well as age, city of birth, alma mater, and favorite Jersey Shore cast member. You can't spell community without common, almost.\n\nAt Facebook, we feel a responsibility to make sure our services are fun to use, and that you think using Facebook is time well spent. I'll admit that [INCIDENT] did not help us live up to our values of [TRUST | COMMUNITY | CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE -- CHOOSE ONE]. The most important thing Facebook can do is help us connect with each other and brands. Facebook has always been about bringing people together, both on our own servers and many others we don't even know about. As I learned on my travels last year, community is [USE DOWN-HOME PHRASE MEANING \"IMPORTANT\" HERE] to us at Facebook.\n\nStill, we know we can do better. Today, I want to share the steps we're taking to [THING YOU ASSUMED WE WERE DOING ALL ALONG]:\n\n(1) We're going to think really hard. This is probably the toughest part of my job, but I take it very seriously. There will be a lot of brainstorms and writing on glass this year.\n\n(2) We will call [PEOPLE WHO USE OUR PLATFORM AS INTENDED] and ask them if they are behaving themselves. If they say yes, we will ask, \"Are you sure?\" and if they say yes again, we will say \"Promise?\" This approach is key to maintaining fairness on the platform for all ideas.\n\n(3) We will not notify any user who was affected by [THE PEOPLE WHO USE OUR PLATFORM AS INTENDED].\n\nNow, I wish I could tell you we're going to be able to stop all [BAD THING], but that wouldn't be realistic. There will always be not-so-good people in the world, and pobody's nerfect. But we can make it harder for [PEOPLE WHO USE OUR PLATFORM AS INTENDED] to [ACT THAT USES PLATFORM AS INTENDED]. Maybe we will do this. In the end, it all comes down to the community.\n\nPrevious uses of this apology format: \"Oops, I dismissed concerns of election interference\"; \"Let's hear Peter Thiel out\"",

                "body": "The calendar may say spring, but the sidewalks say the relentless winter of 2018 is still here.\n\nFor the fourth time in three weeks, a nor'easter is bearing down on New York City. Schools are closed and thousands of flights have been canceled in anticipation of as much as 18 inches of snow falling. If the forecast holds, the city will be looking at its largest-ever springtime snowfall, a record currently held by the 11.8 inches that fell on March 21, 1958.\n\nWednesday's snowfall is expected to peak in the afternoon, when as much as three inches could fall each hour. The heavy, wet snow, along with the wind gusts and coastal flooding that are expected to come with it, could cause widespread power outages, the National Weather Service is warning.\n\nConditions aren't much better farther south, where both Philadelphia and the District of Columbia have also canceled school. The White House on Wednesday canceled all public events due to the incoming storm, which points toward a busy day of \"executive time\" for President Trump.\n\nLike New York, D.C. is unaccustomed to this type of weather so far into the year. As CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller said, \"It's been 75 years since Washington has had five inches of snowfall or greater this late in the season.\"\n\nThose looking for an explanation for this spring time nor'easter may find answers in the latest issue of Nature Communications. Earlier this month, the journal published a study from Atmospheric and Environmental Research and Rutgers University that linked warmer ocean temperatures to heavy snowfall in the Northeast.\n\n\"Five of the past six winters have brought persistent cold to the eastern U.S. and warm, dry conditions to the West, while the Arctic has been off-the-charts warm,\" Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers professor and one of the study's co-authors, told CNN.\n\n\"Our study suggests that this is no coincidence. Exactly how much the Arctic contributed to the severity or persistence of the pattern is still hard to pin down, but it's becoming very difficult to believe they are unrelated.\"\n\nThat's not the only factor, though. Mayor Bill de Blasio placed some blame on his rodent nemesis, the groundhog, for the springtime storm.\n\n\"It is the first day of spring officially and yet I'm about to tell you about a big snowstorm that's hitting,\" he said Tuesday. \"This proves what I've said for a long time -- never trust groundhogs. They will always lead you wrong.\"",

                "title": "Donald Trump Has Never Been More Dangerous Than He Is Now",
                "body": "From one angle, it's been a comforting few weeks for those of us who fear and loathe the Trump presidency. Since early February, public support for the president and his party has declined significantly -- erasing the polling gains that both had made at the start of this year. Meanwhile, Democrats have continued to over-perform in special elections, scoring their most impressive victory yet last week, when Conor Lamb bested a better-funded Republican opponent in a Pennsylvania district that had gone for Trump by 20 points. Signs suggest that the GOP's House majority won't survive the winter -- and that our reality star-in-chief is unlikely to be brought back for a second season.\n\nFor progressives, the case for optimism about Trump's tenure has always gone something like: If he doesn't get us all killed, the demagogue might just rejuvenate the Democratic base, poison the GOP's brand, trigger big \"blue\" wave elections in 2018 and 2020, and thus, ironically, leave U.S. politics in a better place than it had been in circa 2016.\n\nOver the past month, each piece of this scenario has begun to seem a tad more likely -- except, that is, for the \"doesn't get us all killed\" bit.\n\nOf course, Donald Trump is (almost certainly) not going to literally end all human life. But in recent weeks, many of the downside risks of his election -- a mass-casualty war, irreparable diplomatic blunder, or constitutional crisis -- have become more plausible than ever before. Assuming we avoid total catastrophe, America is poised to make a speedy recovery from its ill-advised experiment with kakistocracy. But there are (at least) four reasons why that assumption has never been less safe:\n\n1) The \"adults\" in the West Wing have never had less influence over the president.\n\nThe most harrowing development in presidential politics over the past month (the one that exacerbates all of the others) is that Donald Trump finally lost his humility. That may sound absurd, like saying Trump \"finally\" lost his tail, or some other appendage that the president was clearly born without, or else separated from in early childhood.\n\nBut the reality is that, until recently, Trump approached his duties with a modicum of modesty. Awed by the awesome responsibilities of his new office, Trump spent much of last year deferring to the expertise of his advisers. He let the Republican Establishment dictate his legislative agenda and most of his Cabinet, and allowed the putative \"adults\" in the West Wing to overrule his instincts on the Iran deal, trade policy, and a variety of other matters. Of course, this forbearance was never strong enough to prevent the man from firing off incendiary tweets, praising white nationalists, canceling climate deals, or obstructing a little justice. But it was, nevertheless, sufficient to prevent Trump from translating his most belligerent rhetoric about foreign policy and the Mueller investigation into action.\n\nNow, however, Trump has finally shaken off his first-year jitters -- and is ready to appoint himself the \"adult\" in every room. As the New York Times reports:\n\nA dozen people close to Mr. Trump or the White House, including current and former aides and longtime friends, described him as newly emboldened to say what he really feels and to ignore the cautions of those around him.\n\n... [I]n his first year in the White House, according to his friends, he found himself feeling tentative and anxious, intimidated by the role of president, a fact that he never openly admitted but that they could sense, people close to the president said ... They say Mr. Trump now feels he doesn't need the expertise of Mr. Kelly, Mr. Cohn or Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil executive he made secretary of state. If he once suspected they were smarter or better equipped to lead the country and protect his presidency, he doesn't believe that now.\n\nThe president's new mind-set is readily apparent. Over the past two weeks, Trump has unilaterally announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States; ousted the \"globalist\" director of his National Economic Council; agreed to an unprecedented face-to-face meeting with the leader of North Korea; fired his secretary of State over Twitter; orchestrated the (politically motivated) firing of deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe; and disparaged Robert Mueller's investigation -- by name -- for the first time ever. In most, if not all, of these cases, the president either acted over the objections of senior advisers, or without bothering to consult them at all.\n\nThe election of an emotionally volatile reality star -- with authoritarian instincts, an insatiable ego, a capacious ignorance of American civics and geopolitics, and an implacable aversion to reading multi-page documents -- led many a commentator to seek solace in the thought that Trump wouldn't really be in charge. Precisely because he was so ignorant of -- and uninterested in -- governance, the new president would delegate critical decisions to his team of decorated generals, veteran GOP operatives, and corporate titans. He would handle the tweets, speeches, and petty graft; they'd handle the policy.\n\nTrump's first 14 months produced plenty of evidence to support this hypothesis. But the past few weeks have fatally undermined it. The White House isn't preparing for face-to-face talks with North Korea because James Mattis decided that was a good idea; or drafting $60 billion worth of tariffs against China because that's what the GOP Establishment wanted. These things are happening solely because Trump decided to make them happen. That maniac on Twitter really is the president of the United States. And as more and more \"adults\" exit the West Wing -- and it becomes more and more difficult to find normal, competent people willing to take their places -- the chances of a return to last year's \"normalcy\" grow ever more remote.\n\n2) Trump's path to a war with North Korea has never been easier to envision.\n\nThe fact that Donald Trump's gut instincts are now governing the White House would be alarming in just about any context. But in the present one, it is especially so.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Trump accepted (on a whim) Kim Jong-un's invitation for a face-to-face meeting. At first, criticism of this decision focused on the prospect that our prodigiously ignorant, easily flattered commander-in-chief would get suckered into a lopsided peace deal. But Victor Cha -- Trump's tentative pick for ambassador to South Korea, who (reportedly) lost that gig for his off-putting opposition to a preemptive strike on Pyongyang -- highlighted a more ominous possibility in an op-ed for the New York Times:\n\nEveryone should be aware that this dramatic act of diplomacy by these two unusual leaders, who love flair and drama, may also take us closer to war. Failed negotiations at the summit level leave all parties with no other recourse for diplomacy. In which case, as Mr. Trump has said, we really will have \"run out of road\" on North Korea.\n\nThe likelihood of this nightmare scenario increased significantly, last week, when Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and (reportedly) began seriously considering making John Bolton his next national security adviser.\n\nFor his many, many faults, Tillerson was nevertheless one of the administration's staunchest defenders of the Iran nuclear agreement -- and among its most ardent opponents of a belligerent approach to North Korea. By contrast, his replacement -- outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo -- was the only senior White House official who encouraged Trump to decertify the Iran deal, even as his colleagues in the intelligence agencies affirmed Tehran's compliance with the agreement.\n\nTrump's summit with Kim is tentatively scheduled for May. That same month, the president will need to either reaffirm Iran's compliance with the agreement -- or else withdraw the United States from the deal. The president (reportedly) told Benjamin Netanyahu that he intends to pick door No.2. Pompeo's promotion increases the probability that Trump will keep that pledge. And if the president does, in fact, reaffirm the emptiness of America's promises to rogue regimes - right before sitting down across from Kim - then North Korea would have to be an irrational actor to take him up on any denuclearization deal.\n\nIt is true that, to this point, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster have kept Trump from blowing up the Iran agreement. And the fact that nullifying that deal would compromise diplomatic efforts with North Korea surely won't escape those officials.\n\nBut Mattis lost the internal fight over tariffs, and also, presumably, over Tillerson. Meanwhile, McMaster may be on his way out of the administration -- and one of the top candidates to replace him is an Iran hawk who is publicly rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to fail.\n\n\"How do you know the North Koreans are lying? Because their lips are moving,\" John Bolton explained to Fox News last week. The former U.N. ambassador went on to argue that Trump's meeting with Kim Jong-un was a positive development -- because, as Cha had warned, it could accelerate the breakdown of diplomacy and the onset of military action to combat the North Korean threat. (A recent Pentagon simulation projected that a nonnuclear war between the United States and North Korea would come with a daily death toll of 20,000 in South Korea.)\n\nIf recent rumors prove true, Bolton will be the highest-ranking national-security official in the White House come May.\n\n3) Trump has never had a stronger incentive to undermine rule of law in the United States.\n\nIn recent weeks, the special counsel has subpoenaed documents from the Trump Organization, sought an interview with the president himself, secured the cooperation of various Trump campaign aides and associates, and scrutinized the business dealings of the president's son-in-law.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump has displayed an aversion to the concept of \"rule of law.\" He has argued repeatedly that he believes the Justice Department's first responsibility is to protect him from legal harm. Now, he has more cause for indulging this authoritarian impulse than ever before.\n\nAnd indulging it, he is. Late Friday night, Jeff Sessions fired Andrew McCabe -- just 26 hours before the G-man was set to qualify for his pension. McCabe immediately alleged that he'd been fired for crass political reasons -- Trump was trying to discredit him as part of a broader attempt to obstruct and delegitimize the special counsel's investigation. Trump promptly confirmed this charge. In a tweet celebrating McCabe's firing, the president did not refer to any findings from the inspector general's report that had officially triggered the deputy FBI director's ouster, opting instead to denounce McCabe for his ties to James Comey, and complicity in \"the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\"\n\nThe president proceeded to publicly assail the Mueller probe, arguing that it was launched on the basis of a \"Fake Dossier\" (which is indisputably untrue) and that the investigative team leading it includes \"Zero Republicans\" (Robert Mueller is a Republican). Meanwhile, one of Trump's lawyers called for the investigation to be shut down.\n\nUltimately, these attacks are less alarming for their immediate effects, than for the signal that they send to the rest of federal law enforcement. Andrew McCabe is going to be fine. He has a range of options for recovering his pension, and (surely) for selling his tell-all book. And, as of this writing, the Mueller probe is still alive and kicking -- in no small part because shutting down the investigation would be enormously difficult and costly for the president. Beyond the complex series of personnel changes required to dispatch Mueller and his team, the high-profile nature of the investigation ensures that its untimely death would result in a blizzard of politically damaging leaks.\n\nStill, as Vox's Matt Yglesias writes:\n\nPart of the normal scandal aversion of a normal administration is that middle managers in the federal bureaucracy who sincerely support the president will try not to create a scandal. So it's not just that Obama would not personally reach down into an investigation and meddle for political purposes, but a passionate Obama fan who also happens to run an Environmental Protection Agency field office wouldn't do it either. The top leadership sets a tone, and while the tone isn't universally followed, it does exert a big influence on people's practical behavior.\n\nTrump, by contrast, has sent a clear signal in the opposite direction -- he wants federal public servants, up to and including FBI special agents, to act like they are his personal employees.\n\nThat doesn't mean they'll all do it -- most of them won't. But some of them will. The actual political appointees at every agency know what's expected of them, and to the extent that there are ambitious and career-minded Trump fans scattered throughout the government -- which is surely the case at the federal police agencies, if not the regulatory ones -- they know that excessive service of Trump's personal interests will be rewarded rather than punished.\n\nIf Donald Trump really puts his mind to weaponizing federal agencies, he could inflict a tremendous amount of damage on our democracy. Thanks to the the War on Terror (and Barack Obama), Trump has inherited the legal authority to indefinitely detain anyone his administration deems a suspected terrorist or to assassinate Americans overseas without trial -- and the technological wherewithal to spy on his political enemies, should he find or cultivate friendly renegades within the intelligence community. Separately, his administration's responsibilities for administering the 2020 census and safeguarding the security of our elections provide significant opportunities for undermining democratic rule, should Trump and his allies become more adept at corrupting the federal bureaucracy.\n\nTo this point, the strongest protection against such nightmare scenarios has been Trump's dearth of ambition. No one ever became a successful dictator by watching eight hours of cable news each day, and taking a golf vacation nearly every weekend. But the Mueller probe is forcing the president (and his advisers) to think deeply about how the \"deep state\" can be co-opted. And as Trump has grown more self-confident, he's begun tackling that problem with more energy and creativity.\n\nIt remains difficult to believe that Trump has the wherewithal to outmaneuver senior civil servants throughout the Executive branch. But it's a bit less difficult now than it was a few weeks ago; and it's quite easy to imagine that the Democratic Party's 2020 nominee will campaign while under some form of federal investigation.\n\n4) It's never been clearer that Congressional Republicans are unwilling to act as a check on Trump's worst impulses.\n\nCongressional Republicans have been abetting Trump's corruption from the earliest days of his administration. But at various points in the president's first year, GOP lawmakers signaled that there was an outer limit to their sycophancy. Last summer, as Trump publicly berated his attorney general for recusing himself from the FBI's Russia investigation, Mitch McConnell kept the Senate formally in session through its August vacation to prevent the president from unilaterally replacing Jeff Sessions through a recess appointment. That same month, North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis spearheaded a Senate bill designed to immunize Mueller's probe against a White House attack.\n\nAt the time, some pundits took these moves as a sign that Republicans would turn more forcefully against the president once they'd secured their tax cuts and/or, once his atrocious approval ratings began weighing on the party's 2018 prospects.\n\nBut the very opposite happened.\n\nIn recent weeks, as Democrats racked up improbable special-election victories, and the White House's scandals continued to metastasize, Republicans grew even more craven in their fealty to the president. The House Intelligence Committee progressed from shielding the president from federal investigators to attacking those investigators on his behalf: In February, the committee's Republicans released a memo, which purported to demonstrate that the FBI had used opposition research funded by Hillary Clinton to obtain a surveillance warrant of Trump aide Carter Page, one month before the 2016 election -- without disclosing the political motivations behind said research to the relevant authorities. Republican lawmakers hyped these and related claims, with Senator Ron Johnson going so far as to announce that a \"secret society\" of anti-Trump Democrats was fomenting \"corruption of the highest levels of the FBI.\"\n\nBut Nunes's memo did not actually demonstrate anything of that kind, while its most concrete allegations of FBI malfeasance were subsequently proven false. And yet, four GOP senators nevertheless asked the Justice Department last week to appoint a second special counsel to investigate the FBI's investigation into Russia.\n\nMore remarkably, Republicans aren't just abetting Trump's attacks on the rule of law -- they're even acquiescing to his assaults on their donors' economic interests: After Trump unveiled his steel tariffs earlier this month, Arizona senator Jeff Flake put together legislation nullifying the president's authority to take such trade actions without congressional consent -- and the Senate GOP leadership promptly disavowed the measure.\n\nSome pundits retain hope that the congressional GOP has a breaking point -- that, should Trump cross a certain line, Republicans would suddenly find it in their political interest to distance themselves from him. This may be the case. But there's reason to think that the incentive for Republican lawmakers to stick by Trump is actually growing stronger as his administration becomes more scandal-ridden.\n\nIn an era of hyperpolarization, most midterm elections are won or lost on turnout. Which means that, the more energized the other side's base becomes, the more critical it is for you to retain the enthusiasm of your core constituency. We first glimpsed the perverse incentives that this dynamic can create last spring, when some moderate Republicans in the House voted for a deeply unpopular health-care bill precisely because it generated such passionate opposition. As Politico reported, \"As GOP leaders scrambled to bring the last holdouts aboard in recent days, they made the argument that the liberal base is already on fire ... That means Republicans could ill afford to fall short on their health-care promise and risk depressing their own turnout.\"\n\nRepublican strategists are now using this exact same argument to caution GOP lawmakers against distancing themselves from Trump. And, in this case, they're almost certainly right.\n\nMatters might be different had Republicans spent the past 14 months passing popular legislation and building a base of support independent from Trump's. But they did no such thing. GOP voters have a far higher regard for the president than for Paul Ryan's agenda. The number of Americans who passionately support slashing Medicaid and taxes on the rich but despise Donald Trump is minuscule. Thus, in the most if not all of their (heavily gerrymandered) House districts, GOP incumbents have more to lose from angering Trump voters than alienating anti-Trump independents -- and this very well might remain the case, when and if the president shoots someone dead in the middle of Fifth Avenue.\n\nThis all illustrates the enormous stakes of November's elections. A Democratic House would have the power to subject the Trump administration to vigorous oversight, and, thus, serve as the kind of check on Executive corruption that our constitutional framework intended for Congress to be. By contrast, the survival of the GOP's majority could embolden Trump to indulge his most destructive and authoritarian instincts more wantonly. As of this writing, Democrats lead the 2018 generic ballot by 9.5 percent in FiveThirtyEight's polls of polls; by some estimates, Team Blue will need to win the popular vote by at least 8 percent to overcome Republican gerrymandering and secure a House majority.\n\nAll of which is to say: For progressives, there's rarely been more cause to hope for the best from this presidency; nor more reason to prepare for the worst.",

                "title": "Baseball's Very Tepid Offseason Is Finally Over",
                "body": "Kenny Williams had a fruitful six-year Major League Baseball playing career as a journeyman before, at the age of 27, starting as a scout for the Chicago White Sox, the team that had drafted him in 1982. Over the next 25 years, he worked his way up to general manager and constructed a team, the 2005 White Sox, that won the World Series -- ending one of the longest curses in baseball, almost as long as the one the Cubs would break in 2016.\n\nBut to a large number of baseball fans and connoisseurs of literary nonfiction best sellers, not to mention (and this is key) hundreds of people who currently work in baseball front offices, Williams isn't any of those things. In their eyes, Kenny Williams is a chump. Specifically, the chump whom writer Michael Lewis, in his still massively influential 2003 book, Moneyball, portrayed as a useful idiot being duped by Oakland A's Master Strategist Billy Beane into making what Lewis called a \"fucking A\" trade. (The trade was complicated, but Lewis basically paints second baseman Ray Durham as one of the most vital assets in the game, and Williams as the idiot who didn't appreciate him.) The movie's irresistible narrative of underdog disruption of a flabby, lazy system cast Beane as the insurgent and Williams as the Establishment, the new guard taking advantage of the clueless old one. Never mind that, 15 years out, it sort of looks like Williams won the trades Lewis wrote about. The message was clear: Moneyball was the vanguard, the future.\n\nThat future is here, though. For two decades, there have been old-school baseball guys to serve as foils for the math nerds and Harvard Business kids bum-rushing the sport. But all general managers are smart now, and they're all smart in the same way. The nerds have taken over. Which means there are no more marks for them to exploit.\n\nThat fact is the reason that Major League Baseball, now approaching its opening day, just had the strangest off-season in recent memory. For the first time that anyone can remember, baseball's hot-stove season just ... never warmed up. Top free agents like Jake Arrieta, Yu Darvish, J. D. Martinez, and Eric Hosmer spent most of their winters waiting for huge offers that never came: Arrieta reportedly told teammates that he'd be signing a six-year, $200 million deal for 2018; ultimately he agreed to a three-year, $75 million contract with the Phillies well after he should have reported for spring training (typically, rosters are mostly set by Christmas). And agent Scott Boras, who has essentially single-handedly run baseball's off-season for two decades, had to watch as clients like Mike Moustakas parlayed their career years into one-year deals worth many millions less than they were expecting. (Moustakas, 29, who broke the Kansas City Royals' franchise record last year with 38 home runs, was rewarded in his free-agent walk year with a Royals salary smaller than last year's.)\n\nSo what happened? Many in baseball -- including Boras and other agents -- have hinted that baseball front offices are colluding, to use the dreaded, Voldemort-esque word from baseball's past, to artificially deflate the market in order to keep salaries down. These suggestions have been echoed, much more loudly, by fans frustrated by inactive owners. And one can understand the concern: The average team payroll in MLB in 2018 is $128.6 million, down nearly $25 million from last season despite reported record financial windfalls throughout the game. (It's worth noting that the average payroll will likely go up when the season begins, but not enough to account for $25 million.)\n\nBut the answer is not as simple, or as sinister, as collusion. Part of it is a weak free-agent crop: There are roughly half a dozen free agents coming next winter who are better than the best free agent this year, and many teams claim to be saving up to spend then. Part of it is the way the tactics employed by Boras -- who represents many of the straggler free agents and often holds them out as long as possible, usually to great effect -- backfired when no robust market materialized for his clients. And part of it is the success of the Astros and the Cubs, who put together extended \"rebuilds\" and were rewarded with championships, thus encouraging other franchises to copy them. But the real reason is the lack of a metaphorical Kenny Williams. After decades of fans and smart commentators lamenting the shortsightedness and poor judgment of executives, GMs are finally too smart to sign dumb contracts. Unfortunately for people like Boras -- and Moustakas -- thanks to the structure of baseball's labor agreement, just about all free-agent contracts are dumb, at least at the size players and their agents have grown to expect. As we now know, most of a player's productive value comes in the first six years of his career, when the collective-bargaining agreement dramatically limits how much money he can make. The Cardinals' Tommy Pham, for example, who was one of the best players in baseball last year, just turned 30 and has earned $1.6 million total since 2006 -- just a little more than, say, an NYPD police sergeant would have made in that time.\n\nWhen a player is finally in a position to sell himself on the market, he's often already in decline. Which is how it came to pass that of the 25 highest-paid players in baseball last season -- all of whom were, at one point, high-dollar free agents -- almost one-third weren't even average ballplayers. The worst player in baseball last year, according to FanGraphs, was Albert Pujols, who made $26 million -- and is still under contract for four more seasons, for which he will be paid nearly $115 million.\n\nBut an entire industry realizing there's a better way to do business isn't collusion in the same way that car manufacturers all realizing the value of automation wasn't collusion: It might not be great for the worker -- and we can all agree that more money should go to the people who play the games than the people who sit in luxury boxes watching them play, yes? -- but it's hardly some grand conspiracy.\n\nOf course, that doesn't make it fair. But this is a system that was collectively bargained by a players' union that has, in recent years, valued the comfort of veterans and retired players above what might be just for younger players, often minor leaguers who aren't even in the union yet. If you force teams to pay more for older players, you are asking them to find ways to avoid using them; if you force them to pay younger players less, you are asking them to value them more.\n\nIt's simple efficiency.\n\nAnd efficiency is, as always, the operative term. The key misunderstanding of sabermetrics was that it was about a specific statistic -- on-base percentage. But what it has always really been about is finding value wherever you can. When most executives were backward in their thinking, you could find value in acquiring players they didn't appreciate. Now that those opportunities have dried up, you don't need to exploit other owners to find value; you can just exploit the system.\n\nSo how long can that system, being exploited in this way, last? These conflicts, and this winter of ill will between both sides of the labor divide, may end up forcing the sport into a bit of a labor reckoning when the current collective-bargaining agreement expires after the 2021 season. And the chance of real conflict seems high: The temperature of discourse between the sides is higher than it has been since the 1995 season, the last time MLB lost games to labor disputes. (That remains the longest ongoing run of labor peace of all four major North American professional sports.) But 2021 is a long way away, and there is still a massive winter free-agency period coming next year, with Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, Clayton Kershaw, and Josh Donaldson for sale. Money will surely be spent on all of them -- lots of it. But it won't be spent nearly as dumbly, not anymore. Sabermetrics and Moneyball always argued for baseball front offices to get smarter. Now they have. This is, for better or worse, what happens when they do.\n\n*This article appears in the March 19, 2018, issue of New York Magazine. Subscribe Now!",

                "title": "Austin Goodwill Blast Not Related to String of Bombings",
                "body": "For the past three weeks Austin, Texas has been terrorized by a series of bombings that left two people dead and five people wounded. Initially it seemed the attacks might be racially motivated, but the latest incidents appeared more random - and suggested that the serial bomber is changing his or her tactics. The first three attacks involved cardboard packages that were left on the victims' doorsteps, but on Sunday two men were injured when they triggered a tripwire left on the side of the road, which was rigged to a device partially hidden by a for-sale sign. Then on Tuesday a package addressed to Austin exploded at a FedEx distribution center in Schertz, Texas, and the first unexploded package bomb was discovered at a FedEx facility near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.\n\nOn Tuesday night, it seemed the bomber might be changing their methods yet again when an explosion was reported at a Goodwill store in the southern part of the city. One man in his 30s was injured and a nearby grocery store and shopping center were evacuated.\n\nHowever, police insisted the incident wasn't related to previous bombings, and hours later they revealed that it was caused by an artillery simulator, not a package bomb. Ely Reyes, Austin's assistant police chief, said Goodwill employees determined that the device, which is sometimes used in military training, wasn't appropriate for donation, and accidentally set it off while trying to dispose of it.\n\nReyes said the box contained \"two small devices that were artillery simulators that looks like some type of military ordnance or some type of memento. The employee handled one of those devices at which time it initiated.\"\n\n\"After our investigation on scene, we did determine that this was not an explosive device,\" he continued. \"This incident is not related to any of the other incidents that we've had here in Austin.\"\n\nThe injured employee was treated and released from the hospital on Tuesday night.\n\nNBC News reports that hundreds of federal agents are reviewing surveillance video from a FedEx store in Sunset Valley, an Austin suburb, where the fifth and sixth bombs were shipped. The FBI has also dispatched top cellphone tower experts to attempt to identify any users who were present at each site.\n\nExperts told the Washington Post that it's unusual for a serial bomber to launch attacks this close together, and Mary Ellen O'Toole, a former FBI profiler, said the compressed timeframe may help investigators.\n\n\"When you see a serial offender increase their activity, he's bound to make mistakes -- and in his case a mistake could cost him fingers, it could kill him, or he could just become sloppy because he's so excited about what he's doing,\" she said. \"The motivation has probably evolved over the last two weeks. Now he's probably enjoying all of the attention and the feeling of ­omnipotence he has creating so much concern and fear.\"",

                "title": "8 Reasons Trump Ignored 'DON'T CONGRATULATE' Putin Advice",
                "body": "After Russian President Vladimir Putin surprised absolutely no one by winning reelection on Sunday, the White House said there were no plans to congratulate him on the victory (which involved reports of ballot-stuffing and his biggest rival being barred from the ballot). Yet just one day later, President Trump kicked off what he described as a \"very good call\" with Putin by commending him on his election win.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump did this despite his national security advisers inserting a warning in his briefing materials, written all-capital letters: \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE.\" Trump also ignored instructions to condemn the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, which runs the risk of further angering London officials, who want their allies to denounce the attack. Trump mentioned to reporters that he and Putin will \"probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future,\" though White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said nothing is planned.\n\nTrump's move drew sharp criticism from Senator John McCain, and the many other Twitter users who suspect there might be something fishy about his relationship with Russia.\n\nBut that's just one explanation for Trump's decision to congratulate Putin. Here are some other possibilities.\n\nTrump Didn't Bother to Read His Notes\n\nSeveral officials told the Post that they provided Trump with talking points written on handwritten notecards for his chat with Putin, as is customary for calls with foreign leaders. They noted that rather than ignoring their advice, it's possible Trump never read it.\n\nTwo people familiar with the notecards acknowledged that they included instructions not to congratulate Putin. But a senior White House official emphasized that national security adviser H.R. McMaster did not mention the issue during a telephone briefing with the president, who was in the White House residence ahead of and during his conversation with Putin.\n\nIt was not clear whether Trump read the notes, administration officials said.\n\nTrump Has Given Up on the Written Word Altogether\n\nLast month the Post reported that even bullet point and picture-filled briefing documents were proving too much for Trump, so he's \"opted to rely on an oral briefing of select intelligence issues.\" That may explain one official's odd claim that while the Putin notecards exist, Trump was only briefed verbally. Per the New York Times:\n\nA second official, however, said that while Mr. Trump's briefing cards did contain those suggestions, he spoke to his aides by phone and never saw the cards.\n\nWhy Should Trump Trust His Disloyal National Security Advisers Anyway?\n\nJust because a staffer writes \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE\" on a card doesn't mean the president has to take that advice - and going forward, Trump will probably be even less likely to do so.\n\nRussia's Election May Have Been a Sham, But We Don't Have to Be Rude About It\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders noted that the Trump administration just imposed sanctions on Russia for U.S. election meddling and cyber attacks, and joined France and Germany in formally condemning the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. She painted Trump's decision to take a friendlier stance in his personal interactions with Putin as a strategic choice.\n\n\"We've been very clear in the actions that we've taken that we're going to be tough on Russia, particularly when it comes to areas that we feel where they've stepped out of place,\" Sanders said. \"We've placed tough sanctions on Russia and a number of other things where we have shown exactly what our position is.\"\n\nShe emphasized, however, that Trump is determined to establish a working relationship with Putin to tackle global challenges, including confronting North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\n\nWho Are We to Criticize Another Country's Election?\n\nWhen asked if the Trump administration thinks Russia's election was \"free and fair,\" Sanders said the White House is focused on U.S. elections.\n\n\"We don't get to dictate how other countries operate,\" Sanders responded. \"What we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country, and that's not something that we can dictate to them, how they operate. We can only focus on the freeness and fairness of elections in our country.\"\n\nBut, to be clear, the investigation into what went down during the 2016 U.S. presidential election is totally bogus. Per the Times:\n\nEchoing the president, [Sanders] went on to rail against the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\n\"To pretend like going through this absurd process for over a year would not bring frustration seems a little bit ridiculous,\" she said.\n\nAll the Other Countries Are Doing It\n\nSanders noted that other foreign leaders, like French President Emannuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, congratulated Putin too. That's technically true, but those calls sound far more awkward. Macron pressed Putin on Skripal's poisoning, and only wished success \"to Russia and the Russian people,\" rather than Putin personally. Merkel's office said she told Putin: \"Today, it is more important than ever to continue the dialogue with one another and to foster relations between our states and peoples.\"\n\nWould You Believe That This Is All Obama's Fault?\n\nMany pointed out that Barack Obama congratulated Putin on his 2012 election victory, accusing those upset by Trump's friendly call of hypocrisy. Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow at the time, said there was much internal debate about how to handle the situation, and Obama eventually went with a carefully worded statement that did not commended Russians, but not Putin. Per the Times:\n\nAfter that election, the State Department issued a statement in which it said, \"The United States congratulates the Russian people on the completion of the presidential elections, and looks forward to working with the president-elect after the results are certified and he is sworn in.\"\n\nThe language, Mr. McFaul said, was carefully chosen to applaud the Russian people for voting without praising Mr. Putin for winning. The statement also noted the reservations of outside observers about the \"partisan use of government resources, and procedural irregularities on Election Day,\" though it credited the Russian authorities for reforms after a widely criticized parliamentary election the previous December.\n\nCompared to Trump's Other Dictator Pals, Is Putin Really So Terrible?\n\nSure, congratulating Putin's election win is bad, but it's not, like, \"congratulating Rodrigo Duterte on a dubious drug war that's killed thousands\"-level bad.\n\nBut Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, appeared less concerned, noting that Trump has also offered congratulations to other leaders of more totalitarian states. \"I wouldn't read much into it,\" Corker said.",

                "title": "Incumbents and Big Spenders Win Illinois Primary - By a Hair",
                "body": "Tuesday's Illinois primary offered one marquee congressional race that matched an old-fashioned Chicago machine pol against someone who better reflected the wave of the Democratic present and future. It also featured gubernatorial primaries in both parties, where two of the biggest spenders in the country faced energetic underdogs.\n\nThough there was considerable suspense in the early counting, it looks like the old-school Chicago Democrat, Representative Dan Lipinski, defeated progressive business consultant Marie Newman by an eyelash in the state's 3rd Congressional District. Both candidates had some outside help from organizations on both sides of the abortion issue, though the incumbent may have benefited more from crossover voting by anti-abortion activists in this open primary state. Republicans in the 3rd District have the embarrassment of going into the general election with an open racist and Holocaust-denier, Art Jones, carrying their banner. Jones ran unopposed in the GOP primary.\n\nOn the Democratic side of the insanely expensive gubernatorial race, billionaire J.B. Pritzker handily dispatched progressive state legislator Daniel Biss and political scion Chris Kennedy, who neatly split the anti-Pritzker vote. Pritzker, heir to a family fortune that includes ownership of the Hyatt Hotel chain, has invested around $70 million into his campaign.\n\nOn the Republican side, the AP called the race for incumbent Governor Bruce Rauner over conservative opponent Jeanne Ives. Despite putting $50 million of his own money into his campaign, it appears Rauner beat the underfunded Ives by a very small margin (there is still a bit of doubt about the final numbers because of vote-counting problems in Ives' home county, DuPage). Rauner clearly underestimated Ives, who made a lot of hay out of the pro-choice governor's decision to sign legislation expanding public financing of abortions. The challenger also got a boost from devious ads from the Democratic Governors' Association calling her too conservative for Illinois (an effort to help her against Rauner).\n\nA Prizker-Rauner general election is very likely to become the most expensive gubernatorial contest in U.S. history, and a nasty one as well. Pritzker will try to tie his Republican opponent to Donald Trump, while Rauner will make Pritzker out to be a puppet of state Democratic Party chairman and Illinois House speaker Mike Madigan, a figure nearly as unpopular as Trump. Pritzker leads in the early polling.\n\nIn other contests, Emily's List had, as expected, a very successful evening in Democratic congressional primaries, with former Dick Durbin aide Betsy Dirksen Londrigan defeating Erik Jones in the 13th district (she will face incumbent Rodney Davis in November), and former Department of Health and Human Services official Lauren Underwood demolishing six opponents in the 14th District (Representative Randy Hultgren is her general election opponent). In the 10th District, where Republicans hope to reclaim a seat they lost to Democrat Brad Schneider in 2016, social conservative Doug Bennett and former AIPAC staffer Jeremy Wynes are locked in a close race with a handful of precincts still out.\n\nFinally, in the attorney general's race among Democrats, state legislator Kwame Raoul is holding a probably insurmountable lead over former governor Pat Quinn.\n\nWhile turnout was generally poor (as is usually the case in Illinois midterm elections) Democrats held a considerable turnout advantage that may matter in November. It looks like Rauner got about the same number of votes as second-place Democratic gubernatorial candidate Daniel Biss.",

                "body": "With President Trump seeming to edge ever closer to firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller over the weekend, Republican leadership stayed mostly silent. While the likes of Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake warned Trump that he would be risking disaster if he pulled the trigger, there was nary a peep from the people who have the most power to protect Mueller's job.\n\nOn Tuesday, both House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell finally spoke up to defend the special counsel's work, but didn't go so far as to pledge to protect him on a legislative level.\n\nAt a press conference, Ryan said, rather unconvincingly, that he had \"received assurances\" from an unnamed person that Trump would not fire Mueller, and that the special counsel would be able to conclude his investigation. But given the president's capriciousness and reliable unreliability, this does not amount to much of a guarantee of anything.\n\nMcConnell was much stronger in his remarks.\n\n\"Bob Mueller should be allowed to finish his job,\" he told reporters at his weekly news conference. \"I think it was an excellent appointment. I think he will go wherever the facts lead him and I think he will have great credibility with the American people when he reaches the conclusion of this investigation. So I have a lot of confidence. This is a thoroughly credible individual, I think it was an appropriate appointment, and we all anticipate his finishing the job and telling the American people what they need to know about this episode.\"\n\nThe senator's surprisingly vigorous defense earned plaudits from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who said of McConnell, \"I want to his salute his statesmanship.\"\n\nStill, despite the strong words, McConnell nixed the idea of passing a bipartisan bill to protect Mueller's job, a provision Democrats have been pushing for. In his refusal to do so, he was basically parroting the view of other down-the-line Republican lawmakers like John Cornyn, who believes that since there is no conceivable way Trump would ever dream of firing Mueller, there is no need for any legislative action.\n\nMaybe the Republicans are right. Firing Mueller would be a complicated, potentially catastrophic endeavor, and despite President Trump's clear wishes to do so, there's a reason he hasn't yet taken the plunge. But it's certainly not hard to imagine Mueller drawing one step closer to Trump's orbit, the president making a rash decision to clean house, and Congress being left completely unprepared to deal with the fallout.\n\nWe'll see if McConnell and Ryan are so supportive of Mueller if that day comes.",

                "title": "Cindy Hyde-Smith Set to Be Mississippi's Next U.S. Senator",
                "body": "Unless Donald Trump vetoes his choice (he's asking the president's permission, believe it or not), Mississippi governor Phil Bryant is expected to name his state's commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, Cindy Hyde-Smith, to the U.S. Senate seat being vacated on April 1 by Thad Cochran, who is resigning because of poor health. Hyde-Smith, who is unsurprisingly the first woman to represent her state in the Senate, will presumably run for the rest of Cochran's term (running through 2020) in a special nonpartisan election being held on the same day as the midterm general election (if no one wins a majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held three weeks later).\n\nBryant apparently settled on Hyde-Smith after rejecting the idea of appointing himself and then bypassing Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves (who prefers to run for governor next year when Bryant is term-limited) and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann (thought to be too old at 70). He even more emphatically rejected the argument of hard-core conservative Chris McDaniel that his close primary race against Cochran in 2014 entitled him to the appointment. McDaniel has already announced he's running for the seat in November.\n\nA former Democratic state legislator with a career-long absorption with agriculture issues, Hyde-Smith doesn't at first glance look like the strongest candidate to turn back McDaniel. But she does have a demonstrated appeal among rural conservative voters (she's been elected to her statewide position twice), which could undercut McDaniel's base to some extent. Other than once being a conservative Democrat (an offense to which many Mississippi Republicans would plead guilty), Hyde-Smith doesn't seem to have committed any partisan or ideological heresies. And if she gets past McDaniel in the first round, she would be well-positioned for a runoff against former U.S. Agriculture secretary (and congressman) Mike Espy, the most prominent Democrat to announce for the Senate race. (It would also be a rather historic contest between an African-American and a woman in this white-male-dominated state).\n\nEstablishment Republicans in both Jackson and Washington, however, fear that if McDaniel (who has a robust collection of craziness on his résumé) edges Hyde-Smith in the special election, he might actually lose the seat to Espy, an outcome that would be as strange as the GOP's loss of Jeff Sessions's seat in next-door Alabama. It's the sort of thing that could even produce a Democratic majority in the Senate. So nervous GOPers will be watching Hyde-Smith closely in hopes she will prove to be politically skillful.",

                "body": "It's now spring, which means it's also the season of cleaning and organization. There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nNot that long ago, when it came to making clothes fluffy, wrinkle-free, and smell good in an overwhelmingly artificial way, Bounce was the only game in town. (Or Downy April Fresh, depending on what your household was into.) But do me a favor, pop over to Google real quick, type in dryer sheets, and wait for the word toxic to auto-populate. The main ingredients, found in both conventional sheets and the liquid equivalent, have been linked to a whole slew of stressful stuff. As someone who has gotten more sensitive to synthetic smells over the years, dryer sheets became the thing I slowly stopped restocking.\n\nOn a recent trip home, though, I noticed my mom had a wire basket of crunchy-looking woolen balls parked on top of the dryer. What are those? I wondered, reflexively tossing one up in the air. Some kind of craft project? They were Woolzies dryer balls, actually, an all-natural fabric softener that staves off static, prevents wrinkles, and -- maybe most appealingly -- cuts down on drying time. That same day, when I needed to dry a single pair of jeans (which always come out all twisted and most definitely not dry), the Woolzies worked stupendously.\n\nBack in Brooklyn, my building-shaking washer-dryer combo does a fine job of washing, but a very terrible job of drying. So much so that in a race, air-drying my stuff would win every time. It takes maybe three full cycles (at 45 minutes a pop) to dry shirts, socks, and jeans. (Forget about sheets.) But now, I throw three of these tennis-ball-size wool guys in with my regular loads; all six for heavy-duty stuff like towels and duvet covers. The little guys last for 500-plus loads, or about a year (my mom says you'll know they're done when they get too fuzzy). Everything is perfectly dry and tumbled all before the buzzer goes off. It's all wrinkle-free, too; my handheld steamer stopped working a while back, so now if I need to steam anything, I'll toss it in the dryer with a few balls for five minutes and it's all good -- all without introducing carcinogens into the apartment.\n\nAnd for those who can't separate clean laundry from a lingering scent trail, Woolzies also make an essential oil for dropping directly onto the wool balls in three calming, underwhelming-in-a-good-way scents.\n\nWoolzies Wool Dryer Balls (Set of 6) $19 at Amazon\n\nIf you prefer starting small, the Woolzies come in a pack of three, too.\n\nMore Strat-approved laundry accessories Simple Houseware Laundry Bags (set of 6)\n\nWriter and costume designer Alison Freer swears by these mesh laundry bags for her delicates: \"I now put everything that might need protection from an aggressive washing machine into the bags: tights, bras, underwear, stockings, leggings, slips, and swimsuits -- basically anything delicate, prone to snagging, or silky. Even inexpensive polyester dresses from chain stores, linen pieces, and vintage items that may have fragile seams will benefit from the protection a mesh wash bag gives.\"\n\n$9 at Amazon Innovative Home Creations Canvas Duffle Bag\n\nThis is one of the best-reviewed (and most affordable) laundry bags on Amazon: \"There are so many things I love about this. One: It has a strap. I can easily carry it on my back when I go up and down different floors, should I need to when doing laundry. Two: It is made of canvas. It's a breathable material that isn't flimsy. Three: It is lightweight and keeps its form. Laundry itself is already heavy, so it's good that this bag isn't some sort of heavy and bulky article. Four: It's the perfect size. I can hold two weeks' worth of laundry in here and still be able to close it comfortably without clothes spilling out.\"\n\n$9 at Amazon JapanBargain Laundry Wash Basin With Washboard\n\nIf you're interested in hand-washing, try this Japanese washbasin recommended by Sadie Stein: \"I like to put my unmentionables to soak with a little Woolite, or Forever New; soak them overnight; and then give them a good swish and rinse. And its washboard, of course, is for cleaning underpants (or as some men like to call them, 'panties'). I imagine if you were wanting to wash up any evidence of a murder, it would be very useful, too.\"\n\n$12 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "13 Reasons to Believe Aliens Are Real",
                "body": "In the good old days, the arrival of UFOs on the front page of America's paper of record might have seemed like a loose-thread tear right through the fabric of reality -- the closest that secular, space-race America could have gotten to a Second Coming. Two decades ago, or three, or six, we would've also felt we knew the script in advance, thanks to the endless variations pop culture had played for us already: civilizational conflicts to mirror the real-world ones Americans had been imagining in terror since the beginning of the Cold War.\n\nBut when, in December, the New York Times published an undisputed account of what might once have sounded like crackpot conspiracy theory -- that the Pentagon had spent five years investigating \"unexplained aerial phenomena\" -- the response among the paper's mostly liberal readers, exhausted and beaten down by \"recent events,\" was markedly different from the one in those movies. The news that aliens might actually be visiting us, regularly and recently, didn't provoke terror about a coming space-opera conflict but something much more like the Evangelical dream of the Rapture the same liberals might have mocked as kooky right-wing escapism in the George W. Bush years. \"The truth is out there,\" former senator Harry Reid tweeted, with a link to the story. Thank God, came the response through the Twitter vent. \"Could extraterrestrials help us save the Earth?\" went one typical reaction.\n\nSuddenly, aliens were an escapist fantasy -- but also more credible (legitimized by the government!) than mere fantasy. That Pentagon report, which featured two gripping videos of aerial encounters, was just one beat in a recent search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence (or SETI) drumroll: In October, an object passed through our solar system that looked an awful lot like a spaceship; astronomers spent much of 2016 arguing over whether the weird pulses of light coming from a distant star were actually evidence of an \"alien megastructure.\" An army of Silicon Valley billionaires are racing to make first contact, and our new superpowered telescopes are discovering more conceivably habitable planets every year.\n\nThen, in March, a third video emerged, featuring a Navy encounter off the East Coast in 2015, with the group that released it hinting at an additional trove. \"Why doesn't the Pentagon care?\" wondered a Washington Post op-ed -- surely the first time the newspaper of Katharine Graham was raising a stink about aliens. The next week, President Trump seemed to announce he was creating an entirely new branch of the military: \"We'll call it the Space Force.\" You could be forgiven for thinking you'd woken up in a science-fiction novel. At the very least, it is starting to seem non-crazy to believe. A recent study shows half the world already does.\n\nSearching the Universe for Extraterrestrial Life: A Timeline\n\nAlien dreams have always been powered by the desire for human importance in a vast, forgetful cosmos: We want to be seen so we know we exist. What's unusual about the alien fantasy is that, unlike religion, nationalism, or conspiracy theory, it doesn't place humans at the center of a grand story. In fact, it displaces them: Humans become, briefly, major players in a drama of almost inconceivable scale, the lasting lesson of which is, unfortunately: We're total nobodies. That's the lesson, at least, of a visit from aliens, who got here long before we were able to get there, wherever there is; if humans are the ones making first contact, we're the advanced ones and the aliens are probably more like productive pond scum, which may be one reason we fantasize about those kinds of encounters a lot less than visits to Earth. Of course, when the aliens are the explorers, we're the pond scum.\n\nBut a lot of people in the modern world will take that bargain, which should probably not surprise us given how dizzying, secular, and, um, alienating that world objectively is. Most conspiracy theory is fueled by a desire to see the universe as ultimately intelligible -- the bargain being that things can make sense, but only if you believe in pervasive totalitarian malice. Alien conspiracy theory keeps the malice (cover-ups at Roswell, the Men in Black). But rather than benzo comforts like order and intelligibility, it offers the psychedelic drama of total unintelligibility -- awe, wonder, a knee-wobblingly deep, mystical experience of existential ignorance.\n\nEvery extraterrestrial era has its own fantasy of consequentiality. Crop circles began as a phenomenon of the English countryside, then spread to the far corners of the onetime British Empire (Australia, Canada) after World War II, when the U.K. was falling unmistakably back in the ranks of nations and when its provincial subjects would have felt some understandable desire to demonstrate that, somehow, their lives really mattered. American encounters were invariably rural as well -- typically farmers and ranchers, mostly in the country's interior and the deserts and mountains of the West, in decades the country as a whole spent rapidly urbanizing and then industrializing its farmland so systematically it looked like Monsanto was trying to exterminate the American farmer along with the cotton bollworm.\n\nThese incidents, which never occurred in cities, where other witnesses could have verified them, were often reported as horror stories even as they may have expressed secret desires. But the pop culture of the same era introduced another mode: the suburban encounter, often still private and personal but more ooey-gooey New Age than abductions and anal probes. The two major authors were Steven Spielberg, who gave us broken-family theology in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T., and Carl Sagan, who gave us Cosmos and Contact, which, when it was turned into a movie, featured an eerie seascape that was basically a secular heaven, maintained by offscreen aliens explicitly playing the role of gods. Stephen Hawking, who died in March, was also a godfather of a sort, not just a physicist but a sage and guru for a generation of squishy-lefty seekers curious about life beyond Earth; among his last acts was partnering with Yuri Milner, a Russian billionaire building a giant SETI laboratory at UC Berkeley. Americans used to regard the space race with not just national but something like collectivist pride -- all those government engineers from the new middle class. Suddenly, it's the rich kids with the cool toys and the keys to the rocket ship.\n\nWhich does mark a change. Beyond the mysticism, American stories of alien encounters have been (often anxious) meditations on the status of American power -- meditations informed, surely, by both the memory of European settlers, for whom \"first contact\" was a story of triumphant genocide, and sympathy for those they trampled. Given the option, America will always prefer to play the cowboy, and through the post-Cold War 1990s, the dominant alien-encounter template was still the swaggering military strut of Independence Day. (The closest thing we got to a counterpoint was the cover-up paranoia of The X-Files, which just expressed a darker faith in the same American power.) By the time we got an alien epic for the War on Terror era, even Spielberg staged it as a story about armed conflict: The War of the Worlds. Of course, in that story, the winner was always going to be the humans -- that is, the Americans. And then came the financial crisis, the recession, and Trump, and the new hope that E.T. may take pity on us.\n\nElsewhere in the world, where things are looking up, relatively speaking, you might expect a different perspective on aliens -- and indeed, as The Atlantic's Ross Andersen documented last fall, the Chinese have recently opened the world's largest radar facility to listen for signs of aliens, wherever they are out there. But even our future Chinese overlords, projecting power for the first time into the ever-receding reaches of the universe, are a bit nervous about aliens; as Andersen points out, their popular science fiction bears the evidence. And why wouldn't they be? They have their own memory of colonial contact -- the Opium Wars, the end of that empire -- to reckon with. And, besides, the unknown is just scary. Things have to get pretty bleak before you take a chance on the arrival of a total blank slate, just for the sake of change. -- David Wallace-Wells\n\n1. The Government Literally Just Admitted It's Taking UFOs Seriously\n\nAnd, according to researchers, it's only pretended to end the program.\n\nIn 1952, a CIA group called the Psychological Strategy Board concluded that, when it came to UFOs, the American public was dangerously gullible and prone to \"hysterical mass behavior.\" The group recommended \"debunking\" campaigns to tamper the public's interest in unexplained phenomena. But the government seems to have been interested, too: In December, the Pentagon confirmed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. Created in 2007 by senators Ted Stevens (who reported being chased by a mysterious object), Daniel Inouye, and then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, and funded with $22 million of \"black money\" from the Department of Defense's budget, the program investigated and evaluated reports of UFO sightings, many of which came from American service members.\n\nSo much of what the program uncovered remains classified, but what little we know is tantalizing. Based on data it collected, the program identified five observations that showed mysterious objects displaying some level of \"advanced physics,\" also known as \"stuff humans can't do yet\": The objects would accelerate with g-forces too strong for the human body to withstand, or reach hypersonic speed with no heat trail or sonic boom, or they seemed to resist the effects of Earth's gravity without any aerodynamic structures to provide thrust or lift. \"No one has been able to figure out what these are,\" said Luis Elizondo, who ran the program until last October, in a recent interview.\n\nElizondo has also talked about \"metamaterials\" that may have been recovered from unidentified aerial phenomena and stored in buildings owned by a private aerospace contractor in Las Vegas; they apparently have material compositions that aren't found naturally on Earth and would be exceptionally expensive to replicate. According to a 2009 Pentagon briefing summarized in the New York Times, \"the United States was incapable of defending itself against some of the technologies discovered.\" This was a briefing by people trying to get more funding -- but still.\n\nSome of the accounts Elizondo and his team analyzed supposedly occurred near nuclear facilities like power plants or battleships. In November 2004, the USS Princeton, a Navy cruiser escorting the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the coast of San Diego, ordered two fighter jets to investigate mysterious aircraft the Navy had been tracking for weeks (meaning this was not just a trick of the eye or a momentary failure of perspective, the two things most often blamed for unexplained aerial phenomena). When the jets arrived at the location, one of the pilots, Commander David Fravor, saw a disturbance just below the ocean's surface causing the water to roil around it. Then, suddenly, he saw a white, 40-foot Tic Tac-shaped craft moving like a Ping-Pong ball above the water. The vehicle began mirroring his plane's movements, but when Fravor dove directly at the object, the Tic Tac zipped away.\n\nThe Pentagon has said funding for the program ran out in 2012 and wasn't renewed. But Elizondo has claimed the project was alive and well when he resigned in October. -- James D. Walsh\n\n2. Harry Reid Says We're Not Taking Them Seriously Enough\n\nThe former Senate majority leader is definitely a truther.\n\nEric Benson: I'm curious about just where your interest in this subject comes from.\n\nHarry Reid: Bob Bigelow [the founder of Bigelow Aerospace and Budget Suites]. He's a central figure in all this. When he was a young man, he heard a story from his grandparents about driving down from Mt. Charleston, near Las Vegas, where they saw a so-called flying saucer, for lack of a better description. Bob became a very wealthy man. He would pay for these conferences about UFOs, and he would bring in scientists, academics, and a few nutcases.\n\nThere were people trying to figure out what all this aerial phenomena was. Bob started sending me tons of stuff. Mainly what interested me is that so many people had seen these strange things in the air.\n\nEB: So tell me how this program got started.\n\nHR: I was in Washington in the Senate, and Bob called me and said, \"I got the strangest letter here. Could I have a courier bring it to you?\" I said sure. He didn't want to send it to me over the lines, for obvious reasons.\n\nThe letter said, \"I am a senior, longtime member of this security agency, and I have an interest in what you've been working on. I also want to go to your ranch in Utah.\"\n\nBigelow had bought a great big ranch. All this crazy stuff goes on up there -- you know, things in the air. Indians used to talk about it, part of their folklore.\n\nSo I called Bigelow back and said, \"Hey, I'll meet with the guy.\" The program grew out of that, to study aerial phenomena.\n\nWe decided it would be [funded by] black money. I wanted to get something done. I didn't want a debate where no one knew what the hell they were talking about on the Senate floor.\n\nEB: I saw that you tweeted, \"We don't know the answers, but we have plenty of evidence to support asking the questions.\" To you, what's the most compelling evidence to support asking the questions?\n\nHR: Read the reports. We have hundreds of -- Eric, two, three weeks ago, maybe a month now, up in Montana, they had another strange deal at a missile base up there. It goes on all the time.\n\nEB: Do you know things about this program that you can't discuss publicly?\n\nHR: Yeah.\n\n3. Scientists Are Suddenly Much More Bullish About the Possibility of Life Out There\n\nThe universe is really big, people.\n\nJust 20 years ago, we had not discovered a single planet outside our solar system. Now we know of more than 3,000 of them, and we know nearly every star in the night sky has at least one planet in its orbit. \"Even people who are not terribly interested in science know that we've found that planets are as common as fire hydrants -- they're everywhere,\" says Seth Shostak, the senior astronomer at the SETI Institute. \"One in five or one in six might be a planet similar to the Earth.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean we'll ever find an exact replica of Earth, but maybe we don't have to. Our study of other planets and moons in the solar system shows us many worlds possess the ingredients necessary for life -- an atmosphere, organic compounds, liquid water, and other necessities. (The moons orbiting Jupiter and Saturn, for example, feature whole subsurface oceans.)\n\nAnd even though these places are extremely harsh environments, that doesn't mean as much as we might once have thought it did; recent discoveries on Earth itself demonstrate that life is much tougher than we thought. We've found organisms in blisteringly hot geysers in Yellowstone National Park, in the darkest crevices under the most ungodly pressures in the deep ocean, in dry hellscapes like the Atacama Desert in Chile (an analogue for Mars). These \"extremophiles\" don't need a warm and fuzzy paradise to call home -- in fact, they have already evolved to live in environments as harsh as those on other planets. Some, like tardigrades, can even survive the bleak vacuum of space itself. If there's life in most of those places, \"it's going to be pond scum,\" says Shostak. \"But it's alien pond scum. It shows that biology is all over.\"\n\nAnd where there's biology, there may well be intelligence, and our increasing understanding of evolution also tells us life can evolve faster than we ever anticipated. Millions of years is a long time for us, but it's the blink of an eye on the cosmic scale. Blink too fast, and you'll miss that pond scum turning into an intelligent civilization sending out messages every which way, looking for friends.\n\nAnd we're now at the point where we could one day find those messages and send a reply. New technology gives us a better chance to actually make contact with extraterrestrials. Our radio telescopes can scan more of the night sky for an intelligent message than ever before. Our optical telescopes and observatories can peer farther into space and look for new planets, moons, and perhaps even signs of something altogether artificial (see \"Tabby's Star\"). Our ability to parse volumes of data in mere seconds means we could conceivably survey much of the galaxy in just a few decades. That's why, in the past few years, Shostak has continually bet a cup of coffee with everyone he knows that humans will find aliens by around 2029. \"We'd have to be dead above the neck if we weren't interested in this,\" says Penelope Boston, the director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute. -- Neel Patel\n\n4. They're Especially Bullish About These Planets\n\nAdventures in the \"Goldilocks zone.\"\n\nScientists now think every one in five or six planets might be habitable, based on two general criteria: They're rocky, and they reside in a region of the star's orbit called the \"Goldilocks zone,\" where it's not too cold and not too hot, but just right to allow for liquid water to form on the surface. And where there's water, there can be life. Extraterrestrial researchers and enthusiasts are most excited about these seven:\n\nProxima B: The closest exoplanet ever discovered is also a potentially habitable world in its own right, if the intense stellar winds don't make it barren. It's not totally inconceivable we might be able to actually send a probe and study it directly this century -- even travel to it ourselves one day.\n\nTRAPPIST-1 System: The red dwarf at the center of this possesses a whopping seven planets in its orbit -- three of which reside in the Goldilocks zone, but all of which seem to possess some degree of potential habitability -- and they're so close to one another that life on one planet could quickly spread to another.\n\nLHS 1140b: This wouldn't be a planet we could colonize. It's almost seven times the mass of the Earth and 40 percent larger, making it a \"super-Earth.\" But its mass means that it would retain a thicker atmosphere capable of keeping it warmer and more comfortable for life than most other places.\n\nRoss 128 b: One of the best chances we have so far at finding life on another planet. It orbits an inactive red-dwarf star, meaning it's likely not being bludgeoned by solar radiation. And we've detected strange signals emanating from the nearby host star -- signals that perhaps have intelligent origins?\n\nMars: Mars has water, as we've known since 2015. Although the planet looks like a barren wasteland these days, there's little reason to write off any chance we might find aliens residing in some cavern or crevice.\n\nThe Ocean Worlds (Europa, Enceladus, Titan): Many of Jupiter's and Saturn's moons show signs of possessing a liquid ocean underneath the surface.\n\nGJ 1214b: Nicknamed \"waterworld\" by scientists; signs of potential clouds give us some hope the planet has an atmosphere.\n\n-- N.P.\n\n5. And There Is \"Documentation\"\n\nIn 2012, the photographer Steven Hirsch asked UFO-convention attendees who claimed to have had personal contact with extraterrestrials to draw and describe their experiences. A sampling below.\n\n6. That \"Asteroid\" Looks an Awful Lot Like a Rocket Ship\n\nFor science-minded SETI freaks, the last decade has been a particularly exciting one.\n\nWe May Have Just Seen an Actual Flying Saucer\n\nWhen 'Oumuamua -- the name means \"first messenger\" in Hawaiian -- was discovered floating through the solar system in October, SETI nuts immediately started checking the boxes that suggested the rod-shaped object might be an alien spacecraft of some kind. After all, it's the first interstellar object we've ever seen pass through the solar system. UFO enthusiasts point out that rods (along with flying saucers) are the two most common shapes cited by witnesses in UFO sightings, and the cigar shape would allow it to be slim enough to avoid collision with other objects as well as maximize aerodynamics for travel. Both the SETI Institute and the Breakthrough Listen initiative pointed their instruments toward the object but found no unusual signals emitting from it. Of course, maybe it's an ancient relic from an interstellar civilization, or maybe the aliens just weren't interested in making contact (that asteroid-ness could've just been camouflage). With the object on its way out of the solar system, we may never know.\n\nAnd There Could Be an Alien Megastructure Much Farther Out\n\nIn the fall of 2015, Penn State astronomer Jason Wright posited that erratic shifts in brightness coming from a newly discovered star 1,280 light-years from Earth couldn't be explained by exoplanets or other astrophysics that we understand. He theorized, instead, that the fluctuations may be the result of massive objects passing in front of the star, in a kind of orbit -- a whole array of massive satellites or other kinds of structures, presumably produced by a civilization of advanced intelligence. Whoa.\n\nAliens Could Be Dancing to Earth Music Right Now\n\nLast year, two planets were discovered orbiting a red dwarf 12.36 light-years from Earth. At least one of these planets is in the Goldilocks zone, so SETI International decided to beam some musical signals over to the planet. With a closer proximity to Earth than most potentially habitable exoplanets, it'd be an exciting planet to start an interstellar pen-pal relationship with -- assuming there's someone around to hear our notes and listen to them as a welcoming tune instead of a battle cry.\n\nAnd We're Getting Radio Signals From ... Something\n\nFast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most mysterious phenomena ever observed by scientists. Though they last only a few milliseconds, these pulses, first detected in 2007, emit more energy in that time than the sun does in 24 hours. Three more were found this month, and we're no closer to understanding their origin -- except that they're coming from outside the Milky Way. So naturally, many experts have begun to think perhaps they're produced by an ultra-advanced civilization from afar, trying to speak to us through signals we can barely comprehend.\n\n-- N.P.\n\n7. These Masters of the Universe Are Obsessed (They Are Also All Men)\n\nWhich space-besotted billionaire will be the first to make contact?\n\nRobert Bigelow\n\nAs a child, Bigelow watched the government test atomic bombs from his bedroom window and he and his classmates could see the mushroom clouds bloom over the Mojave Desert from their school playground. To some, such memories are the stuff of dystopic Cold War hellscapes, but Bigelow remembers them as an epiphany. Even back then, Bigelow knew he wasn't going to be a scientist (he was lousy at math), so he resolved himself to make as much money as possible in the hopes that he could one day fund his own space program. He went on to make at least $1 billion with Budget Suites of America, long-term motel rentals around the Southwest. He now runs Bigelow Aerospace, which holds contracts with NASA and was a primary contractor for the Department of Defense's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.\n\nElon Musk\n\nMusk is hell-bent on using his $21 billion to colonize Mars. His company SpaceX has been trying desperately to reduce the cost of space travel in the hopes of beginning a million-person colonization of Mars. \"If [we're not in] a simulation, then maybe we're in a lab and there's some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop, out of curiosity, like mold in a petri dish,\" says Musk.\n\nPaul Allen\n\nWhen Congress cut off funding for NASA's hunt for aliens in 1993, Allen gave millions to the SETI Institute; in 2009, the Allen Telescope Array started searching the cosmos. Allen has given an additional $30 million to the project, a sum that bought him a guarantee that if the array detects an extraterrestrial communiqué, Allen will be the first nonscientist to know.\n\nYuri Milner\n\nLast year, Milner -- named after a Russian cosmonaut -- announced a plan to send spaceships to Saturn's moon Enceladus in search of alien life. Milner is also funding Breakthrough Listen, a ten-year project to use a telescope in West Virginia to search for messages from intelligent life, and Breakthrough Starshot, in conjunction with Mark Zuckerberg and the late Stephen Hawking.\n\nJeff Bezos\n\nHis company Blue Origin is competing with Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch reusable rockets (and comically rich tourists) into space. While Musk played himself in a cameo in Iron Man 2, Bezos appeared as an alien Starfleet official in 2016's Star Trek Beyond. (It was not a speaking role.)\n\n\"Why do I feel so much like Sigourney Weaver?\" Bezos said last March as he piloted a giant manned robot at Amazon's MARs conference.\n\nFranklin Antonio\n\nAntonio cofounded Qualcomm, a mobile tech company, in the mid-'80s. He's also the company's chief scientist and has given millions to SETI research. Last year Antonio gave $30 million to the University of California San Diego's school of engineering and followed that donation up with a contribution to Roy Moore's failed senate campaign.\n\n8. As Are Some Prominent Military and Government Folks\n\nYou see a lot more as a test pilot than as a farmer in Iowa.\n\nNick Pope\n\n\"Know that there are people who watch our skies to protect the sleeping masses,\" Britain's former chief UFO investigator warns in his memoir. \"But also know that not all potential intruders into our airspace have two wings, a fuselage, and a tail, and not all show up on our radar.\" Pope's ominous counsel follows time he spent in the '90s inspecting thousands of paranormal incidents from crop circles to purported bedside abductions. He took that job certain this kind of stuff \"only happened to weirdos,\" but unexplainable sightings soon convinced him that \"there is a war going on\" with aliens. Worse, the U.K. Defense Ministry cut his old UFO desk's funding in 2009, so whatever's out there \"could attack at any time,\" Pope believes. Earthlings' diminished odds have gotten him more fatalistic lately, too: After scientists suggested 'Oumuamua -- a bizarre-shaped asteroid that's the first interstellar object to pass through our solar system -- might be an alien spaceship, he argued in December we \"probably wouldn't survive an alien invasion\" anyway, because if they find us, it's clear who has the upper hand.\n\nPaul Hellyer\n\nCanada's Defense minister during the Cold War, now 94, believes that at least 80 species of aliens have been visiting Earth for millennia. One group is called the Tall Whites (because they can reach basketball-goal height) or Nordic Blondes (because they look like they're \"from Denmark or somewhere\"). Unfortunately, the others may include ecoterrorists: \"We're doing all sorts of things which are not what good stewards of their homes should be doing,\" he told media in 2014. \"They don't like that, and they've made it very clear.\" Hellyer adds that many technological \"breakthroughs\" were aped from these extraterrestrials. Microchips and fiber optics, for instance, were taken off crashed alien vehicles and reverse-engineered. The aliens have a special technology that would solve climate change as well, he claims, but the Illuminati are hiding it because it would devastate oil interests.\n\nPhilip Corso\n\nCorso's military career was long and illustrious, from rebuilding Rome's government after World War II as an Army Intelligence captain to having worked the Pentagon's foreign-technology desk in the '60s. He doesn't appear to have said a word publicly about aliens until 1997, when Simon & Schuster published The Day After Roswell -- with a foreword by Strom Thurmond -- just 13 months before Corso died. It was his tell-all outlining a decades-long Roswell cover-up while plugging his own clandestine exploits, which he claimed involved reverse-engineering technology found on alien spacecrafts. This is how the world got lasers, particle beams, microchips, even Kevlar, Corso said. Skeptics argue that regular Earth people's R&D behind technology like lasers is impossibly well documented.\n\nBarry Goldwater\n\nHad he won election in 1964, one of his White House's first acts might have been releasing top-secret UFO files. He harbored a lifelong fascination with the truth about extraterrestrial contact, much of it stemming from his desire to \"find out what was in\" the mysterious Hangar 18 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, home to the Air Force's Project Blue Book. In the '80s, it surfaced he'd spent decades corresponding with UFO investigators and harassing the military for access to the hangar's so-called Blue Room, where conspiracy theorists believe alien bodies from Roswell are preserved. (\"Not only can't you get into it,\" his friend General Curtis LeMay supposedly snapped in 1975, \"but don't you ever mention it to me again.\" Goldwater claims he didn't.) After retiring in 1987, the senator told Larry King the Earth is \"one of several billion planets in this universe. I can't believe that God or whoever is in charge would put thinking bodies on only one planet.\"\n\nRoscoe Hillenkoetter\n\nAfter he'd served as the first CIA director (he'd been appointed by President Truman), Hillenkoetter retired from a distinguished Navy career in 1957 and took a gig at a brand-new private research group called the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Its chief purpose was pressuring the government to disclose what it knew about UFOs, via investigations like Project Blue Book. Hillenkoetter went after the intelligence community, writing angry open letters that said things like: \"It is time for the truth to be brought out in open congressional hearings.\" When he pointed out in 1960 that the Air Force had investigated 6,312 UFO reports to date, but was seemingly trying \"to hide the facts,\" the military reminded Americans that \"no physical evidence, not even a minute fragment of a so-called flying saucer, has ever been found.\"\n\nOf course, another theory popped up in the '80s -- that Hillenkoetter had helped run a secret committee all along of politicians, military officers, and scientists called the Majestic 12. Ufologists claimed this cabal was formed in 1947, once Truman started panicking over what to do with all the alien spacecrafts the government kept finding. The group's existence is based on government files that allegedly materialized in 1984. The FBI denied their authenticity entirely, but they and the Majestic 12 remain popular grist for conspiracy theories, having figured in Blink-182's song \"Aliens Exist\" and even one of Twin Peaks's side plots.\n\nDennis Kucinich\n\nKucinich's 2008 presidential campaign didn't suffer from his admission, made during a live TV debate, that, back in 1982, he'd seen a UFO at friend Shirley MacLaine's Washington State home. (He was polling around 4 percent at the time.) But the current candidate for Ohio governor got mocked plenty; one joke among Beltway insiders was he wanted the \"little green vote.\"\n\nStaff were prepped to deny the encounter when reporters asked about the passage in MacLaine's 2007 New Age self-help book, Sage-ing While Age-ing, that revealed Kucinich didn't just see a UFO but had also felt \"a connection in his heart and heard directions in his mind.\" The other witnesses -- a Juilliard-trained trumpeter working as MacLaine's bodyguard and his model girlfriend -- also report having seen a trio of triangle-shaped aircrafts flying in tight formation. Her house was 50 miles from Mt. Rainier, a \"saucer magnet\" for UFO buffs because of all the nearby sightings, including America's very first \"flying saucer\" in 1947. Kucinich had the community's full support, even if he spent years playing coy.\n\nIt helped that in Congress he did things like trying to ban space-based weapons. A 2001 bill he authored himself prohibited America from using \"radiation, electromagnetic, psychotronic, sonic, laser, or other energies\" for the purposes of \"information war, mood management, or mind control of such populations.\" It explicitly singled out \"chemtrails,\" a term for jet condensation trails when conspiracy theorists believe they're being used for biological warfare. In 2008, however, he only confirmed he'd seen a UFO, then pointed out, accurately, to moderator Tim Russert that \"more people in this country have seen UFOs than I think approve of George Bush's presidency.\"\n\nJohn Podesta\n\nWhen WikiLeaks published the Hillary Clinton emails, a weird number of Podesta's mentioned aliens and involved contact with believers like Tom DeLonge and astronaut Edgar Mitchell. As Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff, he was known as an X-Files fanatic who'd \"call the Air Force and ask them what's going on in Area 51.\" In 2014, he spent 13 months advising President Obama -- and what was his \"biggest failure\"? According to him, failing to get government files declassified on the 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, UFO incident.\n\nThen during Bush's term, he began publicly crusading for NASA to release UFO documents to journalist Leslie Kean, the person ultimately behind the Times' Pentagon exposé.\n\nPodesta has kept his personal ET beliefs under wraps, but in Kean's best seller UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record, he gamely wrote a foreword that argues: \"It's time to find out what the truth really is ... The American people -- and people around the world -- want to know, and they can handle the truth.\"\n\nPavel and Marina Popovich\n\nThis husband-wife duo was one part world-renowned cosmonaut (Pavel) and one part the Soviet Union's most celebrated female pilot (Marina). They held among their titles that of sixth human in orbit, first Soviet female to break the sound barrier, and holder of more than 100 aviation world records. Once their illustrious flying careers ended, both became ufologists. Pavel headed up Russia's UFO association and claimed to have seen an unidentified aircraft zip past his airplane on a trip home from Washington, D.C., with a group of scientists. People onboard said it was triangular, brightly lit, and rocketed by at 1,000 miles per hour.\n\nMarina one-upped him, though -- she claimed to have seen multiple UFOs and a \"Bigfoot creature\" -- and after they divorced, she became the acclaimed expert, not Pavel. She began preaching a UFO glasnost of sorts under Gorbachev, claiming the Soviet government had pieces of five spaceships in its possession and reports of 14,000 UFO sightings, yet for decades researchers were \"either fired or put in psychiatric hospitals.\" Her eventual book, simply called UFO Glasnost, spoke candidly about how Leonardo da Vinci, Jules Verne, and Ray Bradbury were alien mediums and Gorbachev had the markings of an extraterrestrial emissary because \"he's an epoch-making phenomenon.\"\n\n-- Clint Rainey\n\n9. (And This Genius Thinks He Can Talk to Them)\n\nIn January, Stephen Wolfram -- a computer-scientist philosopher and the author of a \"universal\" programming language that informed the alien communication in the movie Arrival -- wrote an exceedingly long blog post about how best to communicate with aliens.\n\nTim Urban: You created a language you think we might be able to use to communicate with aliens. So what exactly is it that we would want to say to the rest of the universe if we had the chance?\n\nStephen Wolfram: I think the main difficulty is the definitional one. You talk about alien life, you talk about intelligence; what are those things abstractly?\n\nWe know the specific example that we have historically been exposed to: life on Earth, human intelligence. The question is, when you generalize away from that, what do you get to? One of the things that I'm fond of quoting is the statement \"The weather has a mind of its own.\" What does this mean? What is the abstract kind of thing that's like the mind? It's the ability to do sophisticated computation. That's something that exists in the weather, just as it exists in our brains, just as it exists in lots of living systems. And then, what's different between the weather and its sort-of-mindlike thing and our human intelligence? The fundamental answer to that is our human intelligence has its particular cultural, civilizational history and the weather doesn't.\n\nTU: So is it that history that we'd want to communicate?\n\nSW: Yes, I think the thing to realize is that we in our civilization have followed a particular path. There are an infinite number of possible paths that we could've followed. To any other intelligence, our path would be quite mysterious.\n\nTU: Right, so we actually have unique information to communicate. You could have the most sophisticated species, and we can still tell them something they don't know about our history.\n\nSW: I'm particularly amused by Elon Musk's car going into space. That is so extremely aligned with the notion of grave goods from ancient Egypt, where you're taking things from your everyday life to be buried with you. It's charming.\n\n10. There Have Been Enough Well-Known Encounters to Fill Encyclopedias\n\nHere, just a small sampling of the classics.\n\nBarney and Betty Hill's Abduction\n\nThe Hills (above) claimed that in 1961 a bright light swooped over their car on a New Hampshire road and that they woke up a few hours later and the car had been \"magnetized.\" With regressive hypnosis, both were able to recall being abducted and probed by the little gray men, which soon became the de facto alien description. (The Hills' captors were, interestingly, very similar to Selenites -- the five-foot moon inhabitants H.G. Wells invented for The First Men in the Moon.) Betty astonished authorities when she began drawing a map of the constellation the creatures claimed to be from. Initially it looked like nonsense, until a few scientists noticed its resemblance to Zeta Reticuli, a system inside the constellation Reticulum largely unknown in that year. Their case generated widespread publicity, partly because they were a mixed-race couple in the '60s, and turned into the flagship example of a \"close encounter,\" though not until years after the fact (skeptics argue the delayed report is a sign it's a hoax). The hype ultimately culminated in The UFO Incident, a 1975 made-for-TV movie starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.\n\nAntonio Villas-Boas's Seduction\n\nIn 1957, small aliens with huge heads allegedly came for Villas-Boas, a young Brazilian farmer. Villas-Boas was forced inside their vessel, where the creatures took blood samples from, of all places, his chin, and rubbed in some sort of gel. Soon after, a blonde female with big, almond-shaped eyes joined him. She began rubbing his body, then initiated sex. After they were done, she left quickly, which gave Villas-Boas the impression that he was being used to better the aliens' \"stock.\" He didn't react well, as he suddenly felt exploited as \"a good stallion\" by these foreign chin-fetishists.\n\nWeird as it was, Boas's encounter, with its probing and forced sex, became the archetypal alien abduction. Reportedly skittish at first, he eventually told his story to João Martins, the writer behind popular magazine O Cruzeiro's \"Flying Saucers' Terrible Mission\" series. Doctors confirmed Boas had suffered radiation poisoning, but Martins ultimately soured on Boas's story, for one because his spaceship sketch bore remarkable similarities to the Soviet Union's Sputnik. He turned out all right, though: He got a law degree, had four kids, and died believing his children had a half-sibling living in space.\n\nThe \"Wow!\" Signal\n\nIn 1977, Ohio State's Big Ear radio telescope intercepted a 72-second burst of sound that bore signs of having come from interstellar space, which could be a sign of extraterrestrial communication. The anomaly measured 1,420 megahertz, a frequency in the \"water hole,\" the term for a radio-emission range thought ideal for intergalactic messages because it's unusually quiet. Jerry Ehman, the astronomer who spotted it, was so excited that he scribbled a giant \"Wow!\" on his printout. Astronomy's explanations for the bizarre phenomenon include secret spy satellites and a passing comet nobody knew about in 1977. But many admit nothing explains it adequately, and even if the signal doesn't prove aliens exist, it's still a \"tug on the cosmic fishing line.\" To date, it remains the best evidence of alien communication ever obtained.\n\nFoo Fighters\n\nIn the middle of World War II, things took a mysterious turn for Air Force pilots flying overnight missions. They reported seeing lights chasing their aircraft. The number varied (sometimes it was one; other times ten), and so did the colors (red, orange, and green). But the unidentified objects shared in common that they moved very fast, up to 200 miles per hour, yet could dart on a dime. These pilots -- among the world's best -- admitted the objects generally flew circles around them. Their lore grew among the squadrons. In 1944, a crew flying along the Rhine in Germany described seeing \"eight to ten bright orange lights\" whiz by \"at high speed.\" Neither ground control nor their own planes caught anything on radar, and when one pilot turned toward the lights, they reportedly \"disappeared.\"\n\nThey called their mystery air companions \"foo fighters,\" an inside joke based on a phrase the comic-book character Smokey Stover used to declare (\"Where there's foo, there's fire\"). The term flying saucer hadn't caught on yet, or else it would've sufficed. Some witnesses assumed they were tracer fire, reflections from ice crystals, or high-tech weaponry developed by the Nazis, while the government had a boring explanation as always: They were \"electrostatic (similar to St. Elmo's fire) or electromagnetic phenomena,\" though which one and wherefrom were \"never defined.\"\n\nKecksburg UFO Crash\n\nIn 1965, an intense fireball streaked over southern Canada and Detroit and dropped debris over Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Officially, it was declared a midsize meteor, but eyewitnesses in the small Pennsylvania town of Kecksburg claimed they'd found an acorn-shaped object about the size of a VW Beetle in the woods that was festooned with hieroglyphics. Newspaper reporters on the ground said the military conducted a \"close inspection\" of the crash site, and despite the official line being that the search yielded \"absolutely nothing,\" conspiracists maintain the object was packed onto an Army flatbed truck and that the whole thing was a Roswell-level cover-up. Leslie Kean's Coalition for the Freedom of Information managed to secure some of the government's files but reportedly not anything enlightening.\n\nHowever, a second explanation surfaced in the early aughts: It was Die Glocke, purportedly a top-secret weapon Nazis developed that let them time-travel. By dumb Back to the Future-esque luck, it had come to rural Pennsylvania in the year 1965. These proponents argue Nazi SS officer Hans Kammler was navigating the device when it crash-landed in Kecksburg, allowing him to escape Allied troops in the days before VE Day and successfully integrate into postwar U.S. society.\n\nKenneth Arnold's \"Flying Saucer\"\n\nKenneth Arnold, a respected pilot, claimed in 1947 he'd seen nine mostly flat objects whip past Mount Rainier at speeds he timed at 1,760 miles per hour. \"They were shaped like saucers,\" he reportedly explained, \"and were so thin I could barely see them.\" A neologism was born.\n\nArnold he demanded military personnel explain what the contraptions were, if they knew, since he'd dismissed any possibility of them being guided missiles or new types of jets. His best guess? \"From another planet.\" Dozens of others came forward with similar sightings, from as far away as Oklahoma and Arizona. But Arnold didn't enjoy his newfound celebrity. He said people had started shrieking in cafés when they saw him and fleeing. He described the situation to reporters as \"out of hand\" and regretted having people \"look at me as a combination of Einstein, Flash Gordon, and screwball.\"\n\nPhoenix Lights\n\nOn March 13, 1997, thousands of people in southern Arizona say they saw weird lights move across the night sky in a flying V. Most of their reports came in between 7 and 10:30 p.m. along a 300-mile stretch from Phoenix, through Tucson, and to the Mexico border. A majority of people spied the pattern passing overhead (it was supposedly several football fields long), but the Air Force also sent a team of A-10 Warthogs from nearby Barry Goldwater Range on a training exercise that same night, and, as luck would have it, those planes dropped some stationary flares just outside Phoenix, considerably complicating any UFO conspiracies with a second set of strange bright lights.\n\nWitnesses claim to have watched the first set of lights -- the low-altitude wedge formation -- coast by with their binoculars; they say the lights were red, had a singular white one at the V's tip, seemed engineless, and even banked southeast at one point. Actor Kurt Russell now claims he saw them while up in a private plane near the Phoenix airport, but air-traffic control told him the radar was clear. Governor Fife Symington reportedly witnessed the V-shaped as well. At the time he felt sure it wasn't aliens, but his mind changed in 2007, after retiring from politics: He told media that as a pilot, he knows \"just about every machine that flies,\" and these lights definitely weren't terrestrial.\n\nThe \"Warminster Thing\"\n\nWarminster's long, controversial association with UFOs began in the English town on Christmas Day in 1964, when a local woman heard a \"crackling sound\" rip over her head. Other so-called sonic attacks plagued scores of others in town around the same time. Townspeople had no clue what was behind them, so they began blaming the \"Thing.\" Additional reports of inexplicable lights in the sky made it clear the \"Thing\" might have hailed from outer space.\n\nTravis Walton's Abduction\n\nIn 1975, a team of loggers claimed their 22-year-old co-worker Travis Walton disappeared for five days after a glowing disc in the Arizona woods zapped him with a \"bluish ray.\" Intrigued, he'd reportedly wandered underneath the hovering object, and it abducted him. He claims he awoke on a table in a sterile-looking room surrounded by three \"well-developed fetuses\" wearing tan robes. He tried to flee, passed out, then regained consciousness only once the aliens had ditched him on the Arizona roadside.\n\nThe story received loads of publicity -- authorities thought Walton had been murdered, and seven eyewitnesses corroborating a single close encounter was unheard of. The National Enquirer ultimately paid the group $5,000 for the story, after they passed polygraphs and Walton agreed to be interviewed by the tabloid's \"prestigious\" hypnotist. In 1993, Paramount released Fire in the Sky, a movie it said was based on \"the most famous case of UFO abduction ever recorded.\" Skeptics have shot holes in what they assume was a hoax and note that James Earl Jones's NBC movie The UFO Incident had aired two weeks before Walton's own UFO incident. The encounter has a cult following to this day, though, enough that a first edition of Walton's 1978 memoir The Walton Experience now fetches hundreds of dollars online.\n\nThe Battle of Los Angeles\n\nOn February 25, 1942, reports filtered in of a glowing object floating over Culver City. Air-raid sirens sounded; the Army proceeded to pepper it with 1,400 anti-aircraft shells. Eventually it disappeared from view, but not before a citywide blackout was ordered, shell fragments got lodged in surrounding buildings, and five civilians died. The Navy later explained it had been a weather balloon. But ufologists suspected an alien spacecraft, which would explain why an hour's worth of heavy artillery had failed to eliminate a single weather balloon.\n\nSteven Spielberg would mercilessly satirize the incident in 1941, a \"comedy spectacular.\" But ufologists immediately suspected an alien spacecraft, which would explain why an hours' worth of heavy artillery had failed to eliminate a single weather balloon. Conspiracists site a famous L.A. Times photo as extra proof; it seemingly caught searchlights trained on a very un-balloon-like object getting barraged with shells. The next day's Times ran an editorial on page A1 (\"Information, Please\") demanding the Army and Navy release more info, \"if only to clarify their own conflicting statements about it.\"\n\n-- C.R.\n\n11. And Continuing Right Up to the Present Day\n\nNew encounters happen all the time -- even to famous people. When Guillermo del Toro spotted one in Guadalajara, he says, \"It was so crappy. It was a flying saucer, so clichéd, with lights.\" Above, a sampling from ufosightingsdaily.com over recent months.\n\n12. We Even Have Some Pretty Developed Theories About Why We Haven't Heard From ET Yet\n\nMaybe we're the pond scum.\n\nThe Aliens Are All Dead\n\nLet's start with the most depressing theory: Maybe we haven't found extraterrestrials because they're all dead -- at least now. The universe is 13.78 billion years old, and in that amount of time, there might have been plenty of civilizations that evolved and went extinct.\n\nThe Aliens Are All Sleeping\n\nBut maybe they're not dead -- just hibernating. Another theory suggests that perhaps there's an extraterrestrial species out there that's so advanced it cannot efficiently make use of its technology right now, because the universe's temperature is currently too high. Good news, though: The universe's temperature is cooling down (even as Earth's is heating up). So aliens may have decided to take a snooze for a few trillion years while they wait for colder weather that's more suited.\n\nThe Aliens Are Hiding\n\nIf even a genius like Stephen Hawking thought that aliens might destroy us if they ever were to find us, then maybe we should be a little afraid. Perhaps the aliens think the same thing, so they've gone into hiding -- from us. If another civilization were technologically savvy enough and had enough resources, it could build a massive orbital structure like a Dyson sphere to keep it cloaked from detection. Or it might use high-powered lasers to provide an optical façade that keeps its planet from being detected by telescopic instruments.\n\nThe Aliens Are Still Evolving\n\nMaybe alien life is actually everywhere -- it's just not intelligent enough to speak with us. It took about 3.5 billion years of evolution to turn single-celled microbes into humans. Maybe we just happened to evolve faster and earlier than everyone else.\n\nHumans Haven't Spent Enough Time Looking\n\nRealistically speaking, we've only had the proper equipment to search for aliens for a little over half a century. On the scale of the cosmos, that time frame is less than a fraction of the blink of an eye. The process could take centuries or even millennia -- optimistically speaking.\n\nThe Aliens Are Already Here\n\nThis is where the conspiracy theorists get to go nuts. Yes, maybe the aliens are already here and we just haven't figured it out yet. They might be taking some time to study us before unveiling themselves, or maybe they have already let themselves be known to certain groups. The truth isn't out there -- it's here.\n\n-- N.P.\n\n13. And in the Meantime, Aliens Can Be Whatever We Want Them to Be\n\nJoseph O. Baker is a sociologist and the co-author of the 2010 book Paranormal America.\n\nKatie Heaney: Why, when we think of aliens, do they all look the same -- three feet tall, gray or green, big black eyes?\n\nJoseph O. Baker: It didn't used to be that way. UFO narratives became much more popular in the 1950s and '60s, and during that era, the descriptions of the aliens would be almost humanlike in form. If you see drawings that some of the so-called contactees made, the aliens almost look like Swedish people -- very attractive blond types with shining eyes. The abductee narrative really took over pop culture in the 1970s and '80s, and after that, there's this homogenization of the public perception because of all the stories and TV and movies about abductions.\n\nKH: Even those guys look pretty human -- why do we have such a hard time imagining radically different forms of life?\n\nJB: We're the people doing the projecting here. Much the same way people do with God -- really, what sense does it make for a supernatural entity to have a gender or be humanoid Anthropomorphized supernatural entities tend to be more compelling.\n\nKH: Is there a reason why so many of the abduction stories feature \"probing\"?\n\nJB: The probe part of the abduction narrative took over in some sense because it tends to be the most salacious aspect of these stories. It's almost become shorthand for alien abduction. But the stories of abduction among believers are really diverse, and usually probing is only one small part of it. Men will report having sperm extraction, and women will report having eggs extracted. Positive encounters tend to be akin to religion in some ways, in which beings of higher enlightenment show people the errors of humanity, or help them reach a higher plane of consciousness.\n\nKH: Who is likely to believe?\n\nJB: Men, and people with lower levels of income, are more likely to believe. We don't really find strong patterns by education, and if we do, there's usually a slight positive effect. But one of the strongest predictors you can find for believers is their extreme distrust of the government. That's part of the reason it got so big in the '70s, when trust in institutions was low. Trump might actually increase belief in UFOs.\n\nAnother one of the strongest predictors is not participating as strongly in forms of organized religion. In some sense, there's a bit of a clue there about what's going on with belief -- it's providing an alternative belief system.\n\nKH: Most alien-encounter stories give aliens one of two motives: Either they want something from us or they want to kill us. What does that say about us?\n\nJB: It shows that we have a high level of perceived self-importance. The idea that, in this vast universe, these beings sought us out in this tiny corner of the spiral arm of the Milky Way to come learn omething\n\nfrom us, or eliminate us, is a bit flattering.\n\nKH: I've heard that sightings are way down in the smartphone era, when people presumably don't take a story as proof enough.\n\nJB: Well, it's easier to hoax things now than it used to be. I would think that with an increased availability of videos, if it was going to do anything, it might lead to more belief, but from most of what I've seen, it looks more like stasis. Rates of reported sightings and rate of belief have been pretty stable. The 2005 Baylor Religion Survey found that 25 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \"Some UFOs are probably spaceships from other worlds.\"\n\nA Brief History of 'Alien Dreams'\n\n1899: Nikola Tesla notices rhythmic sounds on a radio receiver and is convinced they're communications from Martians.\n\n1924: At the request of David Todd, former head of the astronomy department at Amherst College, the Navy agrees to limit unnecessary radio communications from its largest bases for one day so that he can listen for alien signals as Mars passes closer to Earth than it's been in over a century.\n\n1960: The modern search for ETs begins when Frank Drake uses an 85-foot radio telescope in the hills of West Virginia to scan stars for signs of intelligent life; he later develops an equation to estimate the number of advanced civilizations.\n\n1969: Jimmy Carter, candidate for Georgia governor at the time, sees a strange light.\n\n1992: NASA formally begins its own SETI program.\n\n1993: Congress eliminates funding for NASA's SETI program.\n\n1999: UC Berkeley launches SETI@home, a screen saver available to the public that enables anyone's idle computer to analyze data collected by radio telescopes.\n\n2016: Breakthrough Listen launches; it will collect as much data in a day as past SETI projects collected in a year.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the March 19, 2018, issue of New York Magazine.

                "title": "Trump Can Be Dragged Into Court for Defamation, Judge Rules",
                "body": "One maxim of constitutional law is that what's good for the goose is good for the gander. And in the case of Donald Trump, it turns out that a legal precedent set by a small, dedicated group of Republicans who had it out for President Bill Clinton now applies fully to him. Among them: George Conway, a lawyer in private practice who, as life's twists would have it, happens to be married to Kellyanne Conway.\n\nA judge in New York ruled on Tuesday that Clinton v. Jones, a unanimous Supreme Court ruling that established that a sitting president was not \"absolutely immune\" from civil lawsuits over actions he took before he was president, applies with equal force to a case brought by Summer Zervos, a former Apprentice contestant who is accusing Trump of defaming her during the presidential campaign. \"No one is above the law,\" wrote Judge Jennifer Schecter in a brisk, 18-page ruling in which she declined to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nTrump's lawyers had argued that because the 1997 decision applied only to lawsuits against the president over unofficial conduct brought in federal court, that a similar case brought in state court, like Zervos's, should be thrown out. No dice, said Schecter. \"Nothing in the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution even suggests that the President cannot be called to account before a state court for wrongful conduct that bears no relationship to any federal executive responsibility,\" the judge wrote.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that Zervos's lawsuit is alive and well and that her lawyers may now want to substantiate her claims by seeking discovery -- the exchange of materials prior to trial that may even include a deposition of Trump himself. Because he is not known to be reliable under oath, Zervos v. Trump ought to get really interesting real soon. Alternatively, Trump may choose to fight today's decision and appeal it all the way to the Supreme Court if he'd like. Far more likely, as he has done with other private suits since winning the presidency, he will just settle this one out of court and call it a day. Unless what he really wants is to set a new precedent for whichever Democrat succeeds him in the Oval Office.",

                "title": "Kudlow Wants New Tax Cut for Rich, Without Vote in Congress",
                "body": "The Trump administration's new National Economic Council director, Lawrence Kudlow, has a lifelong monomaniacal obsession with reducing taxes for the rich. Unfortunately for Kudlow and his boss, Republicans have already used up their one-per-session budget reconciliation bill, which would allow them to pass a tax cut bill with a majority vote in the Senate, unlike the normal 60-vote requirement. And since Democrats aren't about to support another tax cut for the rich -- zero supported the last one -- they're stuck for this term.\n\nOr are they? The Wall Street Journal's Richard Rubin reports that Kudlow is interested in applying an inflation index to the capital gains tax. \"Some believe Potus could do it as exec order,\" he told Rubin via email.\n\nThe policy Kudlow is describing would reduce the amount of taxable income paid by people who receive income from capital gains (mostly, by selling stock). As it stands, right now, if you bought $1,000 worth of stock, and sold it ten years later for $1,500, you would pay tax on the $500 you gained.\n\nThe tax code already confers a lot of benefits upon capital gains income. First of all, people who earn money from capital gains don't pay ordinary income tax rates, as they did in the aftermath of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. They pay a tax rate that's about half the level of taxes on ordinary income. Second, they get the additional benefit of deferring all taxes until the sale goes through. Their stock portfolio can appreciate for years or decades without any tax, unlike wage income, on which taxes are paid annually. And third, gains in stock that is passed on to heirs go completely untaxed, a massive break.\n\nConservatives have long wanted to give capital gains an additional break, by subtracting inflation from the taxable gain. So, to go back to that $500 stock gain, if inflation ran a total of 10 percent over that decade, then the IRS would knock $100 off the value of the sale, and you'd only be taxed for a $400 capital gain.\n\nRepublicans have been proposing this change for a long time but have never enacted it, in part because Democrats have opposed it as a complicated change that would give rich people a windfall for no serious economic benefit. The Congressional Budget Office published a paper analyzing it back in 1990. Kudlow is proposing that Trump would just go ahead and order the IRS to implement this change on its own, via executive order.\n\nIf Trump does this, would it stand up in court to a legal challenge? Probably not, since Congress obviously did not intend to make this change when it wrote capital gains tax laws -- but you never know what judge you might get.\n\nOf course, Republicans might oppose such a move because of their long-standing principled belief, expressed repeatedly during the Obama administration, that the president should not bypass Congress to enact unilateral -- ha ha ha, obviously they don't actually care about that stuff anymore.",

                "title": "The New Dyson V10 Picked Up Fuzzies My Bissell Left Behind",
                "body": "It's nearly spring, which means it's nearly the season of cleaning and organization. There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nThough I've never had the pleasure of owning a Dyson, I know it as the company that consistently makes me want to spend my rent money on a fancy vacuum. So when I got the opportunity to test out Dyson's new Cyclone V10 vacuum for Get It Together Week, I was excited to see what the hype was about. The \"hype\" surrounding this specific vacuum has a lot to do with remarks that founder James Dyson made during its launch this month. With the creation of the V10 -- a cordless stick vacuum that generates the same suction power as a full-size upright vacuum -- he announced that the company would no longer produce bulky, corded vacuums. In a way, you could say I'm test-driving the future of vacuums as we know it.\n\nTesting\n\nFor scientific purposes, I compared the Dyson against my scrappy handheld Bissell vacuum called the Pet Hair Eraser (which is a favorite of more than one Strat staffer). It's a small $30 Hoover that I bought a year ago because of its ecstatic reviews and low price tag. And though it's mainly designed for picking up pet hair, I use it on a large white-and-pink floor rug in my room that tends to shed more than a long-haired cat. Sometimes tufts of rug will float out into the living area like tumbleweeds (see above), so it always delights me to see the Bissell collect fistfuls of these fibers in its brushlike head.\n\nBecause it's white and tends to collect a lot of dust and dirt, the rug also made the ideal test subject for the Dyson. My Bissell is great at the bigger picture stuff, but very mediocre at sucking up the nitty-gritty dirt and crumbs. To see how they measured up, I sectioned off one half of the rug for the Dyson and another for the Bissell, and then went to town.\n\nSpecs\n\nBefore I go into actual testing, here's what you can expect from the Dyson. First, the price tag. The V10 Absolute model will set you back $700, so it's definitely on the splurgy end. But if you think about how much you clean on a yearly basis (and when you see just how well this one cleans), you might want to look into it. The V10 combines some of the best features of existing Dyson standing models: an ultrapowerful motor, a purified air filter, a hygienic dust chamber that ejects dust and dirt with the flick of a switch, plus mix and match parts that snap into place. Like other models, you can use the long rod for easy access to ceiling vents and for cleaning floors without stooping, or deconstruct the vacuum to use as a handheld option. And of the three V10 models, the Absolute comes with the most attachments.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the cordless, five-pound body. The main difference between this model and its predecessors is that the V10 comes with a longer charge (up to 60 minutes of power) and more powerful suction than ever. Charging the lithium-ion battery will take you about three hours, but once you're set, you could have an hour of deep-cleaning power at your disposal. It also has 40 percent more bin storage than older versions.\n\nPerformance\n\nTo start the vacuum, all you have to do is push a button resembling a trigger on the inside of the handle. Once it's revved up, it emits a high-pitched jet-engine hum (which explains the powerful little body this guy has). I used the \"torque driver\" cleaner head (it's specially designed for carpets) and set my vacuum to its maximum setting -- there are three -- and reader, it took less than a minute to accumulate almost a half-tank of dust. I was floored. I clean this rug almost every week, so it's apparent that the Dyson is way better at deep-cleaning carpets than the Bissell. But just to prove my case, here are snapshots of the Dyson dust chamber (overstuffed) at three minutes, and my Bissell vacuum after three minutes. It's disturbing to think about just how much dirt and dust my regular vacuum is missing on a regular basis.\n\nFor peace of mind, I even used the Dyson to go back over the areas of the rug I'd cleaned with the Bissell, and was horrified to see how much dust, crumbs, and dirt were neglected.\n\nThe only downside, if you plan on going fast and furious with the Dyson on maximum mode like I did, is that it's going to be a major drain on the battery -- don't expect more than 30 minutes of continuous cleaning on max power. And then, of course, the matter of actually paying $700 for a vacuum.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThat being said, you really do get what you pay for. Considering the sheer amount of dirt and dust this vacuum can pick up from hardwood floors, crevices, and carpets (and how fast), you'd have a hard time finding a better easy-to-use vacuum -- especially if you suffer from allergies, have pets, or own lots of dusty upholstery. If you just want to upgrade to a more powerful vacuum but can't afford the V10, sure, there are plenty of other models with great reviews and cheaper prices, like the Miele C2 or the Shark Rocket. Or, you could find a solid vacuum with a replaceable HEPA filter, like the Shark Navigator Lift-Away, if dust is your main concern.\n\nBut if there's anything I've learned from this, skimping on a cheaper model for the sake of being thrifty isn't worth the drop in quality, and once you've tried the Dyson, it's hard to turn back. For the power, the results, and all of the extra cleaning gadgets, it would be worth it to go the extra mile and invest in a deeper clean and a top-of-the-line vacuum. And who knows? Maybe you'll even end up seeing a sexy new V10 in my next Strat Haul.\n\nDyson Cyclone V10 Absolute Cord-Free Stick Vacuum $700 at Bed Bath & Beyond GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "Cynthia Nixon has been a candidate for New York governor for roughly 24 hours -- and allies of Andrew Cuomo are already attacking her with fire and fury (and/or, condescension and contempt) like the Sex and the City star has definitely seen.\n\n\"Cynthia Nixon was opposed to having a qualified lesbian become mayor of New York City,\" former City Council speaker Christine Quinn told the New York Post Tuesday, referring to Nixon's decision to endorse Bill de Blasio over herself in the 2013 New York City mayoral race. \"Now she wants to be an unqualified lesbian to be the governor of New York. You have to be qualified and have experience. She isn't qualified to be the governor.\"\n\nIt seems unlikely that Nixon opposed Quinn's 2013 candidacy because she did not like the idea of a \"qualified lesbian\" running the Big Apple (and even less likely, that this objection was rooted in a belief that only unqualified lesbians are fit to hold public office). And Quinn subsequently clarified on Twitter that she did not actually believe this was the case.\n\nThe former City Council speaker came closer to landing a clean punch in questioning how Nixon would be able to manage a complex state bureaucracy when \"she's never run an organization.\" By contrast, Quinn argued, Cuomo had already proven his competence and progressive values by passing a $15 minimum wage and marriage quality, and \"opposing fracking.\"\n\n\"Why are we having this primary?\" Quinn asked. \"Democrats should be united and focusing on winning control of the State Senate and taking back the House of Representatives.\"\n\nOne answer to Quinn's question: Progressives believe (with some cause) that Cuomo has abetted GOP control of the State Senate by coddling the turncoat Democrats of the IDC and approving gerrymandered district maps that aid upstate Republicans -- and (with indisputable cause) that Albany is a bastion of corruption where well-heeled interests (most conspicuously, New York City developers) can purchase favors at bargain prices.\n\nNixon referred to the latter point in her response to Quinn. \"Her being a lesbian and my being a lesbian\" is not the issue, the gubernatorial candidate told the Post, adding that the race was about \"the corruption in Albany. It's time for an outsider. I'm not an Albany insider.\"",

                "body": "Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson gave an ill-considered explanation for purchasing a $31,000 mahogany dining set on the taxpayer dime: It was all his wife's fault.\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since details of the lavish, now-canceled purchase were revealed, Carson told a congressional oversight committee on Tuesday that he had asked Candy Carson to help him out with selecting new furniture, then gone back to focusing on his core duties, like helping President Trump try to gut his agency.\n\n\"I left it with my wife,\" he said. \"The next thing that I, quite frankly, heard about it was that this $31,000 table had been bought.\"\n\nCarson has come under fire for giving family members unprecedented sway at HUD, but apparently he's not above scapegoating them when his reputation is on the line.\n\nCarson also said that once he was made aware of the prohibitive dining-set cost, he nixed the purchase immediately. And he emphasized that he and his wife are both very thrifty people, by nature.\n\n\"If it were up to me I would decorate my office like a hospital waiting room,\" he said.\n\nStill, he maintained, the furniture needed replacing -- if only for safety's sake. He described a potentially dangerous office environment in which \"people were stuck by nails, and a chair had collapsed with someone sitting in it.\" (Everyone knows you can't find a safe dining-room table for anything under $15,000.)\n\nA whistleblower at HUD said that she had been demoted after reporting that the furniture exceeded the $5,000 legal cost limit. She was allegedly told that \"$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair.\"\n\nA HUD spokesman initially claimed that \"career staffers in charge of the building\" were to blame for the dining set, but internal emails told a very different story.\n\nScott Pruitt's habit of sitting in first class to avoid the wrath of apopleptic liberals is looking pretty good by comparison right now.",

                "title": "What Was Cambridge Analytica Doing in Developing Countries?",
                "body": "After two years' worth of stories about the shady acquisition and subsequent mishandling of Facebook profile data by the political consultants Cambridge Analytica and its contractors, the general public and the politicians that represent them finally seem ready to take on the company -- and, more importantly, take on Facebook for enabling it. The U.K.'s Information Commissioner is seeking a warrant to seize Cambridge Analytica's servers. Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, has written an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg demanding answers about how often user data was illegitimately passed on to third parties.\n\nThe truth is, though, as invasive and troubling as this data-harvesting might have been in the U.S. and U.K., it was likely much worse in the developing countries in which Cambridge Analytica claimed to have been experimenting.\n\nIn an undercover sting for Channel 4 in the U.K., executives at Cambridge Analytica, including CEO Alexander Nix, were caught on tape bragging about how the company tries to compromise politicians. They also spoke about how the firm essentially ran political campaigns. In Kenya, for example, \"We have rebranded the entire party twice, written their manifesto, done two rounds of 50,000 surveys,\" Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica's political division states. \"Then we'd write all the speeches and we'd stage the whole thing. So just about every element of his campaign.\"\n\nIt's possible that Turnbull and Nix were overstating their influence in their capacities as salesmen. But they're not the only people claiming that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, has been operating with little restraint in countries that have fewer (or no) regulations or laws governing the collection and use of data about citizens. As the Times reported this past weekend on the SCL Group:\n\nSCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.\n\nWhatever you might say about Cambridge Analytica's effects on U.S. elections (and the jury is still out about the company's actual power), the danger for data-harvesting companies to disrupt politics -- not to mention the threat to user privacy -- is much more profound in countries like Kenya, which have abundant internet access (Quartz writes,\"Mobile penetration among Kenya's 44 million people is almost at 90%, and the country has one of the fastest mobile internet speeds in the world\"), but lack strong or comprehensive regulations on digital privacy.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of the global power of the new generation of internet companies is their ability (and willingness) to use smaller and developing countries as testing grounds for their new products -- in particular, for initiatives they couldn't get away with in the U.S. For years, Facebook has tried to violate the principle of net neutrality by striking deals to make Facebook not count against mobile data caps (in India, Facebook's Free Basics program was met with heavy criticism). In Myanmar, Facebook basically is the internet, and it has been accused by the U.N. of fueling the genocide there through misinformation and fake news, also prevalent during Kenya's volatile elections last year. A few months ago, Facebook devastated publishers in six smaller countries by moving their posts into a separate, less-viewed feed called Explore. The test wasn't so funny to the news sites that watched their traffic get slashed in half during an experiment that they hadn't agreed to take part of.\n\nData-centric companies like Cambridge Analytica and Facebook love places that lack basic privacy regulations for obvious reasons. For companies like them, the question of whether or not something is right is the same as asking whether it's legal. This attitude also explains why so many large tech companies shun regulation: It would unambiguously confirm that they were in the wrong.",

                "title": "What's in Cookbook Author Molly Yeh's Kitchen",
                "body": "It's nearly spring, which means it's nearly the season of cleaning and organization. There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nIf you're 1 of the over 279,000 people who follow Molly Yeh on Instagram or read her blog, My Name Is Yeh, you've gotten a peek at her beautifully organized kitchen, tucked away in a generations-old farmhouse on the North Dakota-Minnesota border where her husband is an actual farmer. \"It was purely influenced by Pinterest, and my lofty goals of having all my grains and all of my flours and all of my sugars in cute little Ball jars,\" says Yeh, author of the award-winning cookbook Molly on the Range and, more recently, a Short Stack Editions book all about yogurt. \"But the moment I had to start refilling them, I was kind of like, 'Screw this.'\"\n\nThe truth is that the pots, pans, bowls, and kitchen appliances you regularly see on Yeh's Instagram represent only a small fraction of her cooking gear. \"We have a second living room that, right now, is the prop room, and it's just covered in shelves with pots and pans. It's not the ideal way to store everything, but at this point, our house is bursting at the seams.\" The stuff she uses every day -- like her go-to Staub cast-iron pots and Le Creuset skillets, a couple of small metal pots, and \"one stack of everyday plates and bowls\" -- stays in the kitchen, where she cooks and bakes daily. (When I called her, she was mid-recipe, trying to re-create a recipe for a mint-olive-oil cake that she tasted on a recent trip to Los Angeles. In an Instagram story from earlier in the day, she described the green-cake mess as \"Kermit guts.\") But other than that, she says, \"if it's something I'm just going to use for one recipe, or for one special dish, I'll keep it in my prop room and bring it out.\"\n\nSo to understand how Yeh keeps her kitchen looking picture-perfect without forgoing function, and keeps track of all of the kitchen gear in her house, I asked the cookbook author and food blogger to show me what's in her kitchen and share some of her best kitchen organization ideas.\n\nLodge 10-Inch Seasoned Carbon Steel Skillet With Silicone Sleeve Handle $40 at Bed Bath and Beyond Le Creuset L2081-284T Raymond Loewy Skillet, 11-Inch, Turquoise $300 at Amazon $300 at Amazon\n\n\"That is a Lodge skillet, that's the black one, and underneath it is this limited-edition Le Creuset. This skillet came out, and I saw a picture of it, and I was like, 'I need that immediately.' Everything in my kitchen needs to be extremely sturdy because I'm going to use the fuck out of it. No cheap things that might break make it past a few weeks in my kitchen. So if it's sturdy, it can come into my kitchen. And if it's sturdy, and it looks cool, then that is the ultimate piece of kitchenware for me. I love things that are a pop of color and that are heavy-duty and that will live up to being used multiple times a day. So that turquoise piece is super fun because it's unique, and it looks fun on the wall and on my stove and in Instagrams. And I always think it's going to fall down, but my husband, who hung the hook, swears that it is a very sturdy hook; it's going to be fine.\"\n\n5 Custom Spice Bottles\n\n\"Those are handmade spice canisters. It was a line that Vitrified Studio did for West Elm. The ones that are up, I believe are nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. There's red pepper and paprika in the set. She does custom ones, too, so eventually I want to order a custom set with za'atar and sumac and maybe harissa -- other spices I use a lot. They're hand-stamped with the words on them.\"\n\n$125 at Etsy Reditainer Deli Food Storage Containers With Lid, 32-Ounce, 24-Pack\n\n\"A lot of my spices and grains and stuff are in deli containers from the WebstaurantStore. I order them in bulk; they're like a dollar for a million. I store my leftovers in them, too, and if I accidentally forget about a leftover, and it's disgusting, you don't feel bad throwing them away. Or if guests come over and I want to send them home with leftovers, then I can just give them a forget-about deli container, and they don't have to worry about getting it back to me. We had this huge bin of Tupperware containers, and we could never find lids, and finally, like two months ago, we cleaned it out completely, and now we only use these deli containers with the same lid, and our life, in that corner of the house, is so much more relaxed now.\"\n\n$13 at Amazon $13 at Amazon Sterilite, 24 Quart / 22.7 Liter Modular Latch Box\n\n\"It's in a little hand-carved vase that I believe is from Carey Nershi, her dad hand-carves wood, and in them are some little cake bunting flags that were made by my friend in Fargo, and they're made out of vintage shirts, the little flags. Whenever I travel, whenever I see a cooking store, I just have to go in and see what types of cute little pops of color will fit in my suitcase. My biggest collection is sprinkles and cookie cutters and cake-decorating items, so they're just things that I'm always on the hunt for. And there's no end to the amount of cookie cutters I will make room for in my house. I have a drawer and a bin, and some other random ones lying about. I have these big Rubbermaid six-gallon tubs. Those I also get from the WebstaurantStore, and they're good for storage. I have my cookie cutters in one, I have some grains in other ones, and you can store soup in them. They're very durable. But they're ugly, so I don't like putting them on my open shelving. Tubs are the best.\"\n\nEditor's note: These are not the exact tubs that Yeh uses, but they are a similar size.\n\n$6 at Walmart KitchenAid Artisan 5-Quart Stand Mixer in Ice $380 at Bed Bath and Beyond SMEG 50's Retro Style 2-Slice Toaster $150 at Bed Bath and Beyond\n\n\"I use my KitchenAid all the time. My mom gave me this KitchenAid, and that is another example of something that's very solid and sturdy and does the job on a daily basis, but is also pistachio-colored and fun to look at. Same thing with the Smeg toaster.\"\n\nCuisinart Custom 14-Cup Food Processor\n\n\"I love my Cuisinart. The last Cuisinart that I had was my mom's, so it was decades old, and the stick part that activates the machine was made out of plastic, and it broke. So when I got this new one, I saw it was metal, and I was like, 'Oh, great. This will last forever.' And it does. The biggest test that my Cuisinart gets is when I make almond butter. I make a marzipan butter, which is blanched almonds and sugar, essentially. But it has to blend for, like, 20 minutes, and in that time, the Cuisinart gets really hot, and you think it's going to take off into outer space. But it does the job! That's how you know it's a keeper.\"\n\n$200 at Bed Bath and Beyond Mauviel M'passion Copper 4.9-Quart Beating Bowl With Ring\n\n\"The copper bowl is Mauviel. I use it for whipping egg whites, and it's become my favorite arm workout: whipping egg whites by hand. And the shape just really lends itself well to long periods of whisking.\"\n\n$100 at Bed Bath and Beyond Smeg Full Size Refrigerator (Right Hinge, Pastel Blue)\n\n\"For a while, when we first moved in, there was this huge, old refrigerator that was almond-colored, and I hated it, and anytime that I would take pictures in my kitchen, I would try to only take pictures of the shelves and just ignore the refrigerator. So that left me limited space to take pictures with, and I kept seeing Smegs online and in pictures, though, and they're so beautiful. We kept the old, ugly refrigerator. That's in the prop room now. It's the same sort of system as my dishes. It stores a lot of lesser-used ingredients, and then the Smeg in my kitchen stores all of the things, like eggs and butter and yogurt and hot sauce, that I use on a very regular basis. If I didn't work with food every day, or maybe if I lived in a city, I think the Smeg would be the perfect size, but because I'm actually cooking every day, I need to have that second fridge. And we have a deep freezer. We have a second freezer also, in our garage.\"\n\n$1,999 at West Elm Seafoam Enamelware Plates From $7 at Farmhouse Pottery Seafoam Enamel Utility Bowl Set $32 at Farmhouse Pottery Pantry Bowl From $32 at Farmhouse Pottery\n\n\"The light-blue dishes are enamelware, and then the ceramic ones are Farmhouse Pottery. Actually, the enamel are from Farmhouse Pottery also. They're super sturdy. We use our enamelware plates for something like pizza night, where we don't need to use forks and knives on them, and we don't have to worry about scratching them up. I use the little enamelware bowls anytime I'm separating eggs, or if I need a bowl for my compost or my trash on the counter. I just use one of those. But as far as mixing stuff, I'll use the ceramic bowls, so I don't have to worry about scratching them.\"\n\nA Modern Way to Cook: 150+ Vegetarian Recipes for Quick, Flavor-Packed Meals $22 at Amazon $22 at Amazon The New Midwestern Table: 200 Heartland Recipes $25 at Amazon $25 at Amazon\n\n\"Even if it's a new cookbook that I really, really love, but it's very niche, those are the ones I usually take to bed and I have next to my nightstand -- not the ones that I keep out in the kitchen, the ones I'm always looking at. Right now, there are two Ottolenghi books up there. Anna Jones's Modern Way to Cook, that's a book I open up all the time. Amy Thielen's Midwestern Table has a pizza-crust recipe that we make almost every Friday.\"\n\nJot & Mark Recipe Card Complete Gift Box (Lemon Zest)\n\n\"Then with the recipe box, I have recipes in there that might not be from a book, or they might be from online that I've printed out, and they're also recipes that I use all the time. My go-to sugar-cookie recipe is in there; there's a bibimbap recipe in there that we make all the time. And just random recipe cards that we get from friends. People still do that around here, I didn't know. My stepmom gave me the recipe box. I think she might've gotten it from Paper Source.\"\n\nEditor's note: This exact recipe tin is no longer available, but this one from Jot & Mark is similar in colorful, vintage style, and function.\n\n$27 at Amazon $27 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "Ex-Con Blankenship Screwing Up GOP Plan to Take Down Manchin",
                "body": "Of all the \"Trump Ten\" Democratic senators from states carried by the president in 2016 who are facing reelection this November, West Virginia's Joe Manchin is fighting the strongest MAGA tide. Trump won his highest percentage in the Mountain State, defeating Hillary Clinton by a 69/26 margin. Enthusiasm for the 45th president in\n\nWest Virginia has not flagged; according to Gallup, his average job approval rating in the state during 2017 was 61 percent -- again, the highest in the country.\n\nSo despite Manchin's popularity in the state (his job approval ratio as of the end of 2017, according to Morning Consult, was 52/36), he attracted two A-list Republican opponents: U.S. Representative Evan Jenkins, who represents coal country's Third Congressional District, and Attorney General Pat Morrisey. But as a May 8 primary approaches, it's a third candidate who has all the momentum and is seriously worrying Republicans: former mine owner Dan Blankenship. A prominent figure in West Virginia economic and political life for years, Blankenship gained national notoriety during his prosecution by the Justice Department for his alleged role in a 2010 mine explosion in West Virginia that killed 29 workers. He was acquitted of the felony charges the Feds wanted, but was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards, and served a year in a federal prison in California.\n\nNot long after Blankenship hit the bricks, he launched an unlikely Senate bid, which appears largely designed to reboot his brand. Thanks to his high name ID, his wealth, and his willingness to go after his GOP opponents, he's soon become a formidable candidate, as Politico reports:\n\nBlankenship's rise has been driven in part by his self-financed TV ads. Since launching his campaign in late November, Blankenship has spent over $1.1 million on roughly a dozen commercials, according to media buying totals, far surpassing his opponents. Morrisey has so far spent nothing on TV ads and Jenkins only about $38,000.\n\nBlankenship has used the ads to paint his rivals as insufficiently conservative, blasting Jenkins over his positions on Obamacare and climate change, and Morrisey on abortion. He's positioned himself as an unshakable ally of President Donald Trump, who received 68 percent of the vote in the state.\n\nJenkins is somewhat vulnerable as a former longtime Democratic state legislator who only became a Republican in 2013 when he decided to run for Congress. And Blankenship has gone after Morrisey for his law firm's links to pharmaceutical companies, and his wife's law firm's representation of Planned Parenthood.\n\nObjective public polls in this contest are hard to come by, but the consensus is that the race has become a close three-way fight. A new Morrisey-commissioned poll shows Jenkins dropping into third place behind Blankenship, who is right behind Morrisey.\n\nA Manchin-Blankenship general election would be nasty and personal. The senator has said of the mine owner: \"I believe Don has blood on his hands.\" And Blankenship has charged that Manchin, who was governor at the time of the mine explosion, conspired with Barack Obama (not a popular figure in West Virginia) to send him to the hoosegow.\n\nNational Republicans understandably fear that this kind of grudge match would move a key Senate race away from the partisan and ideological issues where they have a big advantage in West Virginia. And even if Blankenship fades before May 8, he's doing some damage to the other two candidates.\n\nWest Virginians seem split over Blankenship's culpability in the death of the miners; their tendency to forgive him reflects the ancient dependence of the state on vanishing coal jobs and their defensiveness about federal efforts to regulate the industry. But if Blankenship makes it through the GOP primary, voters will have to come to grips with his decidedly mixed legacy, and his stretch in the slammer.",

                "title": "I Suddenly Want a Yin Yang on Everything I Buy",
                "body": "The yin yang, a circle made up of two tadpole-shaped curves chasing each other, is the symbol for Chinese philosophy of Taoism. It stands for the balancing of opposites, and neither the yin nor the yang can exist without the other.\n\nIf I close my eyes and look backward in time, to around 1997, I see yin yangs as part of a montage of earnest images, including Lisa Frank illustrations in radioactive neon colors, jagged \"best friend\" heart necklaces, plastic peace-sign necklaces, and Skechers. In hindsight, my cohort and I seemed weirdly fixated on both the hippie iconography of our baby-boomer parents' youth, and some kind of space-age future, with silver sneakers that lit up.\n\nLately, if I open my eyes and look around my current settings, I see yin yangs again. Not only do I see them, I want them -- even more than I want to avoid looking like I've just emerged from a head shop. That's why I impulse-bought a pair of yin-yang stud earrings this weekend. Now, I'm poking around the internet, looking for a cropped white T-shirt with a big yin yang on the front. A wool yin-yang clutch (above) from London designer Milena Silvano is sold out, but -- great news -- is getting restocked in May. But there's plenty more to be had: Suddenly, this hippie icon turned Y2K motif is back is fashion again.\n\nMicro-trends can usually be explained by trendy people, so I consulted one: Mina Alyeshmerni, who lives in Brooklyn and owns the online boutique Maimoun, where she carries pieces by Maryam Nassir Zadeh, Baserange, and Mondo Mondo, among other designers. Alyeshmerni also uses a yin yang on her website, as a decal on the browser tab. \"I tend to take things more personally than I wish, so using the symbol has been serving as this visual reminder that spaces of positivity and spaces of negativity can live together a bit more rhythmically than we think,\" she says. \"It's a little comedic to me that growing up\" -- in the '90s -- \"I didn't quite know what this symbol meant. It was just so omnipresent.\"\n\nSame goes for Nick Poe, the creative manager of Sky Ting Yoga who's adorned the New York studio's gear with yin yangs. \"I grew up in the '90s and the symbol reminds me of St. Marks Place. You'd go there and girls would get their ears or belly button pierced and get yin-yang jewelry,\" he says. \"It got kind of played out. But it really is too beautiful a symbol to be played out. We're using it earnestly.\"\n\nSo the yin yang has returned again, this time courtesy of people in their 30s who were too young to take it very seriously the first time around. But you need not wear the yin yang in earnest: The internet is full of T-shirts with alien heads replacing the yin-yang dots, or yin yangs made out of cuddling cats. However you do it, wear one -- on a T-shirt, on some socks, on earrings -- and you will likely emit some positive, peaceful vibes. Or you'll seem like you're on a nostalgia trip. Or maybe it's a balance between the two.\n\nEarrings with yin yangs Chuvora Jewelry Chinese Yin Yang Stud Earrings\n\nTechnically, I didn't buy these; mine came from a local shop and had celestial drawings on the package. But these are a true dupe and are sterling silver, not generic metal, so the material won't irritate skin.\n\n$15 at Amazon $15 at Amazon Plain Yin Yang Earrings\n\nThese all-silver studs are a pared-down take on an already fairly pared-down symbol. Good for anyone looking for a subtle yin yang.\n\n$10 at Etsy Bags with yin yangs Yin Yang Standard Baggu\n\nBaggu, always good with a print, has also put out an homage to the yin yang.\n\n$10 at Baggu 3D Zip Set\n\nAnd for anyone ready to lean into head-shop iconography: Baggu has a three-pack of zip pouches with not just yin yangs, but smiley faces and peace signs.\n\n$32 at Baggu T-shirts with yin yangs Shirt Planet Yin-Yang T-Shirt\n\nFor those who like to keep things simple, this is the plainest yin-yang tee to be found.\n\n$18 at Amazon $18 at Amazon Space Yin Yang T-shirt\n\nAnd for a galactic twist: The black yang is actually a print of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\n$16 at Amazon $16 at Amazon Stussy Stock Yin-Yang Tee\n\nUnabashedly '90s.\n\n$34 at Spring Shorts with yin yangs Fenty Puma by Rihanna Tearaway Mini Shorts\n\nThese nylon shorts are reminiscent of vintage boxing shorts.\n\n$80 at Neiman Marcus Boardies Yin Yang Swim Short\n\nFrom far away, these look like polka dots. Up close, it's a Taoist reminder of the balanced universe.\n\n$70 at Need Supply Odds and ends with yin yangs Assembly Cotton Yin Yang Hat\n\nOne of my favorite yin yang accessories out there, this hat (it comes in blue as well) has a bit of a New York street-vendor vibe, but instead of blasting \"Brooklyn,\" you just get some peaceful, loving graphic design.\n\n$30 at Spring Beholder All Good Pin\n\nA two-in-one: a yin yang with a side smiley.\n\n$10 at Urban Outfitters Yin Yang Bath Mat\n\nIf actually wearing a yin yang feels like too much of a commitment, try a simple bath mat to jazz up your sink area.\n\n$24 at Spring GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "Congress Sheds Controversial Riders on Giant Spending Bill",
                "body": "The U.S. House of Representatives missed its own internal deadline of midnight Monday for releasing the text of a massive omnibus appropriations bill that will fund the federal government until October. But reports are seeping out that negotiators have tossed out a lot of the controversial \"riders\" (extraneous policy provisions) that threatened to foul up the process. This will anger their sponsors, but probably reduces the odds of another government shutdown when the stopgap spending bill enacted in February expires.\n\nIt appears at this point that the huge spending package will not include an immigration deal, Obamacare stabilization, an online sales tax authorization, Planned Parenthood defunding, or a funding cutoff for \"sanctuary cities.\" There's still interest in the Hudson River Gateway tunnel project, but the president has threatened to veto the whole bill if that's included. There's also been talk of Veterans Administration reforms being tossed in, but it's looking less likely as time runs out.\n\nExtension of Federal Aviation Administration funding still seems likely, along with some sort of additional disaster money. And believe it or not, negotiators are still talking about gun regulation, as the Hill reports:\n\nAmong the more surprising riders still in play is a bipartisan bill designed to bolster the background check system before gun sales. The House had passed the Fix National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) bill earlier in the year, but it's gone nowhere in the Senate after House Republicans paired it with partisan legislation expanding the right of gun owners to carry concealed weapons nationwide -- a nonstarter with most Democrats.\n\n\"Fix NICS is on the table, however, there is a little bit of resistance because that had been coupled with concealed-carry reciprocity before and now it's not,\" Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) said as he left Monday's meeting.\n\nThis could be an example of a poison pill no longer being a poison pill because its own poison pill was removed.\n\nThe missed deadline last night does mean that the House cannot vote on the omnibus until Thursday. And that will leave very little time for the Senate to make changes that have not already been negotiated.\n\nThe main source of disgruntlement at the shape of this bill will be among House conservatives, who don't like the higher spending levels and who have championed several of the dropped riders. But as is often the case, House Democrats are likely to supply enough votes for the bill to make the loss of some House Freedom Caucus members unimportant.\n\nIf the omnibus passes, the year's funding disputes can finally be laid to rest until the fall, when you can probably expect a stopgap spending bill to get Congress past the midterm elections. It's a hell of a way to do business, but like so many aspects of 21st-century politics, we're getting used to it.",

                "title": "I Really, Really Love This Popular-in-Brooklyn Incense",
                "body": "Palo santo is a tree that grows along the coast of South America -- in Spanish, the name means holy wood. Its uses are varied: It relieves, apparently, symptoms of the common cold, anxiety, inflammation, headaches, and depression. It cleanses like sage, and it's smoke is used to keep away mosquitoes. It's native to Mexico, the Yucatán Peninsula, Peru, Venezuela, and also, as of the last couple years, to every charming homeware store in Brooklyn.\n\nNot the whole tree, readers! Just bundles of its wood, twined together and sold in pretty paper boxes by Incausa, a Greenpoint-based incense company that stocks sticks of palo santo in 40 stores in Brooklyn alone. They -- like their brethren, Marvis toothpaste and Group Partner boob vases -- have reached Ubiquitous-in-Brooklyn status, which is probably why I received two packs of the stuff when I made the move from an apartment in East Williamsburg (where there are no shortage of shops with Incausa sticks) to a slightly strange-smelling apartment in Fort Greene (where there are, also, no shortage of shops with Incausa sticks).\n\nI was wary of the incense, as I am of all scented things -- I get migraines, and even the mildest candles and perfumes make my head swim. But, eager to conceal the lived-in smell that clung to my new place, I decided to try it out. Like a velvet couch or cashmere pajama pants, the scent is cozy: It's smoky and piney and, if you march around the perimeter of your apartment with it, the whole place will soon smell faintly, yet powerfully, woodsy, like a spring hike after a rainstorm. Another nice thing is that it needs no incense accoutrements -- it can be lit and then set on a table or chair to smoke away, all on its own. And it lasts -- the pack that was gifted to me in December, and which I have lit near daily since, seems like it might have another couple of months' worth left in it.\n\nI would be remiss not to add that the incense makes a near perfect hostess gift -- in fact, if I were a more organized person, I would likely order a couple dozen packs of it. \"Oh, this,\" I'd say, handing the box (which is pretty enough that it needn't be wrapped) to the casual acquaintance who has apparently invited me to her housewarming party. \"It smells wonderful.\" At this point, having pleased my imaginary friend, I'd probably drop this fun fact: \"Before the business picked up, the owners used to sell it off a folding table on Bedford Avenue on sunny days.\"\n\nAll said, I love this incense and I'm glad this tree('s scent continues to) grow (in popularity) in Brooklyn.\n\nPalo Santo Wood Hand-Pressed Incense $12 at Goop More Incense That We Like The Incense Match Assorted 15-Pack\n\n\"As their name implies, Incense Matches are books of matches that are also incense sticks. They come in 16 different fragrances, like coconut, musk, Goddess of Egypt, and sandalwood. Light one, burn it down a quarter of an inch, and it emits a few smoke tendrils of scent before it extinguishes. It's a brief wisp of fragrant smoke. No need to turn your bathroom into a donation-based yoga studio.\" -- Margaret Rhodes\n\n$17 at Amazon $17 at Amazon Nippon Kodo Kayuragi Japanese Incense Sticks\n\n\"The scent was delicate but powerful. Not in a nose-singeing, throat-scratching, dorm-room patchouli kind of way, but more like I'd stumbled into a dewy meadow or sun-dappled timberland and inhaled with all my might. Whisper-soft, warm and woodsy, mellow, calming. It's what I imagine those #forestbathing Instagrams would smell like if they were scratch-and-sniff. More impressively, the scent lingered in the air for hours. I could light a stick at 9 p.m. and still smell it the next morning.\" -- Ashlea Halpern\n\n$12 at Amazon $12 at Amazon 7 Scent Sampler Wood Incense With Holder\n\n\"When burned, it gives off the invigorating, pleasantly rustic aroma of a campfire or fireplace, with no perfumey or musky qualities. The scent is strong enough to linger for a day or two, but not overpowering or occultish. And, because they require at least 30 seconds of exposure to a flame to catch (and sometimes need to be relit), each brick of Incienso de Santa Fe comes with the opportunity to feel (a degree of) the satisfaction of starting and tending to a fire on a camping trip. It's like a quick jaunt to Vail, only you get to stay inside.\" -- Caroline Bankoff\n\n$10 at Amazon $10 at Amazon Balsam Sticks and Holder\n\n\"There is no mystery to this incense. It's a fire in a cabin in the New England woods -- almost literally. The company has been making incense since 1931 in Auburn, Maine. The website's \"About Us\" page tells how \"local woodsmen\" bring balsam branches to the factory, which are dried and placed into incense molds. On that same page is a slightly pixelated vertical shot of one of the two company dogs, and a tribute to Terry, the octogenarian most-valued employee. The design is that of an old product that suddenly finds itself cool. And instead of spindly sticks, this incense comes in 40 squat little logs that fit seamlessly into a round hole cut into a square of unfinished wood that serves as the incense stand.\" -- Belle Cushing\n\n$8 at Amazon $8 at Amazon Shun-you Beckoning Spring Incense Sticks\n\n\"A friend of mine who was a sound artist and also a Japanese incense dealer (which sounds like he sells drugs) would come over to sell all these different kinds of incense. Of all of them, this one stuck in my head because I realized it's the same exact one that they use in the R by 45rpm store. I smelled it and said, \"Oh my god.\" I literally can't live without this stuff. I travel with it. It's how my apartment smells. I use a little incense holder that I've probably had since Reggae Fest 1985 in San Francisco.\" -- Carlos Quirarte\n\n$26 at Amazon $26 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "All the 37 Billion Ways Facebook Is Hurting Right Now",
                "body": "Over the weekend, the New York Times and the Observer published two extensive reports on third parties who obtained, saved, and hoarded Facebook data in violation of the site's policies. Depending on whom you ask, this was a data breach, the system working as designed, or somehow, both. It was a brutal Saturday. And it hasn't gotten any better.\n\nTop executives like Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have been completely silent on the matter. Instead, company leaders like Andrew Bosworth and Alex Stamos have apparently been thrown to the Twitter wolves -- both men have spent the last day or so arguing over the semantics of the word breach, among other things. The New York Times reports that \"Facebook's communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos's tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.\" Stamos later deleted a series of posts.\n\nAnd that was before the markets opened! Facebook stock dropped 7 percent on Monday. That's its steepest one-day decline since March of 2014, ending the day at $172.56 per share. It's lost about $37 billion in value total.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is probing Facebook to figure out whether it mishandled user data, and whether other incidents similar to Cambridge Analytica have occurred. According to former Facebook employee Sandy Parakilas, the answer is \"definitely.\" Parakilas's role at Facebook was to investigate data breaches like the one Cambridge Analytica was involved in, where a third party transfers Facebook data to another third party. The Guardian reports:\n\nAsked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: \"Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.\"\n\nAnd:\n\nHe said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: \"Do you really want to see what you'll find?\" Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that \"Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn't know about the abuse that was happening\".\n\n(Parakilas left Facebook in 2012.)\n\nIn the meantime, Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, issued a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to respond to six wide-ranging questions by April 13. The first one: \"How many incidents during the past ten years is Facebook aware of in which third parties collected or processed user data in violation of Facebook's Platform Policies? Please describe each incident, the number of users whose information was collected and misused, and what steps Facebook took to remedy the violation.\" Wyden also asked whether Facebook is taking any steps to inform the 50 million users whose data was passed along to Cambridge Analytica (one can presume that Facebook is resistant to this idea).\n\nAbroad, Mark Zuckerberg has been called before a parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom. Damian Collins, head of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, wrote to the CEO: \"[T]he Committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular, about whether data had been taken without their consent. Your officials' answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading the Committee.\"\n\nRather than face public scrutiny, the Verge reports that Zuckerberg will instead field questions from Facebook employees at an emergency all-hands meeting today. Zuckerberg is notably more candid at these gatherings than he is in public; at the same time, Facebook's employees regard their leader uncritically, to say the least.",

                "title": "In Illinois Primaries, Abortion Is the Big Issue",
                "body": "Tuesday's primary elections in Illinois encompass an insanely expensive governor's race and several competitive congressional contests. There is, however, more than a little malaise surrounding politics in this famously machine-run and often corrupt state. But it's hard to discern before the results are in whether the sour mood will aid insurgents or simply suppress turnout to the point that the favorites will steer clear of trouble.\n\nBeneath the heavy clouds of money dominating the Illinois primaries there are at least two contests where mirror-image conflicts over abortion policy are attracting passionate attention.\n\nIn the Democratic race for the party's nomination in Chicago's third congressional district, incumbent Dan Lipinski is in serious danger of losing to first-time candidate Marie Newman thanks in no small part to his long-standing record of opposing abortion rights (Lipinski has also voted against his party on other issues, including the Affordable Care Act and the DREAM Act). While the House Democratic leadership has dutifully gotten behind Lipinski despite his heresies, many local progressives -- including two of Lipinski's House colleagues from Chicago and notable alumni of the Obama campaigns and White House -- have endorsed Newman, who is also getting significant material help from pro-choice groups.\n\nAll signs -- including the closest thing we have to an independent public poll, taken for NARAL by Public Policy Polling at the end of February -- show a very close Lipinski/Newman race. Despite the Democratic enemies he's made, he's been endorsed by the state and local branches of the AFL-CIO (though SEIU has endorsed Newman), and there's a dynastic factor, too: Lipinski's father represented the district before he all but deeded it to his son. A wild card is the possibility that some anti-abortion Republicans might vote in the Democratic primary to save Lipinski (as they can under the state's open-primary system); that's exactly what National Review is encouraging conservative voters in the district to do.\n\nBut anti-abortion voters in both parties may be torn, since pro-choice Republican governor Bruce Rauner is also facing a serious primary challenge from state legislator Jeanne Ives, who has made Rauner's flip-flop on an abortion-funding bill the great symbol of his ideological infidelity. Ives is being backed not only by National Review and the anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List, but by an assortment of her fellow Republican state legislators. The very limited public polling of this primary shows Rauner comfortably ahead (by a 51/31 margin according to a Southern Illinois University poll in late February), and he's mostly focused on his potential general-election opponents. Anyone, however, who remembers the long recent history of cultural conservatives defeating moderates in GOP primaries would be reluctant to write Ives off.\n\nBut Rauner is trying hard to drown his opponents in both parties in a sea of money. A venture capitalist and private-equity manager before entering politics in 2014, Rauner has contributed an estimated $5o million to his own campaign, and has run $16.5 million in TV ads (as compared to $2.8 million for Ives) during the primary season. He's received another $20 million from billionaire backer Ken Griffin.\n\nIf everything tomorrow goes as generally expected, though, Rauner will face a general-election opponent with even deeper pockets than his own. The Democratic gubernatorial front-runner throughout the campaign has been billionaire J.B. Pritzker, another venture capitalist from one of America's wealthiest families. Pritzker has sunk $70 million into his own campaign so far. But he's struggled to put away his two main primary rivals, progressive state legislator Daniel Biss and businessman (and Robert F. Kennedy's son) Chris Kennedy.\n\nAside from regular poundings he's received from both primary opponents and from Rauner, Pritzker has been targeted by the Chicago Tribune with investigative reporting that has highlighted his family's offshore holdings and his links to the twin symbols of Democratic machine politics in the state, imprisoned former governor Rod Blagojevich and state House speaker (and Democratic party chair) Mike Madigan. At one point in the primary battle, it looked like Biss was overtaking both Pritzker and Kennedy by running to their left; he was endorsed by MoveOn, Our Revolution (the Berniecrat organization), and National Nurses United.\n\nThe race remains close enough that Pritzker hasn't yet put it away; Biss is relying on grassroots enthusiasm for his candidacy, while Kennedy is banking heavily on winning undecided African-American voters via attacks on Chicago's gentrification trends. Some Democrats remain fearful that the Tribune and Rauner's campaign have dirt on Pritzker that will destroy him in a general election, though at the moment he leads the incumbent in polls by a comfortable margin.\n\nIf Pritzker and Rauner both win their primaries, it seems certain the general election will surpass California's legendary 2010 contest between Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman as the most expensive gubernatorial campaign in history.\n\nAside from the marquee races, there are several other primaries in Illinois that are of more than purely local interest.\n\n* With Chicago's progressive congressman Luis Gutiérrez unexpectedly retiring this year, his natural successor (and the incumbent's endorsee) is 2015 mayoral candidate Jesús \"Chuy\" García, though affordable-housing activist Sol Flores is making some serious waves in the contest.\n\n*Emily's List is trying to add to its impressive performance in the Texas Democratic primary earlier this month by backing strong candidates in the 13th and 14th Congressional Districts of Illinois, where Republican incumbents are vulnerable. In the downstate 13th, Betsy Londrigan, a former aide to Senator Dick Durbin, is in a close race against Erik Jones, an ally of Illinois attorney general Lisa Madigan. And in the Chicago exurban 14th, Lauren Underwood, a nurse and former senior adviser at the Department of Health and Human Services, is in a close primary competition with a local small-town mayor.\n\n* There's a highly competitive GOP congressional primary in the Chicago suburban 10th District, which flipped to Democratic candidate Brad Schneider in 2016. Self-funding physician Sapan Shah and former AIPAC staffer Jeremy Wynes are the front-runners for a chance to reclaim a House seat long held by moderate Republicans.\n\nOn top of the congressional races, the retirement of longtime Attorney General Lisa Madigan has created an intriguing eight-candidate Democratic primary featuring former governor Pat Quinn, who was defeated by Bruce Rauner in 2014. In a late poll, Quinn had a narrow lead over State Senator Kwame Raoul.\n\nTurnout is typically low in Illinois midterm primaries. But early voting this year was up sharply. It's unclear now whether that's the product of greater enthusiasm, more competitive races, or all the campaign spending. If despite all the infighting and dyspeptic rhetoric surrounding the Democratic primaries, the Donkey Party in the Land of Lincoln comes out of the primaries with high spirits, it will be another sign of a potential wave that sweeps aside all sorts of local barricades.",

                "title": "What I Tell Friends Who Ask What Bluetooth Headphones to Buy",
                "body": "If a friend asks me about the best Bluetooth headphones, I like to make some chitchat first. I'll say, \"Hey, how's it going? I haven't seen you since the [popular music group] show at [popular music venue] that time!\" And then I like to get down to business. The simple answer to the Bluetooth headphone question is ... well, it depends.\n\nI'm not the leading expert in wireless technology. I wasn't deconstructing radios at age 3 or reading up on near-field communication during recess. What I have done in recent years, though, is tested out a lot of wireless headphones across several categories, including those designed for athletes, those made for kids, and a few pairs created with the genuine audiophile in mind. I've been testing and writing about gear since 2011, and in that time I've used so many dozens of headphones (plus speakers, battery packs, and electric toothbrushes) that I've become the go-to guy for gadget recommendations around my circle of friends.\n\nSo while I'm not the very tip-top expert in wireless sonic whatnot, I am a guy who has tried a lot of such whatnot firsthand, and I'm a man who knows what he likes. Below, the best Bluetooth headphones for most people -- these are the ones I recommend when people ask me what to buy.\n\nBest Bluetooth headphones for under $30 SoundPEATS Magnetic Wireless Earbuds\n\nA lot of people flap their gums about the best Bluetooth headphones for under $100, but the fact is, you can get good Bluetooth headphones for less than $30. A pair of SoundPEATS Magnetic Earphones sells for less than $30, and these compact, little in-ear devices are well worth their tiny price tag. The audio quality is quite good for the earbud category, and the eight-hour battery life is nothing to scoff at, considering the compact size of the hardware (many top out at six hours). Also, they connect to one another via magnet to make a necklace you can wear when you're not using them, which is handy for not losing your earphones. (You can always put them in your pocket.)\n\n$27 at Amazon $27 at Amazon Best Bluetooth headphones for under $50 Creative Sound Blaster Jam Ultra-Light Bluetooth Headset\n\nWhat you won't get with the Creative Sound Blaster Jam Ultra-Light headphones is perfect noise-canceling or the best headphones for workouts or 78 hours of battery life, but what you will get with these $40 headphones is rich bass, clear calls (in both directions), and a lightweight design paired with soft ear pads that allows for hours of comfort. These are not my primary Bluetooth headphones, but they are my favorite backups, and that's only because I'm a bit spoiled. You'd do just fine to make these your No. 1 stunners.\n\n$38 at Amazon $38 at Amazon Best Bluetooth headphones for working out BluePhonic Bluetooth Wireless Headphones\n\nWorking out involves a lot of sweat. Believe me. I run four to five times a week, and for a while I used headphones that had fabric ear pads. By the time I tossed them out, their odor was ... potent. But here was the other thing: Electronics and liquids don't get along. I know about this as well because it wasn't the odor that ended my use of the old earphones, it was hardware failure. Fortunately, I found the BluePhonic BZ-200 headphones, which have a waterproof rating of IXP7, so you (and I) can wear them while sweating profusely or running in a rainstorm, or both, and they'll come through just fine. You can also wear them while doing jumping jacks or using a pogo stick because the ear buds will stay securely in place thanks to over-ear loops. Also, they only cost $40, which is pretty damn good given their quality. And the foam tips don't soak in scents. [Editor's note: For something a bit pricier, we like the Bose SoundSports.]\n\n$40 at Amazon $40 at Amazon Best noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones Plantronics Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2 Special Edition\n\nIf your No. 1 demand from your Bluetooth headphones is that they shut out all the background sound, from voices to vehicles to everything in between, though, then the Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2 headphones should be your go-to choice. Yeah, part of the way they block sound thanks to their super large size, and no, they won't win any fashion contests. But they also use Active Noise Canceling, which, coupled with their size and insulation, leaves you free to enjoy your chosen audio in a virtual cave of peace. Don't just take my word -- several smart reviewers have all ranked the BackBeat Pro 2 headphones as even better than the largely uncontested \"best\" noise-cancelling headphones (cough, Bose).\n\n$250 at Amazon $250 at Amazon Best Bluetooth headphones for media Trond Wireless Bluetooth V4.2 Over-Ear Headphones\n\nA great pair of media headphones has to make you feel totally immersed in the environment of the movie you're watching or the game you're playing. The Trond TD-BH01 headphones do that mostly because they, you know, create great audio quality. But almost as important, these low-lag headphones mean there's no perceptible delay between the visuals and the audio of your movie, show, or game. Which is important because nothing breaks down that fourth wall like someone's lips and words not lining up. Also, you can use these headphones with a Bluetooth connection or hardwired, so when you're gaming or watching TV at home, no need to worry about battery life. And speaking of life, you haven't lived until immersed in the aural universe of old-school Nintendo Mario being piped to your ears via Trond TD-BH01 headphones.\n\n$67 at Amazon $67 at Amazon Best Bluetooth headphones for kids Puro Sound Labs BT2200 Premium Kids Headphones\n\nWhy do I know Puro Sound Labs BT2200 headphones are great for kids? Because I have a kid, and he has these headphones, and he loves them. And he does not love all headphones, by a long shot. (\"Daddy, these are too tight,\" \"Mommy, these are too loud,\" and so on.) The BT2200 40 mm dynamic drivers create excellent sound quality (I've slipped them on more than once), and the headphones block out 82 percent of the ambient noise, which together means an excellent acoustic experience for the youngster. They're also limited to a maximum volume output of 85 decibels, which gives parents (like me) some comfort knowing those little eardrums aren't going to be damaged.\n\n$100 at Amazon $100 at Amazon Best Bluetooth headphones to give as gifts B&O Play by Bang & Olufsen Over-Ear Beoplay H4 Wireless Headphones\n\nBe it music, the audio from a movie or show, a phone call, whatever, the prime directive of a set of headphones is to deliver high-quality audio to your ears. And the B&O Play H4s bring you heckin'-good sound quality. The bass is rich, but not overbearing, thanks to excellent equalization. The treble and midrange are clear and never sharp. They're pricey, they're kind of big, but they sound great. Importantly for gift-giving, they also look fantastic (something the Danish brand is known for) and are pricey enough to feel like a substantial present. I get a fair amount of free stuff to test out, but I've found nothing to top the B&O Play H4s in terms of sound quality, comfort, and design. This is my go-to pair.\n\n$235 at Amazon $235 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "The Right Is Worse Than the Left on Free Speech. So What?",
                "body": "Mari Uyehara has a column arguing that too many columns have been written about free speech on campus. Uyehara does not endorse the kinds of repressive actions that these columns decry (no-platforming is \"a terrible technique,\" she concedes), but instead focuses on the disproportionate coverage. \"The number of publications and prominent journalists willing to cover [these episodes] is quite high,\" she complains. \"Andrew Sullivan has written in New York magazine about a half-dozen articles, warning that 'the broader culture is in danger of drifting away from liberal democracy.' His colleague Jonathan Chait has written another dozen on PC culture ... In The New York Times, Bret Stephens regurgitated a speech as an article called 'Free Speech and the Necessity of Discomfort,'\" and so on.\n\nThis is not the first column to argue along these lines. Jamie Piltch (\"Free speech isn't under attack on campuses\"), Chris Ladd (\"There Is No Free Speech Crisis on Campus\"), Rich Smith (\"There's No Free Speech Crisis on Campus, So Please Shut Up About It\"), Jeffrey Sachs (\"The 'campus free speech crisis' is a myth. Here are the facts\"), Matthew Yglesias (\"Everything we think about the political correctness debate is wrong\"), Hamilton Nolan (\"Get Over College Kids\"), Sophia McClennen, Leah Finnegan, Andrew Hartman, Clio Chang, Clio Chang again, and David Masciotra, to name just a few, have all hammered home essentially the same argument.\n\nMany columns have made the case that too many columns have made the case against political correctness on campus. That is not necessarily a bad thing. If people have intense feelings about the number of columns devoted to discussing free speech on campus, they should express them. The heart wants what the heart wants.\n\nBut complaints about the quantity of a discussion tend to devolve into non sequiturs. Many of the anti-anti-P.C.-niks, while conceding that it's wrong to shout down speakers or close down newspapers, use the moral power of some other issue to make their case. Because we have too many anti-P.C. columns, they insist, we have too few columns on some worthier subject. \"This is not to say that counter-protests and free speech debates aren't important and don't deserve our attention,\" argues McClennen. \"But it is stunning to note the public apathy toward the systematic defunding of higher ed -- a move that affects all families regardless of political beliefs.\" Uyehara complains bitterly that \"The Free Speech Grifters\" -- her term for critics of illiberalism on campus -- \"were silent when Maya Wiley, the Social Justice SVP at the New School, made news for the humanity she showed toward Sam Nunberg during his six-hour media meltdown over an FBI subpoena.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, I was not silent about Maya Wiley's extraordinary gesture toward Sam Nunberg. But imagine that Uyehara was factually correct, and I had failed to discuss that episode. What does one have to do with the other? If the real problem with anti-P.C. columns is that they ignore more important issues off campus, then doesn't that criticism apply with equal force to anti-anti-P.C. columns?\n\nThe anti-anti-P.C. columns propose numerous psychological theories to explain the perverse motivation of the moderate liberals and (generally) anti-Trump conservatives who talk too much about the campus left. We have supposedly given aid and comfort to the far right, which has deftly exploited the excesses of the campus left.\n\nMy response is that the right is attempting to discredit liberalism by attaching it to the illiberal left, and the proper response, both morally and politically, is to separate the two. It's obvious to me why conservatives want everybody who's alienated by the callout culture to self-identify as a conservative. It's less obvious to me why liberals should also want that.\n\n++\n\nThere is, of course, a valid argument to be had over the scale of the problem. I think defining the question as \"free speech on campus\" largely misses the point. It is not, for the most part, a question of \"free speech\" in the legal sense. It is about the spread on the left of norms and protocols of political discussion that make reasoned disagreement difficult or impossible. In its most extreme form this can lead to overt censorship, and such acts mostly occur on elite campuses, which have the highest concentration of committed radicals. But campuses are not the only places where this political style has been on display. There is only so much formal censorship that can go on in a country with robust First Amendment protections. The question is what progressives are doing to our own minds.\n\nAs the noted Free Speech Grifter Barack Obama has put it, the impulse to shut down or shut out any opposing viewpoint as an offense or a threat to safety is a \"recipe for dogmatism.\" The great strength of American liberalism is its permeability, its openness to evidence and diverse perspectives, in contrast to the stultified atmosphere on the right. When some of us have diagnosed conservatism as suffering from \"epistemic closure,\" this is not merely a partisan talking point to bludgeon our opponents, but the expression of a fundamental value. A value is something you hold yourself to, not just something you taunt the other side with.\n\nThat's why it misses the point for so many progressives to dodge complaints about left-wing dogmatism by pointing fingers at the right. The impulse to close ranks against the larger political enemy encourages overlooking unhealthy habits on one's own side. Is the right worse? Yes, of course -- and we have to keep it that way. If your only response to your side's shortcomings is the comparative evil of the other side, then eventually the level of your standards will sink to theirs.\n\nJamelle Bouie, who has written probably the most sensible and fair-minded anti-anti-P.C. column, concedes not only that it's wrong to shut down opposing points of view, but that it's legitimate to worry that \"an illiberal campus left might eventually become an illiberal political left.\" Bouie simply concludes that it won't happen because \"similar warnings\" failed to pan out when political correctness flared up briefly in the early 1990s. I hope he's right. I'm less confident than he is in our ability to predict the future. One thing I do believe with some confidence, though, is that liberal values won't prevail if people aren't willing to speak up for them.",

                "body": "Four bombs have exploded in Austin, Texas, this month, killing two and injuring several others. The victims in two of those bombings were members of locally prominent African-American families, who were killed after picking up explosive packages that were by their homes. This sparked fears that the attacks were racially motivated. The most recent bombing, however, appeared less discriminating in its choice of victims -- and more sophisticated in its construction -- than those that had preceded it: On Sunday night, an explosive device left by the side of a residential road injured two people who happened to trigger its trip wire.\n\nNow, it looks like the suspected serial bomber might have switched up his or her method yet again. Early Tuesday morning, a package filled with shards of metal and nails exploded at a FedEx center near San Antonio -- and, according to local reports, the box was bound for Austin. One employee of the delivery company suffered minor injuries from the explosion.\n\nThe FBI's office in San Antonio told CNN Tuesday that they \"suspect it is related to our investigation\" into the Austin bombings. Nevertheless, as of this writing, authorities have not yet determined that this bombing is connected, or that all of this month's bombings were carried out by the same perpetrator or perpetrators (as opposed to by copycats, or unrelated individuals). But if this is the work of a serial bomber, then the criminal appears to be growing more ambitious (and/or reckless) in his or her methods, as none of the previous explosive packages were sent through the mail.",

                "title": "Facebook Haunted by Its Handling of 2016 Election Meddling",
                "body": "Days after the 2016 election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the idea that fake news shared on the social-media site influenced the election, calling it a \"pretty crazy idea.\" Facebook didn't publicly acknowledge that its platform might have played a role in Russia's election meddling until April 2017, when a company release noted that its \"data does not contradict\" a January 2017 report by the U.S. director of National Intelligence. As indicated in a footnote, that's a reference to the U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia carried out a vast cybercampaign in an effort to help elect Donald Trump.\n\nNow Facebook is facing an intensifying backlash over its handling of various elements of the 2016 campaign. The latest crisis came on Monday night, when the New York Times and other outlets reported that Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief information security officer, is set to leave the company by August. Stamos is widely respected within the cybersecurity community, but that's not the sole reason that his expected departure is such a blow. It's also exposed a debate among Facebook executives over how to address attempts to misuse the platform, and how much to disclose following security breaches.\n\nAccording to the Times, there's been ongoing tension within Facebook's upper ranks between the security team, which tended to push for more public disclosures on misuse by Russia and other nations, and the legal and policy teams, which prioritized protecting the company's business interests. Stamos was said to be a key advocate for publicizing Russia's interference and working to combat it, even before the election. Per the Times:\n\nMr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.\n\nBy November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook ...\n\nIn the ensuing months, Facebook's security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.\n\nIn early 2017, Stamos penned a memo describing Russia's activities on the site, but direct references to Russia were reportedly scrubbed from the report, resulting in the vague aforementioned document published in April 2017.\n\nHowever, efforts to avoid publicly discussing Russia's activities didn't make the controversy go away. Months after media reports shed more light on Russia's use of fake ads and user accounts, in September 2017 the company said it had uncovered a vast Russian campaign to spread propaganda on the site:\n\nIn reviewing the ads buys, we have found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June of 2015 to May of 2017 -- associated with roughly 3,000 ads -- that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook Live at the time, Zuckerberg said the company was cooperating with investigators, and taking steps to make political advertising more transparent. When representatives from Facebook, as well as several other top tech companies, testified before Congress in the fall, lawmakers still criticized them for being slow to address the problem.\n\nStamos pushed back against reports of his imminent departure on Monday night, tweeting that while his role at the company has changed, \"I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook.\" He also denied that fellow executives hampered his efforts to investigate Russian election meddling (though he did not say whether there was resistance to disclosing those findings).\n\nEven if Stamos stays put, Facebook has plenty of other crises to deal with. Over the weekend Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, which ran data operations for Trump's 2016 campaign, ahead of media exposés on how it harvested data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles. Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic working with Cambridge Analytica, allegedly violated Facebook's terms of use by saying the data would be used for academic purposes, not political purposes.\n\nAided by the Trump connection, the stories drew attention to Facebook's loose rules for accessing users' data. Kogan's initial collection was no different from what thousands of developers -- from Farmville to Barack Obama's 2012 campaign -- have done legitimately. (The rules have been tightened since 2015, and allowing third-party apps to access your information no longer gives them access to all your friends' data as well.)\n\nNow lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe are calling for probes into how Facebook and other social-media companies protect users' data from third-party companies. Several members of Congress demanded that Zuckerberg testify on Capitol Hill about how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data.\n\n\"Facebook, Google, and Twitter have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data and use this data when selling advertising, including political advertisements,\" Senators Amy Klobuchar and John Kennedy wrote in a letter to Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.\"\n\nGrassley's spokesperson said he has not decided whether to hold a hearing, but the controversies are already having an impact on Facebook. Its stock fell 6.8 percent on Monday, its worst single-day drop in four years. The company lost more than $36 billion in market value, and Zuckerberg personally lost $6.06 billion.\n\nFacebook can certainly survive the loss of a top security chief and another grilling from lawmakers, but it's a company built on trust. What happens if the ongoing revelations about Facebook's failure to protect users from Russian disinformation and the inappropriate use of their profile data make people less interested in handing over their personal information?",

                "title": "Mueller's Obstruction Focus Is Likely the Tip of the Iceberg",
                "body": "One takeaway from Donald Trump's unhinged Twitter meltdown over the Robert Mueller investigation this past weekend - aside from indications that the president is increasingly isolated, under siege, and out of sorts - is that his legal team is in disarray and can't seem to put him at ease, despite repeated assurances that he will be vindicated in the end.\n\nTrump has been getting more and more aggressive against the special counsel, and according to the New York Times, he may drop his lawyer Ty Cobb, who's advocated for cooperating with Mueller. The addition of a new attorney-cum-attack dog to his circle of legal defenders - Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney who has espoused some of Trump's FBI conspiracy theories on Fox News - seems designed to at least give him peace of mind that he has another lawyerly type in his corner.\n\nThis backup comes at a pivotal time for Trump. The Washington Post reported on Monday that his lawyers have turned over to Mueller a report that is the equivalent of a connect-the-dots coloring book: a blueprint of key events under investigation. The purpose of these White House \"summaries\" is to limit the breadth of Mueller's questioning should Trump sit down for an interview -- a major minefield that, as I have written before, no sensible lawyer would allow a client like Trump to step onto.\n\nThis is clearly damage control. As the Post indicates, these written materials zero in on the dismissals of FBI Director James Comey and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, which suggests that the special counsel has an interest in the president's state of mind during these events -- the thing that matters to a prosecutor who is looking at the potential obstruction of an ongoing investigation. What was really going through Trump's head when he fired Comey? And why did he ask him to go easy on Flynn, who had enough demons to warrant being in the FBI's line of sight?\n\nComey, as you may recall, was fired before the true extent of the FBI's investigation into Russia's 2016 election interference (which Mueller took over) was publicly known. Andrew McCabe's dismissal last Friday, on the other hand, happened after \"this Russia thing,\" as Trump once called it, had already yielded several indictments, guilty pleas, and cooperation agreements with a number of the president's men. That McCabe was caught in the undertow of Trump's vindictiveness was only a function of his proximity to Comey; he was one of the three senior advisers whom the fired FBI director briefed on his troubling interactions with the president, including his demands for loyalty. Besmirching McCabe, in Trump's mind, serves to besmirch the testimony of Mueller's star witness on obstruction. This may yet be another miscalculation on Trump's part, as that public trial will almost certainly never happen.\n\nMueller's prospective obstruction case, captivating though it may be to political reporters and those who yearn for the president's downfall, is still only a tiny slice of the special counsel's mandate. You can count me among the skeptics who doubt that Mueller will ever make such a case in a court of law -- even in the face of reports, like one from Axios on Monday, suggesting the opposite. If Mueller's probe is to retain its legitimacy, which it has in spades, it will be by charging ahead with what it's already done so well: uncovering the extent to which Russia worked alone or in tandem with Trump campaign operatives to boost Trump's chances at the presidency.\n\nThe word that's been used and abused to describe this synergy between the Kremlin and the Trump camp is collusion, but Mueller has given us a better, more legally grounded term: conspiracy. Last month, Rick Gates, Trump's deputy campaign manager and a longtime associate of Paul Manafort, became the first person in Mueller's crosshairs to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States. This curious, catchall offense also appeared in the February indictment of 13 Russian trolls, all of whom were charged with \"impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.\"\n\nSo far, that's as close as Mueller has come to identifying a political crime in any of his public prosecutions. In Gates' case, he \"together with others\" conspired to interfere with the law-enforcement functions of the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department, each of which is responsible for ensuring lobbyists register with the government whenever they represent foreign interests or seeing that taxpayers properly report taxable income they earned overseas. Because Gates pleaded guilty to doing neither, he has conspired to defraud his own country and now faces the very real prospect of time in prison. Not even his cooperation with Mueller is likely to spare him.\n\nWhich brings us to this past weekend's revelations about the role Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm closely associated with Steve Bannon and the Trump campaign, played during the presidential election. Twin reports in the New York Times and The Guardian shed light on a staggering data mining operation that resulted in the firm improperly obtaining tens of millions of Facebook profiles, which it then exploited for political microtargeting. Or as Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who leaked this information put it, the technology he helped create with Cambridge Analytica was \"Steve Bannon's psychological warfare mindfuck tool.\"\n\nThere's nothing criminal about swaying voters, and neither the Times nor the Guardian account is conclusive as to how Cambridge Analytica may have aided Russia's election meddling, if at all. But this bit in the paper of record suggests the special counsel is already on to something: \"While the substance of Mr. Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine.\" Mueller, for his part, has already asked the firm for the emails of any employees who did work on behalf of the Trump campaign. And even Julian Assange has accused Cambridge Analytica's CEO of attempting to obtain from WikiLeaks damaging emails belonging to Hillary Clinton.\n\nSo there's a lot we don't yet know. But based on the precedent Mueller has already set, it wouldn't be a stretch to expect his office to bring a fresh round of federal conspiracy charges against actors -- whether that be Assange, executives at Cambridge Analytica, or other intermediaries -- who attempted to impair the lawful functions of the government by concealing activities that they should've disclosed to, say, the Federal Election Commission or the Justice Department. \"A method that makes uses of innocent individuals or businesses to reach and defraud the United States is not, for that reason, beyond the scope\" of the law of conspiracy, the Supreme Court said some 30 years ago.\n\nUnlike collusion, which makes for good sound bites but not real cases, conspiracy has deep roots in American law. As independent journalist Marcy Wheeler has laid out, even Jared Kushner may be on the hook for it. If the last 10 months or so of the Mueller investigation have shown us anything, it is the tangled web of lies and cover-ups the Trump campaign weaved to hide its dealings with Russia. Don't be surprised if Mueller untangles yet more of this mess and presents us with more indictments against conspirators in the U.S. or abroad.",

Qualifying for the governor's race doesn't even begin until June, and the primary's on September 13. If Nixon just wanted the buzz of a potential candidacy without making a commitment, she could have waited for quite some time. Another sign of her seriousness is the people who have signed on with her candidacy from the get-go. They include Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, formerly best known as strategists for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. And her campaign treasurer is Zephyr Teachout, who made her own left-bent challenge to Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic gubernatorial primary four years ago.\n\nTaking on Cuomo so early could reflect an understanding that overcoming the incumbent's huge campaign stash (an estimated $30 million) will be a herculean task. Or it could just indicate that Nixon wants to annoy and provoke the famously averse-to-criticism Cuomo for a long time, exposing the uglier aspects of his personality and possibly encouraging him to overreact in a politically damaging way. Truth is, Nixon will become a national heroine to many progressives if she simply succeeds in sidetracking Cuomo from the 2020 presidential run he is clearly contemplating.\n\nShe's already showing some shrewd moves in getting under Cuomo's thin skin, as the Cut's Gabriella Paiella notes:\n\n[S]he announced today that she's officially running for governor, with a platform that includes \"fixing our broken subway.\" In a press release, her campaign office added that \"unlike Andrew Cuomo, Cynthia rides the subway nearly every day, and understands the toll that his disastrous mismanagement of the MTA is taking on New Yorkers.\"\n\nNixon's big advantage over other potential lefty challengers to Cuomo is name (and face) ID, thanks to her starring role as Miranda in the iconic and long-running show Sex and the City. That the incumbent is acutely aware of that factor was illustrated by his immediate reaction to her announcement:\n\nIt's a sign of the low regard Cuomo's personality has earned that this quip came across as \"condescending.\" And if Nixon can keep it up and survive a long and brutal primary campaign without making big mistakes of her own, she could without a great deal of effort spoil the self-love-fest the governor had clearly hoped his reelection campaign would become.\n\nForty-two percent of voters rated Cuomo's job performance as good or excellent; with 57 percent rating it poor or fair. That's his lowest job approval rating since September 2016. But 52 percent of respondents viewed Cuomo himself favorably, statistically unchanged from February.\n\nWith luck and skill Nixon could exploit meh assessments of the job Cuomo's doing in a way that lures him into behavior that will dent his personal favorability as well. And then it could become a real contest.",

It had suspended Strategic Communication Laboratories and Cambridge Analytica, its data lab, for illegitimately obtaining user data and holding on to it when instructed otherwise. Cambridge Analytica, depending on whom you ask, was either just one of many players in the 2016 election or one of few key players who landed Trump's victory. The data-accessing -- back in 2015, Facebook had no rules to keep third-party apps from accessing your friends' data when you gave said app access to your data -- should concern you if you fall into either camp, though the \"Cambridge Analytica scores landmark victory for Trump\" camp might want to be more concerned. This was all on Friday night.\n\nBy Monday, the plot had only thickened. Over the weekend, Cambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie tweeted that his Facebook account had been suspended. Wylie is the whistle-blower whose revelations to major news outlets prompted Facebook's late-night press release in the first place.\n\nElizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, announced earlier on Monday that she is seeking a warrant to raid Cambridge Analytica's offices and seize its servers. (Cambridge Analytica is a London-based company.) Her statement came following the publication of a special investigation from the U.K.'s Channel 4 News about Cambridge Analytica, in which several of the company's executives were taped offering to entrap politicians in situations involving bribes and sex workers. (Cambridge Analytica denied that the company has ever used such measures, Business Insider reports.)\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook announced that it will conduct its own audit of C.A. \"We have hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica,\" the company said in a statement on its blog on Monday. \"Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford the firm complete access to their servers and systems.\" Facebook will be trying to figure out if user data that Cambridge Analytica claimed it destroyed was actually, in fact, destroyed. Aleksandr Kogan, a University of Cambridge professor whom C.A. brought in to build a psychometric profile database via an app-based survey, has also agreed to the audit. Facebook says that Christopher Wylie has, thus far, declined.",

But given diGenova's aggressive views, and, importantly, his propensity for appearing on cable television to enunciate them, it's not surprising that Trump took a liking to him.\n\nDiGenova, who has also represented former Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis, said on Fox News in January that \"there was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn't win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime.\"\n\nThis make-believe view matches up nicely with the president's. Trump has repeatedly called Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nDiGenova joins a team of lawyers that has sometimes been split about the administration's approach to the Mueller investigation. On one side of the divide is Ty Cobb, who has tended to advocate full cooperation with the investigation while assuring/misleading the president that the probe is on the verge of wrapping up any day now. He has clashed with White House counsel Don McGahn, who has been more resistant to give up documents and information to Mueller.\n\nThen there are more truculent types like Jay Sekulow and John Dowd, the president's personal lawyer. On Saturday morning, Dowd told the Daily Beast that Mueller should immediately abandon his investigation, then had to clarify that he was not speaking for the president.\n\nBut on Saturday night and Sunday morning, President Trump for the first time attacked Mueller directly via Twitter, making it clear, as if it wasn't already, that he'd like to get rid of the special counsel.\n\nOn Sunday night, Cobb issued a statement claiming that, despite his weekend eruptions, President Trump was not considering firing Mueller. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley reiterated that claim on Monday afternoon.\n\nNo matter what the White House says, though, Trump looks to be spoiling for a fight. And having another voice in the room telling him exactly what he wants to hear is unlikely to mollify him.",

                "title": "Republicans Can't Understand Why Trump Is Acting Guilty",
                "body": "During the final competitive stages of the 2016 presidential primary, Ted Cruz was all that stood between the Republican Party and nominating a candidate who called Cruz \"Lyin' Ted,\" insulted his wife's appearance, and accused his father of possibly helping to assassinate JFK. Jeff Roe, Cruz's campaign manager, has never been one to let a thing like pathologically dishonest bullying affect his political judgment. In a New York Times op-ed this weekend, Roe urges his party to stand behind its president. \"No, you don't have to support the president's tweet storms,\" he wrote. \"But you do have to defend his policy accomplishments.\"\n\nWhat Roe has defined here is the mainstream stance of the Republican Party. A handful of dissidents, all of whom are retiring from elected office, have attacked the president as unfit for office. A considerably larger group on the right has staunchly defended every aspect of his performance. But the largest faction of the party has taken the position that Donald Trump is a fantastically successful president whose main error is undisciplined tweeting.\n\nWhat is most notable about this approach is what it omits: the idea that Trump possesses authoritarian instincts or might be deeply implicated in the Russia scandal. It focuses entirely on the most superficial critique of his job performance and ignores evidence of his fundamental unfitness for office.\n\nThis weekend, Trump abandoned his pose of restraint toward Robert Mueller and began openly lashing out at the special counsel. This was yet another effort to test the limits of what his Republican allies would accept. Trump proceeded to hire a lawyer, Joseph E. diGenova, who has described the Russia investigation as a plot to \"frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime.\"\n\nThe mainstream Republican response to these provocations has focused on the style of Trump's actions, rather than the substance. A Wall Street Journal editorial applauds the firing of Andrew McCabe from the FBI, assuring its readers that -- while the evidence remains private -- McCabe probably deserved it. \"Mr. Sessions's statement was a straightforward explanation that he fired Mr. McCabe for a serious violation of duty,\" the Journal concludes. The stated rationale for the firing \"should have been cause for Mr. Trump to let the dismissal speak for itself, but the President is too self-involved for such restraint,\" the editorial lamented. \"Instead he tweeted on Saturday, 'Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI -- A great day for Democracy.'\"\n\nMaybe the fact that Trump decided to taunt and smear the fired civil servant should be evidence that, perhaps, the pretext given for his firing is not entirely on the level. Maybe McCabe was singled out for scrutiny because Trump has demanded such an action. The Journal does not entertain the possibility, though. Trump is simply making the completely neutral execution of administrative justice appear biased for no reason at all.\n\nRepublican congressman Trey Gowdy, the former Benghazi inquisitor, has moved from his party's fever swamp wing to its mainstream (or perhaps stood still while the party lurched further toward craziness than he could tolerate). Gowdy, who is retiring, scolded Trump's lawyer John Dowd for threatening Mueller, saying, \"If you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.\" But what if ... Dowd's client is not innocent? It would certainly explain his behavior, but also force people like Gowdy to entertain scenarios they would rather ignore.\n\nThe assumption that Trump is probably innocent informs the party's most popular position on Mueller, which is to quietly defend his work, while ignoring the possibility that Trump would fire him. Last year, several Republican senators expressed support in passing a law to protect Mueller from the kind of purge Trump seems intent upon carrying out. But the progress of those bills has crawled to a halt. Democratic senators are pleading with their Republican colleagues to pass them before it's too late:\n\nSome Republicans openly oppose the legislation. Orrin Hatch says firing Mueller would be \"the stupidest thing\" Trump could do, but opposes any bills to prevent him from doing it. Likewise, John Cornyn insists, \"I think it'd be a bad mistake for the president to fire the director. And I don't think he'll do it, so I don't see any benefit in trying to pass a law.\" It would be \"stupid\" and a \"mistake\" for Trump to try to shut down the prosecutor. Because he's innocent, of course.\n\nMost Republicans haven't come out and repudiated these bills. Instead, they have slow-walked them and refused to say anything in public. \"By some leaders' reckoning, the special counsel bills are not yet ripe for consideration,\" reports the Washington Post. \"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) has said he will not schedule the bills for a markup until they are merged into a single piece of legislation.\"\n\nWe know what it looks like when Republicans actually want to get a bill passed quickly. Just recall the frantic rush to pass the Trump tax cuts, a massive law shot through with errors in the haste to get something accomplished. It does not take much imagination to discern why the party is not eager to publicly declare themselves on the issue. They have hitched their political fortunes to the president. It is possible he could ultimately go so far as to violate their conscience, or their polling numbers, provoking a revolt. But in the meantime Trump's party is giving every impression of quiescence. And that passivity, in turn, is feeding Trump's confidence and aggression.",

                "body": "If you're like us, you've probably wondered what famous people add to their carts. Not the JAR brooch and Louis XV chair, but the hand sanitizer and the electric toothbrush. We asked model and designer Alexa Chung about the string cheese, detangling brush, and woodsy candles she can't live without.\n\nHarry Josh Pro Tools Detangling Brush\n\nMy hair and I mostly have a good relationship, but sometimes we fall out. And when we do, it's usually because I find it hard to get my brush through it in one fell swoop -- it's very fine, so it gets very tangled, and nothing gets through it. But somehow this green beauty is really good. I never thought about hairbrushes as good or bad until I bought this one, and it's a whole new world. The other day, I was on a trip and had left it at home, so I used a lesser one. But I got a new Harry Josh brush, and life is all good again.\n\n$20 at DermStore Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser\n\nI admire Glossier for the business as much as the products because I think Emily is really smart, and the idea is approachable but luxury at the same time. I love everything, but the one thing I come back to is the cleanser because it's so soothing and nice on the face. I use it in the shower, although I might have to reassess that because the water from the shower head gets onto my hands before I slap the stuff on, and then half of it is gone. It's very wasteful, actually.\n\n$18 at Glossier Organic Valley Stringles\n\nHave you tried them? They're bloody delicious. In England, they're called cheese strings, but string cheese in America, but basically there was a point in my life when I was so on-the-go that I lived exclusively on a diet of Stringles, avocado, and apples and nuts, like I was foraging. Nowadays, I manage to remember to enjoy three square meals a day, but the Stringles addiction didn't leave me. They give me a burst of calcium and dairy, and they're salty and delicious and playful to eat. If I can interact with my food, it amuses me. NB: To be peeled and consumed, not gnawed at from the top.\n\n$5 at Jet Globe-Trotter Safari 21-Inch Hardshell Trolley Travel Case\n\nI am constantly traveling, and it's lovely and a luxury, and I'm happy to do it. That said, I'm only ever in a place for a few days and then head back to London, so I never get around to unpacking because it seems illogical since I'd have to repack, so more often than not my luggage is at the front door. And for years it was an unattractive suitcase. But when I found the Globe-Trotter, it changed everything because the trolley could be a piece of slightly chic furniture. If you put a lamp on it, it could be a nice coffee table.\n\n$1,640 at Nordstrom Sisley Paris Ecological Compound\n\nI use it every day. I'm obsessed with moisturizing and less obsessed with drinking water. Maybe if I hydrated, I wouldn't have to moisturize so much. This one is really dependable and a good everyday guy. It's liquidy and seeps in and doesn't sit on top. Because it's so expensive, it feels like a luxury, so I don't use so much at a time. I use it morning and night, and sometimes even throughout the day.\n\n$250 at Nordstrom Cire Trudon Byron Classic Candle\n\nOh, my relationship with candles. I really like things to smell nice, and I find these so perfect because Cire Trudon candles are very potent. They smell sort of like a wealthy 60-year-old man's smoking lair. And I love that. I'm drawn to a more masculine scent rather than anything floral. I like things that are woody -- it's from growing up in the country I think -- and things that smell like grass or a bonfire. That's why Byron is my favorite. I'm burning candles constantly, but that has its own problem. I'm forgetful and have a low attention span, so I'll leave candles on sometimes. My biggest fear, though, other than things smelling bad is burning things down. I don't know if you follow my Instagram (you probably don't), but once a day I have to do a story where I go back and check that I haven't left anything burning. I thankfully never have, and it's always blown out, but I do have a fear of fires. I maybe died in one in a past life.\n\n$95 at Saks Fifth Avenue Ballet Beautiful Group Class\n\nI'm someone to whom exercise doesn't come naturally. I'm not a gym bunny by any means. I don't particularly like athleisure. I'm all about health, but I'd rather not move around for it. That's not how it works unfortunately, but I found out about Ballet Beautiful in glossy magazine pages. All these women would say, \"I see Mary Helen,\" and I totally fell for that. Mary Helen is a thing of beauty and a thing to behold. She just had her third child and bounced right back because she practices what she preaches. So it's a barre class, and you put on a leotard, you feel chic, and you get something done but you don't come out feeling splotchy and gross when you're heading in to work. It's a bit of a therapy session, too, because we all have a nice chat.\n\n$38 at Ballet Beautiful Superga x Alexa Chung 2295 COTW\n\nWink, wink! Okay, so I've always worn Supergas because my mother always wore them, so it became like Stockholm syndrome. But because I was wearing them, they approached me a few years ago to model for them, and then I art-directed for them, and then finally this year, they asked me to do a collaboration. You might notice that I haven't done very much to them. It's not laziness! It's actually respect for the thing I love so much in the first place. I don't like when someone collaborates on something and twists it into something that it's not. So what I did was make it ivory rather than white, which makes it a bit warmer. And then we added a toe cap and two extra eyelets, so the laces go higher up the ankle. I love the traditional high-tops, but they're a little lower than my ideal shape. It'd be nice to wear with the raincoat I also designed in that cool green shade, too.\n\n$85 at Superga GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "13 Kitchen Organizing Ideas From Professional Organizers",
                "body": "It's nearly spring, which means it's nearly the season of cleaning and organization. There's something particularly alarming about emerging from the winter doldrums to find that your home is a dusty, cluttered mess. To help you (and us) with sprucing up and restoring order, we're talking to professionals and experts this week all about the best tricks and tools.\n\nOrganizing your kitchen can be intimidating, especially if you feel like you're maxed out on all available kitchen storage but still have more pots and pans and bowls that you need to fit into your cabinets and onto your shelves. The good news is that with a little planning and a few good cabinet organizers, you too can have a functional, organized kitchen without going full Marie Kondo and throwing most of your stuff out. And to help you come up with some foolproof pantry and kitchen organization ideas, I asked two professional organizers to share the kitchen and pantry organizers they use to create picture-perfect pantries and space-saving kitchens for their clients (and in their own homes).\n\nBest Kitchen-Cabinet Organizers Salt 12-Inch Cabinet Shelf in White\n\n\"I call them helper shelves -- or mini-shelves or stacker shelves. It's almost like a table, and it lets you double the space in your cabinet because you can put plates or bowls underneath it or on top of it. It's also really good if you can't adjust your shelves in your cabinet or if there's just a lot of extra vertical space. With this helper shelf, you separate different sizes of plates or bowls or types of dishes, and when you need to grab one, you don't have to move others. I like the coated metal ones because they're a little more protective, and they don't slide around.\" -- Lisa Zaslow, Gotham Organizers\n\n$6 at Bed Bath and Beyond YouCopia StoreMore Adjustable Cookware Rack in White\n\n\"Rather than stacking frying pans and baking sheets, flip them on their side and store them vertically, like files. So that way, you can pull one out without having to move a whole stack, and there are pot and pan organizers that hold them vertically, so they don't all topple and slide around. That's a great way to make your stuff more accessible and also maximize your space. But for big pots, like a stockpot, most often, people have to stack them. If you do have to stack things, put the ones that you use more often on the top.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$20 at Bed Bath and Beyond YouCopia StoreMore Adjustable Cookware $20 at Amazon $20 at Amazon Our Tall Shoe Box\n\n\"I have a baking bin with a lot of stuff in it, and it's appliances, things related to baking that I love, but I don't keep it in my working kitchen. So I have plastic bins with lockdown lids that I have in the bottom of my front hall closet [filled with] baking stuff that's just odd, like the weird popover pan -- because when you want it, you want it, but it's funny and it takes up a lot of space. [If you don't have a spare closet,] you know how sometimes in New York, there's space above the cabinets? Especially in rental apartments. It gets dirty and gross up there if you cook in your kitchen, but if you use bins with lockdown lids, the bin gets kind of gnarly, but what's in it is clean. There's one Container Store brand that we use a lot, they're inexpensive and they work really well, so we use those a lot in kitchens. \" -- Ann Lightfoot, Done & Done Home\n\n$4 at The Container Store SimpleHouseware Wall / Door Mount Kitchen Wrap Storage Organizer, White\n\n\"One of my fave kitchen space-saving organizers are wrap racks, which utilize the wasted space on the inside of a lower cabinet door to store wraps -- like plastic wrap, aluminum foil -- and plastic bags, freeing up drawer space. You can also use them for cutting boards or under the sink for cleaning products.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$9 at Amazon $9 at Amazon Best Kitchen-Pantry Organizers OXO Good Grips 10-Piece Food Storage Pop Container Set\n\n\"We do lots of pantries for people because they're on Instagram or Pinterest, and they go, 'I want the million-dollar look.' But we always say to them that we don't want to leave you and have you be aggravated, because life is hard enough. So one of the things we always say to people is if it's something you know how to use -- let's say flour -- put it in the clear bins. You could put Doritos in the clear bins, that's sort of fun. The containers we always use for those are the OXO ones that have the pushdown button, so I think it probably does stay fresher than flour in a paper bag, and in that way, it works. But anything that's in a box with an expiration date or directions, don't put that in a separate container. You can put them into bins by groups, you can have all your rices together, instead.\" -- Lightfoot\n\n$100 at Bed Bath and Beyond OXO Good Grips 10-Piece Food Storage POP Container Set $85 at Amazon $85 at Amazon Best Kitchen-Drawer Organizers 2\" Custom Drawer Organizer Strips, White\n\n\"The first thing is to give each drawer kind of a function, so you have a sense of what is in which drawer, because that will also reduce the time you spend hunting for something. Every kitchen is different, but usually, there's some drawer relatively close to the stove, and I like to use that for gadgets that are used at the stove. (It sounds obvious, but you'd be amazed.) So when you're standing at the stove, you can open the drawer and grab a spatula, a wooden spoon, a slotted spoon. Most of those things are usually long with a handle, so to be honest, if those are just neatly arranged in a drawer, you often don't need any kind of organizer. But one thing that I do love in organizing a drawer, because it takes up almost no space, are these customized drawer dividers that you cut with an X-Acto knife. You can cut them to the exact size that you want, and then they've got slots that stick on to the edge of the drawer, and you just slide them in.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$17 at The Container Store Madesmart 6 Compartment Cutlery Tray in White/Gray\n\n\"For utensils -- knives, forks, spoons -- I usually just buy a standard organizer. That's one of the few organizing products throughout the home that is actually made really well. Nobody has trouble finding their forks for that reason. Personally, I like the molded-plastic type of organizers because they're easy to clean, and they can contain crumbs. If you have mesh ones, the crumbs can fall through it. And in the kitchen, I like things that are easy to clean.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$10 at Bed Bath and Beyond Madesmart Large Silverware Tray, White $8 at Amazon $8 at Amazon Best Refrigerator-Shelf Organizers InterDesign Fridge Binz 8-Inch x 15-Inch Stackable Clear Plastic Bin\n\n\"One thing that I really like is these clear bins; they're made by InterDesign and they're called Binz. And they have ones specifically for the fridge, which are called Fridge Binz. The thing that's great about them is that fridge shelves are really deep, so stuff does tend to get pushed to the back. With these bins, it makes the shelf into a drawer, so you can put a whole bunch of small things into the bin and then pull the whole thing out. So if you have tons of condiment jars that don't fit on the shelves on the door, those are great to contain them. Or if you've got things like anchovy paste in a tube, that's just going to fall down and get lost from the door, those are great in a bin.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$15 at Bed Bath and Beyond OXO Good Grips 11-Inch Turntable\n\n\"Depending on how the fridge is laid out, a lazy Susan can make a huge difference. It, of course, doesn't use the corners, but because it turns, it means you're not getting the black holes in the back where things are lost. And then you're not wasting money on things that spoil.\" -- Lightfoot\n\n$12 at Bed Bath and Beyond OXO Good Grips Lazy Susan Turntable, 11-Inch $12 at Amazon $12 at Amazon Sharpie 30001 Permanent Markers, Fine Point, Black, Box of 12 $6 at Amazon $6 at Amazon Duck Brand 394693 General Purpose Masking Tape $5 at Amazon $5 at Amazon\n\n\"The other thing I will say is great for organizing your fridge is just a Sharpie and a roll of masking tape, so that you label things, like when you put something in the fridge, when you opened the jar of salsa -- because who remembers?\" -- Zaslow\n\nBest Food-Storage Containers and Gadgets Rubbermaid 10-Piece Glass Food Storage Container Set With Easy-Find Lid\n\n\"Clear is great because you can see what's inside. For those I actually like glass because that's easier to clean than plastic, and things like tomato sauce are not going to stain glass. Rubbermaid makes some nice ones where the containers nest, and the tops stick together. The bottom is glass, but the top is a rubbery plastic. They're airtight, square. Square is always better; it's more of a space-saving shape than a circle. I think it's really good also to have one shelf, usually the top shelf, where you put your leftovers, so you see them and remember to use them.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$30 at Bed Bath and Beyond Rubbermaid Easy Find Lids Glass Food Storage Containers, 10-Piece Set $24 at Amazon $24 at Amazon Debbie Meyer Green Bags\n\n\"What I prefer for produce savers, because they save more space, are these Debbie Meyer GreenBags. They really work. You just use that and a chip clip. They're great for carrots, lettuce, celery, any kind of produce. It really does make them last longer. The thing about these, as you eat your lettuce, it takes up less and less space, which is what I love about plastic bags, in general. They don't look cute on Instagram, but they really work.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$10 at Bed Bath and Beyond Debbie Meyer GreenBags $7 at Amazon $7 at Amazon Twixit! 20-Piece Bag Clips\n\n\"I'm obsessed with these clips; they're called Twixit. They're Swedish, and they come in all different sizes. They have big ones you can use right on a bag of chips. You just use them over and over again; they can go in the freezer. I buy a lot of frozen berries and fruit; those things come in plastic bags, so I just use these to keep them closed. They're also great for those inner plastic bags inside of boxes of crackers or cereal.\" -- Zaslow\n\n$9 at Bed Bath and Beyond Linden Sweden Twixit Clip Bag Sealers, Set of 20 Assorted $10 at Amazon $10 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "To browse the Claire's website is to enter a time machine and get out in a world of Backstreet Boys bangers (or were you more of an NSYNC girl?), freshly pierced ears, snap bracelets, puberty, and malls that were actually filled with people. But today, suffering under a pile of over $2 billion of debt, Claire's filed for bankruptcy. A '90s fashion revival and Lil Uzi Vert mall-goth Grammys outfit alone were unable to save it.\n\nAs of now, Claire's will still keep all of its stores open, and it thinks it can pull through, given that you can't get your ears pierced on Amazon, but in these times there's really no saying how long it'll last. If recent trends teach us anything, it probably won't be that long. Just last week, less than a year after filing for bankruptcy itself, Toys 'R' Us announced it'll be closing all of its stores. So while it's hard to find Claire's stuff that we actually like now that we're older than 12, we took a little trip in the time machine and surfaced 13 crazy-cheap things we actually might still buy and wear now.

She was crossing the street when she was struck by the car sometime between late Sunday evening and early Monday morning. The woman has not yet been identified by the authorities. She is believed to be the first person killed by a car operating autonomously, the Times also reports.\n\nThe car, while operating sans driver, was not empty when the incident occurred. There was a person, a \"human safety driver,\" in the driver's seat of the car. Uber is cooperating with officials on an investigation into the accident and has since suspended driverless tests in Tempe, as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Toronto. While it is the first pedestrian fatality, this isn't the first incident to occur with an Uber test of a autonomous vehicle. About a year ago, Uber also suspended vehicle testing after a collision in Arizona that ended with a driverless Uber vehicle rolling over after it was hit by another nonautonomous car. Following an investigation, testing resumed.",

                "title": "Dem Congressman Hints at Armed Rebellion Against Trump",
                "body": "In pursuit of the ever-popular Beltway sport of False Equivalence, it's common to see today's left-bent resistance to Donald Trump compared to right-wing extremist movements of the recent past, from the tea party movement to precincts further off in the fever swamps. This sort of talk is often the product of laziness or malice. But now and then something happens that makes left-right parallels unavoidable and accurate. One such incident, surprisingly, comes from the loose lips of a member of Congress, New York's Tom Suozzi. According to the New York Post, the Nassau County Democrat had this to say about the remedies available to deal with Donald J. Trump during a town hall meeting last week:\n\n\"It's really a matter of putting public pressure on the president,\" Suozzi said in a newly released video of the March 12 talk in Huntington. \"This is where the Second Amendment comes in, quite frankly, because you know, what if the president was to ignore the courts? What would you do? What would we do?\"\n\nA listener then blurts out, \"What's the Second Amendment?\"\n\nThe left-leaning Democrat says, \"The Second Amendment is the right to bear arms.\n\nFirst time I read about this, I thought maybe Suozzi was joking. Apparently not.\n\nSuozzi political adviser Kim Devlin denied the pol was \"advocating for an armed insurrection.\"\n\nBut the Suozzi campaign at the same time seemed to double down on the comments, as they forwarded a line penned by Thomas Jefferson that called for armed resistance.\n\n\"What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms,\" the quote said.\n\nThe idea that the Second Amendment is intended to preserve the right of the people to undertake a violent revolution against some present or future \"tyrannical\" government is dangerously common on the political right. It's usually articulated by those who oppose any firearm regulations whatsoever. But at a deeper level, the availability of\n\n\"Second Amendment remedies\" is the foundation stone of the militia movement, and represents a not-very-subtle threat from anti-democratic (not to mention anti-Democratic) activists of all sorts that there are rights -- ranging from property rights to the so-called right to life of the unborn -- that no popular majority will be allowed to violate perpetually without provoking righteous violence. This Second\n\nAmendment-based right of revolution was embraced by 2016 Republican presidential candidates Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, and Mike Huckabee.\n\nThis sort of loose talk has largely been accepted as part of conventional conservative politics, though Donald Trump did raise some eyebrows during the 2016 general election by hinting that he might share it:\n\nRepeating his contention that Mrs. Clinton wanted to abolish the right to bear arms, Mr. Trump warned at a rally here that it would be \"a horrible day\" if Mrs. Clinton were elected and got to appoint a tiebreaking Supreme Court justice.\n\n\"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\" Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: \"Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don't know.\"\n\nSo Suozzi is in some pretty strange company in adopting the Second Amendment remedies meme, including, perhaps, the man whose threats to the Constitution apparently pushed him in this direction in the first place.\n\nI'm sure Suozzi will issue a \"clarification\" before the sun sets tonight. But his remarks should serve as an opportunity for left-of-center folk to swear off similar thinking once and for all. There are few things more frightening than the possibility that participants in today's hyperpolarized partisan politics will all get into the habit of threatening to take up shooting irons to redress the imperfections of our political system. Progressives would be well-advised to leave this sort of extremist reasoning to the gun nuts and the wing nuts.",

                "title": "The Best Camping Tents, According to Outdoors Experts",
                "body": "If you're in the market for a camping tent (or are the proud owner of a new one), you know that tent-shopping is complicated at best. For starters, there's the cost. \"Someone new to camping is going to be looking at their budget first,\" says Ryan Potts, a Backcountry hiking and camping expert (\"gearhead,\" to use company lingo). \"If you're already a dedicated camper, then budget is secondary to the best gear for your particular need.\" And with the best-reviewed tents starting around $300, quality gear can cost you.\n\nThen, of course, is the issue of whether you care more about having breathing room or carrying a light load. \"If you're car-camping with a group, you care more about comfort and space, and not too much about weight,\" says Jason Heckle, the tristate outdoor programs supervisor at REI. \"If you're hiking for miles and miles, weight is the most important factor. You're going to reduce the size and the number of creature comforts that you would have on a typical car-camping situation.\"\n\nArguably the most important factor is whether the tent you've dropped hundreds of dollars on is primed for the unexpected: rain, wind, and unwieldy zippers. Cliff Jacobson, a seasoned outdoors expert with over 20 books on camping and canoeing under his belt, says he won't budge on specs like twin entries (so you're not trapped if a zipper breaks), a long fly wall (or rain cover) that covers all the seams, and a sturdy frame that's windproof and waterproof. To find the best, we sought out expert recommendations for a range of prices, sizes, and weights (with the through line that all should be weatherproofed, too).\n\nThe Best Starter Two-Person Tent Under $200 REI Co-Op Half-Dome 2 Plus Tent\n\n\"A lot of times, we get people that want one tent they can do everything with. This one's a good example of that: It's a two-person tent. The 'plus' means it's got a little extra length on the interior, so it's certainly for taller people, but you can also fit a bit more gear in there. It's certainly very well priced for what you're getting. It has two doors, two vestibules, a little extra space, and it's made of thicker material, so it's gonna be durable, waterproof, and you're saving $200 from the absolute lightest two-person tents that you can buy on the market. And it's not a onetime-use tent. You're gonna have it for years. It's just a workhouse of a tent.\" -- Jason Heckle\n\nEditor's note: For a similarly priced option that's in this weight class, with two doors and two vestibules, there's also this Marmot option on sale.\n\n$199 at REI The Best Midrange Two-Person Tent Marmot Tungsten UL Tent: 2-Person, 3-Season\n\n\"This Marmot tent is probably the best tent out there for the dedicated trekker who is backpacking or car-camping on any consistent basis. The Tungsten is the one everyone can own and be happy with because it's the best balance between weight and space and cost out there. The cost of this Marmot falls between two tiers of heavier, less expensive tents and lighter-weight, more expensive tents. This Marmot stands alone in a nice medium place. The poles are pre-bent, so there's a little bit more head room. This one has two doors and two vestibules, plus the weight on this Marmot is the same as tents that cost $100 more.\" -- Ryan Potts\n\n$299 at Backcountry The Best Lightweight Two-Person Tent Big Agnes Tiger Wall UL 2-Person Tent\n\n\"This is for the tried-and-true backpacker who knows that the majority of the time spent in the backcountry is going to be away from the car. So they're going to be hiking distances and putting it on their bike and riding places. This is the one to get if space and weight are an issue. They make it in a two- and three-person size. It's an ultralightweight option that has two doors, two vestibules, it's for two people, and it weighs two pounds. It has thinner materials, higher-quality zippers, and it's light, but still waterproof and durable.\" -- Heckle\n\n$400 at Outdoor Play The Best Top-of-the-Line Two-Person Tent Hilleberg Nallo GT 2-Person Tent\n\nIf you really want a top-of-the-line, lightweight tent that can handle the elements, Jacobson recommends Swedish brand Hilleberg's tents, which he says are traditionally the best tents in the world. \"If you want a tent that is really watertight and windproof, you're going to be better off looking at a design that's a standard A-frame or a tunnel because its construction is sturdier,\" he says. Google \"Hilleberg\" and you'll find an abundance of articles referencing its stellar reputation, which might owe a lot to the brand's Kerlon nylon fabric, coated with three layers of silicone to make it extra tear-proof and windproof. The tents can run upwards of $1,000, so they're not for the average recreational camper. But if you're a global camper and want a tent suited for all types of terrain, that maximizes storage and space, this is it. Outdoor Gear Lab called this one \"a spacious and strong model\" and a \"world-class tunnel tent.\"\n\n$850 at Moosejaw The Best Affordable, All-Purpose Four-Person Tent Eureka! Timberline SQ 4XT Tent\n\n\"Eureka makes a lot of excellent tents for not a lot of money. For people who don't want to spend a great deal of money, I suggest they take a good look at them,\" says Jacobson. \"They make good, solid tents with good designs. The design is really more important than construction. If you want a less expensive tent, A-frame tents are much more windproof than a dome style, and they have a bathtub floor, which is sewn to the tent several inches above the ground and helps keep water out.\" This one meets many of his specifications for a great tent: It has two doors and two vestibules for easy entry and wider space, has a longer fly wall to protect against rain, a bathtub-style floor to help keep moisture out, and comes in an A-frame shape for greater stability.\n\n$290 at Amazon $290 at Amazon The Best Starter Six-Person Tent Under $400 Kelty Trail Ridge 6-Person Tent With Footprint\n\n\"This is a good entry-level tent with great value. It's for someone just getting started, and plans to be doing it for a while down the road, because they're not going with the absolute lowest in quality. And consequently, they want to enjoy it, so the very first requirement for me, for any tent, are those two doors and two vestibules because you want to be comfortable out there. This one is too heavy to carry backpacking, but with those two doors and two vestibules, in the middle of the night, if someone needs to go to the bathroom, they don't have to crawl over everyone else. There's lots of room underneath those vestibules for boots, and stuff that you want to keep outside your tent. You could probably have your dog sleep out there.\" -- Potts\n\n$400 at Backcountry The Best All-Terrain Six-Person Tent Marmot Halo 6-Person Tent $479 (was $599, now 20% off)\n\n\"This one is for someone who is a dedicated camper. They're probably familiar with Marmot as a brand. It has two doors, two vestibules, great protection -- someone who gets out there enough that they encounter some rough weather at some point in time. They need something that can handle the worst that the weather can throw at them and they're gonna be ready for it. And then also room as well. This one is big enough to stand up in. A six-foot-tall person could stand up in this, and there's still plenty of room in case you get stuck in there.\" -- Potts\n\n$479 at Backcountry The Best Sky Tent for Mountaineers Tepui Ayer Sky Tent: 2 Person, 4-Season\n\n\"The sky tent is pretty common out here in Salt Lake. This is for the dedicated weekend warrior who is looking for convenience. This thing basically sits on top of your car most of the time, so it's great if you're hitting the mountains right after work. Obviously, there's a pretty steep price tag on this guy, but with that comes that convenience. It's super easy to set up. This tent mounts on crossbars, so really any car that can hold 150 pounds on its roof, in theory, could work. You fold it out and you're up there above the ground, above the creepy-crawlies. There's some peace of mind when you're up there five feet off the ground, and it can be warmer, too, away from the moisture and dew. It's like a tree house for adults, essentially.\" -- Potts\n\n$1,050 at Amazon $1,050 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "How to Understand Facebook and Cambridge Analytica",
                "body": "Late Friday night, Facebook published an unusual announcement to its newsroom blog. \"We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook,\" deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote. SCL had illegitimately obtained data about Facebook users, and had apparently not destroyed that data when Facebook ordered it to in 2015. Consequently, the company was no longer allowed access to Facebook's platform. \"We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook,\" Grewal concluded.\n\nThe next morning, it became clear just why SCL and Cambridge Analytica had been suspended so abruptly, and at such an odd hour: because the New York Times and the Observer were prepping major investigative stories about the company's use of Facebook data, based on documents and other information from a 26-year-old whistle-blower named Christopher Wylie.\n\nBoth stories are excellent, and help us better understand exactly what Cambridge Analytica did during the 2016 election (and the primaries before it). But there are a few points worth pulling out and emphasizing.\n\nFacebook was being used as it's designed, and that's the problem.\n\nIn 2014, while working at Cambridge Analytica, Wylie hired a University of Cambridge professor named Aleksandr Kogan to build a database of psychometric profiles. Cambridge Analytica -- funded by the right-wing billionaire Mercer family and advised by then-Breitbart editor-in-chief Steve Bannon -- hoped to use the data to target political advertising and influence voter behavior. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk freelance boards, Kogan hired around 270,000 people to fill out a survey in an app that they would install in their Facebook accounts.\n\nFacebook apps, like FarmVille, extend the platform's usability, but in installing them, users often give third-party developers like Kogan access to a significant amount of their own data. Worse, in 2014, when Kogan's app was gathering data, Facebook's terms of service allowed developers to request access to an app installer's friends as well.\n\nIn other words, each of the 270,000 people who were paid to install the app also gave up a significant amount of data about their Facebook friends as well -- meaning that from the original 270,000 subjects, Kogan managed to obtain as many as 50 million profiles, including information like locations, job and educational histories, and pages liked. Facebook has since changed privacy settings that mean you can't be data-betrayed by your inconsiderate or careless friends. But at the time, there was nothing about what Kogan was doing with his app that broke any of Facebook's rules. It wasn't until he passed that data on to Cambridge Analytica that he put himself in violation of Facebook's terms of use.\n\nFacebook has therefore insisted that it was not party to a \"breach\" of user data. You could argue that this is a semantic argument, largely designed to protect the company from SEC regulations that would have required them to alert users that their data had been mishandled and distributed without explicit permission. Certainly, user trust has been breached, even if no particular server or database was illegally or maliciously accessed.\n\nBut I actually agree with Facebook on this point: It wasn't breached; Kogan obtained profile data perfectly legitimately. I just don't think that's a good defense. As hardly needs stating at this point, Facebook's business model is built on gathering data about its users. (\"We ... built models to exploit what we knew about [people] and target their inner demons,\" Wylie tells the Observer. \"That was the basis the entire company was built on.\" He's talking about Cambridge Analytica, but the statement is equally true of Facebook.) You can argue that it was a bad idea to allow a surveillance-advertising company to grow to the size and influence of Facebook. But everyone can agree that the data Facebook has gathered on its users should be better protected, and that users should have better knowledge of and control over that data. Kogan was able to access profiles of 50 million users by paying a mere 270,000 users to install an app -- and able to pass that data on to a third party without Facebook's knowledge -- because Facebook made it remarkably easy to obtain information about its users, not because he did something particularly nefarious.\n\nIf this has happened once, it's probably happened more than once.\n\nKogan ran afoul of the rules by passing the data he'd obtained to a third party -- Cambridge Analytica. He'd presented the app to Facebook and to its users as a project gathering for academic research, but then had turned around and given it to a company that had not been named or identified, and which sought to use the data for political, not academic, purposes.\n\nBut it's worth noting that the only reason any of us know that this happened is because of Cambridge Analytica's prominence in the news. Facebook itself only seems to have become aware that Kogan's data was being misused in late 2015, after a Guardian report outlined the company's data-harvesting techniques. Having learned that millions of its users' data was now in the hands of a company to whom no such permissions had been granted, Facebook demanded that Cambridge Analytica delete that data -- and then never followed up.\n\nThe fact that all this data was obtained legitimately in the first place, and that the discovery that it had been mishandled was met with only token objection by Facebook, is not, to put it mildly, confidence-inspiring. If the Guardian had never reported on the Cruz campaign's contract with Cambridge Analytica, would Facebook (or any of us) even know that profile data on so many users was out there? And given that, shouldn't we be assuming that this same thing -- shady mass data-harvesting of Facebook profiles, to be kept on third-party servers -- has happened more than once?\n\nFacebook has known about this for a long time, and has done nothing.\n\nThe Observer and Times stories are valuable for the level of detail they bring to Cambridge Analytica's practices, and for the attention they draw to Facebook's lax privacy protections. But much of the key information in both stories could also be found in an Intercept story from last year -- and in the aforementioned Guardian story from December 2015.\n\nIt's easy to be cynical about the sudden attention the story is now getting from the public, given that we've had two years to process Cambridge Analytica's methods. And surely some of the attention is unwarranted -- the result of sensationalized chatter about Cambridge Analytica's overstated role in Trump's victory. (More on that in a minute.) But Facebook has been silent over the course of those two years, too. To its credit, it's changed app permissions so that developers can no longer access such a wide network of profiles. Yet even after it was aware that Cambridge Analytica was in possession of mishandled profile data, it did nothing beyond send a letter. \"They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted,\" Wylie told the Observer. It's hard to square that with Facebook lawyer Grewal's claim that \"[p]rotecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do.\"\n\nThe trouble is with Facebook, not (necessarily) Cambridge Analytica.\n\nTrump's victory in 2016 was so unexpected, and so close, that a whole cottage industry of explanations for his victory -- from the prosaic to the conspiracy-driven -- has emerged in its wake. Early coverage of Cambridge Analytica tended toward the sensational: Soon after the election, the Guardian called Cambridge Analytica's influence \"sinister,\" and it was suggested in the woollier corners of Twitter that its \"psychometric profiles\" were not just a deciding factor in the election but a particularly dangerous one.\n\nThe truth is that there's very little evidence that Cambridge Analytica's particular methods have any different effect on voting behavior than any other digital political campaign efforts. Dave Karpf, a professor at Georgetown and expert in political advocacy on the internet, has called Cambridge Analytica the \"Theranos of political data\" -- a company with \"a tremendous marketing department, coupled with a team of research scientists who provide on virtually none of those marketing promises.\"\n\nGiven the narrowness of Trump's margins, could Cambridge Analytica have provided the extra nudge that pushed him across the finish line? Sure! And, yes, it's awfully interesting that Cambridge Analytica employed a Russian-American professor who received funding from the Russian government. But until more reporting is done, that's all it is -- interesting. As Cambridge Analytica itself has resentfully pointed out, the Obama campaign was undertook similar Facebook data-gathering efforts. Those campaigns were aboveboard, and the uses of the data made clear to those who signed up -- no small distinction -- but they used Facebook in much the same way. Focusing on Cambridge Analytica as a uniquely sinister actor in the election (or in the world of data acquisition or voter-targeting) ignores exactly how easy, and how mundane, their data-harvesting really was -- and how vulnerable your Facebook data really is.",

                "title": "As Opioid Crisis Deepens, States Leave Relief Funds Unspent",
                "body": "In 2016, drug overdoses killed 63,600 Americans -- more than guns killed in the peak year for firearm violence in the United States; or HIV/AIDs in the worst year of that epidemic; or car accidents in the heyday of the Ford Pinto; or the Vietnam War during the entirety of its duration.\n\nIn response to this mass death, Congress appropriated $500 million worth of opioid relief funds in 2017, and another $500 million in 2018. Responsibility for allocating these resources was left up to the states.\n\nAs of August of last year, drug overdoses were up 13 percent over 2016 -- and yet, as of the end of last year, states had left left nearly $400 million in opioid relief funds unspent. As Politico reports:\n\nCongress sent states hundreds of millions of dollars to fight an opioid crisis claiming more than 100 lives a day -- money they've largely been unable to spend after a year.\n\nMixed signals from the Trump administration on how to use the money and state challenges ramping up their efforts have left untouched more than three-quarters of the $500 million Congress set aside under the 21st Century Cures Act in late 2016.\n\n...\"This is a total failure,\" said Andrew Kolodny, former chief medical officer at Phoenix House and now a Brandeis University researcher, likening the situation to food and water \"stuck in an airport somewhere, while people are starving to death.\"\n\nThe cause of this \"total failure\" appears to be twofold:\n\n(1) Some states have inefficient procedures for allocating state contracts (in New Hampshire, a five-member council must approve every contract that exceeds $25,000).\n\n(2) It is hard to make serious investments in addiction treatment and mental health care with funds that expire in two years.\n\nThe latter issue is more fundamental and far-reaching. \"Onetime money really changes the parameters of what you think you can fund,\" Katie Marks, project director for the Kentucky Opioid Response Effort, told Politico. \"Some of these programs are going to take a fair amount of development before they can sustain themselves.\"\n\nIt is difficult for states to convince health-care providers to participate in programs whose future funding is uncertain. In Indiana, plans were drafted for an expansion in residential substance abuse services -- and then shelved, due to concerns that the project would prove unsustainable.\n\nThis week, Donald Trump will unveil his plan for combating the opioid epidemic. Early reports suggest it will include a few worthwhile (but small-bore) efforts to increase access to addiction treatment, along with a (thoroughly worthless) proposal to expand the death penalty to certain drug dealers. But all signs suggests that the president's plan will leave the biggest obstacle to mounting a comprehensive response to our public health emergency unaddressed: the GOP's sociopathic fiscal priorities.\n\nA party committed to ever-lower tax rates -- and an ever-larger military budget -- is always going to have a hard time acknowledging when novel circumstances reveal a need for significantly higher social spending. Thus, congressional Republicans have decided to treat the opioid crisis as though it were a natural disaster -- an ephemeral, aberrant tragedy that requires only a temporary increase in domestic spending. In reality, though, Americans aren't trying to rebuild in the wake of a passing storm; the rising tide of drug deaths hasn't even crested. And even if there were signs that the opioid epidemic was in retreat, it would still be necessary to address the structural underfunding of evidence-based addiction treatment and mental-health services in the United States: The costs of our current overdose crisis have been so great that the case for investing in the health-care infrastructure necessary for mitigating the next one should be overwhelming. In 2015 alone, the opioid crisis cost the American economy $504 billion, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nAnd yet, the GOP-controlled Congress only approved $1 billion over two years for the opioid epidemic -- while adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade for its regressive tax cut package.\n\nUnless Trump is prepared to challenge his party's allergy to increasing investment in public goods (that can't be used to kill people overseas) his opioids plan will be doomed to inadequacy; and drug overdoses will continue to send life expectancy falling in the wealthiest nation the world has ever seen.",

                "title": "Trump Made White House Staff Sign NDAs to Stop Leaks: Report",
                "body": "It's well-known that nearly everyone in Donald Trump's orbit has to sign a nondisclosure agreement, from business associates, to campaign employees, to women he may or may not have had an affair with. Therefore it is simultaneously galling and non-at-all surprising that Trump may have pressured senior White House staffers into signing NDAs, though they are members of the federal government, not his personal employees.\n\nTrump actually told the Washington Post in April 2016 that he intended to use NDAs in the White House, saying \"when people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don't like that.\"\n\nHe allowed that \"there could be some kind of a law that you can't do this,\" and experts say he was on to something:\n\nBut on Sunday the Post's Ruth Marcus reported that she did some digging and learned that didn't stop President Trump from making sure everyone around him signed NDAs in an effort to stop the steady flow of leaks from his young administration:\n\nIn the early months of the administration, at the behest of now-President Trump, who was furious over leaks from within the White House, senior White House staff members were asked to, and did, sign nondisclosure agreements vowing not to reveal confidential information and exposing them to damages for any violation. Some balked at first but, pressed by then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Counsel's Office, ultimately complied, concluding that the agreements would likely not be enforceable in any event.\n\nThe nondisclosure agreements, said a person who signed the document, \"were meant to be very similar to the ones that some of us signed during the campaign and during the transition. I remember the president saying, 'Has everybody signed a confidentiality agreement like they did during the campaign or we had at Trump Tower?' \"\n\nTrump's hope, according to the source, was that staffers would \"think twice\" about leaking \"if they were on the hook for some serious damages.\" It appears the consequences were indeed quite serious. Marcus obtained a draft of the NDA that includes a $10 million punishment:\n\nIt would expose violators to penalties of $10 million, payable to the federal government, for each and any unauthorized revelation of \"confidential\" information, defined as \"all nonpublic information I learn of or gain access to in the course of my official duties in the service of the United States Government on White House staff,\" including \"communications . . . with members of the press\" and \"with employees of federal, state, and local governments.\" The $10 million figure, I suspect, was watered down in the final version, because the people to whom I have spoken do not remember that jaw-dropping sum.\n\nThe source did recall that as stated in the draft, the final agreement they signed would remain in place not just for their tenure in the Trump administration, or the four or eight years Trump is in office, but \"at all times thereafter\" - i.e. until the end of time.\n\nIt seems the NDAs did not have the desired effect, as there was no noticeable drop off in leaks in February or March 2017. But of course, we have no way of knowing if the NDA had a chilling effect, convincing some who would have sounded the alarm about activities inside the Trump administration to keep quiet. The report raises plenty of other concerns, such as why the White House Counsel's Office was pressuring federal employees to sign a ridiculous loyalty agreement. It also underscores that the president of the United States doesn't know or care how the government works.\n\nOne thing you probably don't need to worry about is your favorite Trump administration personality finding that they owe the federal government tens of millions of dollars. Trump is struggling to silence a porn star who signed an NDA before he was elected, so the Mooch will probably be fine.",

                "body": "Two men in their 20s suffered serious but non-life threatening injuries when another explosion rocked Austin, Texas on Sunday night. It's unclear if the latest blast is related to three package explosions in the city earlier this month, which left two people dead and two seriously injured. The latest incident occurred just hours after police issued a rare public plea to the bomber or bombers, saying they hoped they would \"reach out to us before anyone else is injured or killed.\"\n\nSunday night's explosion occurred in the 4800 block of Dawn Song Drive, which is in southwest Austin. The earlier explosions occurred in separate suburbs in the eastern part of the city.\n\nNeighbors said they felt their homes rattle around 8:30 p.m. CT. \"It sounded like when the transformers go out, but it was five times magnified that,\" Eliza May, who lives about 200 feet from where the explosion occurred, told the New York Times.\n\nA few minutes later, local police and FBI agents flooded the area, and urged neighbors to go back into their homes. In a brief press conference, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley Police said residents within a half-mile radius should stay inside as police comb the area for additional bombs. He said police are examining a suspicious-looking backpack, and estimated that it will take them the rest of the night to clear the neighborhood.\n\nManley offered no further details on the explosion, and did not say whether police believe it is connected to the other blasts.\n\n\"We simply don't know a lot at this point,\" Manley said. \"Stay in your residence. Don't touch anything that looks suspicious.\"\n\nThe first explosion occurred on March 2, followed by two blasts on March 12. In each of those incidents, unmailed packages were placed near the victim's doorstep. Two detonated when they were picked up, and a third exploded after it was brought inside and opened. The two people who were killed, Stephen House and Draylen Mason, were African-Americans who attended the same church, raising fears that the bomber was targeting prominent black families. Esperanza Herrera, a 75-year-old Hispanic woman who was critically injured, did not appear to have any connection to House or Mason, but there are reports that she picked up a package addressed to someone else.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, police urged the bomber to contact them online or through 911. Experts noted that in similar cases, communications from the attacker have yielded clues that led to their capture.\n\n\"There's the message behind what's happening in our community, and we're not going to understand that until the suspect or suspects reaches out to us to talk to us about what that message was,\" Chief Manley said. \"We still do not know what ideology may be behind this and what the motive was behind this.\"\n\nManley also announced that the combined reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case had been increased from $65,000 to $115,000.\n\nSources WaPo USA Today NYT",

                "title": "What Hope Hicks Learned in Washington",
                "body": "On the morning of Wednesday, February 28, Hope Hicks arrived at the White House just after 8 a.m. Within a week, it would be snowing in Washington, D.C., but she was dressed for spring in a bouquet of purple, yellow, and blue, as if willing the end of winter with her miniskirt. She held on to her iPhone in the West Wing, in violation of a rule that normally diverted it to a locker secured by a shiny silver key, then retreated to her office, a first-floor broom closet that in the past had been assigned to presidential secretaries.\n\nWhen the administration began 13 months before, competition among some staffers had manifested as a struggle for real estate here; Omarosa Manigault, a perennial reality-TV contestant, had gone so far as to steal a room that had been designated for Anthony Scaramucci, \"the Mooch,\" a hedge-fund millionaire obsessed with astrology and the word fuck, because of its status-confirming glimpse of the Washington Monument. Both of them were eventually fired, along with a procession of others who failed to maneuver the chaotic status hierarchy President Trump seemed to cultivate out of boredom.\n\nA view of duck-tour buses circling the mall wasn't needed for Hicks to know her standing. What her office lacked in flair it made up for in proximity. While others were left wondering what the president was thinking, Hicks could often hear him shouting, even with her door closed. \"Hope!\" he'd scream. \"Hopey!\" \"Hopester!\" \"Get in here!\"\n\nMany requests were mundane. \"He doesn't write anything down,\" one source close to the White House told me. \"He doesn't type, he dictates. 'Take this down, take this down: Trump: richest man on Earth.' \" A second source who meets regularly with the president told me that Hicks acted almost as an embodiment of the faculties the Trump lacked -- like memory. \"He'll be talking, and then right in the middle he'll be like, 'Hope, what was that ... thing?' \" When the name of a senator or congressman or journalist came up, Trump would prompt Hicks to provide a history of their interactions, asking, \"Do we like him?\" \"And she fucking remembers!\" (Trump has said his own memory is \"one of the greatest memories of all time.\") \"She's the only person he trusts,\" the second source continued. \"He doesn't trust any men and never has. He doesn't like men, you see. He has no male friends. I was just with one of them the other day, someone who's described as one of his closest friends, and he doesn't know him very well. But a small number of women, including his longtime assistant back in New York, he really listens to them -- especially if he's not banging them. Because, like a lot of men but more so, Trump really does compartmentalize the sex and the emotional part.\"\n\nHicks looked around her sepulchral space, outfitted with three mismatched chairs. On the desk was a tiny oil painting by her paternal grandmother, Lucile G. Hicks, an abstract work that looked like the sea or the inside of a cyclone, depending on your point of view. Fresh flowers were delivered by the White House florist each week; today they were pale-pink roses. With the president a motorcade ride away on Capitol Hill at the memorial of \"the GREAT\" Reverend Billy Graham, there was relative quiet.\n\nHicks took out one of her notebooks, black leather with the Trump name embossed in gold on the front. She'd prayed a lot over the weekend, and also written two lists in the same bubbly print that had recently been photographed on a note card in Trump's hand, reminding him to tell survivors of a school shooting, among other things, \"I hear you.\" One list contained reasons to resign as White House communications director immediately; the other, reasons to wait to resign. Not resigning at all wasn't a consideration.\n\nShe'd come close twice before. Over dinner in Bedminster in early August, she told Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump that she was unhappy. She'd thought that being in the White House would feel different than the campaign, but instead, surrounded by eccentrics, maniacs, divas, and guys from the Republican National Committee who seemed to think they were managing a Best Buy in Kenosha, it was somehow sicker there in the stillness of it all. She suggested removing herself from the belly of the psychodrama to work elsewhere in the administration. Sharing her frustrations, Jared and Ivanka engaged her idea with caution; they asked her to give General John Kelly, the new chief of staff, a chance to change the West Wing for the better.\n\nBut as time went on, it became clear that the sickness was a feature, that anyone who entered the building became a little sick themselves. And no matter how dead any of the eccentrics or maniacs or divas appeared to be, how far away from the president their status as fired or resigned or never-hired-in-the-first-place should have logically rendered them, nobody was ever truly gone. The people who were problems on the campaign or on the inside continued to be problems. The president's taste for the other and the new was so established that the most driven among them knew that all they had to do was wait for an opening, or shrewdly create one -- a weakened staffer, a particularly demoralizing news cycle -- and they could worm their way back in. The madness engulfing the White House, in other words, was not just a matter of staff infighting or factional ideological rivalries, as it was often portrayed in the press, but also, in part, the result of manipulation from the fringes of Trumpworld. In early December, Hicks had seriously considered resigning again. When her apartment's annual lease came up for renewal, she couldn't bring herself to sign the papers. Instead, she signed a six-month lease at a significant cost inflation.\n\nOver the weekend, she had sketched out in her notebook various courses of action and how they might play in the press. If she resigned immediately, the assumption would be that it was the result of the bad news that had defined the winter. There was the question of her legal exposure in the special-counsel investigation into Russia's interference in the election; already, she'd been interviewed by Robert Mueller and had appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"She's never failed to impress me, and I'm not an easy guy to impress, historically. I'm not a cheerleader,\" White House counsel Ty Cobb told me. \"She's sort of the last person on my list that I worry about.\" Yet Hicks surfaced at pivotal moments that were of interest to investigators, and she was now being mentioned along with phrases like obstruction. Soon she'd testify in the House, where she would take questions for nine hours, one moment of which, when it leaked -- her admission that she'd told \"white lies\" on her boss's behalf -- made headlines around the globe (some suggesting the president was furious with her). And then there was her personal life, which, with a tabloid story that swelled into a background check and classified-information scandal, had collided with the country's national security in a way that rarely happens outside Netflix.\n\nYet, if she waited, she probably couldn't avoid the impression that she was leaving because of a crisis, because there was always a crisis. If she'd resigned in August, they'd have said it was owed to Charlottesville. In December? Mueller or Roy Moore. January? Fire and Fury. From a public-relations perspective, there would never be a right moment to leave, but public relations as it's traditionally understood had almost no relevance in this White House. By Sunday, her gut had decided for her what her head couldn't.\n\nWhen the president returned from the Capitol around noon, Hicks opened her office door, which clasps with a ring at its center, and walked about ten feet to her right, into the Oval Office. Before she could finish resigning, Trump interrupted her. He told her that he cared about her happiness, that he understood her decision, and he would help her do anything she wanted to do in her life. He said he hoped she would go make a lot of money. He also said he hoped that she would come back at some point.\n\nThen the president added something else: \"I'm sorry for everything you've been through.\"\n\nHope Hicks wasn't a victim; on this both her allies and critics agreed. She didn't faint in a field of poppies and wake to find herself on Donald Trump's campaign, 35,000 feet up and strapped in aboard a Boeing 757. Over the course of three years, she'd spent more time with Trump than anyone, more than his own children and his wife, and she acknowledged his flaws and idiosyncrasies. She had made her choices knowingly, even if she couldn't know where they'd lead her. But she believed Trump was a good person, and she was angered that his critics didn't seem open to the parts of his personality that would lead them to believe the same. To Hicks, the president's policies were secondary considerations -- the man himself came first. And at the end of the day, she really liked him. \"Part of it is because of the proximity,\" a source close to her said, \"part of it is human nature.\" She even sounded a little like him sometimes, uttering words like loser in her sugary voice.\n\nIt would require an extraordinary sequence of events for her to finally quit. According to dozens of interviews conducted, over five weeks, with more than 30 current and former senior White House officials, what Hicks \"went through,\" to borrow the words of the president, wasn't really about her at all. She was something more like a pawn in a campaign to upend the White House from afar.\n\n\"When I decided to run for president, I said, 'Hope, lots of luck, hang on!' \" Trump told me once. It was April 2016, and we were in his office in Trump Tower. He hadn't yet secured the Republican nomination, but he was about to, and I was there to talk to him about his uncommonly press-shy press secretary, who sat in silence beside me, radiating discomfort. While nearly everyone else associated with the campaign seemed to think of it primarily as an opportunity to get on TV, Hicks feared attention, a quality that worked in her favor -- her boss wanted all the attention for himself -- until it didn't.\n\nHicks was 26 years old in 2015 when she was called to the same office, high above 57th and Fifth, and asked to accompany the future president someplace she'd never been: a political event (the Iowa Freedom Summit) in a caucus state. She didn't overanalyze her decision to join the campaign, thinking of it almost the way you'd think about a semester studying abroad. \"The feeling was, You know what? I'm just going to roll with it. Let's see what happens until the election,\" a source who has known her since before the campaign told me. \"She wasn't someone who was in it for the politics. She was in it because of the person, and the relationship with the family, and the experience.\"\n\nHicks was raised in Greenwich; PR and politics were recurring themes in her family. Her maternal grandfather, G.W.F. \"Dutch\" Cavender, had served in the Department of Agriculture under Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon; her maternal grandmother, Marilee Cavender, had worked at the Department of Transportation; her mother, Caye Cavender Hicks, had been an aide to Ed Jones, a Democratic congressman from Tennessee; her father, Paul Hicks, was the spokesman for the NFL. He'd once worked as an aide to Stewart B. McKinney, a Republican congressman from Connecticut, and, in the '80s, had served as part of the local Greenwich government.\n\nThat Hicks could bridge this Republican Establishment to the very anti-Establishment Trump was invaluable to the insurgent candidate. \"Does Donald Trump go and become an effective social figure in Hope's world? No,\" said a source close to the president. \"People would be like, 'What? Fuck you.' By the way, they've already said 'Fuck you,' which was the whole point of Trump running.\"\n\nHicks spent her childhood playing lacrosse and modeling for tween book covers and children's clothing, often leaving public school to drive with her mother into Manhattan for go-sees, then heading back to school in time for practice. In the handful of years after graduating from Southern Methodist with a B.A. in English, she waded into the family business, working for the publicist Matthew Hiltzik, a former Clinton operative and Miramax executive whose communications firm had clients ranging from Justin Bieber to Glenn Beck.\n\nShe met Hiltzik in Texas during Super Bowl XLV, at a tailgate with Alec Baldwin, who starred in a movie Hicks had auditioned for. (\"How odd,\" Baldwin told me when I asked him to provide his memory of the meeting. \"I have no recollection of that.\") But Hicks made an impression on Baldwin's then-rep, and within a few years, she was handling the Trump Organization account at Hiltzik Strategies and working closely with Ivanka Trump, who at the time was hustling a lifestyle brand.\n\nBy then, Hicks had the trust of the family, which meant she had the trust of The Donald. This, combined with the fact that she was the only founding staff member who didn't look like a relative of Louie De Palma, made the earliest days of the campaign play out like a season of The Bachelorette: Apprentice. It was an ensemble of two-bit villains, but even among them, the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who departed after allegedly grabbing a reporter's arm at a press conference, stood out.\n\nSam Nunberg, the screwy adviser you may recall from his recent decision to appear on live TV, possibly while drunk, to encourage special investigators to arrest him and to announce, in this publication, that Trump has a \"fat ass,\" today maintains that Lewandowski was to blame for getting him fired two months into the campaign (already, Nunberg had been fired and rehired, then fired and rehired again by Trump). Nunberg believes it was Lewandowski who leaked to the press racist social-media posts he'd made seven years prior, and that it was Lewandowski, in coordination with Hicks, who ignored Trump's promise to keep the firing quiet (they released a statement labeling him a \"low level\" operative).\n\nIn response, Nunberg went nuclear, accusing Lewandowski and Hicks in court documents of having an affair, after Trump sued him for violating an NDA. It was intended to hurt Lewandowski more than Hicks, but the former didn't seem to mind; he never made any effort to deny the accusation, and privately, he encouraged it. (Michael Wolff reported the affair as fact in Fire and Fury.)\n\nFor Lewandowski, there would be many more Nunbergs to deal with throughout the campaign, or people whom the president liked, for some reason, and who were thus a threat. This included Paul Manafort, a comically wicked creature of the Washington Establishment who made a career lobbying for foreign dictators, hired in April 2016 to help with delegates at the Republican convention. When Lewandowski was fired in late June -- the result of a coup led by Trump's children -- Manafort became the campaign chairman. But Lewandowski refused to accede to his exile, and in the days leading up to the election, when Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Bannon were leading the campaign after Manafort had been fired, he made an unofficial return, traveling on the plane with the candidate.\n\nHe'd been there in the beginning, and he believed he was owed a big piece of what came next. \"He didn't really want any responsibility. He just wants to be able to be with the president and just do whatever he wants him to do,\" a source who worked with Lewandowski and is close to the White House told me. \"He's been very focused, from day one, to get into the White House.\"\n\nThere were some issues, of course. Lewandowski had fallen out with Hicks; he was hated by the family; and, when John Kelly joined the White House, Lewandowski quickly developed a conflict with him, a stricter gatekeeper than the previous chief of staff. But Lewandowski did have something important going for him: Although nobody could really explain why, the president liked him. When Kelly prevented him from entering the White House in January, \"the president was upset,\" according to a former senior White House official. \"He complained extensively about Why wasn't Corey allowed in!\"\n\nFrom the time Hicks arrived in Washington, her existence had been an insular one, confined to a radius of only a few blocks past the White House, where she worked 15-hour shifts punctuated by crises and presidential decrees-by-tweet.\n\nShe woke at 4 a.m.; responded to emails from the night before; read the bookmarked articles she'd been meaning to get to; met her trainer in the 3,200-square-foot gym on the first floor of her building; and arrived early at the northern gate, usually by 7:30 a.m.\n\nBut on a Saturday night in late January, Hicks left her apartment and went to Hogan Gidley's home. Gidley, who lived nearby, was a deputy press secretary brought on to the White House staff in October by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, whose father, Mike Huckabee, was Gidley's former boss. Gidley and Hicks shared a love of Tommy Boy and mint candies, and they became fast friends. They were joined at Gidley's house by Josh Raffel, who was considered the White House spokesman for Jared and Ivanka; Hicks had worked with him at Hiltzik Strategies and considered him her best friend. They were also joined by Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary Hicks had been dating since the fall. At the last minute, the group decided to meet Raj Shah, another deputy press secretary, to get dinner at Rosa Mexicano.\n\nThey were unaware that they were not alone. Throughout the course of the evening, their every movement was being watched: Outside Hicks's apartment, at Gidley's home, outside the restaurant, walking into the lobby of her apartment building. Each moment was documented in photos and video, even through the window in the back of the cab home. Hicks was being tailed by a group called Probe-Media, \"an elite agency\" that \"deals in exclusive material and provides images and video footage and reconnaissance in a service uniquely tailored to meet our clients' needs,\" according to the company's sparse website.\n\nProbe-Media offers what it refers to as \"a bespoke service\" to \"international news outlets, intelligence agencies and corporate and individual clients.\" Perhaps by design, basic information about Probe-Media is difficult to locate. The o in its logo is a lens, and above the company's name is an outline of a skyline in which the Statue of Liberty sprouts from the middle of a block of suburban houses and urban buildings. When I reached out through a form on the website, I received a response sent from an iPhone. \"Yes it was us that got the pictures and yes they did lead to further events but the process how the shots were taken cannot be discussed as that's why we get commissioned for our deep surveillance approach and discretion,\" read another response. \"Thank you for reaching out though, Kind regards, The team at Probe-media.\"\n\nFive days after the dinner, on February 1, grainy images of Hicks and Porter taken by Probe-Media were published by the Daily Mail, a tabloid based in the U.K. At first, the story seemed unimportant, even if it was a sign of the times to see it show up in the Mail. Trump was a creation of the Daily News and the New York Post, but not since the Lewinsky scandal had there been so much tabloid interest in Washington, where the Mail now has a robust presence, including a respected investigative reporter, a White House correspondent, and a string of freelance photographers who, since the inauguration, have staked out the Kalorama home of Jared and Ivanka for a near-daily report on Ivanka's outfits.\n\nThe Daily Mail story outing Hicks and Porter as a couple was written by a New York -- based reporter named Martin Gould, a tabloid veteran who in 1997 was charged with driving Victoria Gifford Kennedy, the estranged wife of Michael Kennedy, off the road in pursuit of a photo after she'd left her husband over his affair with their babysitter. Gould had worked for Star magazine and at Newsmax, an outlet owned by Christopher Ruddy, a confidant of the president's.\n\nThe story called Hicks and Porter a \"red-hot couple,\" quoting an \"eyewitness\": \"As soon as the taxi took off they both moved from their sides of the cab to the middle. Rob was kissing Hope's neck all the way home.\"\n\n\"I think covering the love life of two single people in any administration is just ridiculous,\" Gidley told me. \"People are literally staked outside of her house. People literally follow her around town. People literally stare at her whenever she's out. That's enough to make, you know ...\" he paused. \"Britney Spears shaved her head and hit a car with an umbrella, right?\"\n\nRob Porter was a Harvard-educated Mormon with good manners and what seemed like a gentle nature, but at only 40 years old, he'd already been married and divorced twice. He'd also been entangled in an on-and-off relationship with another administration official, and within their D.C. social circle -- which as of Inauguration Day included some of the most powerful people in the country -- their private woes were well known. The fact that Porter was dating Hicks entered the capital's gossip stream at the same time, too.\n\nIn late November, the official read private messages Porter had exchanged with Hicks, where the nature of their relationship was revealed plainly. She informed Porter's colleague, White House counsel Don McGahn, whom she knew. She also told McGahn that Porter had issues relating to violence in his two marriages.\n\nThe White House didn't need the tip. Although the public wouldn't know it for over a year, the FBI began interviewing Porter's former wives beginning in January 2017, as part of a background check for his security clearance. Colbie Holderness, his first wife, would later tell The Intercept that, days before she met with the FBI, a friend of Porter's approached her current husband to tell him that she was \"not obligated\" to tell them anything, but Holderness disclosed to the FBI that during their marriage, Porter abused her physically and emotionally. Jennifer Willoughby, his second wife, did the same. The FBI informed the White House, and deep into the first year of the new presidency, Porter hadn't been granted a high-level security clearance, which was a hindrance; as staff secretary, documents intended for the president flowed through him, and yet on at least one occasion, Porter's request for documents was denied. The White House would go on to claim ignorance and to claim that Porter's background check was ongoing. But in January, according to FBI testimony, the White House was handed the bureau's final review on the matter. Porter maintained only an interim clearance.\n\nIn April, Willoughby posted a blog on her personal website that mentioned physical abuse she'd suffered in a past relationship. Porter wasn't identified by name, but it worried him that it was out there at all. When he repeatedly asked her to take it down, she refused; she didn't see how anyone would ever care enough to dig it up, and even if they did, she'd managed to forgive him.\n\nIn late January, Porter called Willoughby, frantic and paranoid, and asked her a final time to remove the post. \"He did not name names, but he implied that there was a former staffer from the White House who was unhappy with him and was out to get him and take him down and somehow had gotten wind of my blog post,\" she said. \"He's demanding that I take it down and telling me that this former staffer is going to send it to the media.\" Willoughby assumed that Porter was talking about Bannon, because he had specifically mentioned \"how 'he' was angry Rob had blocked him in getting his ideas, or 'racist agenda,' pushed through,\" she said. But later, she came to believe Porter was talking about Lewandowski, even though Lewandowski had never formally worked in the White House.\n\nAs it happened, Lewandowski lived in a townhouse he shared with a former Trump-campaign operative who worked at the same government agency as the official Porter dated. (If this thread is starting to feel tangled -- it is.) The townhouse belonged to Citizens United, the conservative group run by veteran right-wing agitator David Bossie, though Politico had christened it \"The Lewandowski Embassy.\" Lewandowski occupied the top floor while his roommate dwelled in the basement apartment. In between were the offices of Turnberry Solutions, a lobbying group founded by former staff from Lewandowski's old lobbying group. (Lewandowski, who hasn't registered as a lobbyist in several years, claims to have no involvement with Turnberry Solutions.) Lions, light-pink roses, and a phrase from Isaiah 35, repeated three times, decorate the corridor leading past the entrance: THE WILDERNESS SHALL BLOSSOM AS THE ROSE.\n\nOn February 5, four days after the Daily Mail disclosed the \"red-hot\" relationship between Hicks and Porter, two reporters contacted Willoughby after receiving tips about her blog. Willoughby told Porter about the calls, she said, and agreed to negotiate a joint statement. But there were two phrases Porter pushed for that Willoughby told me she couldn't stomach: \"didn't accurately depict my marriage,\" and \"it was a therapeutic post in which I took many liberties.\" Willoughby had already talked to the Mail, and she and Porter stopped negotiating; they never put out a joint statement.\n\nThe following day, the Mail published interviews with Porter's former wives, in which they claimed they'd been physically, verbally, and emotionally abused (Porter responded to the story by saying, \"Many of these allegations are slanderous and simply false\"), and that they'd informed the FBI -- to apparently little effect.\n\nThe report prompted Hicks and Porter to break up, but the feeling around Washington was that the saga was the product of some political spycraft. \"This had been planned and choreographed and coordinated and known long in advance by a group of people who were trying to play political games,\" a source with direct knowledge of the events said, \"knowing that this would be part of a larger story related to security clearances and John Kelly and others, seeking to sow chaos and dissension. They saw this as a useful catalyst, which it turned out to be.\"\n\nFor as long as he'd been in politics, Lewandowski had been defined by two qualities: his ruthless pursuit of an enemy's destruction and always having an enemy. This was true even when it was small ball; in New Hampshire, he once fucked over a local official by claiming that his fantasy-football league, with a grand prize of $200, was an illegal gambling ring. By the time Lewandowski was done, the official had lost his job and was the subject of a criminal probe.\n\nThere were plenty of reasons for Lewandowski to consider Porter his enemy. Whatever was or wasn't true about his relationship with Hicks, Lewandowski's unusual preoccupation with her was well established. \"He has, sort of, Single White Male characteristics,\" a source who had worked with Hicks before the campaign told me. In the fall, he began asking around, trying to figure out whom she was dating. \"I think that he thinks he should control her,\" a second source said. \"He got wind that she was dating Porter, and he could not handle that,\" a third source, who is close to the White House and worked with Lewandowski, said. \"There were still raw feelings.\"\n\nComplementary to Lewandowski's hatred of Porter was his rivalry with John Kelly. To establish order in the West Wing, Kelly had made the president less accessible to outsiders and outside information less accessible to him. A source close to the White House said that, soon after Bannon was fired in August, he became high on the idea of seeing Kelly replaced with a combination of Lewandowski and Bossie, who had co-authored a book called Let Trump Be Trump. They would be the ideal gatekeepers for people who would otherwise need to jump the gate.\n\nDuring the campaign, Charles \"Chuck\" Johnson, an early supporter of Ted Cruz, said Lewandowski tried to hire him to do opposition research. Johnson said he declined the offer but that he and Lewandowski remained friends. Periodically, Johnson would use his website GotNews to prop Lewandowski up, once announcing, when there were murmurs he might work in the White House, \"HE'S BACK!\"\n\nJohnson liked to call himself a journalist and \"debunker of frauds,\" but he was known primarily as a pervasive far-right menace, an oddity with few personal boundaries who'd once raised $150,000 for a neo-Nazi's legal defense fund. In 2012, he had promoted unfounded accusations involving underage prostitutes and Bob Menendez, the Democratic senator from New Jersey, on the conservative website the Daily Caller. At the time, the publication's executive editor overseeing the Menendez coverage was David Martosko. Today, Martosko is the political editor of the Daily Mail. About the Daily Mail's Porter scoop, \"I don't know what I'm allowed to say,\" Johnson told me. \"Probe-Media, from my understanding, is going to be doing a lot more work with private eyes.\"\n\nJohnson was always taking credit for things he didn't seem to have any connection to. He was usually wrong, but he did seem to know things, sometimes, that turned out to be true, and, sometimes, he seemed to know them before anyone else. He also seemed to benefit from the fact that the new administration was populated by people who hadn't been following politics very closely in recent years. He claimed he knew about Porter months in advance of the stories, and that some mysterious \"we\" was pleased with how things unfurled, even if he was surprised it took so long. Johnson said Lewandowski had nothing to do with the stories and that he wasn't among the people he'd told about Porter. (Reached repeatedly for comment, Lewandowski did not answer questions.)\n\nPolitical genius wasn't required to predict that the White House would respond to the Porter news by somehow making it even worse news. The story about Porter and Hicks became the story about Porter and the women who said he abused them. That became a story about the White House covering up Porter's secrets, which became a story about Hicks and Kelly, which became a story about Hicks and Trump, which became a story about security clearance and Jared and Ivanka, which became a story about Kelly again. Eventually, it was just a story about who populates our anarchic new government and whether or not we can trust them.\n\nIn the past month, since Hicks's resignation, the administration has entered into a new level of disorder, with the departures of Gary Cohn, the president's top economic adviser, and the secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, who was fired in a tweet. For emphasis, Trump also fired one of Tillerson's aides. Next, he fired John McEntee, a longtime personal aide whose security clearance had been revoked (though he was immediately hired by the Trump 2020 campaign). Kelly, national-security adviser H. R. McMaster, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have all been rumored to be next. There are many possible explanations for this new chaos -- pressure from the Mueller investigation, burnout from a very messy year, the president's frustrations with the \"adults in the room\" and his eagerness to replace them with people he knows are his people. But the drama surrounding Hicks, for several years now Trump's most trusted confidante, was inarguably a trigger, too.\n\nThe first story about the Porter allegations contained statements from the White House defending his character. Kelly's read, \"Rob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor, and I can't say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidant and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him.\" It was reported that his words had, in fact, been written by Hicks, and, relatedly, that her involvement was seen internally as a problem: The president was frustrated with her, according to unnamed sources, and her judgment was called into question. But five senior White House officials told me that Kelly dictated the statement himself. \"She did not take part in drafting it,\" Kellyanne Conway told me. \"That's correct,\" Sanders agreed. Yet Kelly allowed Hicks to be blamed and didn't make an effort to correct the reporting.\n\nFor months, sources had been murmuring about Kelly's preference for the woman who replaced Hicks as director of strategic communications, Mercedes Schlapp. \"Mercy\" is one half of a Catholic ­conservative power couple -- her husband, Matt Schlapp, is the chairman of the group that hosts the Conservative Political Action Conference -- and before she joined the White House, she was a Fox News commentator. \"Mercedes has been waging just an incredible war,\" the former official said.\n\nA second former senior White House official elaborated: \"The battle between Mercedes and Hope was ugly as hell. I mean, Mercedes was fucking cutting her up.\" The second official was sure that Kelly would install Mercy in Hope's place -- assuming he doesn't resign or get fired himself, an important caveat for all White House speculation. \"Kelly wanted Hope to move out of the anteroom to the Oval Office and into the communications office,\" the first former official said. \"He did not like that she had that level of access and influence.\"\n\nThere was some irony there. Getting Kelly into the West Wing had required a veritable hostage situation dreamed up by Jared and Ivanka, who hired the Mooch as a means of pushing out Reince Priebus, which worked more efficiently than they'd anticipated: Mooch was fired about a week later, and there was a bonus resignation from Sean Spicer, whom they also disliked. By the time the country was becoming fluent in the Mooch's delightfully goonish parlance, he'd already served his purpose. When he was fired, Hicks was promoted to communications director.\n\nBut just as Kelly didn't understand Jared and Ivanka, he also didn't understand Hicks, and he sometimes blamed her for habits Trump had been forming for 71 years. \"He was extraordinarily dismissive of her. He would refer to her as 'the high-schooler,' he would joke about how she was inexperienced, she was in over her head, she was immature,\" a former senior White House official told me. \"He doesn't like a woman that potentially has some position of power over him. He thinks women should be subservient to him. If you look at his relationship with Ivanka or Hope -- women who aren't subservient to him -- he has problems with those people.\"\n\nIn conversations with me, Mercy didn't have a critical word to say about Hicks. She called herself \"mother hen\" and said it upset her to hear what people were saying about their relationship. \"I love that girl and I want her -- we really are there for each other.\" However, when I asked Mercy about Kelly's statement, and whether she believed what five of her colleagues had confirmed to me was true, she wouldn't engage. \"I was not involved at all in that process. I was working on the job I was doing, which is my calendar. So I'm not going to comment on it.\"\n\nAt that point, to Mercy's relief, Gidley entered the room and the conversation turned to how the staff could be described as characters. If it were Saved by the Bell, they immediately agreed, Hicks would be Kelly Kapowski, \"the beautiful one,\" Mercy said. \"I'm Screech,\" Gidley added.\n\nIt was the middle of March, and though it had been only 16 days since Hope Hicks had resigned, she was no longer the most recent official to leave the Trump administration -- not even close. Still, interest in Hicks was undying. The Daily Mail was stationed almost permanently in front of her apartment building, usually with just one photographer, but sometimes with more. Today, it was Matthew Paul D'Agostino, a freelance photojournalist, idle beside his gekko-green Honda Element, wearing two cameras draped over his chest. On Valentine's Day, they'd sent several. \"She's gonna make it after all! Hope Hicks is all smiles as she glides out of her DC apartment in white high heels, a low-cut sundress and bare legs (with a self-tanner fail on her feet),\" read the headline. Hicks was holding bags from Whole Foods. Inside were the sugar cookies she'd baked and decorated with her mother, Raffel, and Gidley to give out to the communications staff. Each cookie package included a note she'd written in silver marker. \"Believe in love,\" read one message. Underneath, she'd drawn a small heart.\n\n\"I think the Daily Mail is reflecting the fact that Hope Hicks is a fascinating person -- and she is,\" Piers Morgan told me. Morgan writes a column for the Daily Mail, and he's also a British TV personality, which is how he came to know Trump, having competed against Omarosa on Celebrity Apprentice. \"Hope is becoming ever more famous,\" Morgan said, explaining that he didn't see how Hicks could ever slink back from here to relative anonymity. He added that he found her personally appealing because she always acted in good faith, an impression Morgan shared with many members of the press during the campaign and in the White House. \"I've never known her to deliberately mislead me or lie to me or be anything but completely honest. Which, again, is not a particularly common character trait in Washington.\"\n\nIn terms of ambience, Washington is unlikely to feel much different without Hicks around; she wasn't exactly Sally Quinn, hosting salons or hitting the embassy party circuit, and the Daily Mail still has Ivanka. But for the president, who gets out even less -- he eats dinner at home, except for rare meals at the restaurant in the hotel bearing his name a few blocks away -- Hicks's decision seems like an amputation.\n\nHicks identified May 1 as the latest she was willing to stay in the White House, though April 1 was her preferred time frame -- possibly even before then. She planned to return home to Greenwich, where she went most weekends anyway, and then move back to Manhattan. Even though more than half the country believed she'd spent three years working for a dishonorable cause, she hadn't become famous for being publicly dishonorable herself, like so many of the more visible figures around her. When Saturday Night Live tried to parody her, it fell flat because you can't parody a person most people have no concept of. \"Many things explain her longevity, all of which are positive in my view,\" Conway said. \"She may not go on TV or take the podium, but she is asked directly and regularly by the president of the United States, 'Hope, what do you think about this?' That's a much more important, much more immediate and consequential audience, I would argue, for the actual policies.\" But not appearing on TV or giving interviews did protect Hicks, Conway said. \"I do consider that a luxury, at the same time. It is a luxury.\" One of the only cases of Hicks speaking on the record was in an interview for the Forbes \"30 Under 30\" list, in which she said her favorite song was \"Friends in Low Places\" and her favorite emoji the \"see-no-evil\" monkey. Asked when she decided what she wanted to do with her life, she said, \"Still deciding!\"\n\nAfter the White House, the scope of options for Hick's future looked, in ways, almost limitless. But she didn't yet seem to have a firm sense of what she wanted to do next. When she spoke to the president about her plans to leave, she didn't say specifically when that would be -- and Trump didn't ask. In some ways, it seemed like he was not yet ready to think about what it would mean for her to be gone. During a conversation about an event taking place weeks and weeks in the future, he told her not to worry about providing him with her thoughts immediately; she'd still be in the White House when he needed them.\n\n\"She is the one person he thinks is totally on his side. And I happen to think that he's right,\" the source who meets regularly with the president told me. \"Trump's main problem with other people is he sees them as competition, and he doesn't see Hope that way, because she's not.\" The source went on, \"This is why he's fired all these people. This is why he hated Bannon, the problem with Scaramucci. They were seeking to eclipse him and he can't handle that.\"\n\nTrump also had a different relationship with Hicks than he did with his children, who keep what the source called \"ironic distance\" from their father. \"He knows that Ivanka has a separate agenda. Ivanka refers to him as 'DJT' just like the boys do, and Ivanka understands that her father is gonna be dead in ten years.\"\n\nFor her part, Hicks was a reminder of another time, before Trump came under Secret Service protection, when he would ride shotgun to direct a one-car motorcade through McDonald's drive-throughs or walk up to crowds and hand out dollar bills. The source added, \"Hope's never gonna write the memoir. She has no political aspirations. She doesn't particularly like politics. She's loyal to Mr. Trump.\"\n\n*This article appears in the March 19, 2018, issue of New York Magazine. Subscribe Now!",

(He was barred by the state from running.)\n\nPutin had hoped to solidify up his legitimacy with a surge in voter turnout, and all signs point to a highly enthusiastic electorate:\n\nHe may also have been helped out by constant praise on state television and a political apparatus that routinely squelches dissent, but let's not split hairs.\n\nPutin has led Russia, alternately as Prime Minister and President, since 2000. By the time he's done with his next term in 2024, he will have been in power longer than any Russian leader since Josef Stalin, whose party was also enormously successful at the polls.\n\nBetter luck next time, other candidates!",

                "title": "Kushner's Company Regularly Filed False Work Permits in NYC",
                "body": "The Kushner Companies, the family business that Jared Kushner ran before joining his father-in-law in the White House, regularly filed false paperwork with New York City regulators, according to the Associated Press. The more than 80 work permits, which were filed in relation to 34 buildings in New York from 2013 to 2016, declared that the company had no rent-regulated tenants in the buildings, when in fact they had hundreds. The practice allegedly allowed Kushner Companies to quickly gentrify buildings even if they contained rent-regulated apartments -- an often cumbersome problem for developers. None of the documents have Kushner's signature on them, but were instead signed by Kushner Companies's chief operating officer or another employee.\n\nIf the forms had been filled out correctly, the company's construction crews could have been subject to stricter oversight by the city, particularly to make sure that the company wasn't harassing rent-regulated tenants in a effort to get them to move out. Tenants of some of the buildings told the AP that they did feel harassed by the construction. One rent-regulated tenant said she was offered at least $10,000 to leave her East Village building amid construction that sometimes went on in the middle of the night. The man who offered her the money told her that, \"I know it's pretty horrible, but we can help you get out.\" She sued the company -- and won -- instead. Another tenant claimed that Kushner Companies illegally tried to increase his rent by 60 percent and ultimately succeeded in clearing out all the other tenants in his building.\n\nThe Housing Rights Initiative, a New York tenants-rights organization which uses \"a data driven and systematic approach to investigating real estate fraud and connecting tenants to legal support,\" discovered the relevant documents, which were then compared against tax records to reveal the discrepancies. The organization's founder, Aaron Carr, told the AP that Kushner Companies was guilty of \"bare-faced greed\" in pursuit of quick returns on its investments. New York City Council member Ritchie Torres now plans to investigate the false documents, and has accused the company of weaponizing construction against tenants. The city also says that two of the buildings in question are already under investigation for tenant harassment.\n\nBut most New York City landlords who are found to have submitted false paperwork -- a misdemeanor crime that can result in an up to $25,000 fine -- get away with it if they amend their forms when eventually confronted. Kushner Companies apparently did that with the false documents it submitted, a year or two later.\n\nAccording to Kushner Companies, the false work permits were outsourced to third parties, and the company \"would never deny any tenant their due-process rights.\" The company claims that \"corrective action is taken immediately\" if mistakes or violations in their paperwork are ever found, and that it has received minimal complaints across the thousands of apartments it has renovated.\n\nThe AP reviewed complaints against the company in New York and found frequent reports of off-hour, illegal, and improper construction, including work done without a permit at all.\n\nKushner Companies is also being investigated by the SEC and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn over its use of EB-5 visas to court foreign investors for its real estate developments.",

Papadopoulos divulged this information to an Australian diplomat at a London bar in May 2016, in a conversation that set in motion the FBI investigation into Russian electoral interference.\n\nThroughout the spring of 2016, Papadopoulos continued to reach out to Russian sources to try to arrange a meeting between Trump and Russian officials, but was shot down by the campaign.\n\nIn October, he pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government. He has been cooperating with Mueller since his arrest in July.\n\nSessions has been slippery -- to put it generously -- about Russia before. During his confirmation hearings last year, he said that he was not aware of any meetings between Trump campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government, neglecting to mention two meetings he had Sergei Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sessions claimed that he had met with Kislyak in his capacity as a U.S. Senator, not as a Trump surrogate. He later claimed that the meetings in question did not involve campaign-related issues -- a version of events contradicted by Kislyak himself.\n\nSessions's duplicitousness led to his fateful recusal from the Russia investigation, paving the way for Mueller's appointment.\n\nBut remember, when it comes to firing political enemies of President Trump, the attorney general is deeply concerned about honesty.",

                "title": "Republicans Barely React as Trump Goes After Mueller",
                "body": "On Sunday, Republican lawmakers began offering their responses to President Trump's escalating rhetoric against special counsel Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation, but most still seemed willfully careless regarding the threat. In the morning, Trump went after Mueller personally for the first time, an important milestone in his efforts to discredit the investigation. That followed a new comment from Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, calling for Mueller to be dismissed, and the controversial firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe -- a move which Trump has been heavily celebrating. Taken together, the president may finally laying the groundwork for firing Mueller and ending the investigation into Russia's 2016 election meddling. The assorted reactions of several GOP lawmakers are collected below.\n\nOne of the Republican Party's few consistent Trump critics, Senator Jeff Flake, said during an appearance on CNN's State of the Union that he was expecting his fellow lawmakers to push back on Trump's attacks on Mueller. \"Talking to my colleagues all along it was, you know, once he goes after Mueller, then we'll take action,\" Flake claimed, though it seemed more like an optimistic expectation than a sober prediction:\n\nI don't know what the designs are on Mueller, but it seems to be building toward that. And I just hope it doesn't go there, because it can't. We can't, in Congress, accept that. And so I would expect to see considerable pushback in the next couple days in urging the president not to go there. He can't go there.\n\nRegarding McCabe, Flake said that Congress would have to look at the inspector general report which supposedly prompted his firing, but he had his suspicions. \"I'm just puzzled by why the White House is going so hard at this,\" speculating that they might be \"very afraid of what might come out.\"\n\nHe added that he hoped House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would come to Mueller's defense as well.\n\nSpeaker Ryan eventually did release a statement on Sunday, repeating his standard position that \"Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.\"\n\nAlso on State of the Union, another repeat defender of Mueller, Senator Lindsey Graham, repeated his prediction that if Trump fired the special prosecutor, it \"would be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\" Graham said that \"we're a rule of law nation,\" and pledged to do whatever he could to make sure Mueller could finish his investigation unmolested, explaining that \"the only reason that Mr. Mueller could be dismissed is for cause,\" and he sees none.\n\nGraham additionally called for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on the firing of McCabe:\n\nI think we owe it to the average American to have a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, for Mr. Sessions, Attorney General Sessions, comes forward with whatever documentation he has about the firing and give Mr. McCabe a chance to defend himself. I believe when it comes to this issue, we need as much transparency as possible, to make sure that it was not politically motivated.\n\nRepublican congressman Trey Gowdy was on Fox News Sunday to defend the recent conclusion of the GOP-controlled House Intelligence Committee that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign -- news that Trump has already been leveraging to try to discredit Mueller's investigation. Gowdy told host Chris Wallace that he hoped that Trump was not getting ready to fire Mueller, and said that President Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, did the president a \"disservice\" by suggesting the Mueller investigation should should now be ended.\n\n\"If you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it,\" he added, later giving the same advice to Trump, explaining that \"if you've done nothing wrong, you should want the investigation to be as fulsome and thorough as possible.\"\n\nRegarding what the consequences Trump would face from Republicans if he did fire Mueller, Gowdy said he wasn't sure \"the House could do a lot,\" but that the president should understand that if he did take out Mueller, it would be a \"very very long, bad 2018.\" In other words, Gowdy didn't say what the GOP would do, if anything, in response to Trump firing Mueller.\n\nFurthermore, Gowdy acknowledged that the House Intelligence Committee's investigation of Russia's election meddling should not be the last word on the issue -- the Mueller investigation's conclusion should be.\n\n\"Executive Branch investigations have more credibility, they have more tools and that's what I think my fellow citizens ought to be waiting for and have confidence in,\" Gowdy said, explaining that if Mueller \"finds stuff, more power to him.\" Representative Michael Conaway, who led the House Intelligence Committee Russia investigation, also seemed to downplay their no-collusion conclusion during his appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday. Like Gowdy, he acknowledged that they didn't get to interview all the key witnesses, and repeatedly emphasized that they had found no evidence of collusion, which didn't necessarily mean there hadn't been any.\n\nOn CNN's State of the Union, Senator Rand Paul seemed to indicate that he wouldn't be too upset if Mueller got fired. \"I wouldn't advocate it,\" Paul told host Jake Tapper, but explained that he would have never advocated for Mueller's appointment in the first place, since special prosecutors' \"have too much power to do whatever they want.\"\n\n\"When they're looking at people's tax returns from 20 years ago, I really think that the power is so unlimited that it's worrisome for the people on the receiving end,\" he explained, and called for broad reforms that would prevent any federal law enforcement official from launching an investigation without first getting approval from a judge.\n\nSenator James Lankford, a GOP member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, didn't seem to take the threat of Mueller being fired seriously during an appearance on ABC's This Week. He characterized Dowd's comment as typical lawyer rhetoric, and said that he believed the White House's position that Trump does not want to fire Mueller, and so GOP lawmakers shouldn't need to worry about how to deal with that. (Chris Christie made an almost identical point later on the program, as well.)\n\nLankford called Mueller's efforts very helpful thus far, but he also echoed Trump's early morning tweetstorm in saying that he thought it was \"odd the number of Democrats that he's put on board his team,\" and that it raises \"some red flags in some sense.\" But either way, \"it's best for the special counsel to be able to go through their process, it's best for the president, best for the presidency, for this to be resolved and to be finished one way or the other.\"\n\nAnd Senator Marco Rubio was Sunday's lone Republican voice objecting to McCabe's firing, or at least how it was carried out. He said on Meet the Press that he didn't agree with the decision to fire McCabe two days before his retirement and pension took effect. \"I don't like the way it happened,\" Rubio said, adding that McCabe should have been allowed to finish the weekend, and that regarding Trump's repeated attacks on McCabe, \"We need to be very careful about taking these very important entities and smearing everybody in them with a broad stroke.\"\n\nOn Mueller's investigation, Rubio said that he supports \"going wherever the evidence and wherever the facts take us.\" He's not the only Republican still looking to wait and see.",

                "body": "President Trump is no longer shy about about condemning Special Counsel Robert Mueller by name.\n\nOn Saturday night and Sunday morning, he sent two apoplectic tweets, slamming Mueller and his investigation, and labeling his team as \"hardened Democrats,\" before being spirited away to a golf course by aides.\n\nWhile it's true that some investigators working for Mueller have donated to Democrats, Mueller himself is a Republican, as are former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, both of whom the president also went after on Sunday:\n\nThroughout most of Saturday, Trump had reserved his ire for McCabe, who was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions Friday night, much to the president's glee.\n\nBut in the evening, Trump invoked Mueller by name on Twitter for the first time. This is one arena in which he has historically shown a modicum of restraint; Trump's lawyers have likely counseled him not to attack the special counsel personally for fear of harming his standing in the investigation.\n\nOn Saturday, though, Trump's personal lawyer John Dowd told the Daily Beast that Mueller should end his investigation, and claimed he was speaking for the president before backtracking (rather unconvincingly) on that assertion.\n\nThe New York Times revealed one possible reason for Trump's especially intense wrath of late: the special counsel's office had sent over a list of questions to the White House to set up a possible interview with the president. Last week, Mueller subpoenaed documents relating to the Trump Foundation, crossing a \"red line\" the president had set dictating that Mueller not delve into Trump and his family's personal finances.\n\nThe investigation, in other words, appears to be drawing ever closer to the president and he's responding the only way he knows how: by preparing to take out his enemy, no matter the consequences.\n\nThankfully for Trump, the Republican response to this increasingly likely scenario has consisted mostly of silence.",

                "body": "In a tweet on Saturday morning, President Trump both celebrated the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe and added another attack on fired former FBI director James Comey. Alluding to McCabe's alleged transgressions at the agency, Trump added that \"Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy,\" before claiming that Comey \"knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\" (Trump then reiterated his attack as part of another tweet on Saturday afternoon.)\n\nNot long after Trump's first tweet, Comey responded, suggesting that Americans will soon be able to judge \"who is honorable and who is not\":\n\nComey is undoubtedly referring to the release of his highly anticipated memoir, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, which will hit the shelves on April 17. The book is already a best seller on Amazon, but save Comey's tease, nobody knows what new information he will reveal about his experiences dealing with Trump in the book. It will, however, undoubtedly present Comey's account of the brief and volatile period he served as FBI director under Trump, and Axios reports that Comey intends to correct the record and challenge the lies and misstatements he has been hearing about the FBI.\n\nLast month, Comey also tweeted a picture of him recording the audio version of his book, making a joke about his previous hope that Trump had recorded their interactions, implying that any such recording would support his version of events rather than Trump's.\n\nMeanwhile, Politico reports that Comey's publisher, Flatiron Books, is going to Harry Potter-like lengths to ensure the book's revelations don't leak out. Flatiron has heavily restricted access to Comey's manuscript throughout the editing process, allowing only password-protected digital access to relevant staff members and storing the book under a code name. Flatiron has also made the warehouse workers who will handle the physical books sign nondisclosure agreements, and orders of the book will be shipped to stores closer to the publication date than usual.\n\nThe book was originally supposed to come out in May, but Comey's publisher says they moved up the publication date because of the unprecedented recent attention on the FBI, though some critics have speculated that Comey and Flatiron are also both wary of an inspector general report, due out this spring, which will likely criticize Comey's controversial handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.\n\nUp until now, outside of his testimony before Congress, Comey has mostly kept quiet about what happened to him last year, but not for much longer. On April 15, Comey will be interviewed by George Stephanopoulos for a 20/20 special on ABC, then make appearances on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The View over the next few days. His book tour is currently scheduled to take him to at least ten cities through the end of May.",

Trump has maintained, without evidence, that her party affiliation and association with Hillary Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe colored her husband's behavior at the FBI.\n\n\"In May, when Director Comey was fired and I had my own interactions with the President, he brought up my wife every time I ever spoke to him,\" McCabe told CNN. \"Of course, I disagreed with him.\"\n\nMcCabe claims that Trump also asked him who he had voted for in the 2016 election, a detail that had previously been reported.\n\nThe memos are reportedly similar to the ones former FBI Director James Comey kept about his interactions with Trump. In those notes, Comey wrote that Trump had requested that he drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and had asked for a loyalty pledge.\n\nMcCabe's memos reportedly include conversations he had with Comey about those incidents, evidence that could lend credence to a possible obstruction of justice charge against the president.\n\nMcCabe claims that his firing is the result of a political grudge held by President Trump. In a statement, he said that he was \"singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.\"\n\nSessions claims that the firing was the result of McCabe leaking to the media and misleading bureau investigators about the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\n\nIn multiple tweets on Saturday, Trump celebrated McCabe's firing.\n\nComey, who groomed McCabe for a high-ranking position the FBI, also weighed in as well:",

                "title": "Trump Is Taking Out His Enemies And Turning Toward Mueller",
                "body": "A history professor of mine once attempted to explain to our class why Adolf Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, when the virtual impossibility of a land invasion of a country as vast as Russia was already well known in 1941. The answer, he concluded, was that Hitler was put on earth to invade Russia. His loathing of Bolshevism, his twisted Darwinian mania for the acquisition of land and resources, and his fixation with his own military genius all led him to a decision that was both inevitable and impossible.\n\nThis is a good way to think about President Trump's approach toward the Robert Mueller investigation. Trump is not a Nazi or a fascist, and I am not drawing any moral parallel between the two. The similarity, rather, lies in the way an apparently irrational decision can be made logical and necessary by a certain kind of twisted internal logic that can escape outsiders. I have long believed Trump is headed toward a confrontation with Mueller, and those who doubt he will finally take the plunge are making the mistake of judging Trump by the standards of a normal president and not his own demonstrated pathologies. The sacking of FBI staffer Andrew McCabe for alleged unauthorized leaking to the news media, and comments by Trump's lawyer John Dowd calling for the firing or Robert Mueller add to an ominous drumbeat.\n\nWhat are the forces and vectors pushing in this direction? Trump of course has been raging against the Department of Justice and the FBI since the campaign itself, when he demanded his opponent be locked up. He fired the FBI director for failing to demonstrate sufficient loyalty, he has repeatedly lashed the attorney general for his obviously necessary recusal from an investigation into the campaign he was part of, and he has repeatedly demanded that the same attorney general investigate his opponents.\n\nSince the firing of James Comey, the staff around Trump have managed to placate, delay, or contain some of these impulses. But nearly every reporter following the White House now agrees that Trump is moving into a new phase of his presidency. He is aware that he has surrounded himself with people who consider him a moron or are trying to save the country from his madness, and he is relentlessly casting them off.\n\nTrump may not be systematically breaking through the protective ring that has surrounded him, because he is barely capable of doing anything in a systematic fashion. But in fits and starts he is lurching in the same basic direction. He is doing the things his aides told him he could not do, or refused to carry out. Imposing tariffs was a major step in asserting his autonomy. Firing Rex Tillerson in humiliating fashion was another. The case that he would leave Mueller alone relied on the assumption that Trump would stay contained forever. That assumption is crumbling.\n\nIt is also notable that Trump's recent behavior displays a reckless disregard for even his own self-preservation. In his legal battle with Stormy Daniels, Trump is opening himself to legal discovery that may expose campaign finance violations or other misdeeds. He not only demanded the firing of McCabe, he proceeded to taunt his victim.\n\nThe legal merits of the case for firing McCabe are not fully known to the public. It is possible McCabe stepped out of line when briefing reporters on a story that made the Clinton campaign look bad. The publicly-known factual contours of the episode make this seem highly unlikely. Almost certainly, Sessions fired McCabe because Trump hated McCabe and wanted to punish him and to discredit one of Comey's corroborating witnesses. Trump's endzone dance will help McCabe make that case, which he can press in a wrongful termination lawsuit, and which will also open up for discovery more of Trump's interactions with Sessions.\n\nTrump is exposing himself to legal danger for the fleeting satisfaction of a tweet. Can there be any doubt he would take the risk of firing a Mueller?\n\nIt is notable as well that Trump has successfully lined up most of his party apparatus behind him for any confrontation. The House Republicans closed their Russia \"investigation,\" which was obviously intended all along to provide a pretext for declaring Trump innocent. Conservative media has been hammering the message for months that Trump has done nothing wrong, and that all the criminal misbehavior exists on the side of the investigators.\n\nAll this effort has been expended either in support, or in studiously ignoring the existence, of Trump's deep-rooted contempt for the rule of law. Whether or not McCabe filled out all the necessary memos when talking to a reporter, how fully the FBI disclosed its source material for its FISA warrant to surveil Carter Page, or any other legal claims upon which Trump's defenders have rested their case, are beside the point. Trump believes law enforcement should operate for his benefit, punishing his enemies and protecting his friends. He admires strongmen. His contempt for democratic norms is characterological. The notion that his own government would investigate him is as unfathomable to Trump as his being called to the carpet by a Trump Organization secretary. Trump is going to go after Mueller at some point because there is no other way for Trump's febrile mind to make sense of the world.",

                "body": "John Dowd, President Trump's personal lawyer, told The Daily Beast on Saturday that he thinks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But while he initially claimed that he was speaking on behalf of President Trump, he quickly walked back that assertion.\n\nIn an email commenting on Jeff Sessions's firing of Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Friday night, Dowd said that Rosenstein should follow suit in his own department.\n\n\"I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,\" Dowd wrote.\n\nThe 77-year-old lawyer, who has been advising Trump since June and apparently has a flair for the dramatic, also included the following annotated paragraph from the Tennessee Williams play \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" in an effort to prove his point about the Russia investigation:\n\n\"What's that smell in this room[Bureau}? Didn't you notice it, Brick [Jim]? Didn't you notice a powerful and obnoxious odor of mendacity in this room[Bureau}?... There ain't nothin' more powerful than the odor of mendacity[corruption]... You can smell it. It smells like death.\"\n\nResponding to a Daily Beast question, Dowd initially said that he was speaking for Trump \"as his counsel.\" But he then emailed the outlet back to clarify that he was opining in a personal capacity.\n\nThis week, the New York Times reported that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump organization, demanding documents related to Russia. Trump had previously warned that any investigation into his family's finances would cross a \"red line,\" and he was reportedly furious about Mueller's maneuver. With the Russia investigation showing no signs of slowing down, Trump may revive his aborted effort to fire the special counsel.\n\nBut Rosenstein, who has overseen the Russia probe since Jeff Sessions recused himself last year, does not appear inclined to follow Dowd's advice. In December, he told Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee that he saw no cause to fire Mueller, and that \"the special counsel's investigation is not a witch hunt.\" And just five days ago, he redoubled his support for Mueller in an interview with USA Today.\n\nBut if Rosenstein doesn't give in to political pressure, there's always the possibility of simply replacing him with a Trump toady who would gladly dispatch the special counsel -- a path the president has already considered. Sessions, Rosenstein's boss, may be in danger of losing his job, too, one reason he may have chosen to fire McCabe.\n\nGiven all the instability in the White House and surrounding the Russia investigation, some Democrats are mounting a public campaign to save Mueller's job:\n\nDon't hold your breath, Senator Warner.",

                "title": "Trump's Data Firm Exploited Facebook Info From Millions",
                "body": "The data analytics firm that worked for President Trump's election campaign, Cambridge Analytica, harvested the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users without their permission, then failed to delete that data when it got caught, according to a new joint-investigation by the New York Times and the Observer of London. Facebook, whose role in the 2016 presidential election was already being widely criticized, suspended Cambridge Analytica's access to the service on Friday in light of the reports.\n\nThe harvested user information, collected under the guise of academic research, included the private social media activity of more than 50 million people. Cambridge Analytica's data scientists were then able to match about 30 million of those users with voter rolls and use that data to build psychographic models aimed at predicting and influencing votes -- though the effectiveness of such methods is disputable.\n\nCambridge Analytica is owned by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah, and counted former Trump adviser and Breitbart chairman Stephen Bannon as one of its founders. One of the company's other founders, Christopher Wylie, told the Times that the leaders of the firm wanted new weapons to \"fight a culture war in America,\" and that, \"rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\"\n\nSpeaking with the Observer, Wylie admitted that the company \"exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,\" and then \"built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.\"\n\nThe Mercers and Bannon wanted to remake American politics, he explained, and saw personality profiling as a way to help them accomplish that. The private Facebook information, collected in mid-2014, was used link personality traits to voting preferences, and that data was then used to tailor campaign messages that could take advantage of voters' personality traits. Further underlining the shadiness of these efforts: they originally experimented in countries with weak privacy protections where politician clients would pass along government data.\n\nCambridge Analytica executives have also been accused of exaggerating the usefulness of their methods, and it remains an open question how much of an impact their efforts had on the Trump campaign in 2016 (though no one is disputing how effective Trump's overall digital operation was). Former campaign officials told the Times that the Cambridge Analytica's services included \"designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.\"\n\nThe data breach, which has been previously reported as far back as 2015, is one of the largest in Facebook's history -- though the social media giant didn't acknowledge it until now, and is insisting it wasn't even a breach, but rather a mishandling of user data. On Friday, the company announced that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica, its parent firm Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), Wylie (who left the company in late 2014), and the Russian American academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who originally collected the data using a Facebook app that asked users to complete a personality test-like survey.\n\nIn a statement announcing the temporary suspensions, Facebook said Kogan harvested the data legitimately, but then passed it along to third parties in violation of the social network's terms. According to the Observer, Facebook failed to alert affected users about the breach, and \"took only limited steps to recover and secure\" the private information. Facebook had asked the firms to certify that the data had been deleted, which they did, but actually had not, according to the Times. Wylie says that all Facebook did to confirm the data was deleted was to ask him to \"tick a box on a form and post it back.\"\n\nFacebook vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal insisted on Friday that while the platform's terms were violated, \"no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"\n\nThe Times also reports that because many of the data scientists employed by Cambridge Analytica and SCL were foreigners, it's possible that they violated U.S. election law -- though Cambridge Analytica denies that. The company is also being investigated by UK authorities over its data acquisition methods and possibly illegal efforts to influence voters to vote in favor of Brexit.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly demanding emails exchanged between Cambridge Analytica employees and Trump campaign staff. One likely reason why: the Times says that a British affiliate of Cambridge Analytica claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. The Observer adds that Kogan, the Russian-American academic who collected the data, \"has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research.\"\n\nWikileaks founder Jullian Assange also alleged last year that Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Alexander Nix, contacted him during the campaign trying to get ahold of Hillary Clinton's private emails. And Times reporters watched undercover footage of Nix bragging in January that he had employed front companies and former spies in service of his political clients, as well as discussing ways of entrapping politicians in compromising situations.\n\nSo far, no American political campaigns or super PACs have reported paying Cambridge Analytica for its services ahead of this year's midterms.",

By not letting him run out the clock on his career, Sessions may force McCabe to forgo some of his pension, which he had earned after 21 years at the bureau.\n\nTrump had been agitating for McCabe's dismissal for months, and on Saturday morning he gloated that it had finally come to pass.\n\nIn a lengthy statement put after his firing -- which he reportedly learned of from a press release -- McCabe wrote that he had been unfairly singled out and made a target by the president.\n\n\"For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country,\" he wrote. He said that \"the President's tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all,\" and maintained that \"I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.\"\n\nThe purported reason for McCabe's firing involves a yet-to-be-released report into the F.B.I.'s handling of Hillary Clinton's email server probe in 2016.\n\nA statement put out by the F.B.I. said that McCabe \"made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor - including under oath - on multiple occasions.\"\n\nLawfare's Benjamin Wittes wrote on Saturday that \"anyone who is confidently pronouncing on the merits of Andrew McCabe's firing Friday night is venturing well beyond the realm of known facts,\" noting that no actual details surrounding his firing are available to the public, and that the investigation into McCabe's conduct involved several career Justice Department and FBI officials, including at least one appointed by President Obama.\n\nStill, on first blush at least, Sessions's explanation does not pass the smell test, considering both the timing of McCabe's firing and the Trump administration's overall attitude toward the truth.\n\nMcCabe was also a close associate of James Comey, the former FBI director who Trump fired last May. Trump's firing of Comey, and his earlier insistence that Comey shut down an investigation into Russian electoral interference in 2016, is at the center of a possible obstruction of justice case against Trump being cobbled together by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThough evidence points to the fact that the FBI helped out Trump during the campaign -- whether inadvertently or not -- the president and his allies have concocted a conspiracy that \"deep state\" actors in the bureau, including McCabe, protected Clinton from prosecution and tried to hobble his campaign. Part of Trump's proof for this dubious assertion is that McCabe's wife once ran as a Democrat in a State Senate race in Virginia, and received money from Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend of the Clintons.\n\nIn the past several months, Trump has repeatedly gone after McCabe on Twitter, calling for his firing. (Because he has been so public and nakedly partisan on the matter, McCabe may have a solid legal case to recover his pension.)\n\nComey, who has been largely silent on his firing save for a day of Congressional testimony, is on the brink of embarking on a tour for his new book, which promises to reveal new, unflattering details about the Trump administration. Now that McCabe has been dumped, he is likely to follow suit.\n\nSessions has been in Trump's doghouse ever since he recused himself from the investigation into Russian electoral interference, paving the way for Mueller's appointment. (Sessions also promised to recuse himself from all matters related to the Clinton investigation, a vow he appears to have blatantly broken with the McCabe firing.) As rumors float about Trump possibly replacing him, Sessions may have wanted to mollify his boss by helping the president get revenge against what he views as a political enemy.",

                "title": "Will the Youth Vote Surge in November?",
                "body": "One of the abiding realities of U.S. politics is that young voters don't participate proportionately in midterm elections. This is not a new thing. But it's become a big thing for Democrats in the 21st century as age has become a major partisan differentiator, with older voters tilting Republican and younger voters trending Democratic.\n\nThe chart below shows that while every age category turns out more in presidential than in midterm elections, and old folks vote more than younger folks in every election, the midterm drop-off is much more severe for under-30 voters.\n\nThere are varying theories for why younger voters tend to skip midterms (and other non-presidential contests), which is not just an American phenomenon. This explanation from the Economist offers one of the most plausible:\n\n[Y]oung people today do not feel they have much of a stake in society. Having children and owning property gives you a direct interest in how schools and hospitals are run, and whether parks and libraries are maintained. But if they settle down at all, young people are waiting ever longer to do it. In 1970 the average American woman was not yet 21 years old when she first married, with children and home ownership quickly following. Today women marry at 26 on average, if they marry at all, and are likely to want a career as well as children. People who have not settled down are not much affected by political decisions, and their transient lifestyles can also make it difficult to vote.\n\nA presidential election with its national scope (and rules allowing even highly transient people to vote) and incessant publicity is more likely to attract young voters. But midterms often leave them cold.\n\nBut there are now signs that could change this year.\n\nA new Survey Monkey poll shows a really high level of interest among young voters this year:\n\n[A] new poll from Cosmopolitan and SurveyMonkey finds that young adults are deeply dissatisfied with their elected representatives and unusually motivated to vote in both sets of elections [primaries and the general election] in 2018. The online survey of a national sample of 4,706 adults, conducted from February 22 - 25, found that 60 percent of young people (ages 18 - 34) say they're absolutely certain to vote or will probably vote in the upcoming primary elections, and 68 percent say the same of the midterm elections. By contrast, less than half (47 percent) of young people say they always or nearly always voted in past primary elections, and only 25 percent say they voted in the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nThe huge gap between self-reported interest in the midterms and past voting behavior is going to become a big issue in polls later in the year, since some pollsters base likelihood to vote primarily on one of these two very different factors. And there's some doubt that a lot of young voters who might want to vote know enough about local politics to participate, particularly in primaries.\n\nTurnout in the year's first primary election, which took place on March 7 in Texas, was higher than usual among people who don't usually vote in off-year or primary elections. But it wasn't as high as many polls had predicted, which may be a reflection of another finding from the Cosmopolitan/SurveyMonkey poll: Many young people don't know when their state's primary will be held, and relatively few say they're familiar with the candidates running to represent them at the state or local level.\n\nBut by November, a lot more voters of all ages will have heard that the midterm general election is a referendum on the occupant of the White House, and that happens to be something about which under-30 voters have strong opinions right now:\n\nMore than half (53 percent) of young people say the results of the 2016 presidential election are making them more likely to vote in this year's general election. Only 30 percent approve of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president, and a majority (52 percent) strongly disapprove of the president's performance so far.\n\nIt's the intensity of this antipathy towards Trump that may matter most. Young voters famously liked Barack Obama a lot. But that didn't motivate them to turn out for his party in either 2010 or 2014.\n\nWithout question, it would be ironic if Obama's successor discovered the key to the ancient riddle of how to get young people to vote in midterms -- by horrifying them. If that happens, the Democratic wave so many are anticipating could grow even larger than expected.",

                "title": "Why Wikipedia Works",
                "body": "Earlier this week at South by Southwest, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced that the video site will use excerpts from Wikipedia to counteract videos promoting conspiracy theories. This new feature is, at first glance (and really, on second and third glances, too), odd. A megacorporation with billions of dollars and thousands of brilliant employees is ... relying on a volunteer-run platform anyone can edit to fact-check information?\n\nBut the fact that YouTube sees Wikipedia as a reliable source is also, in a sense, a total validation of Wikipedia's mission. A encyclopedia, open to edits from anyone, could easily have been misused and abused. Instead, it's become the default place to find facts online. Even Google knows this: When you search for certain things, Google will pull information \"snippets\" about those terms from Wikipedia. And Wikipedia makes its content free for people to license and reproduce wherever they see fit -- including the world's most powerful search engine. (In a statement, Wikipedia said that it had no problem with YouTube's decision to use the encyclopedia content -- though the video site should definitely have given the encyclopedia some sort of advance notice.)\n\nIt's worth examining, then, how Wikipedia has managed to maintain its role as a reliable database without thousands of paid moderators and editors, while major, well-funded platforms like Facebook and YouTube have become the subjects of frenzied debate about misinformation.\n\nTo start with, Wikipedia's process is collaborative -- it requires broad groups of people to come to an agreement about what can be said and what can't. On YouTube, I might make one video about the Stoneman shooting, and you might make another with a totally opposite idea of truth; they'd then duke it out in \"the marketplace of ideas\" (the YouTube search results). On Wikipedia, there's only one article about the Stoneman shooting, and it's created by a group of people discussing and debating the best way to present information in a singular way, suggesting and sometimes voting on changes to a point where enough people are satisfied.\n\nImportantly, that discussion is both entirely transparent, and at the same time \"behind the scenes.\" The \"Talk\" pages on which editorial decisions are made are prominently linked to on every entry. Anyone can read, access, and participate -- but not many people do. This means both that the story of how an article came to be is made clear to a reader (unlike, say, algorithmic decisions made by Facebook), but also that there is less incentive for a given editor to call attention to themselves in the hopes of becoming a celebrity (unlike, say, the YouTube-star economy).\n\nWikipedia articles also have stringent requirements for what information can be included. The three main tenets are that (1) information on the site be presented in a neutral point of view, (2) be verified by an outside source, and (3) not be based on original research. Each of these can be quibbled with (what does \"neutral\" mean?), and plenty of questionable statements slip through -- but, luckily, you probably know that they're questionable because of the infamous \"[citation needed]\" superscript that peppers the website.\n\nActual misinformation, meanwhile, is dealt with directly. Consider how the editors treat conspiracy theories. \"Fringe theories may be mentioned, but only with the weight accorded to them in the reliable sources being cited,\" Wikimedia tweeted in an explanatory thread earlier this week. In contrast, platform companies have spent much of the last year talking about maintaining their role as a platform for \"all viewpoints,\" and through design and presentation, they flatten everything users post to carry the same weight. A documentary on YouTube is presented in the exact same manner as an Infowars video, and until now, YouTube has felt no responsibility to draw distinctions.\n\nBut really, I'd argue that Wikipedia's biggest asset is its willingness as a community and website to \"delete.\" It's that simple. If there's bad information, or info that's just useless, Wikipedia's regulatory system has the ability to discard it.\n\nDeleting data is antithetical to data-reliant companies like Facebook and Google (which owns YouTube). This is because they are heavily invested in machine learning, which requires almost incomprehensibly large data sets on which to train programs so that they can eventually operate autonomously. The more pictures of cats there are online, the easier it is to train a computer to recognize a cat. For Facebook and Google, the idea of deleting data is sacrilege. Their solutions to fake news and misinformation has been to throw more data at the problem: third-party fact-checkers and \"disputed\" flags giving equal weight to every side of a debate that really only has one.\n\nTo hear Facebook and Google tell it, \"fake news\" accounts for less than one percent of everything uploaded to their platforms. In that sense, the risk of actually deleting unproven conspiracy theories is minimal, and it actually improves the integrity of the data set these companies use to build machine-learning systems (remember when Microsoft's Twitter bot turned racist in less than a day because users kept sending it racist tweets?). Instead of adding \"Well, Wikipedia says ...\" next to bad videos, it might be time for major platforms to get over their fear of the delete key.\n\nBut on the business side, all of this data helps these companies sell targeted ads. Which is one of the final points in Wikipedia's favor. The open encyclopedia, as a donation- and grant-funded nonprofit, has no incentive to generate revenue. It's therefore not caught up in the advertising business, which means it has no need to ensure that users spend a lot of time on the site, which means it's never fallen prey to the defining techniques of the social web -- extremism, sensationalization, clickbait, misleading titles and thumbnails, and so on.\n\nNone of which is to say that Wikipedia is, by any means, perfect. In fact, just as the design of its institution and platform means that it is a more informative and accurate site than YouTube, it can also encourage bad and unfortunate behavior. As an online space dedicated to facts above all else, and where editorial decisions are made through conversation and voting, it can be a place where only the loudest and most persistent and self-confident users feel comfortable. Wikipedia, like every organization, struggles with bias: Its editors are often male and white.\n\nAnd its openness can be taken advantage of -- in the wake of breaking news, Wikipedia articles are often defaced (usually for comedic effect) or the setting for editorial arguments, placing it in a publishing role it wasn't initially designed for. Notorious pages like \"Race and IQ\" have been the setting of some grossly bigoted, not to mention absolutely incorrect, edit wars.\n\nBut Wikipedia is still evolving, and as the site has evolved and grown, it's gotten better. The phenomenon of ideological extremists holding sway over individual and highly contentious articles has largely ended, in part because Wikipedia is designed to make such domination very difficult. And anyway, if you want to learn more -- or complain -- here's a Wikipedia entry called \"Criticism of Wikipedia.\"",

                "title": "The NYPD Investigator Who's Determined to Bust Weinstein",
                "body": "Early in the evening of March 27, 2015, a young Italian model named Ambra Battilana walked into the NYPD's 9th Precinct house, a few blocks from Tompkins Square Park. She was so physically and emotionally distressed that the desk sergeant almost called an ambulance. When two patrol officers transported her to the 1st Precinct house, in Tribeca, she cried throughout the short drive. There, at 8:20 p.m., she made a formal complaint that she had been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein.\n\nBy nine o'clock, the commander of the NYPD's Special Victims Division, Michael Osgood, had been notified. Osgood understood immediately that the case had to be handled with extreme care. He and Lieutenant Austin Morange, head of the SVD's Manhattan unit, mapped out a plan to keep the case under wraps, to prevent Weinstein from calling in his army of high-powered lawyers and publicists. Knowledge of the investigation, they decided, would be confined to a small circle of detectives and supervisors. Their reports, contrary to standard procedure, wouldn't be loaded on the NYPD's system, and Osgood orally informed his boss, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce, rather than putting his briefing in writing.\n\nThen Morange called Martha Bashford, head of the Sex Crimes Unit at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, to apprise her of the complaint. The call was made reluctantly, after much internal debate. Osgood's team felt that ever since 2011, when District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. had been blasted in the press for dropping a sexual-assault case against IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the DA's office had been gun-shy about taking on powerful defendants. While Osgood cannot talk about the case his team built against Weinstein, sources close to the investigation provided the first detailed account of its inner workings -- and how the police became convinced that Vance's office was systematically working to derail the investigation.\n\nIn the station house that evening, Battilana told an SVD detective that Weinstein had invited her to a meeting earlier that day, saying he might have work for her. As soon as they were alone in his office, he reached out, two-handed, and groped her breasts. She told him to stop, but he put a hand on her left thigh, moved it up under her skirt, and asked for a kiss. When she refused, he told her he was a very powerful man, boasting that he could make her $2 million a year. The meeting ended with Weinstein telling his receptionist to get Battilana a ticket to that night's performance of Finding Neverland on Broadway.\n\nJust then, as Battilana was providing her account to the SVD detective, she got an email from Weinstein. Why hadn't she shown up at the theater, he wanted to know. Recognizing an opportunity for a \"controlled call\" -- a police technique used to solicit and record incriminating evidence -- the detective instructed Battilana to reply to the email and say that she didn't have his phone number. They exchanged numbers, and Weinstein called.\n\n\"How did my breasts feel?\" Battilana asked him, as the detective had coached her. (A flat-out accusation isn't a good strategy for a controlled call. \"Why did you touch my breasts?\" is only likely to prompt an apology, which isn't an admission.)\n\n\"They felt beautiful,\" Weinstein replied, according to a source who heard the recording. \"They're great.\"\n\nThe call was used to set up a meet with Weinstein -- one that would be surveilled and recorded by the SVD -- for the next day, at the Tribeca Grand Hotel. At one o'clock that Saturday afternoon, Lieutenant Morange called Bashford at the DA's office to tell her about the meet. \"Her response to it was, in sum and substance, that it was fine,\" recalls Michael Bock, a retired sergeant who was one of only six SVD members privy to the investigation. \"At no time did she request to prep the victim or direct any specific questions to be asked by the victim during the controlled meet. In other words, she didn't participate, but the opportunity was there.\"\n\nAt the Tribeca Grand, detectives listened in as Weinstein again admitted to fondling Battilana's breasts, all the while trying to wheedle and bully her into a room he had rented in the hotel. Once Battilana had gotten safely away, Morange and another officer approached Weinstein, asking him to come down to the station house. Weinstein refused. \"He threatened to call the police commissioner,\" Bock says. When Morange told him that the commissioner knew they were there -- a bluff the egotistical Weinstein readily believed -- he agreed to go with them.\n\nOn the way to the precinct, Weinstein threatened Morange and the two detectives escorting him, telling them he was going to call Police Commissioner William Bratton, former commissioners Ray Kelly and Bernard Kerik, and former mayor Rudy Giuliani. By messing with him, Weinstein said, they were putting their jobs in jeopardy.\n\nAt the precinct, Weinstein demanded to know why he had been hauled into the station. As soon as Battilana's name was mentioned, he invoked his right to counsel. \"All he needed to know was her name,\" Bock says. Weinstein's machine went into high gear. He retained two lawyers with ties to the district attorney's office, including Elkan Abramowitz, Vance's former law partner and a donor to his campaign. To cement their access to Vance's office, the lawyers hired Linda Fairstein, the former head of the DA's Sex Crimes Unit and a close friend of Bashford's.\n\nOn April 1, five days after Battilana had filed her complaint, Bashford conducted an interview with her. The next day, sources say, Vance's office sent its own investigators to Battilana's apartment. There, according to Bock, they aggressively questioned her roommates. Was Battilana a prostitute? Did she bring home lots of strange men? Was she a stripper? The DA's office also reviewed video from the apartment building's surveillance cameras, which would enable them to create a record of Battilana's personal life. \"When she found out about this, the victim became afraid,\" recalls Bock. \"She began to cry.\"\n\nAccording to Bock, Osgood believed that Vance and his office were actively working to discredit Battilana. So the chief and his team decided to take an extraordinary step. \"We decided we're going to hide the victim,\" Bock says. \"From the DA.\"\n\nOn April 2, under the direction of Osgood, the SVD put Battilana in a hotel, registering her under a false name. For the next five nights, she was kept safe from Vance's investigators, first at the Franklin Hotel, then at the Bentley. A 22-year-old woman had come forward to accuse one of the most powerful men in Hollywood of sexual abuse, and the police decided she needed protection -- not only from her alleged assailant, but from the elected official responsible for prosecuting him.\n\nThe Special Victims Division is headquartered in a gray brick building on Avenue C, where the front doors are routinely stuck halfway open and, at night, roof floodlights give the humble edifice a penitentiary glare. Outside of Chief Osgood's office there are dozens of desks, set side by side, where SVD detectives comb over every sex-crimes complaint made in the past 24 hours to make sure they were classified correctly. That was one of the first and most sweeping changes that Osgood made when he took over Special Victims in 2010. Too many rape complaints, he discovered, were improperly dismissed as \"unfounded,\" while attempted rape was often misclassified as forcible touching, a misdemeanor charge. Shortly before Osgood took command, a journalist named Debbie Nathan had been grabbed by a man and dragged into the woods in Inwood Hill Park, where he rubbed himself against her. \"Special Victims showed up and made it a forcible touching,\" Osgood recalls. \"Yeah, she was grabbed -- but that's not what his intended goal was. He wasn't gonna bring her into the woods and practice salsa dancing.\" Osgood implemented what he called the \"attempted-rape rule,\" ordering investigators to take into account a perpetrator's intent. \"The worst thing you can do to a victim is to improperly classify her complaint,\" he says. \"Plus, I need to know if I have a possible rapist, so I can zero in on him.\"\n\nWhen then-commissioner Ray Kelly tapped Osgood to oversee the SVD, the unit was in bad shape. For many years, the NYPD had treated Special Victims like an investigatory backwater. \"If you couldn't cut it someplace,\" Chief Boyce recalls, \"we'd send you there.\" Although the division was slowly beginning to improve, Osgood found that detectives were still making too many \"jump collars\" -- premature arrests on slim evidence, which led to innocent people being picked up and guilty ones being let go. SVD detectives fought incessantly with prosecutors, each unit in the division acted as a world unto itself, and there was deep distrust between the SVD and advocacy groups for sexual-assault victims. When Monica Pombo, a social worker at the nonprofit Crime Victims Treatment Center, took a job at the NYPD, her fellow advocates responded warily. \"Oh,\" they said, \"you're going over to the other side.\"\n\nOsgood, who had spent eight years heading up the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force, had developed a reputation for solving high-profile cases and working closely with traumatized victims and their communities. A former Marine who stands six-foot-four, he has the forthright manner of a seasoned cop, coupled with a buoyant, restlessly tuned energy; many of our conversations were accompanied by the sound of his fingers drumming on the tabletop. Around the NYPD, where excessive reading is viewed with a degree of suspicion, he's often referred to as an academic. \"He's not a regular chief,\" says Boyce. \"He's an expert in his field, and he has an unbelievable amount of knowledge.\" Osgood majored in mathematics in college, and the shelves in his office are lined with books on criminal investigations, complex-systems theory, advanced management, biochemistry, and probability -- a collection Osgood describes as a \"body of knowledge and set of modern intellectual thought that is necessary to move policing forward.\"\n\nOsgood used such thinking to hone the way the NYPD investigates hate crimes. Breaking with long-established traditions of policing, he eliminated the military-style hierarchy ingrained in the NYPD, creating a flat command structure that allows for a constant flow of real-time information between detectives and supervisors. When a hate crime was especially violent or complex, he flooded the crime scene with manpower -- a move his detectives affectionately call \"an Osgood mobilization.\" In what has become a mantra for Osgood, he imposed \"investigative process discipline,\" pushing his team to follow each investigative pathway to the very end, no matter how time-consuming or frustrating it might be. Searching for witnesses in one homicide case, for example, detectives in the hate-crimes unit identified and tracked down the six bus drivers who were working the B38 route in Bushwick the night of the murder. That step alone took two weeks, and led nowhere.\n\nEmploying such unconventional techniques paid off. The Hate Crimes Task Force, which Osgood continues to lead, has solved every case of stranger homicide it has investigated in the past 15 years. By contrast, the national solve rate for homicides -- the majority of which involve known offenders -- is roughly 65 percent.\n\nOsgood brought the same instincts as a reformer to the task of investigating the more than 5,000 rapes and other sex crimes reported in New York City each year. When he took over the SVD, he knew nothing about what he calls the \"hard, hazy world of sexual-assault complaints.\" Years before Weinstein's predatory behavior helped spark the #MeToo reckoning, Osgood decided that the cops needed to do a better job of listening -- not only to the victims of sexual assault but also to the vocal and organized network of social workers, doctors, and prosecutors who advocate on their behalf. Going against the culture of the NYPD, Osgood allowed victims' advocates to step inside the closed world of the Special Victims Division and independently audit case files -- a step that only two other police departments in the country have taken. He sits down with advocates twice a year to hear their criticisms and suggestions, and he makes a point of being on call whenever they spot something that needs fixing.\n\n\"We have his phone number, and he's always available,\" says Brigitte Alexander, an emergency-medicine physician who formed the first sexual-assault response team for the city's public hospitals in 2004. \"So if there's a problem, like some patrol officer not taking a report, it's very easy to make that call and get it resolved. Honestly, before he took over, that did not exist. There's a level of openness and professionalism that just wasn't there 20 years ago.\"\n\nAt the same time, Osgood ordered SVD detectives to stop jumping the gun on arrests. \"I communicated to the whole division that we're not a jump-collar division,\" he says. \"We're a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt division.\" He studied the science of DNA -- \"the molecular structure, DNA-extraction technology, the probability mathematics\" -- and created a DNA Cold Case squad that has resolved more than 1,800 dormant cases. Most recently, he formed a new squad dedicated to reexamining 4,000 unsolved cases of stranger rape.\n\nThe Stranger Rape Cold Case unit was formally approved by Commissioner James O'Neill in February, after Osgood and the SVD reopened and solved one of the NYPD's most infamous cold cases. In 1994, a 27-year-old Yale graduate was raped in broad daylight by a stranger in Prospect Park while she was walking home from the grocery store. But as SVD detectives worked to solve the case, a high-ranking police source told the Daily News that the victim was lying, and the paper published a series of columns dismissing the attack as a \"hoax.\" The victim described the experience as being raped twice. Using new technology, Osgood's team managed to match DNA evidence from the original investigation to a serial rapist who was serving a 75-year sentence in Sing Sing.\n\nOsgood brought the victim to his office to give her the news personally. \"I don't know how to say this,\" he told her, \"but we solved your case.\" She broke down in tears. Osgood also apologized to her, on behalf of the NYPD, for whoever had smeared her in the press.\n\nThe biggest innovation that Osgood brought to the Special Victims unit -- one that is only now beginning to make its way across the country, police department by police department -- was also the trickiest to implement. The NYPD's police academy, Osgood observed, offered a range of courses on questioning suspects but none on talking to victims. As a result, SVD investigators were stuck in a \"who, what, when, where, and why\" mind-set. They wanted the facts, ideally in chronological order. \"Start from the beginning,\" they might tell a victim. \"What time did this happen? Tell me the exact location where he first approached you. What color shirt was the suspect wearing?\"\n\nBut victims of sexual assault are often unable to answer such straightforward questions. There will be gaps in their stories. Events will be out of sequence. And the fractured nature of their testimony can lead investigators to conclude that they are unreliable at best or dishonest at worst. \"What I saw time and time again is something like this,\" Osgood says. \"A victim says, 'I was walking down the street, a red van passes me, and then I'm assaulted.' But when you pull video, you see that she's walking down the street, she's assaulted, and then a red van passes. Most police departments would go, 'Oh, she's inconsistent, she's lying.' \"\n\nOsgood saw the phenomenon play out in one of his earliest cases at SVD. On Memorial Day in 2011, an 85-year-old woman was sexually assaulted while taking her early-morning walk on East 83rd Street, just four blocks from Mayor Michael Bloomberg's townhouse. The media jumped on the story, and Osgood assembled an investigative team of more than 60 detectives. After the police released video images of the suspect dragging the woman into a stairwell, someone identified him as the same person who hung around his apartment building in East New York. But when SVD detectives staked out the location and grabbed the guy, they noticed something odd.\n\nOne of the detectives immediately called Osgood. \"Chief, we don't think this is the guy,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\" Osgood asked.\n\n\"He's got a New York Yankees tattoo on his face,\" the detective explained. It was inked on his left cheekbone and it was pretty big -- larger than a silver dollar. But the victim, when giving her physical description of the suspect, had never mentioned it.\n\n\"Bring him in,\" Osgood told the detective. \"He's the guy.\" And he was. DNA lifted from the elderly women's blouse matched that of the 32-year-old suspect.\n\nIn 2015, a deputy commissioner named Susan Herman, who works closely with victims, handed Osgood a research paper about something called the Forensic Experiential Trauma Interview. Developed by Russell Strand, a former special agent with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, FETI drew on emerging neuroscience that dovetailed precisely with what Osgood has observed in action. \"Memory encoding during a traumatic event is diminished and sometimes inaccurate,\" Strand wrote. When trauma occurs, the prefrontal cortex often shuts down, and more primitive parts of the brain take over. Information necessary to survival continues to be recorded, Strand explained, but the primitive brain doesn't do very well \"recording the information many professionals have been trained to obtain.\"\n\nOsgood, who was making notes in the margin, only had to read the first page to feel the kick of recognition. \"This guy's correct,\" he said to himself. \"This is what I've been seeing over 14 years.\"\n\nOsgood decided to fly to Idaho, where a former detective named Carrie Hull, one of the country's leading innovators in sexual-assault investigations, was offering a training program in FETI. He brought along Monica Pombo, the victims' advocate who had joined the NYPD, and Bock, one of his most \"experienced, gritty sergeants.\" If his seasoned vets couldn't learn FETI, Osgood reasoned, or if they balked at the process, it wouldn't matter how effective the technique was.\n\n\"I was skeptical,\" Bock admits. \"It's not the normal way of doing business. But going out there, I kept an open mind. Maybe they know something that we didn't.\"\n\nOsgood, Bock, and Pombo were blown away by what they discovered. FETI, it turned out, provides a way to interview victims that allows them to access the kind of rich and detailed information that investigators can then follow up on in the field. The questions are open-ended and empathetic -- more an invitation to share than a relentless hammer to provide a precise chronological account. \"What are you able to tell me about your experience?\" takes the pressure off the victim to figure out what the investigator wants and allows for actual recollection. \"What are you able to recall about what you heard or smelled?\" taps into the victim's deeper sensory experience. \"What can't you forget about your experience?\" bypasses what the victim has forgotten and offers an entryway into other memories.\n\nThat night, over dinner with Hull and his colleagues, Osgood plunged right in. \"I love this -- I want this,\" he said. \"This is what I've been looking for.\" Plates were pushed aside and everyone pulled out notebooks and pens, sketching out a plan to bring FETI to the NYPD. \"When Chief Osgood gets excited, he just starts talking more and more and more and more and faster and faster and faster,\" says Pombo. \"He starts doing what he does well, which is saying: 'This is great -- here's how it can be better.' \" With the backing of Chief Boyce, Osgood put 30 of his best investigators through the FETI course, enabling him and Hull's team to fine-tune it to match the needs of the NYPD. Today, all 144 detectives in the SVD who investigate sex crimes involving adults have received seven days of training in the technique.\n\n\"Of anybody we've worked with, the NYPD has made by far the most significant commitment in training their people,\" says Hull, who has worked with police departments across the country. \"Chief Osgood not only said, 'Hey, what kind of training can I bring in?' He went out and put himself through the trainings. You tend to see people that want a quick fix, but for him, it wasn't just a way to check a box. He made sure it was the right fit for his department.\"\n\nSince Osgood took charge, Special Victims has solved 79 percent of all cases involving rapists who commit more than one assault -- compared to a national average of 36 percent. But whatever innovations he has brought to the investigations of hate crimes and sexual offenses, there is one variable that remains outside Osgood's control: politics. Five days after he and his team sequestered Ambra Battilana in a hotel room to protect her from Vance's office, she agreed to meet with Martha Bashford, the head of the DA's sex-crimes unit. Bashford didn't inform the SVD, but Battilana's lawyer did, and Osgood's investigative team showed up at the attorney's office before Bashford arrived.\n\nDuring the meeting, according to Bock, Bashford grilled Battilana about her personal life -- including one of the infamous sex parties thrown by Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi that she had attended.Battilana told Bashford that she and her friends had left as soon as the sex started. \"The questioning was aggressive and accusatory,\" Bock recalls. \"Again, the victim was upset. She felt like she was under attack.\"\n\nThree days later, Bashford called Osgood's team to inform them that Vance had decided not to prosecute the case. Weinstein's team, which smeared Battilana in the press as a gold digger, reached a settlement requiring her to turn over a copy she possessed of the phone call recorded by the SVD. Anonymous sources close to Vance's office, meanwhile, painted Battilana as an unreliable witness and blamed Osgood's team for having moved too quickly. The SVD, a source told the New York Times last fall, failed to give prosecutors \"an opportunity to help steer the secretly recorded encounter with Mr. Weinstein.\"\n\nThree years later, Bock is still incensed. \"This is only a misdemeanor case!\" he fumes. \"It's not a felony! They prosecute people for misdemeanors with far less probable cause than this. We gave them beyond a reasonable doubt. We obviously know who this man is. We obviously know we have a different burden of proof. So to go above and beyond as we did, he should've been arrested. He should've been arrested.\"\n\nThe DA's office continues to insist that it handled the case by the book. Joan Vollero, a senior adviser to Vance, denies that Osgood's team notified Bashford about the complaint against Weinstein or consulted with her about the meet at the Tribeca Grand. Vollero also maintains that the DA's office never interviewed Battliana's roommates or questioned her aggressively. \"It is customary for prosecutors to discuss potential areas of cross-examination when meeting with complainants,\" Vollero says. \"This characterization of the meeting is incorrect and, moreover, troubling. It was a normal, typical interview of a complainant.\"\n\nThe deep-seated mistrust between the DA's office and the SVD is bad news for the victims of sex crimes, who rely on public officials to bring their assailants to justice. In the wake of #MeToo, 14 women have filed sexual-assault complaints against Weinstein with the NYPD. This time around, to ensure that nothing goes wrong, Osgood has taken an extraordinary step: He personally conducted each of the investigations, along with two of his best investigators, Sergeant Keri Thompson and Detective Nicholas DiGaudio. The task force of three has worked on the case full-time since October, traveling to Paris, London, Toronto, Montreal, Florida, and California. Many of the cases had passed the statute of limitations, but five are now sitting with Vance, awaiting his decision on whether to issue an indictment. If Weinstein winds up in handcuffs, it will be in no small part because Osgood made sure the police covered every base.\n\nOne day not long ago, Osgood was sitting in his office, talking with several current and retired members of his team. Behind his desk hangs a print of the iconic painting Washington Crossing the Delaware. \"I put that up there about 12, 14 years ago,\" Osgood says. \"And of course, the detectives said, 'Oh, that's Osgood leading the Hate Crimes Task Force.' \"\n\nEveryone laughs. \"The first Osgood mobilization!\" says Anthony Caban, a retired detective with the hate-crimes unit.\n\n\"That's not what it is,\" Osgood replies with a grin. \"Emanuel Leutze was a German artist who came to America in the 1820s. He was amazed at the individual liberty he saw, so he paints this picture. I have it there because when you look in this boat -- which is an incorrect boat, it's not the type of boat they used -- there are all these different identities ...\"\n\n\"Oh, you're giving her so much of a yarn here, you don't even know,\" says James Byrne, an NYPD spokesman, to more laughter.\n\n\"And what Emanuel Leutze was trying to say ...\" Osgood plows on.\n\n\"Some of this stuff I think he makes up as he goes along,\" injects Deputy Inspector Paul Saraceno, Osgood's right-hand man.\n\n\"There are people of Scottish identity, Irish. There's an African-American in there, there's a person that looks somewhat female. The night when Washington crossed the Delaware, he was crossing it not for any one group -- he was crossing for individual liberty, because all these different identities fought in the fight for independence. So I have it there to signify that in the United States, the right to identity safety is a core American principle. It's an extension of individual liberty, and that's what that represents.\"\n\nOsgood finishes. Drums his fingers on the tabletop. Gestures to the other cops in the room. \"Even if these guys feel otherwise,\" he says. More laughter.\n\nOsgood knows he still has a lot of work to do at Special Victims. In 2015, the division's reputation took a hit when the head of its Manhattan unit was forced to resign after his partner was accused of groping a rape victim during an investigative trip the two men took to Seattle. SVD remains seriously short-staffed, with each detective working as many as 130 cases a year. The interview rooms for victims are dingy and uncomfortable, and in most offices can be reached only by parading past a roomful of cops. And too many victims still don't trust the police enough to come forward to report the abuse they've suffered. \"This is probably the most important thing I can say, after doing 90,000 sexual-assault cases, 14,000 rapes, and 2,000 stranger rapes,\" Osgood emphasizes. \"Sexual assault is the hidden scourge on the American landscape. And it's hidden because there's such a vast underreporting of rape.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering the high-profile investigation he has just completed and what it will take to confront the true scope of sexual assault. \"Harvey Weinstein may be a watershed moment in the country,\" he says. \"We're at a point in our history that it's time for us to find a way to interdict this behavior. You can't have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of silent victims out there. I've learned the depth of the trespass and the damage this action causes. It's time for us, as a people, to go out there and mobilize.\"\n\n*This article appears in the March 19, 2018, issue of New York Magazine. Subscribe Now!",

                "body": "Making pour-over coffee first requires the right setup. Specifically, you need three things: a pour-over coffee maker (sometimes called a manual drip coffee maker), a pour-over kettle, and a scale, in order to keep track of the coffee bean-water ratio. But with so many different coffee makers, kettles, and scales out there, it can be hard to know which pour-over gear makes the best coffee. So we talked with coffee experts from Manhattan's Black Fox Coffee and Brooklyn's Variety Coffee Roasters about their preferred pour-over coffee setups and the gear they say makes the perfect cup.\n\nKris Wood, Co-Owner, Black Fox Coffee Brita Soho 5-Cup Water Filtration Pitcher\n\n\"The most important factor that everyone overlooks is water. If your water is clean and has the right combination of minerals, you're going to get a delicious result. New York water is very clean, but it picks up a lot of particles from the old pipes. A water filter is absolutely necessary if you'd like to achieve café-quality coffee at home. Brita does a good job; just make sure the cartridge is fresh.\"\n\n$20 at Bed Bath and Beyond Hario V60 Pour-Over Kit\n\n\"At Black Fox we use a Hario V60, and the extraction it delivers is even and consistent when used with skill. Plastic is best, as it does not retain heat. Having your water at the consistently hottest possible temperature will ensure consistent extraction from brew to brew. There are three main things that affect extraction when brewing at atmospheric pressure: grind particle size, contact time of water to coffee, and temperature of water.\"\n\n$28 at Bed Bath and Beyond Hario Filter Paper for 02 V60 Dripper $8 at Bed Bath and Beyond Bonavita 1.7-Liter Variable Temperature Gooseneck Kettle\n\n\"We use a Bonavita variable-control temperature kettle, as we brew teas at different temperatures. For coffee, we brew at just off-boiling, as it is a consistent machine, and we know what temperature it's really at.\"\n\n$110 at Bed Bath and Beyond Hario V60 Coffee Drip Scale/Timer\n\n\"For a scale at home, I've used the same Hario scale for three years, and it's not missed a beat.\"\n\n$65 at Bed Bath and Beyond Hario V60 Drip Scale and Timer $44 at Amazon $44 at Amazon Mike Jones, Director of Retail, Variety Coffee Roasters Abid Clever Coffee Dripper\n\n\"If you want to make great coffee at home, you should aim to eliminate as many variables as possible. Therefore, any product or method that enables you to achieve a repeatable outcome will inevitably yield the best results. For this reason, I think the Abid Clever Coffee Dripper is the best manual coffee maker for home use. The Clever is a mix between a full-immersion brewer like a French press and a traditional pour-over cone. You use time as a brew control. You can use grind as a control by timing how long it takes to drain, and make adjustments if you want it stronger or weaker. The best part is that, due to its design, these steps are measurable and repeatable -- you can steep the same amount of time, measure how long it takes to drain, and do the same thing every day without having to overthink it.\"\n\n$21 at Prima Coffee Melitta 100-Count Number 4 Natural Brown Super Premium Coffee Filters $4 at Bed Bath and Beyond Hario Electric Buono Kettle\n\n\"The best pour-over kettle is the Hario Buono.

                "title": "Nat'l Geographic's Racist Fictions and Post-racial Fantasies",
                "body": "In her honest but odd memoir that it seems, thankfully, few besides me have read, National Geographic emerges as a crucial touchstone to Rachel Dolezal's supposed racial awakening. Isolated regionally and culturally by Christian-fundamentalist parents, copies of the magazine were one of the few tokens from 1980s and '90s American culture allowed to Dolezal in a home that forbade television and processed food. And while her older brother scrounged pages for photos of topless women, NatGeo begat Rachel's earliest racial fantasies. Coating herself in mud from head to feet, she \"would pretend to be a dark-skinned princess in the Sahara Desert or one of the Bantu women living in the Congo,\" images conjured exclusively by the monthly magazine. \"I would stay in this fantasy world as long as I possibly could,\" Dolezal writes. \"It was never long enough.\"\n\nOver the last century, National Geographic has used the guise of ethnographic research to stoke the racial imaginations of curious white people. Investigating peoples and cultures like flora, splaying their images upon glossy pages with unchecked fascination, the magazine does not have a great track record when it comes to stories about people of color. And yet, these are the stories NatGeo is most famous for, training generation after generation to gawk at peoples other than themselves through telephoto lenses. Founded in 1888 to document the interests of affluent explorers, the name alone evokes a colonial impulse -- the National Geographic Society started as a private club dedicated to worldly, exotic travel. The publication has long been an unrepentant descendant of those beginnings -- until now, allegedly.\n\nThe magazine's April issue, \"The Race Issue,\" promises to reckon with an editorial history it describes precisely as \"racist.\" In a note, editor-in-chief Susan Goldberg admits that for all its well-traveled coverage throughout the 20th century, \"National Geographic did little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture.\" John Edwin Mason, associate professor of history at the University of Virginia, conducted a deep dive into the magazine's archives, pointing out glaring erasures as evidence of a run that has more often than not failed to treat people of color as human. Examples include the absence of black South African perspectives in a story shortly following the 1960 massacre by Sharpeville police and the publication's mid-century obsession with Pacific-island women, to which a casual reader could add an obsession with nonwhite women in general, often indigenous and partially nude.\n\n\"How we present race matters,\" Goldberg asserts, marking this issue as a new era for the pages of NatGeo, one that will not shirk due diligence when it comes to representation. Goldberg underscores April 4, a date that marks 50 years since Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, \"a worthy moment to step back, to take stock of where we are on race.\" She also takes notice of another landmark event of sorts, the soon-to-come time when \"less than half of the children in the nation will be white.\" That NatGeo would choose these climactic moments is not surprising: In fact, they suggest the issue is perhaps not as committed to interrogating racial fantasies as it claims.\n\nKing -- or a certain image of him -- along with America's projected brown majority have long loomed large and symbolic in the minds and politics of people who believe that the best hope for equality is the removal of race as a topic of conversation. \"Race is not a biological construct,\" Goldberg introduces like a cherished revelation. Part of the Race Issue's mission, she writes, is to \"examine why we continue to segregate along racial lines and how we can build inclusive communities.\" NatGeo wants to start a conversation on race, but their opening statement seems more like an end than a beginning.\n\nThe April cover story features a set of biracial twin girls with different skin shades (one light, one brown) and curl patterns. On the cover, they stand side by side in identical off-white dresses, solemn-faced against a gray background. The headline offers some assistance in case the contrast between them isn't clear: \"Black and White,\" reads the bold white text (\"Black\" is overlaid on the lighter-skinned girl; \"White\" atop the darker-skinned girl). Though the cover and the story behind it intend to disturb preconceived notions about race in the year 2018, I am immediately reminded of a story from NatGeo's 125th anniversary in 2013. Called \"The Changing Face of America\" and accompanied by portraits of ethnically diverse, racially ambiguous people, the story offered an increasingly self-identified multiracial population as the kryptonite to race and therefore racism.\n\nSimilarly, Patricia Edmonds's feature on Marcia and Millie Briggs traffics in a certain post-racial optimism I find incredibly uncomfortable. The story is fascinated by the juxtaposition of racialized features and the color contrast between two children born of the same parents at the same time. \"Even when the twins' mother, Amanda Wanklin, dressed them alike, there was no mistaking one for the other,\" says one caption underneath a slideshow of the twins at various ages, from infancy up. As also noted in the 2013 story, Edmonds explains that race is not a biological category, but a social one.\n\nBut while the older story at least acknowledges the residue of Japanese internment and Jim Crow with respect to flagging equality in America, in this new one, racial segregation and its effects (globally) derive from the heart. In an \"out of the mouth of babes\" approach, the article delegates its intellectual labor to Millie and Marcia, ages 11, who not only \"understand racism,\" but also \"the best way to combat it.\" The wisdom imparted is sweet to be sure and very much what you might expect from someone who has lived barely a decade on earth. \"[D]on't judge other people by their looks because they could be so much different on the inside,\" says Millie in a short video; \"If you're happy with the way you look, then you should stay the way you look,\" Marcia adds. Were it so easy. In truth, people have many compounding reasons -- wealth, power, access -- to judge others as less than human, and as long as those benefits remain, people will continue to do so. (And in turn, many others will be dissatisfied that what they see in the mirror will be a lifelong barrier to thriving.) I can't expect a child to know this, but adults should know better.\n\nLast year, I predicted 2017 (and the era of Trump more generally) would be a time of renewed faith in the political efficacy of interracial romance and procreation. This prediction was informed by two recent books -- one by UC Irvine professor Jared Sexton, the other by NYU professor Tavia Nyong'o -- which probe the way racial hybridity is used to avoid reflection and recollection on how white supremacy works. NatGeo's cover illustration, which codes one biracial twin as \"white\" and the other as \"black,\" transmits the idea that racism will be fixed with more lightly bronzed children. This future utopia is one in which children who can pass for white still exist among their tanner peers, but those with dark skin and tightly coiled hair do not. This hope, which imagines a past of white racial \"purity,\" is a form of anti-blackness itself. Racism and multiracialism can be allies.\n\nRather than confront the power dynamics that racism relies upon to survive, these gestures fuel a deus ex machina fantasy in which humans breed themselves into equality -- never mind the fact that mixed-race children have existed for just as long as racism has. NatGeo is not even the first outlet to break the Briggs story -- that honor belonged to the Daily Mail, who covered the twins over a decade ago in a similar fashion. While twins Marcia and Millie Briggs are a genetic rarity, the nonbiological mechanisms that maintain race are not mysterious. \"[T]he 21st-century understanding of human genetics tells us that the whole idea of race is a human invention,\" writes Edmonds, as if centuries of genocide, enslavement, and discrimination were waiting to be stayed by a set of tenured biologists.\n\nRacism poses a challenge for scholars, journalists, and poets not because its delusions are hard to disprove, but because its filiations are incredibly difficult to unravel. Race is a fiction, but it is one in which people are both emotionally and materially invested. Unveiling race as a social construction without an effort to address how and why it's constructed is as much a threat to racism as North West or the Briggs twins -- that is to say, not at all. It's also often used to undercut efforts toward radical politics. Many white people on the left, fitted with the knowledge that race is a fiction, deny the efficacy of black political organizing. They, like NatGeo here, neglect the extent to which fictions rule the world we live in. Edmonds is puzzled how \"50 years after the assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., racial identity has reemerged as a fundamental dividing line in our world.\" (When did it ever submerge?) Yet she daren't explicate any further, relying on a pair of 11-year-olds to perform the heavy lifting on that topic.\n\nBut NatGeo's new commitment to confronting racism -- among other stories, they have a lengthy history of scientific racism and a collaboration with ESPN's the Undefeated on the routine harrowing experience of \"driving while black\" -- could still be promising. As Goldberg writes, the Race Issue \"is just a starting point.\" I hope that's true, but I hesitate to applaud just yet. It's just like a fantasy to materialize when you need it the most.",

                "title": "The Best Makeup for Acne-Prone Skin",
                "body": "Whenever I'm breaking out, I find myself seriously weighing the cost versus benefit of putting on makeup. On one hand, using makeup tends to be psychologically beneficial when I'm having skin issues: Concealing a blemish ensures that I won't touch it throughout the day, and helps me straight-up forget it's there when I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. This allows me to think about it less and lets my skin's healing process run its course. Benefit!\n\nBut on the other hand, I'm putting makeup over an active breakout, which then raises the question of whether I'm clogging my pores and making my skin worse. Cost.\n\nSo, I decided I'd try a small, unscientific experiment: The next time I broke out, I would go totally makeup free to see if it expedited the healing process. The results: Honestly, I really couldn't tell the difference. Which led me to the decision that hormonal breakouts are hormonal breakouts, and I may as well use makeup as a sort of mental salve. I reached a compromise with myself: Now, when my skin is going through a moody phase, I more diligently research the ingredients of the cosmetics I use during that time, so I can ensure that they don't contain anything that will make them worse. And after reading articles on what ingredients to include and avoid (namely, parabens, alcohols, and silicones), a bit of at-home trial and error, and some crowdsourcing from my trusted, sensitive-skinned peers, I present to you a collective list of products that never ever make me break out, and never ever make my preexisting breakouts worse.\n\nClinique Acne Solutions Liquid Makeup\n\nAs a blemish-prone but also very dry-skinned girl, I've always been hesitant to try out any foundations that have salicylic acid in them. I figured it would immediately turn my skin into the Sahara Desert and ultimately cause my makeup to look crusty and weird as the day went on. So I was really surprised by how much I liked this product. It's a sheer, light foundation that's not cakey at all and does a nice job of providing some soft coverage while also actively treating blemishes.\n\n$29 at Nordstrom Tarte Double Duty Beauty Shape Tape Contour Concealer\n\nWhile this product doesn't advertise itself as particularly good for breakouts, I honestly don't know where my acne and I would be without this concealer from Tarte. It's dewy and blendable so that blemishes never look dry or crusty, and is also extremely full coverage -- a little goes a long way. I can vouch that this concealer has never ever made me break out or made a blemish worse, and has completely erased zits in emergency situations.\n\n$27 at Ulta Beauty Dermablend Quick Fix Concealer\n\nIf you've found that stick concealers work better for you, look into this quick-fix concealer from Dermablend. This paraben- and fragrance-free concealer is made for those with acne-prone skin who just want to conceal and correct in certain areas. It's full coverage, but it also blends out really easily -- perfect for the no-makeup-makeup-oh-wait-I-have-to-conceal-this-zit girl. This has helped me conceal even the worst of the worst.\n\n$26 at Dermstore Vichy Dermafinish Corrective Fluid Foundation\n\nI saw Lisa Eldridge use this foundation in one of her videos on a more acne-prone client. And, as I often do with products she recommends, I sprinted to buy it. I am so, so glad I bought this product. It's not full coverage, but it's also not one of those no-coverage foundations -- it's nice and buildable and does a great job at canceling out redness while also providing you with nice, even skin and a subtle glow. Again, a little goes a long way, and I like applying it with my fingers first, then using a buffing brush to smooth it into my skin.\n\n$30 at Dermstore Klairs Illuminating Supple Blemish Cream\n\nOne of my friends would not stop raving about this BB cream from Klairs from the moment she tried it out. And I must admit, I've been pretty pleased myself. It does a really great job at canceling out redness, providing the perfect amount of light but effective coverage, while also keeping your skin hydrated. But, and this is a big but, there's only one damn shade of this. Initially, I was hesitant to even write about this product because I find that just so ridiculous, but hopefully saying this on New York Magazine's website will motivate them to take action. Klairs, try harder. Make more shades.\n\n$23 at Amazon $23 at Amazon Dr. Hauschka Translucent Bronzing Tint\n\nA friend of mine was complaining that while she loves throwing on some bronzer before nights out, it typically makes her breakout. I went into a few Reddit and YouTube holes before stumbling across this product -- a buildable liquid bronzing tint from Dr. Hauschka that has witch hazel and anthyllis that actually soothes inflammation. So not only will this not break you out, it's actually preventing breakouts! Mix it with your moisturizer for a more subtle effect or apply straight for a more striking contour.\n\n$45 at Dermstore Dr. Brandt Skincare Pores\n\nI've always been really hesitant to try new primers due to the constant fear that they'll make me break out. I tested this one at a friend's house before going out one night and I was so stoked about the results. This gives the appearance of shrunken-down pores in a way I've never seen before, and also provides a really nice, clean base for makeup. My friend says she sometimes even wears it alone with no makeup on top!\n\n$20 at Amazon $20 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

But, according to Jonathan Swan, chief of staff John Kelly today defended the purchase to reporters as a wise long-term investment:\n\nKelly said $31,000 sounds like a lot of money, but to put it in context he asked a reporter how much they think the chair they're sitting on costs. Kelly said it's probably worth hundreds of dollars but it will last a long time. He rationalized Carson's $31,000 outlay by saying the table could last for 80 or 100 years.\n\nTrump's administration isn't always big on long-term planning when it comes to things like climate change, where the 100-year picture is not exactly foremost on anybody's mind. But at least they're thinking long term about the executive dining needs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Our grandchildren may lose some coastal cities we currently enjoy, but they can rest assured they will never need to fund another dining set for the HUD secretary.",

                "title": "Tammy Baldwin's Reelection Fight in a Hyperpolarized State",
                "body": "At first glance, you might not expect Wisconsin senator Tammy Baldwin to be one of the more endangered of the ten Democratic senators up in 2018 who represent states carried by Donald Trump. After all, Trump carried the state by a whisker, and his approval ratings there have not been great. Nor is she facing some sort of very-well-known, strongly popular GOP opponent.\n\nBut she is running for reelection in America's ground zero for partisan polarization. And her numbers show it. According to the usually very reliable Marquette Law School poll of Wisconsin, her favorability ratio has been meh bordering on not-so-hot for a while: 40/35 a year ago, 38/38 in June of 2017, and 37/39 earlier this month. Compare that to the dominant political figure in her state, two-term Republican governor Scott Walker, and you see the problem: He was at 45/51 a year ago, at 48/47 in June of 2017, and 48/48 today. The state's voters are really divided evenly, and Walker -- who this year faces voters for the fourth time in eight years -- is sucking much of the oxygen out of the room, denying pols like Baldwin much attention (which is probably why so many voters have no opinion of her after five years in the Senate).\n\nIn 2012, Baldwin was famous for her successful effort to become the first openly gay U.S. senator. Now, she's just another Democratic woman in a purple state with bad guys coming after her.\n\nIndeed, according to Dylan Scott, political pros are telling her that she might as well campaign against Walker as much as or more than her actual opponent:\n\n\"You couldn't have two more different people,\" Scot Ross, who leads the progressive group One Wisconsin Now, told me. \"First thing Walker does in the morning is check the polls, stick his finger in the air, and then figure out how to spend our tax dollars based on the first two. Tammy is just totally different. She gets up in the morning and wants to help people. I don't see how you could have a better contrast.\"\n\n[A] Republican strategist noted to me that Walker has never won an election with more than 52 percent of the vote. So while he has managed to bend Wisconsin to his will, there is not an overwhelming Walker coalition -- and the Democratic base is motivated to beat him this year.\n\nThe other reason to make this a straight-on anti-Walker campaign is that his wealthy friends are already hammering Baldwin with negative ads at a pace rarely seen this far out from an election:\n\nBy mid-March, outside conservative groups had already spent $8.5 million in Wisconsin, according to a summary provided to Vox ...\n\nThe money is coming from the usual suspects: groups aligned with the Koch brothers and organizations affiliated with Dick Uihlein, a conservative businessman with longtime Wisconsin ties, plus a little bit from the National Republican Senate Committee, which will surely become more involved once there is an official Republican nominee.\n\nAnd, yes, however much she focuses on Walker and however small the universe of persuadable swing-voters becomes, Baldwin will have to contend with an actual opponent. The main GOP candidates are conservative State Senator Leah Vukmir, a pretty conventional pol tied to Walker, but who might be attractive to some women who would otherwise lean toward Baldwin, and \"outsider\" Kevin Nicholson, an Iraq combat vet and business consultant that one observer called a \"dream candidate.\" The above-mentioned Dick Uihlein is backing Nicholson heavily. The primary, however, isn't until August, which gives Baldwin a lot of time to prepare for whatever happens.\n\nBeyond the Walker race and the primary to identify an opponent for Baldwin, there are two other variables that could affect the Wisconsin landscape significantly. First, there will be a special election for the Supreme Court in early April that is technically nonpartisan, but is actually a grudge-match battle for control of the Court between liberal Rebecca Dallet and conservative Michael Screnock. It will test both parties' financial resources and voter-mobilization infrastructure.\n\nAnd in another Supreme Court, the one in Washington, a decision is expected to come down between now and June in the extremely important cases involving alleged gerrymandering in Wisconsin and Maryland. In 2016, a lower-court panel overturned the 2011 state legislative map engineered by Wisconsin Republicans on the novel grounds that it represented an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Oral arguments at SCOTUS last October were inconclusive, though Democrats are optimistic that Justice Kennedy, and hence a Court majority, might be ready to conclude that there's a workable standard for judging excessive partisanship in redistricting.\n\nEven if SCOTUS rules the Wisconsin map as unconstitutional, it is increasingly unlikely with each passing day that it will force the legislature to redraw it before the 2018 elections. But an adverse ruling for the GOP could have all sorts of ripple effects on Republican politics in the state. And in the present environment, even the beating of a butterfly's wings in Washington could make a big difference in the 2018 elections, including Tammy Baldwin's reelection campaign. She and her people have probably already game-planned it out.",

                "title": "This Kit I've Been Using for a Decade Gave My Brows Purpose",
                "body": "The realization hit me on day one of a semester abroad in Paris: The women here have incredible eyebrows. The allure of the French woman was and remains a tired cliché, but that doesn't make it any less true -- especially when you're a 20-year-old college student who's usually surrounded by people wearing sweatpants to class. Upon my arrival, I decided a lot of that appeal had to do with these bold, sculpted, untweezed eyebrows. It might have been the first cogent thought I had when the jet lag started to wear off.\n\nDetermined to get onboard, I made my way to Le Bon Marché, where a salesperson guided me directly to the Bobbi Brown cosmetics counter and pulled out the Brow Kit. She said it was the best thing they had for eyebrows, and started shading in mine (not sparse, per se, but certainly not dense or shapely) with the tiny angular brush. And then, voilà: my eyebrows graduated from merely existing to framing my face with some purpose. They had the full, brushed look of eyebrows that had never been over-tweezed, grew in perfect density, and had some shape without looking too sculpted. This is due to two things: (1) The diagonal brush is firm, so you can apply the powder in specific strokes and angles, and (2) each kit comes with two shades of brow color that's slightly more ashen than you'd expect, not matching bright color-treated or artificially glossy head hair. But for a blonde or light-ashy brunette, that's what makes the final result look so natural.\n\nAt Le Bon Marché, the price tag on the Brow Kit bit me. The exchange rate was unfavorable to Americans then, and I was a student. But time would reveal that this Brow Kit was no drugstore tube of mascara: It lasts for years. It's been ten years since I bought my first Brow Kit in Paris, and I'm only just starting on my third one. By that math, my Cost Per Application is around three cents per day. And I do use it every day, without fail. These days, I'll swipe a little Glossier Boy Brow over it, just to hold things in place for the day. And as a bonus: The kit -- an all-in-one compact that makes this already-good makeup even better because it's portable -- includes a tiny pair of tweezers that are the best I've ever used, including full-size ones, full stop. I've worried over the last decade that Bobbi Brown might stop making this kit, but am at least reassured that if it goes extinct, I've got four or five years of full and soft eyebrows in the bank.\n\nBobbi Brown Brow Kit $50 at Saks Fifth Avenue Other Strat-Approved Brow Fillers Boy Brow\n\nBoy Brow -- a universal favorite soon after Glossier launched it -- is useful for combing brows and giving them some hold. I pair the brown Boy Brow with the Bobbi Brown kit.\n\n$12 at Glossier M.A.C Eye Brows\n\n\"I love brow pencils. This M.A.C product is super easy to apply and very thin, so it does an excellent job of creating the illusion of individual hairs in patchy areas,\" says brow-styling whiz Robin Evans, who recommended this pencil to Rio Viera-Newton.\n\n$18 at Nordstrom M.A.C Great Brows\n\n\"I have a lot of clients who either have extraordinarily light-pigmented, sparse brows or suffer from hair loss around the brow area. One of the most important things they can do for this is to go into a salon and get their brows tinted -- this provides the illusion of thicker, bolder brows,\" says Mitra Khazeni, of Matthew Preece salon in Santa Monica, who told Viera-Newton about this kit. \"I also like to use powders on these kinds of brows instead of gels or pencils. Gels and pencils can look really intense and fake if the client is suffering from super-sparse brows. Instead, I use powder underneath the brows, which looks way more natural. My favorite is this kit from M.A.C that comes with two kinds of brushes, depending on what part of your brow you're trying to tackle.\"\n\n$30 at Saks Fifth Avenue Laura Mercier Brow Powder Duo\n\nKhazeni also recommended this brow powder to Viera-Newton. The two tones and the ashy shades are reminiscent of the brow kit -- good for people who already have brushes and tweezers they like.\n\n$28 at Saks Fifth Avenue Pure Castor Oil\n\n\"If you have patchy eyebrows, castor oil is amazing for stimulating hair growth. I've seen castor oil seriously help people's eyebrows out,\" Evans told Viera-Newton.\n\n$12 at Amazon $12 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "Ask a transit expert why the MTA is such a disaster, as New York did last summer, and they'll cite some combination of aging technology, crumbling infrastructure, depleted budgets, and, the issue that's gotten the bulk of attention in recently, overcrowding.\n\nBut a new report from The Village Voice adds another reason for the delays and disruptions to the list, one that writer Aaron Gordon calls the \"root cause of the subway system's decay.\" As an anonymous source put it, \"The trains are slower because they slowed the trains down.\"\n\nThe intentional slowing of trains is traced back to a 1995 J train crash that killed the a conductor and injured dozens more. After that, Gordon writes, the MTA hit the brakes. Maximum train speeds were reduced from around 55 mph to 40 mph. Speed limits were also introduced, along with consequences for breaking them. In some cases, if speeds limits aren't met, a train's brakes are automatically tripped. Recovering from that can take one to ten minutes, Gordon writes, and the transgression is noted in a conductor's performance file.\n\nThat affects not just the conductors that have to sit in time-out for going too fast, but those who intentionally go very slow to avoid the punishment. Speed regulations around track work are also more stringent than they used to be, the report notes, requiring trains to move at a glacial speed as they near a work site.\n\nAll of these changes were implemented with safety as the primary focus, the MTA says, but one driver told Gordon that speed and safety aren't mutually exclusive. \"They always act like speed is unsafe, but you can run trains quickly without sacrificing safety if you have competent management,\" he said.",

                "title": "Nancy Pelosi Is Good at Her Job and She Should Keep It.",
                "body": "Ever since Nancy Pelosi ascended to a position of leadership among House Democrats, her standing has been in a state of near-constant peril. Last year, Pelosi's critics within the caucus had granted her a reprieve, promising to delay their next challenge to her leadership until after the midterm elections, with the implicit threat that she would be deposed if Democrats failed to win a majority. \"She's been authorized to provide leadership, good or bad, for the next two years,\" said Representative Steve Lynch of Massachusetts, challenged her after the 2016 failure, last summer. \"I think in fairness we owe her that. We owe her two years.\"\n\nNow Pelosi's critics have renewed their threat to depose her even if Democrats do win the midterms. Axios reports, \"Some well-wired House Democrats predict she will be forced aside after the election and replaced by a younger, less divisive Dem.\"\n\nThe challenge to Pelosi has one good reason behind it, and many bad ones. The good reason is that Republicans have made her their most effective campaign message. Democrats running in red seats have faced ceaseless ads tying them to the dreaded San Francisco Liberal, and victorious candidate Conor Lamb had to disavow her leadership in order to squeak through. That's not a replicable pattern: A handful of the party's most vulnerable candidates might be able to promise not to support her speakership, but Democrats control the chamber without candidates in 218 districts who will vote for Pelosi.\n\nWould a different Democratic leader prove less of a liability? Probably for a while, yes. Republicans have spent years building up Pelosi as a hate figure, and a newer and less familiar Democratic leader would take longer for Republicans to promote as a target of fear and loathing. It's also possible that a Democrat who was either from a less famously progressive locale than San Francisco, or not female, would be less threatening to some socially conservative voters. (The latter point is the most fraught: Do Democrats really want to let irrational fear of powerful women dictate their choice of leaders?) It is true, though, that deposing Pelosi would have at least a temporary messaging benefit in some tough districts this fall.\n\nBut the cost of throwing Pelosi over the side would be high. She has been an extraordinarily effective caucus leader. When Democrats last held the majority, she shepherded into law the most aggressive spate of liberal reforms since the Great Society: an $800 billion fiscal stimulus, health-care reform, Dodd-Frank. The House passed a cap and trade law at a time when bipartisan support for the idea still had some life in the Senate.\n\nIt might seem tempting to dismiss these feats as automatic, the baseline expectation for what a leader can do when her party commands a majority. It is not. During many of these fights, Democrats were wandering off in multiple directions, as Democrats are wont to do. In particular, after Republican Scott Brown won a special election in Massachusetts in January 2010, many if not most Democrats collapsed into despair. Pelosi kept her nerve, talked her party off the ledge, and passed a bill that was signed into law.\n\nIf you want a picture of what the ineffective marshaling of a majority looks like, remember the repeated instances in which John Boehner tried to bring bills to the floor only to suffer humiliating defeats. Having a leader who can figure out which bills can get 218 votes is not something to take for granted.\n\nPelosi's Democratic critics include both the left and right flanks of the party (which is itself a sign that she occupies its center). Attacks on her leadership try to simultaneously attack her as too moderate and too liberal, in an attempt to cobble together both irreconcilable strands. In part to cover up the incoherence of the criticism, the complaint is often expressed in vague generational terms. She is too old, and ought to give way to the new generation. (Whether this new generation will be more moderate or more liberal is a question that can be filled in as one desires.)\n\nYet there is zero sign Pelosi's age has impeded her work. She has not lost her persuasive talents: Pelosi effectively rallied the party to unanimously oppose the Trump tax cuts. If some Democrats had supported the measure, Republicans could have touted its bipartisan nature, which would in turn help reduce its unpopularity. Instead the health care and tax cuts have been a millstone around Republican necks. (Republicans initially tried attacking Conor Lamb for opposing the tax cuts, but abandoned that message, a telling concession in a heavily Republican district.) Last month, Pelosi delivered an eight-hour speech defending the Dreamers, standing the entire time, in heels, without a break, a feat of stamina I could not have matched at any point in my life. It may have been a stunt to display her vitality, but it was a convincing one.\n\nReplacing Pelosi as leader would create the ephemeral benefit of forcing Republicans to rotate in a new cast of villains to star in their attack ads -- MS-13? hippies? antifa? -- until they could build up the name-ID for her successor. It would bring the significant downside of firing an elected official who is extremely good at her extremely important job.",

                "body": "In our advice column, Ask the Strategist, we take your most burning shopping questions and scour friends, call up experts, and draw from personal experience to answer them. As always, please comment with one of your own -- we're here to help.\n\nQuestion: I need good snow or rain boots that aren't ugly. I've been rocking the Cole Haan Chelsea boot that are waterproof, but I need something a little sturdier. Hunter had some nice ones, but they sold out of the good stuff too soon. Know of anything else?\n\nThis question came from a guy, so we decided to find fashionable Seattle Instagram dudes and stalk them until we uncovered their boots of choice.\n\nThat led us to an account called Seattle Gents and to Strath Shepard, creative director at Nordstrom and curator of rare books on photography, art, fashion, and design at Pacific Standard Books. After a deep stalkerish scroll, I found a pair of shoes he's made a habit of photographing over the last year.\n\nAfter asking around and zooming in on logos, I discovered that these are a pair of Red Wings, a century-old shoe company founded in Minnesota. It turns out the ones Shepard's wearing are classic oxford's, not boots, but the pair was actually inspired by Red Wing's work boots and designed for people who might not need the support of a high-top. They're still waterproof.\n\nClassic Oxford $250 at Red Wing Shoes\n\nFor rain boots, though, we'd suggest going all in on the tall boot, what Red Wing calls the \"Classic Moc.\"\n\nRed Wing 'Roughneck' Boot $270 at Nordstrom\n\nThey're also available at Amazon.\n\nRed Wing Heritage Men's Classic Moc 6\" Boot $270 at Amazon $270 at Amazon Red Wing Chukka Boot\n\nThen we did a little poking around what else Nordstrom, and presumably Shepard, is offering in terms of waterproof men's boots. There's the Red Wing chukka boot, which looks like a regular leather boot, but is also waterproof.\n\n$230 at Nordstrom Samuel Hubbard Re-Boot Waterproof Gore-Tex Chukka Boot\n\nAnother chukka, this time by Samuel Hubbard and in black.\n\n$285 at Norstrom Trask 'Andrew Mid' Apron Toe Boot\n\nThere's this Trask, which is pretty similar to the Red Wing. It has a grippy sole and is made in England.\n\nFrom $275 at Nordstrom\n\nNow back to Seattle Gents, that menswear influencer Instagram. These Gents were all mostly dapper and not to be found wearing many rain boots, but I reached out to Endurance Weke, a blogger who goes by @CuratorOfCool and who's featured on Gents. He wrote back with some of his favorite options.\n\nRobert Wayne Thomas Lace-Up Zip Boot\n\n\"Being based in Seattle, the weather is mostly 65 percent rain during the year. With that said, most people wear some type of boots throughout the seasons,\" he wrote. His first choice was a Robert Wayne lace-up. \"On most melancholy, rainy days, this boot is perfect in this weather. The dark-brown color is perfect for those days were you feel like wearing all black, or that grunge vibe. By Thursday most people are already tired of the week, so you can wear this boot and throw on jeans and whatever sweatshirt on top and call it a day.\"\n\n$40 at Nordstrom Rack Kenton Leather Pacer Boots\n\nHis second pair from J.Crew are actually pretty similar to the Red Wing's. \"This boot pays homage to the classic carpenter boot, so of course you know they're durable. I would consider this the starter boot for anyone trying to see how it would look on them and those not really sure what kind of boot they'd go for first.\"\n\n$248 at J.Crew Hunter Men's Original Refined Chelsea Rain Boots $116 (was $155, now 25% off)\n\nAnd lastly, I found a couple of other pairs that I thought worth throwing into the mix. First, these Hunter Chelseas that aren't yet fully sold out.\n\n$116 at Bloomingdale's Saks Fifth Avenue Collection Buckle Rubber Chelsea Boots\n\nAnd a similar, more fashion-y pair by Saks.\n\n$278 at Saks Fifth Avenue GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we'd like to, we can't try everything. Which is why we have People's Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that's four-to-five-star reviews and lots of 'em) products and single out the most convincing. While we've written before about the best walking shoes, heard from Sadie Stein about her favorite travel sandals, and even raved about a certain ultracomfortable, grandma-friendly sandal, here we're breaking down the best sandals for women on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nThe Best Platform Sandals Dream Pairs Women's Greek Platform Wedge Sandals 4 stars, 325 reviews\n\n\"I ordered these sandals after pining over a pair of Eileen Fisher sandals that looked similar but were well beyond my budget. They fit perfectly and were super soft and comfortable. The footbed is like a micro-suede: super soft and cushiony. I love the soft, stretchy ankle straps, they move with me and aren't too tight, plus the straps help keep the sandals on my feet. They have quickly become my everyday go-to sandals. Even my husband said, 'Those are really cute,' and ladies, we all know something's gotta be pretty spectacular to get a compliment on your shoes from your husband of nearly 20 years.\"\n\n$18 at Amazon $18 at Amazon The Best Padded Flip-flop Sandals Sanuk Women's Yoga Sling Flip-flop 4.6 stars, 10,219 reviews\n\n\"Okay, folks, I don't often leave product reviews, but the moment these amazing sandals/flip-flops were placed upon my feet, I swear I could hear my little tootsies SING! I have plantar fasciitis, so I need supportive, cushy footwear. These sandals are perfect! They look dressy enough to wear with a nice summery dress out to dinner, and yet not so stuffy that I couldn't wear them with a pair of shorts and a T-shirt. The 'strap' material is stretchy enough to accommodate moving around and walking, and yet supportive enough to feel like these shoes won't fall off. The cushion is perfectly squishy without being too squishy -- just enough squish to be happy walking in these all day. No, seriously ... ALL DAY.\"\n\nFrom $14 at Amazon $14 at Amazon The Best Adjustable Flip-flop Sandals Clarks Women's Breeze Sea Flip-flops 4.8 stars, 8,130 reviews\n\n\"LOVE THESE FLIP-FLOPS! They are so much more than just your ordinary pair of flip-flops. They are ultracomfortable -- underfoot as well as along the top of the foot. My last pair has lasted me a couple summers now, and they are finally coming apart, so I ordered a new pair to have when the old ones are no longer wearable. I have wide feet and these are perfect for me! But my mom also has these, and she has narrow feet and they work great for her, too. You just have to adjust the straps on top.\"\n\nFrom $18 at Amazon $18 at Amazon The Best Flip-flop Sandals With Arch Support Reef Women's Sandy Sandal 4.2 stars, 3,760 reviews\n\n\"I live on a nine-acre farm in Florida and wear this Reef sandal about 90 percent of the time, pretty much daily. I wear it while mucking out the barn, digging ditches, putting up fences, etc., as well as to the beach. The thick sole has great traction and allows comfortable walking on all surfaces, even sharp rocks. The pretty strap makes it acceptable as a sandal with dresses, too. Given the very heavy use, I tend to wear out and replace this sandal about every year or so. Reef is the best and I would be very reluctant to settle for any other flip-flop in this price range.\"\n\nFrom $16 at Amazon $16 at Amazon The Best Strappy Flip-flop Sandals Teva Women's Olowahu Flip-flop 4.4 stars, 5,682 reviews\n\n\"These are the most comfortable thongs I've worn for years. These Teva flip-flops mold to the length and width of each of your feet. In other words, they customize themselves to each individual foot. I have worn them nonstop since receiving them two or three weeks ago. I like this particular style, Olowahu, because they stay on your feet. They have never slipped off my feet no matter what I'm doing -- up and down stairs, walking fast, driving -- no problems.\"\n\nFrom $11 at Amazon $11 at Amazon The Best Slim Flip-flop Sandals Crocs Women's Sexi Flip Sandals 4.3 stars, 3,518 reviews\n\n\"These are, hands down, the greatest sandals I've ever worn. I have wide feet with high arches and I get plantar fasciitis sometimes, so it's really important for me to wear shoes with cushion and support. I remember when I first discovered these shoes: I asked my mommy friend if she was going to be okay carrying her baby all day with those sandals, and she explained that she can do anything in them. Well, I was converted by that statement and had to try a pair. I wear these shoes with dresses for going out because they look expensive, to the beach, for low-impact exercise, in the yard with my dogs and toddler, and all day almost every day with no problems. I get so many compliments!\"\n\nFrom $19 at Amazon $19 at Amazon The Best Sandals With Cork Soles Birkenstock Women's Mayari Sandal 4.5 stars, 4,375 reviews\n\n\"If I could, I'd spend my summer in flip-flops, but that won't fly at work. Instead, after talking to my cousin, who just so happens to be a podiatrist, I decided to invest in my first pair of Birkenstocks. They took a little breaking in, but they have fantastic support, especially in the arch of my foot, and they just seem to get better as I wear them. The style is very nice -- comfortable enough for weekends, but nice enough to wear in my casual office -- and I'm sure I'll get years of use out of them. I would definitely recommend these sandals to anyone.\"\n\nFrom $90 at Amazon $90 at Amazon The Best Ankle-Strap Sandals Teva Women's Original Universal Sandal 4.4 stars, 1,469 reviews\n\n\"For a summer of light activities in Europe, the Original Universals were great. I wanted to have sandals that were comfy but could also be worn with a casual skirt, and in the university for lab work without looking like I was in my 'field clothes,' but also for some moderate hikes on the weekends. I wore them for the one-mile walk to the institute every day, and even if it rained they didn't look trashed. They looked reasonably respectable in the lab, and for social occasions I could pair them with a casual skirt and top without looking like I had Serious Clunker Footwear. Weekends I could wear them for half-day hikes with gentle slopes in perfect comfort.\"\n\nFrom $17 at Amazon $17 at Amazon The Best Slide Sandals Crocs Unisex Classic Slide Sandal 4.2 stars, 243 reviews\n\n\"I bought these after my sprained ankle was well into recovery, and I wanted a sandal that is flat and stable. These fit the bill and more. They are so very comfortable. They don't pinch my toes, my feet don't slide in them, I don't have to grip with my toes, and the sole is a bit 'spongy,' so they would be great for walking on concrete. Perfectly stable, and don't 'slap' as much as my Crocs flip-flops do, so they are quiet-ish.\"\n\n$10 at Amazon $10 at Amazon The Best Wedge-Heel Sandals Clarks Women's Eirwyn Wedge Sandal 4.3 stars, 478 reviews\n\n\"In a word: amazing. These shoes are like walking on clouds. The straps and sole just feel super plush and soft; no slipping, no rubbing, and you really don't feel like you're walking in heels at all. I really think I'll need three more pairs. For note, I have size-ten feet with narrow to average width and they fit perfectly. There's an adjustable heel strap, but I didn't need to use it. Worth the price. Perfect summer shoes for any occasion. I'm using these babies for a wedding.\"\n\nFrom $28 at Amazon $28 at Amazon Best Pool Sandals Vertico Shower and Pool Sandal 4.3 stars, 1,789 reviews\n\n\"I have to say, this product really shocked me. Originally, I just wanted shower sandals for around the house. Very comfortable fit, and I find myself wearing them outside as well. Hard to believe for the price. I have spent $40 to $50 for sandals that are not nearly as comfortable as these.\"\n\nFrom $13 at Amazon $13 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

This seems to have been the case with CIA deputy director -- and now the president's choice to succeed Mike Pompeo as director -- Gina Haspel.\n\nWhen Haspel was first appointed deputy director -- a position that does not require Senate confirmation -- in early 2017, it was widely reported that she supervised a CIA \"black site\" in Thailand beginning in 2002 where two highly controversial interrogations took place, the most notorious being that of Abu Zubaydah. He was a man whose intelligence value was never clearly established. But he was permanently damaged (and nearly killed) by interrogations in Thailand that included 83 waterboardings, and later tortured some more at a second black site in Poland (for which Poland was ultimately fined by the European Court of Human Rights). Haspel was also charged with responsibility for a second interrogation that involved much less serious waterboarding, and then for either recommending or actually carrying out the destruction of tapes of both interrogations.\n\nAll these alleged acts were troubling and borderline-illegal and contributed to the closure of the black sites by President Obama in 2009 and the establishment of new restrictions on torture by Congress in 2015. But it was the Zubaydah interrogation that became the center-piece of a national debate on torture. And it now appears that claims of Haspel's responsibility for torturing Zubaydah, based on heavily redacted material from the CIA, much of it conveyed to the public in a 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report, may have been erroneous.\n\nYesterday ProPublica issued a correction of its 2017 report on Haspel and the Thailand black site:\n\nOn Feb. 22, 2017, ProPublica published a story that inaccurately described Gina Haspel's role in the treatment of Abu Zubaydah, a suspected al-Qaida leader who was imprisoned by the CIA at a secret \"black site\" in Thailand in 2002.\n\nThe story said that Haspel, a career CIA officer who President Trump has nominated to be the next director of central intelligence, oversaw the clandestine base where Zubaydah was subjected to waterboarding and other coercive interrogation methods that are widely seen as torture. The story also said she mocked the prisoner's suffering in a private conversation. Neither of these assertions is correct and we retract them. It is now clear that Haspel did not take charge of the base until after the interrogation of Zubaydah ended.\n\nInterestingly enough, the New York Times reached the same conclusion in a report earlier this week that was largely overlooked:\n\nMs. Haspel arrived to run the prison in late October 2002, after the harsh interrogation of Mr. Zubaydah, a former senior C.I.A. official said. In mid-November, another Qaeda suspect, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri arrived. Mr. Nashiri, accused of bombing the U.S.S. Cole, was the man who was waterboarded three times.\n\nAnd so, in ProPublica's summary of where we stand now, the charges against Haspel have shrunk but hardly disappeared:\n\nThe February 2017 ProPublica story did accurately report that Haspel later rose to a senior position at CIA headquarters, where she pushed her bosses to destroy the tapes of Zubaydah's waterboarding. Her direct boss, the head of the agency's Counterterrorism Center, ultimately signed the order to feed the 92 tapes into a shredder. Her actions in that instance, and in the waterboarding of al-Nashiri, are likely to be the focus of questions at her confirmation hearings.\n\nBecause of the lurid nature of the Zubaydah interrogation, and particularly the hints we've gotten that whoever was in charge of the black site at the time was personally involved, a lot of the thunder and lightning about Haspel has involved that particular case. Now conservative media outlets are drawing attention to the ProPublica retraction of its earlier story as a big setback for her opponents.\n\nHad Haspel not (allegedly) participated in the destruction of the most compelling evidence about the torture of Zubaydah, of course, she would have not been accused of being involved in it in the first place. So she doesn't exactly come to the table for discussion of that mistaken charge with clean hands. And the CIA itself could make Haspel's confirmation hearings a lot easier by declassifying more of the relevant information.\n\nThe other big question is whether Donald Trump appointed Haspel as CIA Director precisely because he wants a renewed debate over torture, which he seems to favor even more avidly than the Bush administration officials with ultimate responsibility for the CIA black sites. Perhaps he will even be disappointed if it transpires that Gina Haspel wasn't quite the avid torturer she was alleged to have been in earlier reports. But there remains enough issues with her record to sustain a robust confirmation hearing.",

                "title": "The Best French-Press Coffee Makers in Every Material",
                "body": "Here's a little secret about French-press coffee makers: They all basically work the same. You add the coffee grounds, you pour in hot water from your kettle, you stir, you cover and wait about four minutes, you plunge, and then you pour into a mug and enjoy. And unlike drip coffee makers, which will only make coffee as good as the machine, the quality of coffee you get from a French press relies pretty heavily on your skill and process, as well as the quality of beans that you're using. That's why it can be hard to tell if coffee was made in a French press that costs $10 or $100, just by sipping it.\n\nHowever, this is a case where material matters, and French presses made of certain materials are better for different types of coffee drinkers, even if all of these coffee machines function in basically the same way. So to help you figure out which French press is best for you and your caffeine habit, we took a deep dive into the most common types of French presses available and broke down the pros and cons of each material, along with some archetypal examples that you can buy.\n\nGlass French-Press Coffee Makers\n\nWhen you picture a French press, you're probably picturing something with metal scaffolding and a glass carafe. That's the standard style of French press, and as such, is often the least expensive and most readily available. This is why a glass French press is a solid choice for beginners, or anyone who doesn't want to spend too much money on a coffee maker.\n\nThe most obvious downside is that the glass can break easily, but bigger brands like Bodum also sell replacement carafes for their French presses in case of such an accident. But glass is easy to clean, and some of these carafes are even dishwasher-safe. Plus, the actual French presses come in a variety of colorful, or not-so-colorful, designs, depending on your preference.\n\nHowever, if you like to drink your coffee over the course of a couple of hours, glass might not be the best choice, even if it's the easiest. This material isn't the best insulator, so coffee made in these is best enjoyed as soon after making as possible, especially if you like your brew hot.\n\nMr. Coffee 4-Cup Coffee Press in Black\n\nFor only $10, this simple, no-frills four-cup French press is a good option for beginners or those who aren't entirely sure they're into this style of coffee.\n\n$10 at Bed Bath and Beyond BonJour Monet 3-Cup French Press\n\nThis classically-styled French press, with silver accents and glass carafe, comes in three sizes. The smallest, a three-cup, is ideal for people who mainly make coffee for one.\n\n$30 at Bed Bath and Beyond Bialetti Preziosa 11.83 oz. French Press\n\nA stainless-steel-and-glass French press from the Italian espresso company Bialetti.\n\n$28 at Bed Bath and Beyond Bodum 'Chambord Classic' French Press\n\nThis classic style of eight-cup French press has a modern copper finish.\n\n$50 at Nordstrom Grosche Madrid 8-Cup French Press\n\nYou could try this minimalist, metal French press from Canadian coffee company Grosche.\n\n$40 at Bed Bath and Beyond Bodum 'Eileen' 8-Cup French Press, Gold\n\nOr this maximalist metal one, from Bodum.\n\n$50 at Nordstrom Grosche Zurich 8-Cup French Press in Orange\n\nFrench presses can be colorful, too -- like this bright-orange one.\n\n$20 at Bed Bath and Beyond Grosche Melbourne 8-Cup Bamboo and Cork French Press\n\nGrosche also makes a French press with a glass body and wooden detailing, for those with a more organic sensibility.\n\n$40 at Bed Bath and Beyond Plastic French-Press Coffee Makers\n\nThe main advantage of having a plastic French press is that it's harder to break than a glass one, yet much cheaper than a stoneware or metal one (but more on those in a bit). It's also a great French press for camping or anywhere you can't bring glass. The flavor of the coffee really shouldn't be affected if you're using BPA-plastic versus glass, just be sure that the plunger itself is made of stainless steel.\n\nOXO Good Grips 8-Cup French Press Coffee Maker in Clear\n\nThe interior pitcher of this OXO French press is glass, but it's double-walled and insulated with clear plastic (which also means the inside glass is harder to shatter, even if it drops).\n\n$50 at Bed Bath and Beyond BonJour Ami-Matin 8-Cup Unbreakable French Press\n\nIf you're still worried about accidents, this French press has both plastic casing and an unbreakable plastic carafe.\n\n$25 at Bed Bath and Beyond Stoneware and Ceramic French-Press Coffee Makers\n\nFrench presses made of stoneware or ceramic are often the most expensive, but they're also, in many ways, the most showstopping, ideal centerpieces for weekend brunches when you're trying to impress friends or family. That doesn't mean the material's not practical. Much like a cast-iron skillet or a Dutch oven, these stone and ceramic French presses retain heat very well, making them ideal for leisurely mornings, when you're not in the mood to slurp up an entire French press's worth of coffee in one go. Stoneware and ceramic, however, must be cleaned by hand.\n\nLe Creuset 12 oz. Petite French Press Coffee Maker in Marseille\n\nA single-serving stoneware French press that's the perfect morning companion for someone who takes their time.\n\n$50 at Bed Bath and Beyond Yield Design Ceramic French Press\n\nThis white ceramic French press has a copper plunger and is big enough to hold over 28 ounces of coffee and keep it warm until the last drop.\n\n$120 at Goop Metal French-Press Coffee Makers\n\nMetal French-press coffee makers are, in many ways, the most versatile. Like ceramic or stoneware coffee makers, metal French presses are also ideal for entertaining, handsome enough to put out as part of a fancy brunch spread. Though metal isn't known for retaining heat, these are often well-insulated with double walls, meaning your fresh coffee will stay hot for a while. A lot of metal French presses are also dishwasher-safe, and the chances of breaking one are slim to none. The trade-off is that metal French presses are often quite expensive, so you'll be paying if you want this kind of versatility.\n\nFrieling 23 oz. Insulated Stainless Steel French Press in Brushed Finish\n\nEverything on this French press is made from matching stainless steel, including the outer handle and the plunger you use to make the coffee.\n\n$85 at Bed Bath and Beyond La Cafetiere Thermique 8-Cup French Press\n\nThis more oblong-shaped stainless-steel French press almost looks like a space-age teapot.\n\n$70 at Bed Bath and Beyond KitchenAid Precision Press Coffee Maker\n\nThis French-press coffee maker from KitchenAid is a little more high-tech than a traditional French press, since it has a built-in scale and timer to help you keep track of your brew. But from the outside, it looks like just another metal coffee maker.\n\n$130 at Bed Bath and Beyond Travel French-Press Coffee Makers\n\nA more nontraditional category of French presses is the travel French press. The idea is that you can brew your coffee and drink it with the same vessel. This is great if you're just making coffee for yourself, or you want to be able to make coffee at work, or you're often on the road. But if you're looking for something more versatile that can make more than one serving of coffee at a time or will look handsome on your counter, go with any of the other options.\n\nPlanetary Design Desk Press 20 oz. French Press Travel Mug\n\nThis travel mug has a plunger built-in, so you can make coffee (or tea, using loose tea leaves) on the go or at your desk without creating a huge mess.\n\n$30 at Bed Bath and Beyond Cafflano Kompact Portable Coffee Press\n\nThis French press is designed for travel, and it collapses down into a small, plastic disc. To use, simply pull apart, then add grounds and water.\n\n$65 at Bed Bath and Beyond GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "body": "Last week, I went on a trip to Copenhagen and there was only one store my newly local host wanted me to see: Ganni. First founded in 2009, the womenswear brand led by Ditte Reffstrup hit a stride last year when a good chunk of women in fashion realized that its girly patterns and just-right loose fits were a perfect antidote to obsessive branding and logo overloads. These women started calling themselves #GanniGirls. It was like Gucci, but less obvious. Céline, but cheaper. Street style, but not trying hard. Over in Denmark, it's got a cult status akin to our Mansur Gavriel (and their store designs kind of look alike, too), while being almost as accessible as Cos. It just carries that ineffable Nordic cool. So I've been obsessing ever since and managed to find a bunch of pieces from a few different seasons all on sale right now, some for as much as 70 percent off.

It was the second major revelation Friday morning by Michael Avenatti, who previously told CNN that six other women have approached him with stories about Trump similar to his client's.\n\nDuring the Morning Joe interview, which Avenatti used to tease Daniels's March 25 interview on 60 Minutes, he said, \"There's the act and there's the coverup and the American people are going to learn about both in the interview and beyond.\"\n\n\"Was she threatened in any way?\" host Mika Brzezinski asked. \"Yes,\" Avenatti said.\n\n\"Was she threatened physical harm?\" Brzezinski asked. \"Yes,\" Avenatti said.

                "title": "Trump Push to Purge Disloyal Civil Servants May Be Underway",
                "body": "Has the State Department been subjected to an ideological purge under the auspices of President Donald Trump? Inquiring House Democrats want to know.\n\nIn a letter sent to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan on Thursday, Representatives Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrats on the House oversight and foreign affairs committees, are demanding an explanation after receiving \"disturbing new documents\" from a whistleblower indicating that senior political appointees at State worked to push out or demote career diplomats deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump and his agenda, with the assistance of right-wing activists and White House officials.\n\nThe documents, also obtained by Politico, consist of a series of emails between State Department and White House officials, as well as outside parties including former House speaker Newt Gingrich, conservative activist Barbara Ledeen, and the neoconservative ideologue David Wurmser, a former adviser to vice president Dick Cheney and U.N. ambassador John Bolton.\n\nThe congressmen express particular concern over the reassignment of Iran expert Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, a career civil servant who had been the subject of a malicious article at the little-read Conservative Review last March saying she had \"burrowed into the government\" under Trump, calling her an architect of the Iran nuclear deal who had misled the public about it, and insinuating that she had ties to the regime in Tehran, owing to an internship she took in college with the National Iranian American Council.\n\nNowrouzzadeh, who joined the Civil Service in 2005 during the Bush administration and later served on President Barack Obama's National Security Council, was indeed a key figure in crafting the Iran deal. So were many other people at the NSC and State, but not all of them had the misfortune of an obviously Iranian surname, which is what put Nowrouzzadeh on right-wing media's radar in the first place.\n\nThe Conservative Review hit piece made its way through the inboxes of the aforementioned activists: Wurmser forwarded it to Gingrich with the note \"I think a little cleaning is in order here\"; Gingrich then forwarded that message to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin.\n\nNowrouzzadeh had been detailed to the secretary of state's Policy Planning Staff in July 2016, where she worked on issues related to Iran and Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region -- an assignment meant to last one year. Nowrouzzadeh contacted the head of the policy team, Brian Hook, asking for his help in correcting the record after being smeared.\n\nInstead, according to Cummings' and Engel's letter, \"Hook forwarded her email to other political appointees at the Department, who then forwarded it to officials at the White House and used it as a basis for a wide-ranging internal discussion that questioned her loyalty to President Trump.\" In the course of those discussions, White House Liaison Julia Haller falsely stated that Nowrouzzadeh was born in Iran (in fact, she was born in Connecticut).\n\nIn April, a month after the Conservative Review piece landed, her detail was cut short by three months and she was reassigned to her previous post at the Office of Iranian Affairs -- to which she objected, saying her assignment had not been completed as the senior officials claimed and that the curtailment was not carried out according to the terms of her memorandum of understanding.\n\nNowrouzzadeh was the second \"Obama holdover\" to be abruptly reassigned after coming under attack in the right-wing press, Politico reported at the time; Andrew Quinn, a member of the National Economic Council who had helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, had just been sent back to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative after being attacked for his \"globalist\" views by Breitbart News.\n\nNowrouzzadeh was by no means the only career staffer at State targeted for a Trumpist inquisition: Politico adds that Hook emailed himself a list of potentially disloyal staffers last April, referring to one as a \"leaker and troublemaker\" and to another as a \"turncoat.\" In one of the emails, Breitbart staffer Joel Pollak offers to give Tillerson aide Matt Mowers \"additional background\" on \"Obama holdovers.\" Hook's deputy, Edward Lacey, referred to several of the career public servants on the Policy Planning Staff as \"Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump's foreign policy agenda.\"\n\nThese new revelations strongly suggest that the exodus of career talent from the State Department over which Tillerson presided was no mere side effect of his mismanagement, but in some cases a deliberate effort by Trump's political appointees within the department to remove or marginalize employees they saw as disloyal or ideologically unfit.\n\nNothing about this story comes as a surprise, given Trump's marked disdain for diplomacy, foreign aid, and American engagement in global affairs generally, as well as the Bannonite principles of anti-intellectualism, anti-globalism, and obsession with dismantling the \"administrative state\" that underpin his administration ideologically. Purging undesirables and politicizing elements of the government that are designed to resist partisanship are fairly textbook moves for any nationalist government, after all, and what agency could be more crawling with globalists than the State Department?\n\nOf course Trump has presided over a personnel crisis in a department whose work he holds in contempt. Transparently politically motivated staffing decisions like what befell Nowrouzzadeh have an impact beyond the employers directly affected: How many other career diplomats and civil servants, one must wonder, have opted to quit their jobs or take early retirement after seeing their colleagues dismissed, demoted, or reassigned for no reason other than their assumed political loyalties?\n\nUnder federal law, career civil servants can't be fired without cause or for political reasons. When Trump called on Congress to curtail civil service protections and make it easier for him to fire federal employees during his State of the Union address in January, some of us feared that he was looking to legalize these politically motivated dismissals. In light of the latest revelations from the State Department, these fears look increasingly well-founded.",

                "title": "A Guide to Which Trump Staffer Is Getting Fired Next",
                "body": "With many political watchers wondering who President Trump will fire next, the comparisons between The Apprentice and the White House have perhaps never been more apt. The past ten days have seen the departure of both chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Trump keeps teasing that we should stay tuned for more dramatic exits - even as he pushes back on reports that his administration has devolved into even more chaos than usual.\n\n\"There will always be change,\" Trump told reporters on Thursday. \"And I think you want to see change. I want to also see different ideas.\"\n\nH.R. McMaster's expected firing generated the biggest headlines on Thursday evening, but the national security adviser is just one of many Trump officials said to be on the chopping block. Here's a look at all the rumors, for anyone who wants to follow the Trump staffers' lead and start placing bets.\n\nWho: National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster\n\nHow He Angered Trump: \"The president has complained that McMaster is too rigid and that his briefings go on too long and seem irrelevant,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nWill He Be Fired? It's just a question of when. Per the Wall Street Journal: \"The timing of a departure was unclear, with one official saying it could happen 'imminently' and another saying it could be weeks, even months.\"\n\nThe Evidence: McMaster was brought on to replace Michael Flynn, who Trump reportedly regretted firing, and he never gelled with the no-nonsense general. Rumors of McMaster's ouster have persisted for months, possibly fueled by a right-wing smear campaign stemming from his decision to boot Steve Bannon from the National Security Council.\n\nThe Post reported on Thursday that Trump has made up his mind and is talking to potential McMaster replacements - but his firing may be delayed until the White house can arrange a non-humiliating exit. In the wake of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson being fired via tweet, they are said to be \"eager to show that someone can serve in the Trump administration without suffering severe damage to their reputation.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied the story, though the phrasing of her tweet does not preclude changes at the NSC as soon as tomorrow. Post journalists are standing by the report, and many other outlets say McMaster is a goner.\n\nPossible Replacement: One frontrunner is John Bolton, the ultra-hawkish former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He's a Fox News regular, and Trump likes that he's good on TV.\n\nAnother possible candidate is Keith Kellogg, the chief of staff of the National Security Council. Per the Post, \"Kellogg travels with Trump on many domestic trips, in part because the president likes his company and thinks he is fun.\"\n\nWho: Chief of Staff John Kelly\n\nHow He Angered Trump: He botched the White House response to the Rob Porter domestic abuse scandal, then tried to recover by cracking down on interim security clearances. Jared Kushner lost his top secret status, which reportedly enraged Trump's older children. The New York Times reports that Kelly \"angered the president by privately saying 'no' to the boss too often\"; specifically, Trump is annoyed that Kelly prevented him from implementing tariffs and firing Tillerson for so long.\n\nWill He Be Fired? Eventually? Yes. Soon? It's unclear.\n\nThe Evidence: It seemed Kelly might be safe after he survived the initial wave of bipartisan calls for his ouster, but several reports on McMasters's imminent exit mention that he's on thin ice as well. Some officials claim Kelly isn't going anywhere, and he and Trump laughed about the latest round of rumors.\n\nPossible Replacement: Mick Mulvaney, though presumably he'd have to give up the two full-time jobs he currently holds: director of the Office of Management and Budget and head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nWho: Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin\n\nHow He Angered Trump: Shulkin is the Trump administration's lone Obama holdover. That wasn't initially an issue, according to CNN, but then he started feuding with Trump appointees about how far to go in privatizing the VA health care system. Also, last month an inspector general report blamed him and top VA aides for spending much of a 10-day European trip sightseeing, then misleading ethics officials. Shulkin apologized and reimbursed taxpayers for his wife's travel expenses.\n\nWill He Be Fired? It's highly likely.\n\nThe Evidence: Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested Shulkin doesn't have the full support of the White House at Thursday's press briefing.\n\n\"The president has a large number of individuals that are working hard to make sure that the VA is helping veterans at the best level possible,\" she said. \"We are continuing to review if there are anything that we can do to improve on that system. And if we make changes, we will let you know.\"\n\nPossible Replacement: Trump was reportedly considering moving Rick Perry into the VA post, but on Thursday the Energy secretary shot down that idea, saying he's a \"happy man,\" and has already \"got the perfect job.\"\n\nWho: Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson\n\nHow He Angered Trump: Generating embarrassing reports about plans for an extravagant office redecoration, including a $31,000 dining set. There are allegations that Carson and his wife lied about their roles in the redecoration process, and a former top HUD official claims she was demoted for challenging their lavish spending.\n\nWill He Be Fired? Maybe.\n\nThe Evidence: The White House reportedly held private meetings with four Cabinet officials to scold them about ethics scandals, including Shulkin, Carson, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. Trump is said to be increasingly frustrated with Carson and other \"deadweight\" Cabinet members, and is considering a purge.\n\nWho: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\n\nHow He Angered Trump: Combine Shulkin's extravagant travel and Carson's office remodel and you have the Zinke ethics sandal.\n\nWill He Be Fired? If the purge happens, he'll probably be part of it.\n\nThe Evidence: On top of attracting negative press with alleged ethics violations, Zinke may have lied to White House officials when summoned for his scolding. CNN reports that during the meeting Zinke was asked if there were any other potential issues, and he failed to mention a forthcoming report on his misuse of travel privileges, which quoted a department spokesperson.\n\nWho: Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt\n\nHow He Angered Trump: Pruitt generated the same ethical issues as the other Cabinet members, but did it with more flair: he had a $43,000 sound-proof office phone booth installed in his office, and argued that he needs to fly first class due to \"unpleasant interactions with other travelers\" in coach. Plus, he's let it be known that if Trump fires Jeff Sessions, he wants to be attorney general.\n\nWill He Be Fired? It may depend on whether he can focus on his own job, instead of the attorney general's.\n\nThe Evidence: The Post reports that White House officials have \"grown agitated\" at Pruitt's campaigning for Sessions's job, and \"on Wednesday night, Kelly called Pruitt and told him the president was happy with his performance at EPA and that he did not need to worry about the Justice Department.\"\n\nWho: Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nHow He Angered Trump: Respecting the U.S. justice system enough to recuse himself from the FBI's Russia probe, which indirectly led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nWill He Be Fired? Almost certainly.\n\nThe Evidence: Trump has been attacking Sessions publicly and privately for months, and the AG reportedly offered to resign several times. Sessions has been a bit more defiant of late, and that combined with Trump's willingness to ignore his advisers and fire Tillerson has raised fears that the Saturday Night Massacre 2.0 (or maybe 3.0) is imminent.\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley, who would oversee the confirmation process for a new attorney general, was alarmed enough on Thursday that he told the Wall Street Journal he \"would not be comfortable\" if Trump fired Sessions. (That's what passes for pushback from a GOP lawmaker these days.)\n\nWho: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nHow She Angered Trump: Being unable to answer basic questions about the nation's schools during an interview with 60 Minutes, and urging Trump not to curse in an NBC News interview.\n\nWill She Be Fired? Sure, if you're getting rid of half your Cabinet, why not fire her too?\n\nThe Evidence: Kelly was reportedly frustrated by DeVos's lack of preparation for the interviews, and other Trump advisers mocked her privately. Though she was just appointed to chair a federal commission on school safety, Sanders downplayed her role this week, saying \"I think that the president is going to be the lead on school safety when it comes to this administration.\"\n\nWho: Senior Advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump\n\nHow They Angered Trump: At one point Kushner was supposed to singlehandedly take on many of the toughest issues facing the White House, but instead he's only generated one business or Russia-related scandal after another. Trump is said to view him as a liability, though he veers between being annoyed at Kushner and sorry that his daughter and son-in-law are media targets.\n\nWill They Be Fired? As White House advisers, probably, as family members, no.\n\nThe Evidence: Jared and Ivanka are said to be feuding with Kelly, and last week the Times reported that Trump may be siding with his chief of staff (though he sounds undecided):\n\nYet aides also noted that Mr. Trump has told the couple that they should keep serving in their roles, even as he has privately asked Mr. Kelly for his help in moving them out.\n\nVanity Fair's Gabriel Sherman reported that Jared and Ivanka are headed for the door, but will hang on for as long as possible to avoid talk of Kelly pushing them out:\n\nOne scenario being discussed is that Kushner would return to New York to oversee Trump's 2020 re-election campaign with his ally Brad Parscale, who was hand-selected by the Trump family. One Trump friend referred to it as a \"soft landing.\" Ivanka will likely stay on longer, perhaps through the summer, before decamping home to New York to enroll the children in a Manhattan private school.\n\nPotential Replacements: Both are expected to remain in close contact with Trump after leaving the White House, as he values outside input. If that doesn't work out, Tiffany should graduate from Georgetown Law in 2020.",

                "body": "Congressman Dan Lipinski is a Democrat from Barack Obama's hometown of Chicago, yet he failed to support the former president on such key initiatives as the Affordable Care Act - and even on his reelection bid in 2012. Understandably, this left Chicago-based aides and supporters of the 44th president highly irritated.\n\nSo just a few days before a primary in which Lipinski is in serious danger of losing to challenger Marie Newman, these Obama vets found an opening to remind Democrats of the incumbent's treachery. Politico has the story:\n\nA campaign mailer from a super PAC backing Lipinski gave the group the opportunity to pile on Lipinski at the worst possible moment. The mail piece featured a photo of the former president on one side, and the words \"Known for Leading.\" The flip side offered a picture of Democratic opponent Marie Newman under the headline, \"Known for Misleading.\"\n\nSo they got together at a former office of Obama strategist David Axelrod - \"the very place they said Michelle and Barack Obama made their decision to launch a 2008 presidential bid\" - and held a press conference to blast Lipinski for hypocrisy.\n\nThe group recounted the difficulties of corralling enough votes to pass the Affordable Care Act eight years ago -- and lamented that Lipinski was the only Illinois Democrat to vote against it.\n\nOrganizing for Action National Finance Committee member John Atkinson recalled watching the roll call vote in 2010 with \"tears streaming down my face,\" from the pride he felt in the moment the landmark health care act passed....\n\n\"I was stunned to watch Dan Lipinski vote to deny 20 million Americans the very coverage that he and I both enjoyed, while defying a president and members of Congress who put their careers on the line to pass this health care reform in this country,\" Atkinson said. \"We will not allow Dan Lipinski's hypocrisy to stand.\n\nLipinski's campaign complained that it had nothing to do with the flier that used the former president's image, and also claimed the congressman had voted for Obama's reelection. But it's kinda like Lipinski's protestation that while he voted against Obamacare because of its abortion provisions, he later voted against repealing it. It's too little and too late.\n\nMeanwhile, as Politico put it, Obama loyalists engaged in some \"Chicago-style payback.\" Perhaps a better phrase would be \"rough justice.\"",

                "title": "GOP Senators Call for New Special Counsel to Investigate FBI",
                "body": "For months now, congressional Republicans have been trying to discredit the federal investigation into Donald Trump's campaign by investigating the investigators. Specifically, right-wing lawmakers have presented the fact that Hillary Clinton's campaign funded research into Trump by former British spy Christopher Steele -- and that Steele later shared said research with the FBI -- as evidence that the entire Russia investigation might be built on Clintonian lies.\n\nThis line of argument appeared to reach its apogee last month, when House Intelligence chair Devin Nunes released his much-hyped memo. That document purported to demonstrate that the FBI had used Steele's research to obtain a surveillance warrant of Trump aide Carter Page, one month before 2016 election, without disclosing the political motivations behind Steele's project to the relevant authorities. But the memo did not actually demonstrate anything of the kind. And Nunes's insinuations were later proven to be false.\n\nNevertheless, the GOP persisted. And on Thursday, while Robert Mueller hit the Trump Organization with subpoenas, four Republican senators called on the Justice Department to appoint a second special prosecutor to investigate the FBI's relationship with Steele. As Politico reports:\n\nThe Judiciary panel's chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), was joined by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) in requesting that DOJ name a special prosecutor to zero in on possible mishandling of the FBI's Russia investigation prior to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Specifically, the quartet raised concerns about the FBI's relationship with Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier of verified and unverified intelligence alleging a Russian effort to compromise now-President Donald Trump.\n\n...The Republican senators noted in their Thursday letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that under current law, \"the Inspector General does not have the tools that a prosecutor would to gather all the facts, such as the ability to obtain testimony from essential witnesses who are not current DOJ employees.\n\nNow, who knows -- maybe there was some as-yet-unrevealed impropriety in the FBI's relationship with Christopher Steele, and/or the agency's use of his research. But considering the fact that a highly motivated House Intelligence Committee was unable to come up with anything approaching evidence of such malfeasance -- and the reality that the federal government has limited investigatory resources -- it is hard to understand how the attorney general could possibly justify approving the senators' proposal to the public. (Although, it's fairly easy to see how he might justify doing so to himself).",

                "title": "Trump Opioids Plan Includes Good Ideas, Killing Drug Dealers",
                "body": "The Trump administration finally has an ambitious, detailed plan for combating the opioid epidemic, one that includes some evidence-based reforms that public-health experts have been recommending for years -- and, also, the death penalty for low-level drug dealers. Or, at least, so Politico's summary of the yet-to-be-finalized plan suggests.\n\nRarely, if ever, has a policy proposal been this simultaneously encouraging and horrifying. To this point in his presidency, Donald Trump has displayed so much callous indifference to the opioid crisis, it was far from certain that he'd ever produce any remotely serious blueprint for combating it. Last year, Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public-health emergency -- and then declined to call for any new funding to mitigate it, even as his administration encouraged Congress to slash $1 trillion from Medicaid (which funds addiction treatment for low-income Americans) and to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit for tax cuts. Since then, the White House has (ostensibly) ignored the recommendations of its opioids commission, and put Kellyanne Conway -- a career pollster with no experience in public health -- in charge of coordinating the administration's policy response to a drug-overdose epidemic.\n\nGiven this track record, the fact that Trump's plan (reportedly) includes the following sound, serious measures is pleasantly surprising.\n\nProviding Medicaid enrollees with easier access to in-patient addiction treatment.\n\nA half-century ago, amid the backlash to the mass institutionalization of the mentally ill, Congress passed a rule barring Medicaid from funding residential addiction treatment at large facilities. Some states have already received federal waivers exempting them from this prohibition. But the law remains in force throughout most of the country, and prevents many low-income opioid addicts from accessing treatment. Repealing it might seem like a no-brainer, but precisely because doing so would expand access to treatment, the reform would cost the government billions of dollars -- and, to this point, the administration has been reluctant to increase federal spending on health care merely because 60,000 Americans are now dying of drug overdoses each year.\n\nRaising standards for opioid prescriptions that are reimbursed by federal programs.\n\nThe White House plan would reportedly make Medicare and Medicaid more selective about the kinds of opioids prescriptions they're willing to fund. According to Politico, the plan would require \"75 percent of opioid prescriptions reimbursed by government health programs like Medicare and Medicaid to be issued by using 'best practices' within three years. That would be scaled up to 95 percent of prescriptions in five years.\" Given the paucity of evidence demonstrating that opioids are an effective treatment for chronic pain, there is some rational basis for discouraging their use. That said, this particular approach is opposed by many physicians, including eight who participated in drafting the CDC's 2016 guidelines on prescribing opioids for chronic pain.\n\nMassively expanding the availability of naloxone.\n\nMany states and municipalities have already taken action to equip police officers and other first responders with the lifesaving anti-overdose drug. But Trump's plan would ostensibly provide federal funding to scale up these efforts. This would be an obvious piece of any remotely serious opioids plan, but there was some reason to fear that the conservative movement's allergy to \"harm reduction\" approaches to drug abuse would keep it off of the White House's list.\n\nEncouraging states to opt into a drug-monitoring database that allows doctors to identify patients who have been seeking multiple opioid prescriptions from a variety of providers.\n\nScreening inmates for opioid use upon their arrival to federal prison.\n\nThis would provide inmates who have serious opioid problems with residential treatment.\n\nAlas, these sensible (if inadequate) proposals are paired with Draconian ones that would accomplish nothing beyond exacerbating our nation's mass-incarceration problem and expanding the reach of (the moral abomination that is) the death penalty.\n\nOn the first point: The plan would make it easier to impose mandatory minimum sentences on \"drug traffickers who knowingly distribute illegal opioids that can be lethal.\" There is no reason to believe that this would deter opioid trafficking -- according to the 2014 findings of the National Research Council, applying a mandatory minimum to a given offense does not reduce its prevalence. As criminologists have long demonstrated, potential criminal offenders are not (generally) deterred by the severity of the statutory punishment for a given illegal act, but only the \"certainty of apprehension.\" Which makes sense: It is hard to believe that anyone has ever decided whether to traffic fentanyl by consulting federal sentence guidelines, and carefully calculating exactly how many years in prison they're prepared to serve; but it's somewhat easier to imagine them making that decision after considering whether they know anyone who has made a lot of money dealing fentanyl and has not gotten caught.\n\nAnyhow, sentences for drug crimes (and virtually all other crimes) in the United States are already exceptionally long by international standards -- a fact that has gifted our nation with the highest incarceration rate in the world.\n\nFinally, the administration's proposal to make the death penalty an option in \"certain cases where opioid, including Fentanyl-related, drug dealing and trafficking are directly responsible for death\" is even more abominable. As written, the proposal would seem to potentially apply to even low-level drug dealers who sell opioids that result in someone's death. Again, there is no evidence that this would deter the sale of fentanyl. And even if one finds the death penalty morally unobjectionable in theory, in practice, it simply can't be: Between 1973 and 2004, at least 117 convicts sentenced to death were later found innocent of their alleged crimes. One might think that our president would be sensitive to the risk of misapplying the death penalty, seeing as he personally called for the execution of five teenage rape suspects who were later exonerated (but one, of course, would be wrong).\n\nIt's likely that Trump's proposal would be found unconstitutional. If not, it would make America an even crueler and more unusual place than it already is.",

                "body": "In Jane Mayer's definitive profile of Christopher Steele, the veteran British spy who compiled a controversial dossier documenting Donald Trump's alleged ties to Russia, and then some, there's a curious line attributed to the reclusive agent, who has gone into hiding since his investigative findings have made him the target of Republican recriminations: \"It was as if all criminal roads led to Trump Tower,\" Steele is quoted saying.\n\nThrough the first ten months of his investigation, Robert Mueller's interest in the headquarters of the Trump Organization seems to have been limited to Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting, alongside Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, with a motley crew of Russian characters who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton. But now the special counsel has trained its sights on the business proper: The New York Times reported on Thursday that Mueller has subpoenaed Russia-related documents from the organization -- which may include everything from emails to visitor logs to financial records to contracts the company entered into, all going back several years.\n\nThe Times doesn't specify the breadth of the subpoena, but it wouldn't be surprising if Mueller is interested in specific sensitive records related to Trump's long-held desire to grow his real-estate empire in Moscow. Mueller's team has already asked witnesses about those plans -- among them Felix Sater, an estranged Trump associate who knows better than most about the president's interest in Russia. \"First thing I plan to do when Trump leaves office, whether it's next week, in 2020 or four years later, is march right into his office and say, 'Let's build Trump Moscow,'\" Sater told BuzzFeed News recently.\n\nUnlike a sit-down with Trump, which Mueller is still trying to negotiate with his legal team, subpoenas are nonnegotiable and extremely hard to quash. The Trump Organization has already turned over documents requested by congressional investigators, but Mueller's request is likely far more focused than those of his counterparts on Capitol Hill, who made theirs back in the summer and are yet to produce anything of substance. Trump has warned that any snooping by the special counsel into his business dealings would cross a red line, but Mueller doesn't seem to care. He's going to get the documents he needs whether Trump likes it or not. This is business as usual for him.",

                "title": "Austin Bombs Appear to Be Targeting Prominent Black Families",
                "body": "Three package bombs have gone off in Austin, Texas, in the past two weeks, and they appear to have targeted members of prominent black families, the president of the local NAACP told NBC News Wednesday.\n\nThe families of Stephen House, who was killed on March 2, and Draylen Mason, who was killed on Monday, have known each other for a long time \"and go to the same church,\" according to Nelson Linder. The Austin NAACP president said that a third bomb, which injured 75-year-old Esperanza Herrera, may have been intended for \"another person who might be connected to the House and Mason families.\"\n\nThough the Austin police agree that the bombings are related, they haven't suggested a motive. They also haven't said whether they think the victims were personally targeted. But interim Austin police chief Brian Manley did tell reporters this week that they're not ruling out the possibly \"that hate crime is at the core of this.\"\n\nMason, 17, was a musician who was set to enroll at the University of Texas Butler School of Music. His grandmother LaVonne Mason is a co-founder of the Austin Area Urban League. House, 39, was a father and founder of his own money-management firm. His stepfather, Freddie Dixon, who is close with Mason's grandparents, was the longtime pastor at Wesley United Methodist Church, a historic black church that was founded by newly freed slaves.\n\nDixon told the Washington Post that he doesn't think the victims' history is a coincidence. \"Somebody's done their homework on both of us, and they knew what they were doing,\" he said. \"My diagnosis: Number one, I think it's a hate crime. Number two, somebody's got some kind of vendetta here.\"\n\nInvestigators have begun looking into the connection between the Mason and House families, attempting to see if the victims' relationships to \"prominent members of Austin's African-American community\" is related to the bombings, the Austin American-Statesman reported on Wednesday.\n\nAs for the third bomb, police have a theory that it was meant for a woman who is not related to the Mason family, but shares their last name.\n\nThe bombs themselves provide some clue as to who may have delivered them. According to ABC News, the explosives \"displayed a level of sophistication, indicating that the bomb-maker or bomb-makers were highly skilled.\"\n\nThe devices were set up to be detonated by motion like shaking or jostling, which is why they exploded when they were picked up. The devices also had some sort of safety switch, which enabled the bomber to move the devices without blowing themselves up, the sources briefed on the investigation told ABC News.\n\nAs police continue their probe into the bombings, a sense of unease has come over the city as Austinites prepare for another potential bombing. And they remain vigilant. Since Monday, there have been nearly 500 reports of suspicious packages in the city. None of them have contained explosives.",

                "body": "In high school, I would buy John Frieda Frizz-Ease a couple of bottles at a time. Squeezing dollops of the gluey goop into my hand, I'd work it from root to tips, forcing my very curly, very fine, frizz-prone hair into something similar to an uncooked brick of ramen: compact curls that did not budge. In the late '90s, frizz was something to be dealt with. A handicap. The enemy.\n\nNow, some 20 years later, society's stance on frizz has softened -- it's no longer something to feel bad about. Maybe you even want to play it up! I'd point to women like Solange, Jenny Slate, and Petra Collins for moving us forward. Like many things we shamed until not too recently, embracing your frizz is now seen as a type of empowerment, which is fine with me. After a decade-plus of fighting frizz and straightening my hair flat, something a little fluffy and puffy feels like a comfortable identity. But I also like my frizz a certain way: big and brushed-through, with this '70s vibe that reminds me of the culty women from the Source Family, Roseanne Roseannadanna, and my mom back in the day.\n\nLike my frizz-fighting days before me, my frizz-forward approach involves a styling routine and a tool kit, with the hero product being a Tangle Teaser. (Frizzy hair equals tangly hair.) Palm-size and kidney-shaped, it's like a cross between a dog brush and those circular old-man scalp-massage brushes (I like to keep one in the shower for that reason). Post-shampoo and conditioner, the forgiving plastic bristles detangle my insanely knot-prone curls with ease -- no yanks, no tears; 30 minutes later, another pass through air-dried ends gives me that triangular halo-fuzz that I'm forever reaching for. Midday, I'll pull one out of my drawer or grab the one I keep stashed in my bag and fluff things up a bit. And you don't have to have puffy-fine curls to appreciate this thing. I gifted one to my stick-straight-haired 5-year-old niece who is in one of the more tangly phases of her life, and she loves it, too.\n\nTangle Teezer $12 at Dermstore Other Strat-Approved Frizzy-Hair Products Oribe Curl Gloss Hydration & Hold\n\n\"After I comb, I mix together this Oribe Curl Gloss and L'Oreal Mythic Oil in the palm of my hand, then run the mixture through my damp hair. The curl gloss hydrates and the mythic oil nourishes and gives shine, so together they make my hair look super shiny and bouncy. This concoction gives body to the curls and kills the frizz. It's all about avoiding frizz.\" -- Christina Viera-Newton\n\n$38 at Neiman Marcus Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine Anti-Frizz Serum\n\n\"Okay, I know this product is middle school as hell, but before I made the big cut, and I was suffering from poofy, dry, fried hair, this was a total lifesaver for me.\" -- Rio Viera-Newton\n\n$5 at Bed Bath & Beyond Davines Love Cream\n\n\"My hair type is naturally very curly and frizzy and doesn't take well to humidity. In the summertime, especially in New York, if I don't use Love my hair is a complete mess. I put Love in when my hair is damp, right out of the shower, and then I scrunch my hair with my hands -- it enhances my curls and keeps them in place! It also does a really good job of separating my curls without making them crunchy, which I find a lot of products do.\" -- Laura Chautin\n\n$20 at Walmart Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser's Invisible Oil\n\n\"I love this oil. It helps so much with thick frizz. I use it after every time I wash my hair, but my hair is so thick I only really wash it every few days. A little goes a long way!\" -- Ana Coccioletti\n\n$22 at Nordstrom Elchim 2001 Milano Cocoon Bi-Diffuser\n\n\"To use the bi-diffuser -- which 'reduces the air velocity from your hair dryer' -- you have to twist a strand of hair around your finger, then lay it inside the diffuser. Then you move the diffuser toward the scalp so it dries the hair roots, leave it in place, and move on to the next section of hair. It makes really perfect curls.\" -- Christina Viera-Newton\n\n$25 at Ulta Beauty DevaCurl No-Poo\n\n\"People with curly hair should not use shampoo. It dries out the curls when the thing they need most is moisture (hence all the oils I used to rub into my hair). But for everyone who feels weird about never washing their hair, Devachan has created No-Poo, a shampoo that doesn't lather or contain any of the sulfates regularly found in shampoo that dry out curls.

I have them at work with me right now. I use this bag from Peak Design that's a specific camera bag, so it can hold multiple cameras, lenses, your iPad, and your actual laptop, and it's really compartmentalized, in a streamlined way, to get every inch of use out of it. The zippers open up on both sides, so you can get easy access to a camera or a lens. A lot of photographers have multiple lenses, so all the pockets and zipper ways are made with a photographer in mid. Camera bags in general are not known to have the best aesthetics. A lot of them are like, \"You're a camera guy.\" This one is a little more low-key.\n\n$260 at Amazon $260 at Amazon Tile\n\nIn my slightly older age, I feel like I'm getting forgetful. This thing is flat and stays in my wallet and turns it into a GPS. And I have one on my key chain because my wife was going crazy over how many keys I lose. If I forget something, I can pull it up on an app and buzz it, and it makes a sound.\n\n$57 at Amazon $57 at Amazon Leica SL\n\nMy baby, the gadget I love and use the most. The Leica isn't the cheapest camera out there, but it's the third love of my life right now after my wife and daughter. The best way I can explain it is, it's the SUV of cameras. It has a solid feel, it's completely weatherproof, and you can even drench it in water. It's a very rock-solid camera, and it's like my go-to if I'm doing street photography and taking portraits. The price tag will make people do a double take; it's definitely a guilty pleasure, but it'll last a lifetime.\n\n$5,995 at Amazon $5,995 at Amazon DxO ONE\n\nIt's kind of like my spy camera: It basically has the optics of the best point-and-shoots out there, but it's in this little incognito shell. I went to see a comedian at Radio City Music Hall, and you weren't allowed to bring cameras or phones in. This doesn't look like a camera, it looks like a harmless toy. I kept this in my pocket and got to fire off a few shots. They were actually pretty good shots. It's much better than an iPhone camera.\n\n$477 at Amazon $477 at Amazon Lacie Porsche Design 2TB Portable Hard Drive\n\nWhen you take a lot of these full-frame photos, you're basically using a lot of raw photos, and they can be 50 megs right out of the camera. I have a bunch of these and bring at least one of these with me at all times.\n\n$80 at Amazon $80 at Amazon BlackPods\n\nI'm a big fan of the [Apple] AirPods because they democratized wireless headphones that stay in your ear. But I never liked the white, it's a little too in your face when they're white. I did a search and found this company and literally all they do is take your AirPods and powder coat them to make them professionally black. And they'll also do the case. But they also sell buds directly, too. Everyone asks where I get them.\n\n$280 at BlackPods Beats Solo3 Wireless\n\nI try every once in a while to go out for a morning run. I'm older and have a kid, so it doesn't happen as often as it used to. But the AirPods, if you're running, they're going to keep falling. I need the bigger over-the-ear headphones to run in -- I can't deal with cords everywhere, I'm cord-cutting everything -- and I like these because the sound fidelity isn't professional, but they're bass-y, and when you're running you just need something that works. I sweat in them, and they still work.\n\n$199 at Amazon $199 at Amazon Dyson Big Ball Multi Floor Vacuum\n\nIf you're going to have something so utilitarian as a vacuum cleaner taking up space, it's nice to have a good piece of design. My wife and I both appreciate that, so this was our choice. We've had it for about four years, and it's still working great. We also have quite a few bladeless fans from Dyson around the house.\n\n$300 at Amazon $300 at Amazon MacBook Pro\n\nI use the 13-inch MacBook Pro, with the new Touch Bar ID, which in hindsight is kind of useless. It was an interesting attempt, but it takes longer to do the same things you could do with an older laptop. But the computer is probably still the gold standard for laptops, and I've always been a Mac user. There are basically zero desktop computers in the office at Squarespace, and all the creatives are on Macs. The engineering team is split between Mac and PCs.\n\n$1,010 at Amazon $1,010 at Amazon iPad Pro\n\nWhen I'm not actually working at Squarespace, I use a tablet for everything. I have the 10.1, along with the Apple Pencil. I got the pencil right away because I tend to be a gadget nerd. At first I didn't really have a use case for it, but then I started seeing some apps where you could do some robust color grading for photos. It seemed more natural than on a desktop because you're drawing right on a screen. I did that in Kenya, on a safari. I was taking photos but then loading them up on the tablet, right on the safari, and doing retouching.\n\n$600 at Amazon $600 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

I just found out what a fiddler cap is, and I don't want you to wear one. Don't wear slouchy beanies that scrunch up in the back, especially if you're wearing it indoors with a henley and no coat. Don't wear beanies that sit on the tip-top of your head like a condom: I won't be able to stand it.\n\nUtility hats are fine. If it's sunny, wear a baseball cap. If it's cold, wear a beanie.

(If you don't believe me, know that in 2016, more Americans bought candy for Easter than for Halloween.) It's the time for Easter baskets full of chocolate bunnies, chocolate Easter eggs, and, of course, marshmallow Peeps. And to help you find the best Easter chocolate and Easter candy to put in your family's baskets this year (or your own, we don't judge), we asked 11 chefs, from New York and Miami, to share their favorite Easter chocolates, candies, and treats.\n\nOriginal Cadbury Creme Egg, 12 Pack\n\n\"Their seasonal availability alone is enough to make me crave Cadbury Creme Eggs regularly. I've tried to stock up and save them; it never works. They also signify spring approaching, so I immediately associate them with sun and happiness. Pro tip? Don't eat all at once: Bite off the top and scoop out the filling. A childhood habit I will never give up.\" -- Alexandra Shapiro, owner, Flex Mussels\n\n$14 at Amazon $14 at Amazon Reese's Easter Peanut Butter Eggs, 10.8 oz\n\n\"I have a special fondness for chocolate eggs for Easter, mostly because my mother went through a candy-making phase. When Easter came around, she inevitably tried her hand at rabbits and eggs. She wasn't an expert in any way, but what did a 10-year-old boy know from nothing? To me, they were better than the Easter ham and all the jelly beans combined! Usually, I buy myself just one Cadbury or Kinder Egg every year at Easter time, just to bring about that memory. But yesterday, I bought an entire bag of Reese's Peanut Butter Eggs. Maybe I'm feeling homesick heading into this chilly Easter.\" -- Ryan Tate, chef, Deer Mountain Inn\n\n$4 at Walmart Palmer Peter Rabbit Easter Bunny Milk Chocolate\n\n\"My favorite Easter candy is, hands down, a good old-fashioned Palmer's hollow chocolate Easter bunny. There's something kind of punk rock about nibbling the face off of a cartoon rabbit. I love the irreverence of snipping the top of the ears and using the rabbit as a drinking vessel for an Easter Sunday white Russian, spicy chocolate Martini, or Irish iced coffee. This hack also leaves the chocolate delightfully booze infused for when you decide to eighty-six Peter Cottontail.\" -- Nick Korbee, chef, Egg Shop\n\n$4 at Target Hitschler Softi Chewy Candy (200 Pieces)\n\n\"My grandma always gave me this German candy called Softi. Best stuff in the world. The texture of it is amazing, and it's been part of every Easter since I was a child. It's not a traditional one by any means, and I was the only kid who gave it to my friends because no one knew of it. Also, I like the flavor, which is completely ambiguous. Everyone who eats it thinks its something different, which I think is super cool. To me, it tastes like pineapple, to others like a light cherry flavor.\" -- Greg Proechel, executive chef, Ferris\n\n$23 at Amazon $23 at Amazon Elmer's Gold Brick Eggs (24 Individual Eggs)\n\n\"Most people know I am from the South, but little know I was born right off the banks of the Mississippi River in New Orleans. I grew up getting NOLA classic Elmer's Gold Brick Eggs in my Easter basket. Such a decadent chocolate and seeing the packaging just takes me back to my childhood.\" -- Richard Hales, chef and owner, Bird & Bone at the Confidante, Miami\n\n$26 at Amazon $26 at Amazon PEZ Easter Bunny Candy Dispenser, 2.03 oz\n\n\"PEZ. Every holiday, my mom has PEZ for me with a dispenser that is fitting for the time of year. Santa for Christmas, heart for Valentine's Day, and a bunny on Easter.\" -- Greg Baxtrom, chef, Olmsted\n\n$3 at Walmart Kinder Schoko-Bons\n\n\"We've never really been allowed to eat chocolates and candies at home, but Easter was always a great opportunity to break the family rules. The Kinder Schoko-Bons are by far the most addictive thing to me on earth. I still remember sneaking at night to the kitchen to eat at least one. One time I finished the pack in one night.\" -- Vincent Marino, co-owner, Loosie Rouge and Loosie's Kitchen & Cafe\n\n$5 at Amazon $5 at Amazon Original Peeps Bundle -- 4 Packs of 10\n\n\"My wife got me hooked on Peeps, as it's her favorite Easter candy, and I buy them for her every year. We've even teamed up with Peeps to create a CrazyShake milkshake at Black Tap for the third year in a row -- it's a huge hit.\" -- Joe Isidori, chef and owner, Black Tap Burger\n\n$15 at Amazon $15 at Amazon Bonifanti Chocolate Colomba (26 oz.)\n\n\"I love the chocolate colomba, a traditional dove-shaped cake that is only made around Easter in Italy. It is great on its own with coffee or even better when done as French toast the next day. The combination of chocolate and almonds make it a great crowd-pleaser. It reminds me of lazy weekends with family over coffee and conversation.\" -- Adam Hill, executive chef, Manzo at Eataly Flatiron\n\n$25 at Eataly Original Turkey Joints\n\n\"Turkey joints from Nora's Candy Shop are my absolute favorite candy. They are made in my hometown of Rome, New York, and they instantly take me back to my childhood. They are a mixture of hazelnuts and chocolate, and they have a silvery sugar coating on the outside.\" -- Kevin Adey, executive chef and owner, Faro and General Deb's\n\n$21 at Nora's Candy Shop Brach's Easter Marshmallow Chicks & Rabbits Candy\n\n\"These delicious lollipops are made in my hometown of China. They have a sugar coating on the outside and a soft and sweet center. The candy reminds me of my childhood years growing up, and I recall eating them by the boxes when I was a kid. The lollipops are difficult to find now, but they bring me back to a nostalgic time, so instead I'll eat these marshmallow rabbits.\" -- Skinny Mei, executive chef, Jade Sixty Asian Steakhouse\n\n$3 at Target GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

                "title": "Devin Nunes's Russia Investigation Had No Suspects",
                "body": "Last night, at a dinner with a few dozen conservatives hosted by the American Spectator, Devin Nunes expounded on his view that Donald Trump's campaign is extremely innocent of wrongdoing in the Russia scandal. Nunes, who is of course in charge of the House of Representatives' putative investigation into this very question, combined strong beliefs about the bottom-line result of Robert Mueller's probe with a deep lack of curiosity about any of its outstanding questions:\n\n\"Now look at who Mueller has prosecuted at this point, and who is left to prosecute for collusion?\" he wondered. \"I mean, there's no one left. [Former Trump campaign manager Paul] Manafort would be the obvious guy to think of that was colluding, right? If you could have gotten him on collusion, he would have been the obvious choice. Flynn, I mean, I knew Flynn very very well, and he is not a secret communist supporting Putin. So, they can't get him on that. So who else do they have?\"\n\nWho is left to prosecute for collusion? Well, let's see. There is Donald Trump Jr., who attended a meeting with a Russian promising to help his campaign, and loved it. There's Jared Kushner, who also attended that meeting, and had a web of financial relationships and contacts with Russia that he suspiciously failed to disclose. There is Roger Stone, who reportedly knew about the Russian email hacking as early as spring 2016, before it was publicly known.\n\nThere is Flynn, who Nunes rules out as a suspect because he is \"not a secret communist.\" Nunes might not have been told that Russia is no longer a communist country, and there are reasons these days for non-Russians to develop secret relationships with its government, such as money, a thing Flynn was taking on the sly. Plus, there's Donald Trump, who worked with all these people, and all of whom had strong incentives to keep him apprised of their nefarious work on his behalf.\n\nNunes does concede that Manafort is not exactly a saint, but concludes that since he has not been charged with collusion yet, he never will be, nor will anybody else. The thing is, though, Mueller is still investigating. Nunes conducted a pretend investigation and concluded he found nothing. It's almost as if Nunes did not want to find any guilt!",

                "title": "Trump Admin Finally Sanctions Russia for Election Meddling",
                "body": "On Thursday, the Trump administration announced a raft of long-anticipated sanctions against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election and other cyberattacks the country has launched against the United States.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions demonstrate that the U.S. is \"confronting and countering malign Russian cyberactivity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyberattacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure.\" The announcement comes more than seven months after Trump reluctantly signed a bill calling for the sanctions and 45 days after the deadline to impose them passed.\n\nAmong the entities and individuals targeted are the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-linked \"troll farm\" that Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted last month, and Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch known as \"Putin's chef.\" In total, the new sanctions target 19 individuals and five entities involved in what Mnuchin called \"the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.\" Those sanctioned will no longer be allowed to travel to the U.S. or do business with American companies or individuals. Assets they hold in America will also be frozen.\n\nIn addition to Russia's election meddling, the U.S. justified the sanctions by citing the NotPetya cyberattack, which targeted computers in Ukraine before going global, and a previously undisclosed attempt to attack the U.S. power grid.\n\nThe sanctions announcement comes on the same day that President Trump joined leaders from the U.K, France, and Germany to make his most forceful public statement against Russia, which is accused of orchestrating a nerve agent attack on a former spy living in England.",

                "title": "Republicans Need to Stop Politicizing Airline Dog Deaths",
                "body": "This has been an emotional week. The death of a French bulldog puppy aboard a United Airlines flight has filled Americans with shocked sadness and mournful indignation. And I am no exception. As a dog owner and frequent flyer, I can readily imagine the grief that the deceased's family is feeling right now.\n\nFor this reason, upon hearing the news, I immediately offered my thoughts and prayers over Twitter, and put a French-bulldog-themed frame over my Facebook photo. And as friends, family members, and internet acquaintances \"liked\" my social media contributions, I suddenly felt that this puppy might not have died in vain; that its tragic end might just help to unify our bitterly divided nation by reminding us that, in truth, there is no \"red America\" and \"blue America\" -- no \"cat people\" and \"dog people\" -- but only, the United States of American dogs and cats and people.\n\nBut then, of course, Republicans decided to politicize the tragedy. On Wednesday night, before the investigation into Kokito's death had even been completed, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana decided that now was the time to push the far right's anti-dogs-in-overhead-bins agenda.\n\nIn a written statement, Kennedy went so far as to suggest that Americans who oppose dog-storage control don't actually care about their pets. \"For many people, pets are a member of the family,\" the senator wrote. \"They should not be treated like insignificant cargo. Frankly, they shouldn't be placed in the cargo hold, much less an overhead bin.\"\n\nBy now, such rhetoric from smug conservatives isn't surprising -- but it's still shameful. I do not question the sincerity of Kennedy's love for his canines, and I don't see why he refuses to give that same benefit of the doubt to those on my side of the dog-storage debate.\n\nWhat Kennedy and his fellow conservatives fail to understand is that, for many Americans, stowing dogs in overhead bins isn't some abstract \"issue\" -- it's an identity, a culture, and a heritage.\n\nI come from a humble, cosmopolitan community full of good, god-forsaking coastal elites. In liberal enclaves like mine, it is not uncommon for a family to own six or seven small, yappy dogs, and to take upwards of a dozen European vacations each year. Republicans think that my parents stowed our Yorkies in overhead bins because they did not see them as members of our family. This couldn't be further from the truth. It was love of animals that prevented my father from keeping those pups in a kennel during our annual trips to Davos and Milan. And it was also love -- of our peoples' culture and traditions -- that informed my family's commitment to maximizing our legroom on intercontinental flights.\n\nPut simply, the liberty to shove our dogs into the dark, airless compartments of passenger airliners made our way of life possible.\n\nNo one wants to see dogs die from suffocation. And it's understandable that, in the wake of a tragedy like this one, people would look for ideologically comforting answers to that timeless scourge. But condescending to the cultural values of half of America will not make our nation's pets any safer; especially since the connection between storing dogs in overhead bins and canine suffocation is tenuous, at best. Who's to say that increasing the number of dogs stored in overhead compartments wouldn't actually reduce the incidence of such fatalities, by conditioning those pets to get by on less air, thereby saving their lives, should they ever accidentally fall down a mineshaft into a poorly ventilated space? (Throughout my entire life, only four of my family's Yorkshire terriers have died mid-flight, and in all of these cases, it was clear that the true cause of the tragedy was our nation's failing canine mental-health system.)\n\nWhat makes Kennedy's comments so frustrating is that he understands the importance of treating public safety regulations with skepticism when his cultural traditions are threatened.\n\nShortly after a teenage psychopath in Parkland, Florida, massacred high-school students with an AR-15 rifle, Kennedy told CNN that America did not need a \"single\" new gun-control law. Rather, the senator argued that what we really need is \"more idiot control.\"\n\nI agree wholeheartedly. But if Kennedy recognizes that there's no reason to assume that America's exceptionally high rate of gun ownership has anything to do with its exceptionally high rate of gun violence, how can he not see that the connection between stowing dogs in airless compartments and canine deaths is also uncertain?\n\nAnd if he understands that red America's time-honored tradition of buying military-grade assault weapons over the internet is too sacred to outlaw (even if it did somehow contribute to America's 30,000 annual gun deaths), then why doesn't he see that our nation's 24 annual airline pet fatalities is an acceptable price for preserving my family's liberty to stow our Yorkies in solitary confinement as we glide amongst the clouds?\n\nDoes the latter idea really make any less sense than the former?",

                "title": "Frank Rich: The Hidden Logic of Trump's Staff Exodus",
                "body": "Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, the recent wave of departures from the Trump administration, Democrat Conor Lamb's apparent victory in the Pennsylvania special election, and the Stormy Daniels scandal.\n\nThe exodus from the Trump administration continues this week with Rex Tillerson at the State Department, followed out the door by the department spokesperson who described the White House's actions a little too bluntly, and with more moves expected. What is going on here?\n\nTrump's top appointees, exemplified by the Cabinet, are in their jobs for only three reasons: to demolish the federal government; to spend taxpayers' money on luxury travel and office refurbishing; and to toady to the president in public and obey his policy whims in private. Tillerson is out because he succeeded in only the first of these by decimating the State Department. His successor, Mike Pompeo, will not make Tillerson's mistake. He's the very model of a heel-clicking Vichy Republican.\n\nThe latest scuttlebutt has Rick Perry, the Energy secretary who took the job not knowing what the Department of Energy does, moving to Veterans' Affairs. As others inevitably follow Tillerson out the door -- Jeff Sessions, H.R. McMaster, et al. -- we'll increasingly see successors like Pompeo, picked from within the current ranks of administration flunkies.\n\nRespectable new recruits are hard to find now that it's no longer a matter of debate that to work for Trump is to destroy one's reputation. Gary Cohn, the departing economic adviser, used to be known as a Goldman Sachs super trader; now he's known as the guy who was so determined to get a tax cut that he refused to resign after his boss gave a free pass to anti-Semitic and racist neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. Tillerson was known as the star CEO of Exxon; now he's become a national punch line whose repeated public humiliations culminated with his being fired by tweet.\n\nRemember all that talk that Trump would be constrained by the \"grown-ups\" in the White House? With the exception of Jim Mattis, the Defense secretary, they've all either departed or surrendered their manhood to Trump's racism, misogyny, and xenophobia (John Kelly). We now know definitively that Trump doesn't want adults in the room; he wants malleable dolts (Ben Carson, Steve Mnuchin, Betsy DeVos) who are happy to join him in his Oval Office playpen, where he can make all the rules and hoard the toys.\n\nToo many rats departing the sinking ship, too little time to dwell on them all. My favorite of the recent crop is Trump's personal assistant, Johnny McEntee, who was hustled out of the White House this week when it was discovered that he was being investigated for online gambling and tax evasion. Hardly was he out the door when he found a safe landing in a senior position in the 2020 reelection campaign. Say what you will about the chaotic comings and goings in Trumpworld, but Paul Manafort's sleazy résumé even now remains its ethical gold standard.\n\nThough uncounted absentee ballots have an outside chance of shifting the math, the Democrat Conor Lamb is apparently squeaking out a victory in Pennsylvania's special election, winning a House seat in a district Trump carried by nearly 20 points in 2016. How will this shake up each party's plans for the midterms this November?\n\nThe Republicans are stuck with only one plan for November: Donald Trump. They can run, but they can't hide from the president they have embraced unequivocally since his inauguration. The Democrats' plans? The very question is an oxymoron. They have many ways to try to commit self-sabotage between now and Election Day, and will surely indulge in more than a few during the ideological battles of primary season.\n\nBut even so, the result in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, in the heart of what the GOP candidate Rick Saccone himself called \"Trump country,\" is momentous for the Democrats, a further demonstration that they will have to work extra hard to claw defeat from the jaws of victory this year. Saccone had everything going for him -- not just an expanding economy, a supposedly crowd-pleasing tax cut, and the district's solid GOP history. (Some years, the Democrats haven't even bothered to field a House candidate in the 18th.) Conservative groups and PACs spent $10.7 million on Saccone's race, more than five times Lamb's bankroll. Trump announced his steel and aluminum tariffs in the campaign's final days, the most microtargeted pander to Rust Belt voters imaginable. Trump visited Pennsylvania twice to campaign for Saccone, culminating in last Saturday's rally in which he served up the red meat that usually revs up his base, from racism (calling the Congresswoman Maxine Waters a \"low IQ individual\") to press-bashing (calling NBC's Chuck Todd a \"son of a bitch\"). Ivanka, Donald Jr., and Mike Pence campaigned, too. All to no avail.\n\nTrump apologists will argue that Saccone was too conventional a Republican to wear a MAGA hat convincingly. But Saccone had enthusiastically embraced Trump and Trumpism. The fact is that since Trump became president, his all-in endorsements of GOP candidates have failed to win victories whether the candidate is a standard-issue conservative in a purplish state (Ed Gillespie, in the Virginia gubernatorial race) or an uninhibited Trumpian (the accused child molester Roy Moore in Alabama) in a deep-red state. And Trump has made it known that he loves campaigning so much -- certainly far more than his actual job -- that he wants to book many more of his rambling, crowd-pleasing rallies in the months to come. Who is going to say no to him? Meanwhile, the Democrats need 24 seats to take the House in November, and according to the Washington Post, they have an even better shot at flipping 114 other House seats than they did the Pennsylvania 18th. (And Democrats should even do better in Pennsylvania in the fall, given that the 18th and other gerrymandered districts are being redrawn in the aftermath of a State Supreme Court ruling.)\n\nSome Democrats will undoubtedly view Lamb's ideological profile as a relatively conservative Democrat as a mandate for the party to now tilt right. But as an analysis of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study of the last national election has shown, the 9 percent of 2012 Obama voters who switched to Trump in 2016 are more conservative than the other 90 percent of Obama voters as a whole; they will remain tougher pickups for Democrats no matter how much its strategists try to concoct campaign strategies from a deep reading of Hillbilly Elegy. A more likely source of a Democratic revival are the 10 percent of 2012 Obama voters who either stayed home (7 percent) or voted for a third-party candidate (3 percent) in 2016. Trump has given many of them -- a disproportionate number of them either young or black -- a reason to be fired up and ready to go even without Obama on the ballot.\n\nBringing her affair with Trump into public view with a lawsuit and a not-yet-aired interview with 60 Minutes, Stormy Daniels has exposed Trump's marital infidelity (and the possible existence of other \"hush agreements\"), not to mention potential violations of federal campaign law and the president's vulnerability to extortion. Is this a scandal that could end his presidency?\n\nDaniels is fascinating, a sleeper cell who is unlikely to end this presidency but could yet hasten its demise.\n\nThe fact that Trump had an affair with a porn star soon after he married his current wife and fathered his youngest son will not drive away his base. Voters who were onboard for Trump's Access Hollywood tape, in which he essentially confirmed the charges of the multiple women accusing him of sexual assault, are on for this. The moral charlatans who speak for Evangelical Christians, from Tony Perkins to Franklin Graham, would likely rationalize Trump's behavior even if sex tapes do surface from Tahoe or Moscow.\n\nBut Daniels has an asset that Trump may well fear: She seems to have the talent to challenge him in the arena he cares about most -- entertainment. I am not talking about her cinematic canon, which I have not seen, but about her gumption, wit, and shamelessness. Her rapid-fire Twitter feed, in which she dispatches Trump supporters for their illiteracy and other stupidities, is sharp and funny. Her interview with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes might launch her as a plausible successor to Kathy Griffin.\n\nThere are many legalities attendant to the $130,000 hush money paid to Daniels that could ensnare Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen. But in the aftermath of yesterday's election result in Trump country, what both the president and his party should most fear is her potential to extend her 15 minutes into a star turn with legs long enough to keep her center stage until November 6.",

                "title": "Hopes Fade That Congress Will Stabilize Obamacare",
                "body": "Remember \"Obamacare stabilization,\" one of the great bipartisan causes of 2017? Mostly in response to the president's suspension of so-called cost-sharing-reduction reimbursements to insurers required to limit the out-of-pocket costs to low-income participants in the Obamacare markets, legislation developed by Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray developed a real head of steam in the Senate, until opposition from House Republicans and the White House stalled its momentum. Then in December, Senator Susan Collins got assurances from both Mitch McConnell and the president that both the Alexander-Murray legislation and a bill she co-sponsored with Florida Democrat Bill Nelson giving states money to set up reinsurance pools for high-cost Obamacare patients would be included in an omnibus spending bill that was being negotiated. Collins gave Republicans a critical vote for their tax bill in no small part due to these assurances.\n\nWell, nearly three months later, the promises to Collins have yet to be kept; the only real excuse is that Congress has passed a series of short-term spending measures, with the real omnibus appropriations bill still being negotiated in advance of a pretty serious March 23 deadline. But the odds of Obamacare stabilization legislation making it into this package are definitely fading. For one thing, House Republicans are now demanding strict language prohibiting use of any Obamacare subsidy dollars for purchase of private insurance policies covering abortion services.\n\nLast week, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a lead Democratic negotiator, called GOP demands on abortion limitations \"a complete nonstarter.\" A spokeswoman for Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., sponsor of the House GOP package, said if Democrats want to oppose the effort \"by playing abortion politics, then shame on them.\"\n\nThe even bigger problem is that escalating demands -- mostly from Republicans, some from Democrats -- for \"riders\" on the giant appropriations measure could be leading to a dynamic in which virtually all of them -- including Obamacare stabilization -- are left out. In other words, health-care measures could become collateral damage in higher-profile fights over gun regulation, immigration, and Planned Parenthood \"defunding.\"\n\nThe really unfortunate thing about these developments is that Obamacare needs stabilizing a lot more than it did when Alexander and Murray unveiled their legislation last year. Since then, Congress has eliminated the individual mandate for health insurance, and the Trump administration has taken a number of steps to let states mess with the rules governing individual insurance policies. The most important of these is probably the encouragement of \"short-term\" policies that are allowed to evade all of Obamacare's requirements, which could lead to an even greater exodus of young and healthy people from the Obamacare risk pool than abolition of the mandate.\n\nIndeed, Senator Tammy Baldwin thinks this is such a big problem that enacting last year's Obamacare stabilization bills won't do much good without additional restraints on the new GOP-promoted loopholes:\n\nBaldwin told TPM that if Congress re-funds the CSRs and passes a temporary reinsurance program but ignores the threat of the short-term plans, it would be like bailing out a sinking ship while failing to patch a hole in the hull....\n\n\"I think it will not only have the impact of basically allowing junk plans to be offered to sometimes unsuspecting people, but beyond that, it will drive up prices in the ACA marketplace because healthier people may go into the junk plans and leave older and less-well people in the ACA.\"\n\nSo Baldwin is pushing her own measure overruling Trump's permission slip for expansion of short-term plans.\n\nAbout the only thing exerting significant leverage on Republicans to cooperate in Obamacare stabilization is the fear that they will get blamed for shockingly high premium increases for 2019, which would be announced shortly before the midterm elections, as the Associated Press notes:\n\nSome Democrats think they'd reap political gains if the talks collapse since polls show the health care statute is widely popular and the public would largely fault Republicans if consumer costs spiral skyward.\n\n\"Either Republicans help stabilize the market or they own these premium and deductible increases,\" said Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. \"And I'd be glad to help crucify them if they don't want to do something very reasonable.\"\n\nThe effort forces Republicans to choose between trying to avert bad news about premiums shortly before elections or standing by their opposition to anything that could be viewed as propping up \"Obamacare.\"\n\nIn what is widely being perceived as a \"base mobilization\" election year, it's a reasonably good bet that enough Republicans will refuse to do anything to prop up Obamacare and that this dilemma will be resolved in favor of inaction, particularly given all the cross pressures surrounding the omnibus appropriations bill. That might change with some seriously responsible Republican leadership. But expecting that from an endangered Speaker Paul Ryan or from the president who has done so much himself to destabilize Obamacare is likely naïve.",

                "body": "Most people know what it feels like to be anxious. Whether they have chronic anxiety (like me) or have felt nerves during stressful situations, few are strangers to that stomach-sinking moment, that loss of breath, that trepidation. Even Kevin Love isn't immune.\n\nDepending on your level of anxiety, you may take medication (I do), but medication doesn't erase anxiety from your consciousness. It's not a Band-Aid -- more a corner of a thousand-piece puzzle. Because of this, I've had to come up with some tricks to calm my mind, lower my heart rate, and reduce the feeling like the end of the world is imminent. Whether anxiety is part of your daily life or just here-and-there nerves for an interview, date, or basketball game (I got you, Kevin), here's what puts my mind at ease.\n\nAura Cacia Cooling Peppermint Essential Oil $8 at Amazon Arkopharma Migrastick $14 at Amazon\n\nAromatherapy is so hot right now. And when I'm feeling stressed, I go right to the peppermint oil. (For me, it is truly essential.) I like to dab it on my temples or put some on my stomach, which remarkably relieves any nausea I'm feeling at the moment. At home, I keep a big bottle of Aura Cacia peppermint oil next to my bed. In my purse, it's a Migrastick, which offers soothing peppermint tingles on the go.\n\nDr. Teal's Therapeutic Solutions Epsom Salt in Lavender\n\nMore aromatherapy, this time in bath form. If you have a bathtub wherever you live, USE IT. If you get into a nice hot bath with lavender Epsom salts, you'll not only immediately relax but also get supersoft skin. My grandmother told me she used to use Epsom salts to relieve aches and pains as a kid. I'm happy to say they're very much back in style.\n\n$5 at Bed Bath & Beyond AmazonBasics High-Density Round Foam Roller\n\nA lot of people tell me that I should exercise for my anxiety. But that seems like a lot of work for when I'm already feeling out of sorts. (Plus, there are so many people at the gym ... will they be watching?) But to get my circulation going when I'm anxious, I foam-roll. This not only helps relieve stress pain in my neck and back, but it gives me something to concentrate on (not falling off the roller). If your foam roller hasn't arrived yet, Lauren Weisman (of Mama Method and my anti-anxiety expert) says to lie down with your knees bent and feet firmly planted on the floor, then take some deep breaths. It will literally and physically ground you.\n\n$19 at Amazon BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts by Stella Parks\n\nWhen I'm feeling really anxious, throwing myself into a complex baking project can often keep the nerves at bay. I have made the cinnamon buns from BraveTart many, many times. The act of kneading the dough, watching it rise, smelling it bake all cinnamony and buttery is enough to really calm me down. The satisfaction of successfully making something so delicious is just an added perk. Full disclosure: I actually work with Stella Parks, the author of the cookbook, and she is a genius, so I feel no guilt in this plug. But choose whatever cookbook you want. Just get off your screens and get in the kitchen.\n\n$24 at Amazon Headspace: Meditation\n\nMeditation reminds me that I actually have control over my brain, and that no matter how bad I'm feeling, there is always an end point. While there are a lot of great meditation apps out there, my favorite is Headspace. Andy Puddicombe's sessions are designed for real people living in the modern world. His guided meditation recordings can last up to 20 minutes, and topics range from self-esteem and regret to quick one-off sessions titled \"Burned Out,\" \"Losing Your Temper,\" \"Interviews,\" and even \"Commuting.\" No matter what topic you choose, Andy reminds us that we're never alone in our feelings; recognizing that is a major part of feeling better. It doesn't hurt that his voice is super sexy, too.\n\n$0 at iTunes A Few Other Strat-Approved Anxiety Remedies Tata Harper All-Natural Aromatic Stress Treatment\n\nStrategist editor Alexis Swerdloff keeps this Tata Harper Aromatic Stress Treatment oil next to her computer, and dabs a little bit on her wrists when things get hairy.

                "title": "The New Ceramics Is Embroidery",
                "body": "We're several years into the ceramics craze -- an era that kicked off in earnest around 2013, when, seemingly at once, all entrées began arriving in charmingly uneven bowls, a bevy of articles lauding independent makers cropped up in the \"Style\" section, and in Vogue, and in this very magazine, and all my friends began bringing smocks to work for their Tuesday-night wheel class in Tribeca.\n\nCeramics were not the first craft to break from Pinterest into a full-blown mainstream trend. Woodworking had its moment, as did terrariums. So did knitting, in the earlier aughts. (And again last year when suddenly thousands of women needed pink crocheted hats.) Now it's 2018, and while our collective clay hysteria hasn't yet died down, a new craft has achieved Cult Craft Status: embroidery.\n\nEmbroidery crept into my sight when I found and became enamored with Paloma Wool, a small Barcelona-based designer who makes sweaters and pants stitched with palm fronds and twisty snakes and naked female bodies. Then I saw it everywhere: at the Soho Converse store, where Brooklyn artist Brian Blakely recently spent a weekend chain-stitching cherries onto high-tops; in Rachel Comey on colorful needlepoint slip-ons and purses; on a Pari Desai sweater I coveted (red roses on mauve cotton); in Maryam Nassir Zadeh, where I found a dress with \"Heartthrob\" stitched messily in cursive across the back. It showed up in the art world, too (although to be fair, women have used stitching and embroidery in their art for ages), in Susan Cianciolo's embroidered tapestries, Sophia Narrett's stitched domestic scenes, Maira Kalman's portraits of her late mother sewn onto linen, and Jordan Nassar's cotton-on-cotton depictions of arid Israeli deserts.\n\nInstead of buying any of the above items, I decided to teach myself how to embroider. And I quickly learned that it is the most wonderful craft a person could ever pick up on a whim. It's cheap (all you need is a needle and thread), and it's not messy (like, for instance, covering your hands and forearms in wet clay). Once you run out of things of your own to embroider (you'll know you're at this point when all of your T-shirts have your own name stitched messily across the breast), you can begin making gifts for friends and family that will thrill them: In the last year, I've knit a tiny yellow heart on my mother's jean jacket, my sister's nickname on her overalls, and my boss's initials on a tote. The act of it is deeply soothing: If your hands are busy making tiny stitches, you cannot check your phone, bite your fingernails, or crack your knuckles. Below, the two things you'll need to begin your own embroidery project, a couple of cheap things you can try it out on, and a couple of pre-embroidered pieces to buy if you find this charming, but you already have enough hobbies.\n\nPaxcoo 50 Skeins Embroidery Floss\n\nEmbroidery floss in all the colors.

This is not what the students marching around the country on Wednesday were asking for.\n\nRepresentative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican and the bill's author, called it \"an important first step forward in protecting our children, our teachers and other administrators within our schools.\"\n\n\"It is going to not only harden the target through technology but most importantly I believe it's actually going to provide the tools and education needed by those in our schools to recognize those individuals who have the propensity to become active shooters,\" he said. \"That's what this bill does.\"\n\nThe White House has come out in support of the bill, though it would like it amended so that it funds programs to arm teachers. It's still unclear what the bill's fate will be in the Senate, where lawmakers have been even slower to act in the aftermath of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nWhile Democrats overwhelmingly voted in favor of the bill, they also criticized it as being too narrow. \"This bill, on its own, is not the kind of meaningful congressional action needed to address this crisis of gun violence,\" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said in a statement.\n\n\"This must be a first step and it must be followed by a serious effort to pass legislation that expands background checks and ban military-style assault weapons.\"\n\nFlorida Democrat Representative Ted Deutch agreed on CNN Thursday morning, saying \"we can't allow the gun lobby or anyone else to let us -- let anyone -- believe that this is the response to the shooting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Parkland shooting has sparked some states to act in much more dramatic ways. Among them are Florida and Vermont, where Republican governor Phil Scott is pushing for legislation that would make it easier to seize guns from people deemed dangerous.",

                "body": "In the just-completed special congressional race in Pennsylvania, GOP candidate Rick Saccone could not have identified himself more with the president of the United States had he donned a blond wig and chomped a hamburger while tweeting. He appeared with the president twice, the vice-president once, and with various members of Trump's family and Cabinet. And that's after he began the campaign by saying of himself that he was \"Trump before Trump was Trump.\"\n\nIn this respect, Saccone resembled the Republican candidates in last year's Alabama Senate special elections, who all agreed that Trump was the absolute greatest even as they went after each other with claw hammers.\n\nGiven this experience, along with the president's rather healthy ego, he might have normally expected Republican candidates in California to cluster around him during his trip to the Mexican border to view \"wall\" prototypes this week. But as the Los Angeles Times reported, they were remarkably thin on the ground:\n\nA presidential visit in an election year often comes with an entourage of local officials and candidates hoping to catch a photo op or ride his coattails. But in Southern California, a hotbed of the left's resistance out West that could prove crucial in the midterms, many are staying away.\n\nThe Times asked more than a dozen Southern California GOP candidates if they would attend events with Trump. Most of them either did not respond or said they had no plans to join the president.\n\nThe only major GOP elected officials who showed up were lame-duck congressman Darrell Issa and his strange-duck colleague Duncan Hunter, the ethically challenged congressman from a district Trump carried by 15 points.\n\nTo be fair, state legislator Travis Allen, one of the two Republicans struggling for oxygen in the governor's race, was supposed to be there, but he missed his flight. And were any remotely viable Republicans running for the U.S. Senate this year, perhaps they would have been on hand to greet the president -- but as of the filing deadline last week, nobody's making the race against Democratic Dianne Feinstein and Kevin de Leon.\n\nTruth is, these are grim times for California Republicans, and for the most part, they didn't feel inclined to invite the bad vibes associated with Trump and what might as well have been called the I-Hate-California Tour. Or maybe they've noticed that Rick Saccone and those Alabama Senate candidates didn't win.",

But in the special election in Pennsylvania's heavily conservative 18th District, Republicans stopped talking about the tax cut and switched their closing message over to culture war hysteria, telling evidence that the tax cuts no longer played to their favor. When Democrat Conor Lamb won, President Trump retrospectively cast the outcome as a vindication of ... the tax cuts. \"The young man last night that ran, he said, 'Oh, I'm like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything.' He ran on that basis,\" Trump told a fundraiser. In fact, Lamb opposed the tax cuts as a \"complete betrayal of the middle class.\"\n\nSo, faced with this alarming setback, Republicans in Washington are now reconsidering their strategy. You'll never guess what they came up with. Yes, another tax cut.\n\n\"We think even more can be done,\" House Ways & Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady told Fox Business News. \"We want to make sure we're encouraging innovation in America, we want to help families save for the long term.\" Trump is excited. \"It's going to be something very special. Kevin Brady's working on it with me,\" he informed a group of executives (who would no doubt be delighted to learn that Trump wants them to claim an even larger share of the national income). It goes without saying that Lawrence Kudlow, the fanatical supply-sider and incoming head of the National Economic Council, also supports another tax cut bill.\n\nThe Republican Party's one perfect policy idea for every situation turns out to be its preferred solution to this situation.

                "body": "Last night, Ninja, a megapopular star on the live video-game streaming site Twitch, had a special guest on his broadcast -- a gamer who went by the screen name TheBoyDuddus. In real life, you might know TheBoyDuddus as Canadian musician and actor Aubrey Graham, or as the global megastar rapper Drake.\n\nWell past midnight on the East Coast, more than half a million people were watching Ninja and Drake play a game called Fortnite, which has become something of a phenomenon over the past couple of months. Later on in the stream, rapper Travis Scott also joined in, making for one of the oddest mash-ups of internet culture and mainstream pop culture in recent memory. Let's break it down.\n\nWho is Ninja?\n\nNinja -- known IRL as Tyler Blevins -- is a professional gamer. He makes his money (and builds his fan base) on Twitch, a site owned by Amazon where you can broadcast yourself playing video games live to an audience of thousands. Ninja was a pro competitive Halo player before he turned to streaming games as his main profession; he mainly plays (and is known to be very good at) the shooter sensation Fortnite.\n\nWho is Drake?\n\nAubrey Drake Graham is a popular rapper and former child star from Canada.\n\nWhat is Fortnite?\n\nFortnite is a video game made by Epic Games. Long in development, Fortnite was originally presented as a third-person shooter in which players could also use prefab parts -- wall, floors, and ramps that snap together -- to create a base of operations (a \"fort,\" if you will). Think of it like if Minecraft were a shooting game.\n\nFortnite was languishing in development until last year, when it introduced a mode called \"Battle Royale.\" In Battles Royales, 100 players duke it out to be the last living character on an island. Games of this kind have skyrocketed in popularity last year thanks to another immensely popular game, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Fortnite's Battle Royale mode wouldn't exist without PUBG, but its advantage over the earlier PUBG is that it's completely free to play, and is available on all platforms, including PlayStation. (It is also made by a top-tier developer, and has a nice sense of style compared to PUBG.)\n\nSo how did Drake even link up with Ninja?\n\nHow do celebrities do anything nowadays? Instagram. On the stream last night, Drake told Ninja that he first saw highlights on Instagram, including a PUBG tournament that Ninja won last year. \"I've been watching your shit, man,\" Drake said.\n\nAnd it broke a record?\n\nYes. At one point, more than 600,000 people were watching them run around and shoot people at the same time. This is a Twitch record, though it fell a bit short of Ninja's prediction that if Drake tweeted out a link to the stream they'd break a million concurrents. Oh well!\n\nWhat else did Drake reveal on the stream?\n\nHe's mostly making his album in Miami, and he no longer eats meat. He also likes pineapple pizza.\n\nSo ... is Drake any good at Fornite?\n\nHe's okay. He said he's been playing for a month or two, and the pair won at least a couple of matches, but it's difficult to know how much of that was Drake and how much of that was the fact that Drake was playing with one of the best Fortnite players in the world.\n\nWho else joined in?\n\nRapper Travis Scott was there.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster also squadded up for a bit.\n\nTravis Scott's request for bandages, the game's healing item, became an in-joke.\n\nFile-piracy magnate Kim Dotcom also popped on for a second.\n\nAre there funny posts about all of this?\n\nYes!",

                "title": "Trumpism Doesn't Divide GOP Voters  --  But Conservatism Does",
                "body": "On Capitol Hill, Republicans are united by their support for slashing taxes on the wealthy, and their opposition to increasing social spending on the poor. Congressman Steve King and Senator Susan Collins disagree about many things -- among them the propriety of the president's tweets, the benefits of legal immigration, and whether nonwhite people have ever contributed anything to \"civilization\" -- but they nevertheless share a deep and abiding commitment to making the tax code more regressive.\n\nWhich is to say, the bitterest divisions among Republican elected officials, commentators, and operatives appear to lie on \"culture war\" issues; chiefly, on questions of immigration policy, racial rhetoric, and how unconditional one's loyalty should be to Donald Trump's personality cult.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Democrats often appear most united on (what are conventionally referred to as) issues of social and cultural liberalism. During the 2016 primary, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton boasted nearly identical platforms on abortion, LGBT rights, criminal-justice reform, and immigration. But they argued bitterly over the desirability of single-payer health care, tuition-free public college, and breaking up the major Wall Street banks. In recent weeks, this internal division over the size and role of government has come back to the foreground, as a bill loosening post-2008 financial regulations sparked an acrimonious spat between the right and left flanks of Chuck Schumer's caucus.\n\nAll this has led many pundits to believe that Donald Trump's \"brand of hard-edge nationalism\" has sown divisions within the GOP base -- and even chased a significant number of moderate Republicans out of the party, while Democratic voters are split between Sanders-style social democrats and Clintonian \"neoliberals.\"\n\nBut a new working paper from Vanderbilt University political scientist Larry Bartels suggests this conventional wisdom is wrong. In truth, Republican voters are united by their support for Trump's reactionary nationalism, and divided on questions of taxes and spending -- while the Democratic base is bound together by its support for \"big government,\" but somewhat divided by culture war issues.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, YouGov surveyed the same 2,000 Americans about their views on the major parties and a wide range of policy issues. In November 2017, Bartels checked up on those same 2,000 individuals to see how the 2016 campaign had impacted their ideological views and partisan identities. Here's what he found:\n\n[T]he current conventional wisdom regarding the bases of conflict within each party seems, judging from my analysis, to be quite mistaken. Democrats are supposed to be split between \"the young progressives\" drawn to Sanders's democratic socialism (Yglesias 2016) and an old guard committed to the neoliberalism of the Clintons and Joe Biden. In fact, however, rank and file Democrats are relatively united in their enthusiasm for an active government, but less united on cultural issues, where a sizable minority cling to the traditional values downplayed or even rejected by most party leaders.\n\nConversely...rank and file Republicans seem to be relatively united and energized by \"hard-edge nationalism,\" but less united on the role of government, with a sizeable minority expressing rather un-Republican enthusiasm for a strong welfare state...a majority of Republicans endorse government efforts to regulate pollution, provide a decent standard of living for people unable to work, and ensure access to good health care, while substantial minorities favor reducing income differences and helping families pay for child care and college.\n\nRemarkably, Bartels finds \"no evidence in these data that Trump has alienated traditional Republicans -- at least, not to the point of precipitating defections from the party.\" Only 21 of the participants in YouGov's survey defected from the Republican Party in 2015 to the Democratic Party in 2017. And these voters were not more highly educated -- nor much more socially or culturally liberal -- than the average Republican. Coincidentally, exactly 21 respondents made the opposite partisan switch between 2015 and 2017. And these voters did look about as one would expect: While they tended to be a tad more conservative than the average Democrat on \"limited government\" issues, voters who defected to Trump's GOP were far to the right of the generic blue American issues of \"culture conservatism.\"\n\nNow, this is just one study. And other surveys have shown a more significant decline in Republican self-identification than the one Bartels found. But his conclusions about the nature of intraparty divides among Democratic and Republican bases are buttressed by other studies of the electorate and single-issue polls.\n\nAnd yet, none of this means that the conventional wisdom about the \"the bases of conflict within each party\" is wrong. After all, we don't live in a direct democracy, but rather, a deeply dysfunctional republic -- one in which the average member of Congress is a millionaire, the average House race costs more than $10 million to win, and corporations spend roughly $2.6 billion each year on lobbying. A sizable minority (if not a slim majority) of Republican voters support raising taxes on the superrich to fund more generous health-insurance subsidies for the middle-class -- but that hasn't prevented GOP lawmakers from almost unanimously supporting the opposite proposition.\n\nMeanwhile, just because Democratic voters are united in their support for \"big government\" liberalism doesn't mean that the party isn't riven by internal conflicts over the size and scale of the welfare and regulatory states. Democratic candidates need money to win elections; corporations have a great deal of that stuff, and tend to be more comfortable with the party's social liberalism than with its economically populist streak. And one consequence of this reality is that Chuck Schumer is currently helping Mitch McConnell increase the probability of a future financial crisis.\n\nSimilarly, just because one-fourth of Democratic voters think Trump has a point about standing for the national anthem, building a border wall, and the scourge of \"reverse racism,\" doesn't mean one-fourth of Democratic lawmakers are likely to feel the same: Such attitudes are disproportionately concentrated in non-college-educated voters, and there are very few of those in Congress. The fact that an elite socioeconomic and educational background is virtually a prerequisite for federal office in the U.S. means that our representatives tend to be more economically conservative, and culturally liberal, than their constituents. And this bent is reinforced by campaign finance pressures.\n\nAll of which is to say: Conventional wisdom is largely right about the most salient divisions in both parties -- but wrong in assuming that those divisions are rooted in popular opinion. Political journalists should make a greater effort to mind this distinction; otherwise, they risk conveying the impression that there is a significant constituency for Paul Ryan's austerity budgets -- and broad, public consensus in favor of financial deregulation -- when all available evidence points to the opposite conclusion.",

                "body": "Shortly before the 2016 election, longtime Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen arranged a payment of $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with Donald Trump a decade earlier. When news outlets revealed the existence of this alleged \"hush agreement\" in recent months, Cohen claimed he paid Daniels (real name Stephanie Clifford) out of his own pocket. He wouldn't explain his motivation, but insisted it had nothing to do with his boss's business or campaign.\n\n\"Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,\" Cohen said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders once referred to a temporary restraining order Cohen obtained against Clifford by saying the arbitration was won \"in the president's favor,\" but both the Cohen and the White House have insisted that he was acting independently.\n\nThat's why it's so odd that the arbitration demand dated February 22, 2018 lists a second Trump Organization lawyer, Jill Martin, as counsel for Essential Consultants LLC, the company Cohen set up to make the payment to Clifford.\n\nMartin is the first Trump attorney aside from Cohen linked to the case, and it's unclear if she was involved prior to the arbitration filing. Like Cohen, Martin claimed that when she signed the documents she was working in a private capactity, not for the Trump Organization - though she is still employed at the company full-time, and used the address of her office at the Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles on the documents.\n\nMartin replied to inquiries from CNN and the Wall Street Journal, which broke the story, with a statement from the company: \"The Trump Organization is not representing anyone and, with the exception of one of its California based attorneys in her individual capacity facilitating the initial filing ... the company has had no involvement in the matter.\"\n\nMartin has also denied any involvement in the Trump campaign, though she spoke on Trump's behalf several times throughout the 2016 race. For instance, in October 2016 she appeared on CNN to defend her boss from multiple allegations of sexual harassment, saying, \"I've seen him around women. Thousands of women that have worked for him including myself and he's treated us with nothing but respect and appropriately.\"\n\nClifford filed a lawsuit against Trump last week, alleging that their contract isn't valid because he never signed it, so she should be able to tell her story. Her attorney, Michael Avenatti, shared the arbitration filings that were signed by Martin.\n\n\"We are uncovering more and more evidence that demonstrates that the American people have not been told the truth,\" he said. \"We will not stop until we get to the bottom of this.\"",

                "title": "6 Weird and Worrying Moments From Trump's MO Donor Speech",
                "body": "Following a string of particularly damaging controversies, President Trump let loose in recent days by taking steps to launch a global trade war, announcing he'd sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and firing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Unsurprisingly, the Trumpiness has been turned up to 11 in private as well. The Washington Post, The Atlantic, and Politico obtained audio recordings of a closed-door speech to donors on Wednesday in Missouri, which featured some new Trump gems, and/or terrifying insights into how the president views the world. Here are some of the standout moments.\n\nTrump Bragged About the Time He Gave Trudeau Made Up Facts About Trade\n\nTrump recalled insisting to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the U.S. has a trade deficit with his country, though he had no idea whether that was true. Per the Post:\n\n\"Trudeau came to see me. He's a good guy, Justin. He said, 'No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,' \" Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio obtained by The Washington Post. \"Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in -- 'Donald, we have no trade deficit.' He's very proud because everybody else, you know, we're getting killed.\n\n\"... So, he's proud. I said, 'Wrong, Justin, you do.' I didn't even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, 'You're wrong.' You know why? Because we're so stupid. ... And I thought they were smart. I said, 'You're wrong, Justin.' He said, 'Nope, we have no trade deficit.' I said, 'Well, in that case, I feel differently,' I said, 'but I don't believe it.' I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, 'Check, because I can't believe it.'\n\n'Well, sir, you're actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn't include energy and timber. ... And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.' It's incredible.\"\n\nIt's no big revelation that Trump says things that are wildly false, and he actually told a version of the Trudeau story during a December rally in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nIn the Florida speech, Trump claimed he knew he was right because \"we don't have a surplus with anybody.\" (The U.S. has a trade surplus with many countries.) The new twist in Wednesday's remarks was Trump's admission that he had no idea if what he was telling Trudeau was accurate. (\"I didn't even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, 'You're wrong.'\")\n\nTrump's assertion that he just happened to be correct is false. As the Canadian Press noted in December:\n\nStatistics from the website of the office of the U.S. Trade Representatives - the very office handling NAFTA negotiations - paints an opposite portrait to the one Trump paints. It says, of last year's trade balance: \"The U.S. goods and services trade surplus with Canada was US$12.5-billion in 2016.\"\n\nThat includes a large surplus in trade in services of $24.6-billion, mitigated by a deficit in goods of $12.1-billion.\n\nTrump Revisited His Threat to Pull U.S. Troops Out of South Korea\n\nDuring a tirade about how various allies are swindling the U.S., Trump alluded to pulling U.S. forces out of South Korea if they don't give him what he wants on trade.\n\n\"We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,\" Trump said. \"We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let's see what happens.\"\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump accused Japan and South Korea of not paying enough for their own defense on several occasions, and threatened to withdraw the 80,000 troops stationed there primarily to deter North Korea. As president, Trump backed off on talk of removing the U.S. military presence, but he has called on the nations to pay more for their defense.\n\nTrump Agreed to Kim Jong-un Meeting to Stick It to His Predecessors\n\nIt seems Trump still doesn't understand that he or any other U.S. president could have met North Korea's leader at any time, as Pyongyang sees a U.S.-North Korean summit as a pinnacle of respectability. Trump mocked former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush during the speech, claiming \"they couldn't have met\" with Kim. \"Nobody would have done what I did,\" he added.\n\nHe summed up his predecessors' position on North Korea saying, \"It's called appeasement, please don't do anything.\"\n\nTrump claimed his bellicose rhetoric and tough sanctions led to a breakthrough on North Korea, and said the South Koreans told him Kim had promised not to do any nuclear tests or missile launches until the summit takes place (as the Post notes, \"That comment could not be verified\").\n\nTrump also mocked the media for doubting his diplomatic genius \"He's going to get us in a war,\" he said, imitating a news anchor. \"You know what's going to get us in a war? Weakness.\"\n\nTrump Laments \"Bowling Ball Test\" No One Has Heard Of\n\nTrump claimed Japan uses a test that sounds physically impossible to pass to keep U.S. auto companies from selling their vehicles to Japanese consumers. Per the Post:\n\n\"It's the bowling ball test. They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car,\" Trump said of Japan. \"If the hood dents, the car doesn't qualify. It's horrible,\" he said. It was unclear what he was talking about.\n\nTrump Said Democrat Conor Lamb Won in P.A. Because He's \"Like Trump\"\n\nDemocrats can stop gloating about winning a Pennsylvania congressional race in a district Trump took by 20 points. In Trump's telling, the important takeaway is that his rally for Rick Saccone significantly boosted a subpar-GOP candidate. From The Atlantic:\n\n\"We had an interesting time because we lifted [Saccone] seven points up. That's a lot,\" Trump said. \"And I was up 22 points, and we lifted seven, and seven normally would be enough, but we'll see how it all comes out. It's, like, virtually a tie.\" (It was not exactly clear what Trump was basing his conclusion of a seven-point boost on.)\n\nAlso Democrat Conor Lamb only won because he embraced Trump:\n\n\"The young man last night that ran, he said, 'Oh, I'm like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything.' He ran on that basis,\" Trump said. \"He ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me. I said, 'Is he a Republican? He sounds like a Republican to me.'\"\n\nLamb actually ran against the GOP tax law, but that didn't stop House Speaker Paul Ryan from making similar excuses.\n\nFirst Rule of Tax Reform: Don't Call It Tax Reform\n\nTrump offered some advice to Republicans: despite mounting evidence that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act isn't going to save the GOP this fall, they should still run on the issue. However, they mustn't call it \"tax reform.\"\n\n\"Do me a favor: Don't call it tax reform. It hasn't worked in 45 years,\" Trump said he told people involved in the midterms. \"You say you're reforming taxes, that means taxes could go up.\"\n\nTrump recalled that he wanted to call it the \"Tax Cut Cut Cut\" plan.\n\n\"They thought it sounded a little hokey and called it something else,\" he said. \"I liked the first one better.\"\n\nIt's not clear if Trump believes the many outlandish things he said on Wednesday, or if he's giving us all the Trudeau treatment. Either way, it's not good.",

                "title": "No, Mike Pompeo Isn't Going to Save the State Department",
                "body": "If and when Mike Pompeo is confirmed as secretary of State, he will inherit a department that has not only spent the past few decades losing ground to the Pentagon as the prime mover of U.S. foreign policy, but was also systematically gutted by his predecessor Rex Tillerson, who downsized the agency and pushed out droves of professional diplomats with centuries of collective experience.\n\nGiven that Tillerson's only real legacy at State is one of painful cuts, staff attrition, rampant demoralization, and failed corporate-style management, it is natural to hope that his successor, however odious his politics may be, will at least prove a better manager on account of actually having a background in government service. This hope was expressed on Tuesday in pieces like this one from the Associated Press, which wishfully asserted that \"his conservative political bent and closeness to President Donald Trump could breathe new vigor into an agency all too often sidelined on many of the nation's most pressing national security matters.\"\n\nTillerson, of course, lacked both Trump's ear and his confidence. The AP also noted that Pompeo's leadership of the Central Intelligence Agency was more focused on agility and delegation than Tillerson's micromanaging approach at State. Pompeo is seen as a more forceful personality than Tillerson and could prove a more commanding presence on the world stage.\n\nEven former ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, perhaps the second least likely person in the world to stand up for Mike Pompeo after Hillary Clinton herself, took to the opinion page of the New York Times to suggest that, if he wanted to, Pompeo could restore the State Department to its former glory and save it from utter irrelevance. In her op-ed, Power suggested that the secretary-designate move quickly to fill all of our empty ambassadorships, take steps to attract new Foreign Service officers, and change rules that discourage former employees from coming back to the department.\n\nYet Power also acknowledged that Pompeo was a driving force behind the endless partisan investigation into the 2012 attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others dead. A man who played such an outsize role in politicizing the position he is now poised to assume, for the thinly-veiled purpose of damaging Barack Obama's presidency and Clinton's own political ambitions, seems particularly unlikely to Make American Diplomacy Professional Again.\n\n\"It may be that no Trump appointee can ... attract diplomats to serve under a commander in chief who seems to hold diplomacy in contempt,\" Power wrote. \"But Mr. Pompeo has to try.\"\n\nWill he, though? Indeed, is that even what he's being put there to do?\n\nWhile history may remember Tillerson as one of the least competent and effectual secretaries of state in modern American history, in the final analysis, that's not why he was fired. Tillerson lost his job because for all his many faults, he wasn't a yes-man: He didn't flatter Trump's ego or back up his obviously wrong positions. He refused to participate in the lie that Russia didn't really meddle in our elections. He even got caught calling the president a \"moron.\" He neither sought nor needed Trump's approval.\n\nIndeed, the fundamental irony of Tillerson's ouster is that for how bad he was at his job, at the end of the day, it was trying to do it well that did him in. In this context, there is little reason to believe that Mike Pompeo's State Department will function much more effectively than his predecessor's. The facts before us suggest that it's not really intended to.\n\nUp to this point, the main obstacle to diplomacy in this administration was not Tillerson, but Trump himself. Yes, it was ridiculous that Tillerson had his staff print out Trump's tweets (presumably including the one that fired him) so that he could find out what the policy agenda was for the day, but what's even more ridiculous is a president issuing foreign policy directives on Twitter in the first place.\n\nIn their Tillerson post-mortem at Politico, Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky pointed out that Trump has never taken diplomacy or the State Department seriously. Tillerson's ham-fisted downsizing of the department was neither accidental nor his own idea; Trump put him there to do just that. Had Tillerson been a better manager it might have helped stanch the bleeding of talent from the Foreign Service, but it would not have made much difference to his success, because Trump has never understood the point of having a secretary of State in the first place, or of having anyone other than himself speak to the world on behalf of the United States. To understand Trump's opinion of the State Department, one need look no further than his proposal last month to under-fund it by nearly $9 billion.\n\nPompeo's main appeal to Trump, meanwhile, is that he shares the president's disdain for civilian diplomacy as a means of solving problems and advancing the American agenda internationally. On the policy side, that means the Iran nuclear deal is on even thinner ice and war with North Korea is that much more likely. The best-case scenario is that because Pompeo is simpatico with Trump's hawkish attitudes, he can get him to listen to reason and calm down when he really goes off the rails.\n\nOn the personnel side, meanwhile, it's hard to see how a deeply partisan, military-first, hardcore Islamophobe transplanted from the CIA, whose chances of survival in his role may depend solely on his willingness to validate Trump's worst instincts, will convince all the professional diplomats who have left the department in the past year to come back. Tillerson's mismanagement may have been the proximate cause of their departures, but the more fundamental issue remains that the president clearly doesn't think the work they do matters.",

                "title": "Trump Floats 'DACA Extension for Wall Money' Deal",
                "body": "For most of last year, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle saw Donald Trump's border wall as a joke. The policy lacked support from any major lobby or D.C. think tank. Democrats and Republicans from border areas -- where voters weren't crazy about the government screwing with their land -- hated the proposal. Fiscal conservatives weren't anxious to blow money on the boondoggle, and even immigration hardliners weren't nearly as invested in the idea as they were in denying \"amnesty\" to \"illegals\" and restricting legal immigration.\n\nBut by January 2018, Trump had achieved the politically impossible: By strengthening his grip on the GOP base -- and taking 800,000 American-raised, undocumented immigrants hostage -- the president had gotten Senate Democrats to offer him $25 billion in border-wall funding, in exchange for permanent protections for former DACA recipients.\n\nAnd Trump turned them down.\n\nDespite the fact that Trump officially supported legal status for Dreamers and had made a border wall the centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, the president refused to accept Chuck Schumer's proposal. Instead, the great deal-maker insisted that Democrats also agree to support cutting legal immigration in half, even though such a measure did not even have enough Republican support to pass the Senate, and thus, was never going to happen.\n\nNow, as Congress prepares to pass its last major spending bill before the November midterms, Trump has apparently realized his mistake. To pass an omnibus bill, Republicans need Democratic support in the Senate -- and Democrats won't vote for border-wall funding unless its paired with relief for Dreamers. And if wall money isn't included in this bill, it's quite possible that it will never be appropriated in any legislation: At the moment, it appears highly likely that Democrats will retake the House this November.\n\nTo this point, the strongest opposition to legal status for Dreamers has been concentrated in the House GOP's right wing. It's quite possible that, in the wake of a wave election, a Republican Senate would be willing to work with a Democratic House on a conventional Dream Act -- i.e., amnesty for some subset of Dreamers combined with a bit of border-security funding. And then, there is even an outside chance that Schumer could be Majority Leader next year. Regardless, the chances that a Democratic House would vote for border-wall funding in 2019 are exceedingly slim.\n\nThus, Trump is desperately trying to get back to the negotiating table. As the Washington Post reports:\n\nWhite House officials have told key Republican leaders on Capitol Hill that President Trump is open to cutting a deal in an upcoming spending bill to protect young immigrants from deportation in exchange for border wall funding, according to four GOP officials briefed on the talks.\n\nOne idea under consideration is a three-year extension of the DACA program in exchange for three years of wall funding, a GOP official said. This official said the talks, which are being led by senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and legislative affairs head Marc Short, were fluid.\n\nBut the Republican leadership would rather leave Dreamers in limbo than alienate their right flank ahead of a must-pass spending bill. As Politico notes:\n\n\"I don't get the sense it's getting serious traction,\" said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who said there was no talk of it during a party meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn fact, conservative House Republicans said that such a move could threaten House Speaker Paul Ryan's standing among the party's right flank. Ryan is under pressure to pass a conservative immigration bill written by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), not punt.\n\n\"It would jeopardize the stability of leadership,\" said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), an immigration hard-liner. \"Forcing amnesty into a must-pass bill? That's beyond the toleration level [of] conservatives in this conference.\"\n\nAnd while Democrats would like to give Dreamers some protection from deportation, they're surely both conscious of the fact that they're likely to have more leverage on the issue next year -- and ambivalent about the prospect of legislating a new category of second-class citizenship (which is what transforming DACA from an administrative policy to a written law would entail).\n\nIt's possible that the White House will be able to bring Congress around on a short-term \"DACA for wall money\" deal. But for the moment, it sure looks like the deal-maker-in-chief negotiated his way out of fulfilling his No. 1 campaign promise.",

                "body": "Maybe the truth really is out there.\n\nA UFO research group on Friday released a declassified Pentagon video that apparently shows a U.S. Navy aircraft encountering a UFO, the third such video released in recent months. Published by the group To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science, whose founders include former Blink-182 guitarist Tom DeLonge, the video shows a Navy F-18 fighter jet filming a mysterious aircraft off the East Coast in 2015.\n\n\"What the fuck is that thing?\" someone says after after locking in on the object. \"Wow, what is that, man?\"\n\nLuis Elizondo, the former head of a Pentagon program that investigated UFOs and current member of To the Stars Academy, told CNN that the video is \"the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\n\"These are just three videos now that have come out that everybody's looking at,\" said Elizondo, who's been accused of being a little overzealous in his hyping of similar UFO videos. \"But there is far more compelling evidence that I was privy to.\"\n\nThe oddities of the newly released video include the vehicles lack of wings and, as Popular Mechanics notes, its apparent coldness.\n\nThere are several unusual things about this sighting. For one, the UFO does not have an hot exhaust trail typical of that emitted by any sort of conventional turbine engine. In fact, the UFO appears \"cold\" to the ATFLIR sensor, emitting no heat at all.\n\nElizondo, who has advocated for more government transparency on unidentified flying objects, told CNN that he doesn't know what the object is but that there should be more conversation about it. \"It could be anything, so I wouldn't rule anything out, and that's why I think we need to look at it,\" Elizondo said. \"I mean it could be Russian. It could be Chinese. It could be little green men from Mars.\"\n\nOddly, this is only the second-weirdest piece of space-related news this week, trailing NASA's revelation that astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA transformed during the year he spent in space. Now his DNA no longer matches that of his twin brother, Mark, who was on Earth while Scott was in orbit.",

                "title": "Lamb Win Could Point to Dem Comeback in Lily-white Districts",
                "body": "In all the slicing and dicing of the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania during the immediate wake of the March 13 special election, we've heard a lot about its recent Republican character, its strong support for Donald Trump in 2016, and its \"Trump country\" character as a place with both a large white working-class population and upscale suburbs. But as Ron Brownstein points out, there's something even more basic about Pennsylvania's 18th district that's of interest:\n\nWhites comprise nearly 94 percent of the district's total population -- a share that's greater than all but six districts' nationwide.\n\nIndeed, notes Brownstein, in 2016 Trump won 42 of the 45 congressional districts with a white percentage of over 90 percent of voters, and Democrats hold only 7 of them in the House.\n\nToward the other end of the spectrum, there are (as of 2015) 122 congressional districts where a majority of voters are nonwhite, and Republicans hold only 20 of them. Democrats definitely represent the kind of diverse coalitions that should make them increasingly powerful in the future.\n\nBut for the more immediate future, the ability to compete in lily-white districts (presumably without sacrificing any basic progressive commitments) could definitely help Democrats win and maintain a House majority.\n\nOne of the big adverse trends Democrats have been fighting is a slide in the heavily white areas of the upper Midwest, especially during the 2010 and 2014 midterms. In the latter year, for example, Democrats lost a Senate seat and two of the four House districts they previously controlled in 92 percent white Iowa. In 2016, Iowa, which had gone for Barack Obama twice, voted for Trump by a shocking 9 percent margin, with its racial (and to some extent educational) composition being the most obvious explanation. The slide of 86 percent white Wisconsin into Trump's column, and the near loss of 87 percent white Minnesota, also showed how much Democrats were beginning to struggle with these monochromatic areas.\n\nAnd the trend is not confined to the Midwest: In 2014, the 96 percent white second congressional district of Maine elected a Republican for the first time in 20 years, and then in 2016 the same district was carried by a Republican presidential candidate for the first time since 1988.\n\nSo while Democrats trying to pick off red-state Republican members of Congress or win Republican states in presidential elections are mostly putting together the classic coalition of a significant minority \"base\" and then just enough white \"swing\" voters to get across the finish line, there are places where that strategy's just not available. The special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district shows that they can again win in such territory under the right circumstances. It helps if a strong labor-movement infrastructure is in place, and if the GOP finds ways to lose its advantages.",

                "title": "Mike Pompeo Has a Problem With Islam",
                "body": "In June of 2013, two months after the bombing at the Boston Marathon, then-Congressman Mike Pompeo took to the House floor and criticized Muslim leaders across the country for failing to condemn the attack, even though many of them had. This alleged \"silence\" made \"Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts\" of terrorism, said Pompeo, who will be the next secretary of State if President Trump gets his way.\n\nPompeo's history as an Islamophobe is no secret, and given his statement on the House floor, not something he's ever tried to hide. But given his potential ascendance to secretary of State, statements like the one above and his acceptance of an award from ACT for America, a group classified as the \"largest anti-Muslim group in the United States\" by the Anti-Defamation League, are drawing new scrutiny.\n\n\"As the top diplomat for the United States, it is crucial that the Secretary of State carries out a foreign policy agenda that doesn't marginalize American communities,\" Hoda Hawa, of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told Huffington Post. \"Pompeo has shown, both as a Member of Congress and as the CIA Director, that his personal feelings inform his policies.\"\n\nNihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Pompeo should have \"no role in our nation's government, let alone at the highest levels of policy-making.\"\n\nHis appointment has \"the potential to harm our nation's image and our relations with key players in the international community,\" Awad said in a statement.\n\nPompeo's Islamophobe credentials are without dispute. He has fought for years to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, a move that even the Trump administration has refused to make. He was once a regular guest on the radio show of Frank Gaffney, where he once agreed with the notoriously anti-Muslim host that President Obama had an \"affinity\" for ISIS. And in 2016, he claimed that \"people who deeply believe that Islam is the way\" are a \"threat to America.\"\n\nHaving an anti-Muslim bigot in Congress or even leading the CIA, as Pompeo has been for 14 months, is one thing, but that same bigot ascending to the role of the nation's top diplomat is quite another. Writing for NBC News, Muslim lawyer and activist Arsalan Iftikhar says that nominating Pompeo proves that \"pluralistic diplomacy towards the Muslim world is not even remotely important\" to Donald Trump.\n\nDespite the criticism from Muslim activists, it's unclear if any Senators will oppose Pompeo because of his bigotry. Those who have already declared their opposition to his nomination cite other concerns, including his apparent eagerness to go to war with Iran and his support for torture.\n\nWhatever their reasoning, though, Senators seem poised to give Pompeo a more thorough vetting than the one he received last year when he was confirmed as CIA head. \"I'm giving him a new look because the CIA director has virtually no policy responsibilities, and as secretary of State he'll have responsibility in a lot of areas,\" said Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse this week. If he looks very hard, he's sure to be disturbed.",

                "title": "What It's Like to Take a Road Trip With the Tesla Model 3",
                "body": "The Tesla Model 3 is supposed to represent the future of the automobile, and I hope it does -- even if I found the future to be a somewhat bewildering place to be.\n\nTesla lent me a Model 3 for a weekend to drive to upstate New York, where my extremely pregnant wife and I were headed for a baby shower thrown by her relatives outside of Syracuse. We're having our first child, a daughter, and feeling her kick and move around has done a number on my own worldview, bringing what once felt incredibly distant into the immediate foreground.\n\nBarring Peter Thiel-ian transfusions of youthful blood, I will not live to see the year 2100. My daughter, on the other hand, has a very decent shot at seeing that. If she should have children, they will almost certainly see the 22nd century. Stories about a world where the equator is uninhabitable, Miami is underwater, and the Corn Belt resembles the Kalahari Desert suddenly feel less like hearing news about an earthquake in a country I never planned to visit and more like a buzzing alert on my phone about oncoming flash floods. Abstract notions I held about carbon emissions and climate change (both are, like, bad) have taken on a new urgency, and the idea of driving up for a party celebrating the oncoming arrival of our daughter in a car that, in its own small way, promises to help reduce carbon emissions was tremendously appealing.\n\nKind of a heavy way to start a car review! (Or a weekend trip upstate for a baby shower.) But it was on my mind as I picked up the Model 3 from Tesla's glassy showroom in the Meatpacking District. If the world is going to move from using fossil-fueled vehicles to electric vehicles, it'll be partly because of cars like the Model 3. You can't get the majority of the car-buying public to consider an EV until the price is somewhere in the neighborhood of reasonable. (The Model 3 starts at $35,000, though the model Tesla lent me had enough add-ons to drive the price to $57,000 -- the big-ticket additions being a long-range battery and Enhanced Autopilot.) You also need EVs that have the range and infrastructure that allow for freedom of long-distance travel that Americans have come to associate with car ownership.\n\nExcept for a short test drive in February, I'd never driven a Tesla before. The first time you take a seat behind the wheel of the Model 3, it's an odd experience, mainly because of what's missing. Behind the steering wheel there's nothing -- no instrument panel, no speedometer, no tachometer, no odometer, and of course, no fuel gauge -- just the smooth expanse of the single piece of wood that makes up the dashboard. Instead, everything is shifted to a 15-inch touchscreen display that sits in the center dash. There's no key fob to stick on a ring of keys -- the car instead pairs with your smartphone (you also get two backup hotel-key type things in case your phone dies), and unlocks itself automatically when you get near it. And once you start the car, there's no noise -- the sound of a Tesla completely powered down and the sound of one ready to drive (at least from inside the cabin) are identical.\n\nThe immediate experience of driving a Model 3 is that it is fun. The Model 3's high-torque motor means that you can jet forward smoothly and almost silently, without shifting gears. The first few times you do it, it feels uncanny, like you're floating slightly above the road. A tight and responsive suspension means the car stays glued to the road even during sharp cornering, and allows for quick and easy lane changes. The car's navigation system is, at first blush, the best I've used -- you can press a button on the steering wheel to turn on voice control, spit out an address, and the car will automatically route you to where you're going, automatically figuring in stops you may need to make along the way to charge the batteries. (And to its great credit, it never stumbled on some of the harder upstate and capital-region city names -- whether it was taking us to Schenectady, Herkimer, or Marcellus, the car got it right the first time.)\n\nAnd if you've never driven an electric vehicle before, there are all of these small things about combustion engines you've never noticed until they aren't there. The most obvious, of course, is the lack of engine noise. On city streets, that means you're suddenly much more aware of the sound of all of the traffic around you. On highways, that means the loudest noise will be the wind hitting the car, or the whoosh of semi as you pass it.\n\nTesla's high-torque electric motor also doesn't require the gears a standard combustion engine needs. In practice, this means that what I've spent the last two decades experiencing -- the slight hitch of deceleration from shifting gears as a car gets up to speed -- is completely absent. Step on the accelerator and there's just a smooth, linear progression of speed, instead of spiky upward jerks.\n\nThat said, I spent most of my trip not even touching the accelerator. The car Tesla lent me had Enhanced Autopilot. Tap down once on the right stalk on the steering column and you engage adaptive cruise control -- you set your maximum speed, and radar and sensors on the car will attempt to get as close to that speed as possible while also keeping a set amount of distance between you and the car in front of you. This is nice on a highway with free-flowing traffic, and a godsend for slow-moving or stop-start highway traffic jams endemic to any major metro area. If the Tesla's sensors can detect the lane you're in, you tap down twice on the right-side stalk, and Autopilot will take over steering for you -- the car stays in the center of the lane and moves you gracefully through turns. In general, I found Autopilot remarkably reliable -- the one time I had any real issue was when a separate lane was merging in from the right and someone cut in a little close to our car. It certainly made the drive much more relaxing -- the constant slight negotiations of speed that I'm used to making with the dumb cruise control in our Mazda were gone. If anything, the more dangerous part of Autopilot happened not when it was engaged, but when I would forget to turn it back on, and wonder why the car wasn't turning itself as we slowly veered toward the rumble strip on the highway shoulder.\n\nAbout 75 percent of the issues I had with the Model 3 during the weekend I chalk up to me being dumb. I didn't know how to turn the car off the first time I parked it in my driveway, so I had to sheepishly text a Tesla rep (set it in park and walk away -- the car shuts itself off and locks itself up once your phone is far enough away). At a supercharger station in Kingston, I couldn't figure out how to get the charger out of the car until a very nice guy with the flyaway hair of a STEM professor, who was charging his own Model S, came over to admire the Model 3, and helped me out. (\"Dad, you are obsessed with the Model 3,\" complained his teenage son. \"I am!\" he happily replied.) The morning after the baby shower -- after packing the car up with our luggage, boxes of baby clothes, swaddling blankets, and an absurd number of baby shoes -- I stepped out to get one more picture of the Model 3 against the hills of my wife's grandfather's farm when my phone died. My wallet (with the backup key card) was inside the Tesla, meaning we were suddenly locked out of the car. I ended up bumming a ride and some money from my father-in-law to pick up a charging cable in order to get back into the car.\n\nBut if there are plenty of problems I brought on myself, there are still some parts of the Model 3 that baffle me. Touchscreens are fantastic when I'm holding one in my hand or lap, but shunting so much of the basic functionality in a car to a touchscreen feels dicey. For example, adjusting the max speed on the cruise control currently requires tapping small plus or minus signs on the left side of the touchscreen. But without any tactile or physical buttons, you have to take your eyes away from the road to make sure you're hitting the right spot.\n\nAdjusting side-view mirrors requires a few taps on the touchscreen and is a few too many menus deep. Windshield wipers are supposed to kick in automatically in the rain, but they didn't kick in during light snow, meaning I needed to swipe on the touchscreen and then tap to start them up. Ask the Tesla's in-car music-streaming service Slacker to play a band or podcast it's never heard of, and it pops up a massive search window that hides your navigation completely. All new cars come with a learning curve, and a lot of what I'm describing are things I'd figure out after a week with the car, but it all felt much more dangerous during the first hour of driving. Hunting for a tiny X button to get rid of a massive pop-up screen while another car does a Jersey sweep in front of you is not ideal.\n\nThere's also the fact that Autopilot and adaptive cruise control rely on front radar sensors. Twice during our trip, we drove through light patches of snow -- nothing heavy enough to begin to stick to roads, but enough to stick to the front bumper. The front radar sensors went offline, meaning cruise control was completely off. I don't want Autopilot or adaptive cruise control to attempt to work if the sensors are on the fritz, but if I'm driving on dry roads, I'd like the option of at least engaging the same sort of dumb cruise control I had on my 1992 Volvo station wagon, which just keeps me at a constant speed; it was when I was driving without cruise control that I really noticed how that hitchless acceleration that made the Tesla so fun to drive also meant that even a feathery touch on the accelerator could send an unwary driver like me smoothly and silently into \"reckless-driving ticket\" territory.\n\nAs it was, I found myself pulling over at rest stops twice during our trip to wipe down the front of the Model 3 with a scarf to get cruise control back. Tesla says that it doesn't include a nonadaptive cruise control out of fear that drivers would get confused by too many options -- they'd be so used to using adaptive cruise control, they might end up hitting someone because they expect the car to handle braking as they approach someone going slower than them on the highway. It's a valid concern, but scrubbing the front of the car at a rest stop wasn't fun either.\n\nAnd then there are the issues of lithium-ion batteries and cold weather. We stopped overnight at my in-law's house in Schenectady, where the temperatures dropped below freezing. When we set out in the morning, the car showed a range of 109 miles. We told the onboard computer where we were headed, and the car recommended stopping at a supercharging station outside of Utica, about 77 miles away, where the car estimated that we'd have about 10 percent battery left. As we drove, that estimate of how much battery life we'd have left kept dropping. Finally, we started getting warnings from the car itself -- we needed to travel at 70 miles per hour in order to reach the charging station, and then 65 miles per hour. By the time we pulled into the charging station, we had (per the Tesla) about five miles of range left on the car, and 2 percent battery. Tesla's trip-planning software uses a combination of information about past driving behavior, internal and external temperature, and topography (to determine if you're driving uphill or downhill) to make its estimates, but the company also says that many other factors -- headwinds, tire condition, whether you have a window open or not -- can come into play. Regardless, shaving it so close wasn't fun -- a case of what Tesla owners (and Tesla itself) calls \"range anxiety.\"\n\nMore time with a Tesla would likely teach me that freezing temperatures meant that I should be more conservative than its navigation software. There was a supercharging station much closer that we could have stopped at earlier in the trip. But in the absence of more information, I trusted what the car told me.\n\nA lot of what I'm bitching about here are UX and software problems -- and Tesla promises that over-the-air updates will take care of some of these issues. It's well aware that the windshield-wiper control needs some work, and plans to move some of those controls over to the left-hand stalk on the steering column. Setting maximum speed on cruise control will eventually move to a dial on the right side of the steering wheel. All of these will be handled by over-the-air updates -- your Tesla Model 3 will update itself overnight, the same way your laptop or phone does.\n\nIt's at these points where the daylight between Tesla and a more traditional car company becomes clearest. The Tesla Model 3 I drove this weekend would not be the Tesla Model 3 you'd get in 12 months if you ordered today, in the same way that your iPhone can suddenly be very different thanks to software updates -- even while the hardware remains the same.\n\nThe difference is that changing how I adjust screen brightness on my smartphone may throw me off for a couple of seconds on the subway or while I'm walking. An abstruse UX that adds two seconds to a task while I'm driving at 65 mph means that I travel about two-thirds of a football field figuring out how to adjust my side-view mirrors.\n\nA quick glance around at other drivers on the highway shows that there are plenty of people tapping away at the touchscreen on their phone while they drive. But only in the Model 3 are you virtually guaranteed to futz around with a touchscreen while driving at some point. Maybe this is something that software updates will fix. Maybe this is something that more time driving a Model 3 will fix -- plenty of people wrote off the touchscreen keyboard on the iPhone as unusable as well.\n\nThen again, I don't drive my smartphone. My smartphone won't carry my family around. A few moments of inattention while trying to figure out how to take a screenshot on my smartphone won't send me and the people I love most flying through a guardrail.\n\nThe bigger reality is that the Tesla Model 3 -- and electric vehicles in general -- will only play a small factor in how hot and inhospitable the world my daughter grows up in turns out to be. For better or worse (almost certainly worse), what needs to happen to halt or at least slow down climate change are changes at the societal and governmental level. Electric cars are cool and fun to drive, but to really reduce carbon emissions action has to happen on much more basic things like refrigerant management, wind power, family planning, educating girls, and more plant-based diets. Per one well-regarded list of the 100 most effective climate solutions, using more hybrid and electric cars ranks 49th. It's not nothing, but a lot of people buying (or not buying) a Model 3 isn't really enough. It's fun that Elon Musk wants to colonize another planet, but his cars probably aren't going to be the deciding factor in how easily humanity continues to live on this on. (Also, it's hard to design a flashy, ambitious product that garners a ton of media attention around, say, better refrigerant management -- I don't think the internet would go nuts if you flung a fancy new A/C unit that doesn't use hydrofluorocarbons toward Mars.)\n\nStill, I was sad when it was time to return the Model 3 to Tesla. My Mazda 3 hatchback, which I previously considered a somewhat sporty ride, feels poky in acceleration and somewhat sluggish in its steering. Filling it up with gasoline now feels like littering or not separating out my recycling -- a choice I'm making in my own small way to make the world worse rather than better. If I had a bit more money and could wait the 12 months it would take for a Model 3 to actually make its way to me, I would seriously consider buying one. The Model 3 doesn't do everything perfectly, but manages to bring a lot of the future to me now. When we end up buying our next car in six or seven years, I hope that there are a lot more options like the Model 3 to choose from. It won't be the thing that stops the slow-moving disaster of climate change, but I'd like to drive my daughter around in something that isn't urging it on even faster.",

                "title": "Frank Rich: The Hidden Logic of the Trump's Staff Exodus",
                "body": "Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, the recent wave of departures from the Trump administration, Democrat Conor Lamb's apparent victory in the Pennsylvania special election, and the Stormy Daniels scandal.\n\nThe exodus from the Trump administration continues this week with Rex Tillerson at the State Department, followed out the door by the department spokesperson who described the White House's actions a little too bluntly, and with more moves expected. What is going on here?\n\nTrump's top appointees, exemplified by the Cabinet, are in their jobs for only three reasons: to demolish the federal government; to spend taxpayers' money on luxury travel and office refurbishing; and to toady to the president in public and obey his policy whims in private. Tillerson is out because he succeeded in only the first of these by decimating the State Department. His successor, Mike Pompeo, will not make Tillerson's mistake. He's the very model of a heel-clicking Vichy Republican.\n\nThe latest scuttlebutt has Rick Perry, the Energy secretary who took the job not knowing what the Department of Energy does, moving to Veterans' Affairs. As others inevitably follow Tillerson out the door -- Jeff Sessions, H.R. McMaster, et al. -- we'll increasingly see successors like Pompeo, picked from within the current ranks of administration flunkies.\n\nRespectable new recruits are hard to find now that it's no longer a matter of debate that to work for Trump is to destroy one's reputation. Gary Cohn, the departing economic adviser, used to be known as a Goldman Sachs super trader; now he's known as the guy who was so determined to get a tax cut that he refused to resign after his boss gave a free pass to anti-Semitic and racist neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. Tillerson was known as the star CEO of Exxon; now he's become a national punch line whose repeated public humiliations culminated with his being fired by tweet.\n\nRemember all that talk that Trump would be constrained by the \"grown-ups\" in the White House? With the exception of Jim Mattis, the Defense secretary, they've all either departed or surrendered their manhood to Trump's racism, misogyny, and xenophobia (John Kelly). We now know definitively that Trump doesn't want adults in the room; he wants malleable dolts (Ben Carson, Steve Mnuchin, Betsy DeVos) who are happy to join him in his Oval Office playpen, where he can make all the rules and hoard the toys.\n\nToo many rats departing the sinking ship, too little time to dwell on them all. My favorite of the recent crop is Trump's personal assistant, Johnny McEntee, who was hustled out of the White House this week when it was discovered that he was being investigated for online gambling and tax evasion. Hardly was he out the door when he found a safe landing in a senior position in the 2020 reelection campaign. Say what you will about the chaotic comings and goings in Trumpworld, but Paul Manafort's sleazy résumé even now remains its ethical gold standard.\n\nThough uncounted absentee ballots have an outside chance of shifting the math, the Democrat Conor Lamb is apparently squeaking out a victory in Pennsylvania's special election, winning a House seat in a district Trump carried by nearly 20 points in 2016. How will this shake up each party's plans for the midterms this November?\n\nThe Republicans are stuck with only one plan for November: Donald Trump. They can run, but they can't hide from the president they have embraced unequivocally since his inauguration. The Democrats' plans? The very question is an oxymoron. They have many ways to try to commit self-sabotage between now and Election Day, and will surely indulge in more than a few during the ideological battles of primary season.\n\nBut even so, the result in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, in the heart of what the GOP candidate Rick Saccone himself called \"Trump country,\" is momentous for the Democrats, a further demonstration that they will have to work extra hard to claw defeat from the jaws of victory this year. Saccone had everything going for him -- not just an expanding economy, a supposedly crowd-pleasing tax cut, and the district's solid GOP history. (Some years, the Democrats haven't even bothered to field a House candidate in the 18th.) Conservative groups and PACs spent $10.7 million on Saccone's race, more than five times Lamb's bankroll. Trump announced his steel and aluminum tariffs in the campaign's final days, the most microtargeted pander to Rust Belt voters imaginable. Trump visited Pennsylvania twice to campaign for Saccone, culminating in last Saturday's rally in which he served up the red meat that usually revs up his base, from racism (calling the Congresswoman Maxine Waters a \"low IQ individual\") to press-bashing (calling NBC's Chuck Todd a \"son of a bitch\"). Ivanka, Donald Jr., and Mike Pence campaigned, too. All to no avail.\n\nTrump apologists will argue that Saccone was too conventional a Republican to wear a MAGA hat convincingly. But Saccone had enthusiastically embraced Trump and Trumpism. The fact is that since Trump became president, his all-in endorsements of GOP candidates have failed to win victories whether the candidate is a standard-issue conservative in a purplish state (Ed Gillespie, in the Virginia gubernatorial race) or an uninhibited Trumpian (the accused child molester Roy Moore in Alabama) in a deep-red state. And Trump has made it known that he loves campaigning so much -- certainly far more than his actual job -- that he wants to book many more of his rambling, crowd-pleasing rallies in the months to come. Who is going to say no to him? Meanwhile, the Democrats need 24 seats to take the House in November, and according to the Washington Post, they have an even better shot at flipping 114 other House seats than they did the Pennsylvania 18th. (And Democrats should even do better in Pennsylvania in the fall, given that the 18th and other gerrymandered districts are being redrawn in the aftermath of a State Supreme Court ruling.)\n\nSome Democrats will undoubtedly view Lamb's ideological profile as a relatively conservative Democrat as a mandate for the party to now tilt right. But as an analysis of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study of the last national election has shown, the 9 percent of 2012 Obama voters who switched to Trump in 2016 are more conservative than the other 90 percent of Obama voters as a whole; they will remain tougher pickups for Democrats no matter how much its strategists try to concoct campaign strategies from a deep reading of Hillbilly Elegy. A more likely source of a Democratic revival are the 10 percent of 2012 Obama voters who either stayed home (7 percent) or voted for a third-party candidate (3 percent) in 2016. Trump has given many of them -- a disproportionate number of them either young or black -- a reason to be fired up and ready to go even without Obama on the ballot.\n\nBringing her affair with Trump into public view with a lawsuit and a not-yet-aired interview with 60 Minutes, Stormy Daniels has exposed Trump's marital infidelity (and the possible existence of other \"hush agreements\"), not to mention potential violations of federal campaign law and the president's vulnerability to extortion. Is this a scandal that could end his presidency?\n\nDaniels is fascinating, a sleeper cell who is unlikely to end this presidency but could yet hasten its demise.\n\nThe fact that Trump had an affair with a porn star soon after he married his current wife and fathered his youngest son will not drive away his base. Voters who were onboard for Trump's Access Hollywood tape, in which he essentially confirmed the charges of the multiple women accusing him of sexual assault, are on for this. The moral charlatans who speak for Evangelical Christians, from Tony Perkins to Franklin Graham, would likely rationalize Trump's behavior even if sex tapes do surface from Tahoe or Moscow.\n\nBut Daniels has an asset that Trump may well fear: She seems to have the talent to challenge him in the arena he cares about most -- entertainment. I am not talking about her cinematic canon, which I have not seen, but about her gumption, wit, and shamelessness. Her rapid-fire Twitter feed, in which she dispatches Trump supporters for their illiteracy and other stupidities, is sharp and funny. Her interview with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes might launch her as a plausible successor to Kathy Griffin.\n\nThere are many legalities attendant to the $130,000 hush money paid to Daniels that could ensnare Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen. But in the aftermath of yesterday's election result in Trump country, what both the president and his party should most fear is her potential to extend her 15 minutes into a star turn with legs long enough to keep her center stage until November 6.",

                "body": "Theranos, the company that promised it could do a lot of medicine with just a little bit of blood, has somehow fallen even further. In both a lawsuit and a settlement announced today, the Securities and Exchange Commission said that founder Elizabeth Holmes and president Ramesh Balwani defrauded customers and investors for years by making up claims about what the company's blood-analysis technology could do.\n\nHolmes will pay a penalty of $500,000, and give up voting control of the company. She is also banned from serving as an officer of a public company for a decade.\n\nIn late 2014, Holmes explained the company's process to The New Yorker: \"A chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel.\" The dubiousness of this intricate process was first exposed in a series of reports by John Carreyrou in The Wall Street Journal. In reality, Theranos was using standard blood tech to process many samples.\n\nAs the complaint against Balwani says:\n\nBalwani never told anyone at Pharmacy A that Theranos used third-party analyzers, including those that had been modified to test fingerstick blood. He also never told Pharmacy A that Theranos was using third-party analyzers to perform the majority of its testing.\n\nThe SEC's complaint against Holmes and Theranos outline how they misled investors and press outlets covering them. Theranos placed its \"miniLabs\" inside facilities to imply that they were used in medical analysis during tours for investors.\n\nHolmes also instructed Theranos employees to place numerous miniLabs -- which could only be used for research and development purposes and could not be used for clinical testing -- in a room in Theranos' clinical lab. This made it appear as if Theranos used its miniLab for clinical purposes. Holmes then led a group of Pharmacy A executives on a tour of that room, and those Pharmacy A executives saw rows of miniLabs in Theranos' clinical lab.\n\nThe complaint also includes examples of how Holmes misled reporters for Fortune and Forbes, who featured the CEO in glowing cover stories and bought her marketing hook, line, and sinker. Anyway, if you've got an idea for a new blood start-up, now's a great time to make a push!",

                "title": "New Trump Economist Kudlow Has Been Wrong About Everything",
                "body": "A dozen years ago, I wrote a book about the unshakable grip of supply-side economics upon the Republican Party. Supply-side economics is not merely a generalized preference for small government with low taxes, but a commitment to the cause of low taxes, particularly for high earners, that borders on theological. In the time that has passed since then, that grip has not weakened at all. The appointment of Lawrence Kudlow as head of the National Economic Council indicates how firmly supply-siders control Republican economic policy, and how little impact years of failed analysis have had upon their place of power.\n\nThe Republican stance on taxes, like its position on climate change (fake) and national health insurance (against it), is unique among right-of-center parties in the industrialized world. Republicans oppose higher taxes everywhere and always, at every level of government. In 2012, every Republican presidential candidate, including moderate Jon Huntsman, indicated they would oppose accepting even a dollar of higher taxes in return for $10 dollars of spending cuts. They likewise believe tax cuts are the necessary tonic for every economic circumstance.\n\nThe purest supply-siders, like Kudlow, go further and deeper in their commitment. Kudlow attributes every positive economic indicator to lower taxes, and every piece of negative news to higher taxes. While that sounds absurd, it is the consistent theme he has maintained throughout his career as a prognosticator. It's not even a complex form of kookery, if you recognize the pattern. It's a very simple and blunt kind of kookery.\n\nIn 1993, when Bill Clinton proposed an increase in the top tax rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent, Kudlow wrote, \"There is no question that President Clinton's across-the-board tax increases ... will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy's long-run potential to grow.\" This was wrong. Instead, a boom ensued. Rather than question his analysis, Kudlow switched to crediting the results to the great tax-cutter, Ronald Reagan. \"The politician most responsible for laying the groundwork for this prosperous era is not Bill Clinton, but Ronald Reagan,\" he argued in February, 2000.\n\nBy December 2000, the expansion had begun to slow. What had happened? According to Kudlow, it meant Reagan's tax-cutting genius was no longer responsible for the economy's performance. \"The Clinton policies of rising tax burdens, high interest rates and re-regulation is responsible for the sinking stock market and the slumping economy,\" he mourned, though no taxes or re-regulation had taken place since he had credited Reagan for the boom earlier that same year. By the time George W. Bush took office, Kudlow was plumping for his tax-cut plan. Kudlow not only endorsed Bush's argument that the budget surplus he inherited from Clinton -- the one Kudlow and his allies had insisted in 1993 could never happen, because the tax hikes would strangle the economy -- would turn out to be even larger than forecast. \"Faster economic growth and more profitable productivity returns will generate higher tax revenues at the new lower tax-rate levels. Future budget surpluses will rise, not fall.\" This was wrong, too. (I have borrowed these quotes from my book, in which Kudlow plays a prominent role.)\n\nKudlow then began to relentlessly tout Bush's economic program. \"The shock therapy of decisive war will elevate the stock market by a couple-thousand points,\" he predicted in 2002. That was wrong. He began to insist that the housing bubble that was forming was a hallucination imagined by Bush's liberal critics who refused to appreciate the magic of the Bush boom. He made this case over and over (\"There's no recession coming. The pessimistas were wrong. It's not going to happen. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2.0. (And that's a minimum). Goldilocks is alive and well. The Bush boom is alive and well.\") and over (\"The Media Are Missing the Housing Bottom,\" he wrote in July 2008). All of this was wrong. It was historically, massively wrong.\n\nWhen Obama took office, Kudlow was detecting an \"inflationary bubble.\" That was wrong. He warned in 2009 that the administration \"is waging war on investors. He's waging war against businesses. He's waging war against bondholders. These are very bad things.\" That was also wrong, and when the recovery proceeded, by 2011, he credited the Bush tax cuts for the recovery. (Kudlow, April 2011: \"March unemployment rate drop proof lower taxes work.\") By 2012, Kudlow found new grounds to test out his theories: Kansas, where he advised Republican governor Sam Brownback to implement a sweeping tax-cut plan that would produce faster growth. This was wrong. Alas, Brownback's program has proven a comprehensive failure, falling short of all its promises and leaving the state in fiscal turmoil.\n\nThe passage of the Trump tax cuts follow from the party's \"tax cuts über alles\" philosophy. In the face of widespread social and economic problems, the one legislative goal the party could agree upon was reducing taxes paid by business owners. The existence of relatively high deficits even at the peak of the macroeconomic cycle did not deter them; indeed, Republicans -- even moderates like Susan Collins -- insisted the tax cuts would not increase the deficit. The onset of deficits exceeding a trillion dollars a year in the midst of low unemployment has not prompted any regret, or even a hint of willingness to compromise on the party's rigid opposition to higher taxes.\n\nThis was the Trump agenda even with the relatively moderate Gary Cohn running the National Economic Council. Now that true believer Lawrence Kudlow is taking the helm, the dawn of fiscal sanity in the GOP is receding ever farther into the distant future.",

                "title": "Teacher Accidentally Discharges Weapon in Classroom",
                "body": "What happened yesterday at a high school in the small Central Coast city of Seaside, California, would have raised eyebrows in any event. But in the context of the president's NRA-endorsed proposal to train and arm school teachers, and today's nationwide School Walkout to protest gun violence in schools, the Seaside story got national attention right away.\n\nHigh school teacher and reserve police officer Dennis Alexander was doing a demonstration of how to disarm an assailant in his \"administration of justice\" class at Seaside High when his handgun discharged, firing a bullet into the classroom ceiling. Falling debris from the accident inflicted minor injuries on three students. It could have been much worse, of course.\n\nCalifornia state law requires a special authorization for anyone to bring a firearm onto public school property. Alexander did not have that authorization. He's been placed on administrative leave by the school district, and also by the nearby municipal police force on which he was a decorated reserve officer.\n\nWhat makes the incident even more striking is that Alexander is a member (and currently mayor pro tem) of the (non-partisan) Seaside City Council, first elected in 2006. He's also a former Peace Corps volunteer, a long-time community activist, and in general not a gun-nutty sort of guy, so far as we can tell. He's very likely not a MAGA fan, either; aside from holding elected office in a very Democratic portion of a very Democratic Monterey County, Alexander's main gig at Seaside High is teaching math in Spanish (the school's student body is 89 percent minority).\n\nBut fairly or not, Alexander will probably become a figure of mockery and scorn to those who are fighting Trump's arm-the-teachers proposal. After all, if a trained police officer winds up endangering his students with a handgun, how safe should parents feel about teachers who are not professional law enforcement folk packing heat? It's a valid question.\n\nMeanwhile, the local school district is being somewhat supportive of the planned walkout. But the sound of yesterday's gunshot may echo for a good while.",

                "title": "What Are Prebiotics? And Do I Need Them?",
                "body": "There are many possible pathways toward better skin, and one of them is through your gut. This \"you are what you eat\" logic at least partly explains why in recent years probiotics have risen from the obscurity of Activia yogurt to popularity on par with K-beauty. Probiotics -- basically, good bacteria -- can help with digestion, vaginal health (probiotic tampons are a thing, and a Strategist favorite), skin, mood, and so on, which is why they've become a basic component for people with self-care routines. Which brings us to the newest wave in bacterial health: prebiotics.\n\nPrebiotics arrived on the health scene after probiotics, but that's counterintuitive to understanding them: Like the prefix suggests, prebiotics -- basically, fiber -- should exist as a condition for probiotics to flourish. \"I describe a prebiotic as lawn food for the beneficial members of the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract,\" says Bob Hutkins, a food scientist at the University of Nebraska. \"There's no doubt that it's a hot topic right now. But it's been hot in the research world for 20 years. And now you're even seeing things about the role of gut health in things we don't even think of as being intestinal, like allergies, mental acuity, stress reduction.\"\n\nPrebiotics are fibers found in foods such as bananas, leeks, and garlic. (Anyone you talk to will tell you first that these foods are the most straightforward way to up your prebiotic intake.) Based on research by scientists like Hutkins and his colleagues in the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that some people's bodies can benefit better from probiotics (also found in real foods like yogurt and sauerkraut) if they take them with prebiotics.\n\nSo, the promise: Whatever you want out of probiotics -- improved digestion, clearer skin, fewer yeast infections -- can be maximized by pairing them with prebiotics. But as with skin care or even just regular diet, success with prebiotics comes to those who experiment. Plenty of doctors will caution consumers against spending money on them, until robust clinical studies arrive that prove the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics, and other supplements. But a lot of us don't need clinical trials to know that we're sleeping better or having fewer stomach aches. To anyone looking into prebiotics, Hutkins advises looking for capsules, or powders that blend into smoothies, with labels that contain inulin (derived from chicory) or FOS or GOS (shorthand for certain fiber chemical compounds) prebiotics. Many of them even come packaged with probiotics. There's no hard and fast rule that explains why certain fibers help certain flora flourish, but there's no harm in dabbling. Even doctors who stand by clinical trials will tell you that it's a matter of listening to your body.\n\nPrebiotics that come in capsules The Nue Co. Skin Food + Prebiotic\n\nThe Nue Co., a stylish line of supplements with an emphasis on including prebiotics, mixes prebiotic inulin, based off of chicory, into its Energy Food and Skin Food capsules. Jules Miller launched the Nue Co. after years of dealing with chronic IBS -- not \"I just ate a whole pizza\" IBS, she says, but a condition of bloating and fatigue that ultimately led to her going up three pant sizes. Doctors advised that she cut out dairy, and then sugar, and then wheat, but ultimately Miller found that raw vegetables were hardest on her system and that a mix of all-natural pre- and probiotics powder supplements eased her maladies. This one includes powder from lucuma and baobab fruit, which contain vitamins C and E for brightening skin.\n\n$75 at Goop The Nue Co. Debloat Food + Prebiotic\n\nMiller calls Debloat a good starter for anyone who, like her former self, has digestion problems. This contains ginger, to help calm down the stomach, and turmeric, an anti-inflammatory.\n\n$75 at Goop The Nue Co. Energy Food + Prebiotic\n\nEnergy food contains a \"magnesium-rich blend of maca, goji berry, and beetroot\" to keep you feeling charged.\n\n$75 at Goop RMS Beauty Within Probiotic + Prebiotic\n\nRMS, one of the early brands to start putting out chemical-free makeup \"you can eat,\" like this highlighter that beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton likes, recently released a prebiotic-probiotic capsule combination.\n\n$64 at Dermstore BioSchwartz Probiotic\n\nOne of the most-reviewed and most-loved prebiotic-probiotic combo supplements on Amazon, BioSchwartz has racked up five-star comments from users who say it's helped with digestion issues.\n\n$19 at Amazon Dr. Tobias GutMeister\n\nAnother product with rave Amazon reviews, the Dr. Tobias products are just prebiotics. Trial and error is the rule with these, but in theory these could be added to a regimen that already includes a good probiotic.\n\n$21 at Amazon Prebiotics that come in gummies BeLive Prebiotic Fiber Gummies\n\nAnd if you have a problem with swallowing pills: Prebiotic gummies are an option.\n\n$14 at Amazon Prebiotics that go on your skin Proactiv Complexion Perfecting Hydrator\n\nProactiv's face moisturizer contains a \"nourishing prebiotic\" that's \"designed to help the skin's natural protection.\" In other words: In the same way that prebiotics can help feed the good bacteria in your gut, they can also nurture the good bacteria on your skin. For people with sensitive or blemish-prone skin, that can be a helpful way to restore balance.\n\n$50 at Ulta La Roche-Posay Lipikar Balm AP +\n\nLa Roche-Posay's \"Prebiotic Thermal Water\" follows the same logic as Proactiv's face wash, but for your whole body and microbiome.

                "title": "5 Lessons From the Pennsylvania Special Election",
                "body": "Over the past three months, America's two major parties spent over $12 million on a race for a House vote that won't matter - in a district that will soon cease to exist. Which is to say: Last night's special election in southwestern Pennsylvania was, primarily, a battle over this morning's headlines.\n\nA victory for Democrat Conor Lamb was never going to threaten a single item on Paul Ryan's agenda - but it would threaten his colleagues' peace of mind. A win for Team Blue in the heart of Trump country could convince GOP incumbents that a blue wave was coming, thereby pushing more into retirement, depressing contributions to others' campaigns, and torpedoing morale across the board. Thus, the actual result of the election would matter less than the lessons that it appeared to teach.\n\nAnd so, even though we don't yet have an official result for the final contest in (this version of) Pennsylvania's 18th district, we do have the only returns that really matter: The takeaways.\n\n1. The GOP's House majority is (probably) not long for this Earth.\n\nBefore voters went to the polls in the Keystone State yesterday, there was already good reason to think Paul Ryan would soon be parting ways with his speaker's gavel. Historically, there's been a strong correlation between a party's performance in off-year special elections, and its showing in the ensuing midterms. And, as CNN's Harry Enten notes, the performance of the Democrats in said special elections has been exceptionally strong.\n\nStill, before last night's showdown, the GOP retained one plausible argument for downplaying these results: Special elections are special. Such contests allow the more energized party to focus attention and resources on a single race, and to mine a greater advantage out of an enthusiasm gap. Since turnout is generally lower in special elections than in midterm ones, it's easier for a (relatively) small number of highly motivated voters to engineer upsets in the former than in the latter.\n\nBut turnout in the Keystone State last night was at midterm levels. And if the specialness of the congressional race allowed Democrats to focus their resources on the election, well, that was even more true for Republicans. The GOP outspent the Donkey Party, and flew in the president of the United States to campaign for its candidate.\n\nAnd as of this writing, Conor Lamb is, nonetheless, the presumptive winner of an election that remains too close to officially call.\n\nDemocrats need to flip 23 seats this fall to win control of the House. There are 118 congressional districts that have more Democratic-leaning electorates than the one Lamb (appears to have) won.\n\n2. Democrats can win back white working-class voters with economic populism (where the labor movement still exists).\n\nThe constituency for the Republican Party's economic agenda is exceptionally small. In a recent analysis of voter opinion data, political scientist Larry Bartels shows that a majority of Republican voters support \"government efforts to regulate pollution, provide a decent standard of living for people unable to work, and ensure access to good health care.\" That finding is buttressed by Lee Drutman's study of the 2016 electorate, which found that more than 70 percent of voters that year held left-of-center positions on fiscal policy, as well as by the large number of polls that found GOP voters expressing support for increasing health-care spending - and opposition to tax cuts for the rich - in 2017.\n\nAll of which is to say: If Democrats could convince white voters to prioritize their views on taxes and spending - over their cultural anxieties and resentments - they would dominate national politics. And we know that it is possible for the party to perform that feat. In Bartels's analysis, roughly a quarter of reliable, Democratic voters have opinions on racial and cultural issues that are closer to Donald Trump's than Nancy Pelosi's - they just like \"big government\" more than than they fear \"illegals.\"\n\nLamb's strong showing last night would have been impossible without these voters; and he succeeded in winning over a critical mass of them without engaging in dog-whistle demagoguery. Lamb did make some concessions to cultural conservatism, most conspicuously on guns. But he vehemently rejected Republican Rick Saccone's attempts to pin the opioid crisis on immigrants, and ran as a pro-choice, pro-LGBT candidate. Instead of trying to beat the GOP at its culture war game, Lamb worked to make bread-and-butter issues more salient - and succeeded, thanks, in no small part, to the aid of the labor movement.\n\nAccording to a telephone exit poll from Public Policy Polling, 52 percent of voters in last night's election ranked health care as one of their \"top issues\" - with 15 percent saying it was the single most important one, and 37 percent saying it was \"very important.\" And on that issue Lamb enjoyed a 7-point advantage. This wasn't because conservative voters failed to turn out; last night's electorate narrowly approved of Donald Trump, according to PPP's survey - but they disapproved of the GOP's attempts to repeal Obamacare by 14 points.\n\nAnd Lamb gained the upper hand on other pocketbook issues, including Social Security, Medicare, miners' pensions, and labor rights. That last one was especially crucial. Tim Murphy, the Republican congressman whose resignation triggered the 18th-district race, had maintained a friendly relationship with organized labor. Saccone, by contrast, was an avid supporter of turning Pennsylvania into a \"right-to-work\" state. Thus, unions rallied to Lamb's side - and helped him increase the salience of economic issues to their working- class members. As Eliza Griswold illustrates in her New Yorker profile of the Lamb campaign:\n\nLast week, when I drove through Greene County, which Trump won handily, I noticed flocks of blue and white Lamb road signs among signs advertising vape shops and a local Mace dealer, and 800 numbers for the sale of oil, gas, and mineral rights. The next day, I passed more signs lining rural back roads as I drove to a warehouse that smelled of fresh sawdust. Hundreds of local union members were waiting for Lamb to appear with Joe Biden, the one national Democratic leader who is still liked in Pennsylvania, in no small part because he comes from Scranton.\n\n...\"This isn't a referendum on Trump,\" [Machinists' union representative Kevin] Hallam said, explaining that it was about work and health care and wages, and that Lamb's opponent stood on the wrong side of all of these issues.\n\nRick Grejda, a local leader of the Service Employees International Union, told me that social issues paled in comparison to the economic ones that union members and others face. \"It's hard to say you're in the middle class if you work two jobs,\" he told me. \"We're not this bunch of liberal lefties.\"\n\nThis way of thinking is a real threat to the GOP. And labor unions are uniquely capable of turning working-class voters onto it. This is why Republicans have prioritized the passage anti-union legislation in other Rust Belt states. In fact, one of the GOP's few consolations after last night's election is that - while PA-18 is a \"Trump country\" district, it's one (of a relative few) that lies in a non-right-to-work state. In a demographically identical county in Wisconsin, Michigan, or Iowa, Rick Saccone probably would have posted a decisive victory.\n\n3. Democrats don't need to sell out reproductive rights to compete in red America.\n\nAs noted above, Lamb ran as a \"personally pro-life, but politically pro-choice\" candidate - in a district where the Republican incumbent just resigned in disgrace for revealing himself to be the opposite.\n\nIf Lamb does pull out a victory, this will be the second consecutive high-profile, special election in (deep) red America where Democrats triumphed with a pro-choice standard-bearer - Doug Jones having accomplished that feat in Alabama late last year.\n\nThere's been less of a leftward drift in public opinion on abortion than on other social issues. But the reality is, Democrats are never going to win passionately pro-life voters. And Lamb's win suggests that Team Blue can win over moderately pro-life ones in red areas merely by giving voice to their moral qualms on the issue - while making the libertarian case against getting government involved in such intimate matters.\n\n4. Opioids can be a gateway issue for Democrats in rural America.\n\nThe year Donald Trump was elected president, drug overdoses killed 63,600 Americans. The epidemic's body count was almost certainly higher in 2017, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And yet, despite his campaign promises to solve the opioid crisis, Trump has done virtually nothing to address the plague - but has tried to cut $1 trillion in funding from one of America's top sources of addiction treatment, and allowed his attorney general to wage war on legal marijuana, which many in rural America now see as a much-needed alternative to opioids for those suffering from chronic pain.\n\nThis grotesque failure to mitigate a public health emergency - concentrated in white rural America - offers Democrats an opportunity to make inroads in that hostile territory. And, by all appearances, Lamb capitalized on it. While the Democratic candidate declined to attack the White House over the issue, he did make the crisis a central one in his campaign, and called for an expansion of federal funding for 90-day treatment centers. Other Democrats in rural districts this fall would do well to follow his example.\n\n5. The suburbs are in revolt.\n\nLamb's inroads with rural, working-class voters kept him competitive - but his base was still in the elite suburbs of Allegheny.\n\nThis isn't surprising. The biggest development in American politics over the past 14 months has been the suburbs' secession from red America. For decades, these high-income enclaves had been a key part of the GOP base; now, some look like battlegrounds -- while others look like Blue America's new frontiers.\n\nThe upper-middle-class's left-turn gave Democrats a ten-point victory in Virginia's gubernatorial race; powered Doug Jones's unlikely victory in Alabama; and helped Team Blue outperform expectations in nearly every special election held in 2017.\n\nFollowing Trump's victory, the question of whether Democrats should seek to build on Hillary Clinton's gains with suburban professionals - or to restore the party's standing with its traditional working-class base - sparked much progressive infighting. But Lamb's showing last night confirms that the correct answer to this conundrum is: \"Why not both?\"\n\nWhite working-class voters tend to view the Democrats' fiscal positions more favorably than its racial and gender ones. The opposite may be true for some high-income suburbanites - but not for most. College-educated voters tend to actually hold more progressive views on fiscal policy in public opinion polls than their working-class counterparts. And the GOP's fiscal agenda has now grown so extreme, it no longer serves the material interests of the average suburban professional - but only, the average trust-fund millionaire. Charles Koch may have little use for well-funded public schools, universities, Social Security, or child-care subsidies. But the upper middle-class class does.\n\nDemocrats can draw strength from the (female-led) anti-Trump rebellion in the suburbs - and win back working class voters with populist economic appeals - all while honoring the progressive movement's commitments to racial equality, reproductive freedom, and immigrants' rights.\n\nLast night, in the heart of Trump country, Conor Lamb did just that.",

                "body": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we'd like to, we can't try everything. Which is why we have People's Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that's four-to-five-star reviews and lots of 'em) products and single out the most convincing. While we've written about the best laundry bags, and found an old-school workout-clothes soap and Fran Drescher-approved detergent, here we're going deep on portable washing machines that you can buy on Amazon for small apartments and homes without in-unit laundry (along with a couple of portable dryers, for good measure).\n\nBest portable washing machine Haier HLP21N Pulsator 1-Cubic-Foot Portable Washer 4.3 stars, 1,152 reviews\n\n\"It has been about four months since we purchased the portable Haier washer, and I have to say that we love it! It came complete in the box, with the exception of having to screw in the base plate and the casters, which only took about ten minutes total. We use it in a truly portable way. When we need to do laundry, we wheel it out of our downstairs closet and into our downstairs powder room. My husband was really excited to try it out and started doing rather large loads immediately -- I was concerned that it would fail, but it has kept on churning. The little washer does a really good job of getting the clothes clean, uses very little water and very little clothes-washing detergent. It is so very economical.\"\n\n$250 at Amazon $250 at Amazon Best quiet portable washing machine Panda Compact Washer Panda Compact Washer 4.1 stars, 240 reviews\n\n\"I have a family of five, and I can wash almost a regular load of laundry. It beats having to take it to a laundromat or use the machines here at the complex. It is so quiet. The water from the water filter hitting the water in my turtle tank is louder than the washer. I honestly can't find a single negative thing about it. That's either because it really is that awesome, or it's because after doing laundry at a laundromat for the past eight years, I'm just ecstatic to have my own washer. I'll say this though: I wish I would've thought to Google portable washing machines years ago.\"\n\n$296 at Amazon $296 at Amazon Best portable washing machine for small spaces Giantex Portable Compact Full-Automatic Laundry 4.1 stars, 108 reviews\n\n\"It works great. Easy to use and takes up very little space, fits in our very small bathroom. The washing capacity [works] quite well for our laundry needs. Quick and easy transportation. If you are looking for a small, good-quality washing machine, this is the one!\"\n\n$210 at Amazon $210 at Amazon Best portable washing machine for RVs Haier HLP21N Portable Top Load Washer With Stainless Steel Tub 4 stars, 222 reviews\n\n\"It was a snap to put together ... then I washed four loads right in succession. It washed sweatshirts, socks, and jeans with no problems. The clothes then hang and dry by morning. It really spins the water out of the clothes. I bought this washer with the idea that I can take this in my RV and use it on the road. It is perfect for this. RV-specific washers are very expensive, and this washer is so light that I can carry it to move it to wash my laundry and put it back in storage out of the way. Now that I've owned this washer for several months, I still love it and still have had NO problems with it.\"\n\n$303 at Amazon $303 at Amazon Best portable washing machine with twin tubs Giantex Portable Mini Compact Twin Tub 4.2 stars, 1,189 reviews\n\n\"When I described to my boyfriend what I had purchased, he immediately envisioned me with a plunger and a five-gallon bucket washing clothes in the bathroom. But this thing is amazing. The motor really agitates! I love the power of it. And it holds a lot of clothes! The spin dryer is also amazing. While it doesn't dry (and doesn't claim to dry), it really wrings the clothes out a lot. We hang-dry our clothes on a line with a fan in the room, and they are dry in an hour or two after the spin-dry cycle. The water input, as other reviews have stated, does not work well, as it doesn't fit our faucet, but I went out and purchased a handheld showerhead with a long hose and use that to fill the tub. I love this washing machine.\"\n\n$140 at Amazon $140 at Amazon Best portable washing machine with twin tubs for $100 Best Choice Products Portable Compact Mini Twin Tub Washing Machine and Spin Cycle 4 stars, 835 reviews\n\n\"This washer totally exceeded my expectations, even though I read all kinds of good feedback from other buyers. I can literally pick this up with one hand and carry it (although you'll want to use two, and so do I), yet it is a serious powerhouse. I ran a dry cleaner for 23 years, so we might assume I'm a bit of an expert in the care of fabric. I am very impressed.\"\n\n$100 at Amazon $100 at Amazon Best portable washer-and-dryer combo Della Small Compact Portable Washing Machine With Spin Dryer 4.2 stars, 132 reviews\n\n\"Simply amazing! I live in a tiny studio apartment with no space for a washer and dryer. I was carrying baskets of clothes to the laundromat every week, spending an average of $15. This portable washer has made my life so much easier! I have been using it almost daily since it arrived. It it very easy to move around because of its light weight. I set it up in my bathroom, so it can drain into my sink or shower. I use the shower to drain the machine after my last load is done spin drying. The pump works really well, but has trouble getting the last cup or so of water out. If you keep the drain tube low (laying in the bottom of the shower) and lift the machine up about eight inches, the rest of the water drains easily. The machine washes very well and fast. The longest wash time you can set it for is 15 minutes. It has a normal wash mode and a gentle mode. You can fit about five shirts and a pair of jeans in one load. I try not to push it, though. The spin dryer does an amazing job as well. It can be set to spin for up to five minutes. It sounds like a little jet engine and spins most of the water out. I just hang my clothes up in the house and they are completely dry in a couple of hours. I definitely recommend this product to anyone that is sick of the inconvenience and cost of the laundromat.\"\n\n$110 at Amazon $110 at Amazon Best compact spin dryer The Laundry Alternative Nina Soft Spin Dryer 4.5 stars, 578 reviews\n\n\"We purchased a portable washer. In order to hang our clothing to dry in the house in the winter (or on a folding drying rack outside), we really wanted to get even more of the water out. So we purchased this spin dryer. It gets out an enormous amount of additional water after the spin cycle. It is really easy to use -- really, really easy! Our clothing dries in a matter of hours. Even our large bath towels are spun out enough to hang-dry inside now. I am able to get our laundry washed, dried, and put away much faster. In the winter or during a stretch of rainy days, there were times I was so sick of looking at laundry hung up around the house. Now I can wash in the morning, hang everything, and come home in the early afternoon to put it all away, then actually enjoy a clean and uncluttered house.\"\n\n$127 at Amazon $127 at Amazon Best compact laundry dryer with heat Panda 2.65 cu.ft Compact Laundry Dryer, White 4.1 stars, 416 reviews\n\n\"I'm pleasantly surprised at the size and the heat that this dryer puts out. I'm able to put quite a bit in it, and it doesn't take hours to dry my clothes like my last one did. This one runs circles around my old one. I hope nothing changes, and it keeps doing the job it's doing now and I will be extremely happy.\"\n\n$246 at Amazon $246 at Amazon GET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

That's why we're stepping into the offices of enviably creative (and productive) people to look at what's on their desks -- pens and notebooks and gadgets, but also décor and tchotchkes. Today, we've asked Brooklyn textile designer Aelfie Oudghiri to show and tell.\n\n1300 Real and Fanciful Animals From Seventeenth-Century Engravings (Dover Pictorial Archive)\n\nI live for Dover clip-art books. I've been collecting them all since I was a little kid. So cheap and so much inspiration. I think if you were to look at any designer's desk, they would have a stash of Dover books somewhere. They are thematically really specific. This one is the treasury of animal illustrations, they have another one that's women's faces, which is a good one. There are also paisley designs, Celtic illumination, and designs and patterns from historic ornament.\n\n$14 at Amazon $14 at Amazon Bow Wow Wow Dog Planter\n\nI commissioned these stoned-looking dog things in pink from this cool ceramist in Poland. I keep my markers in it. When I saw them, I was like, \"This is amazing. Can you make a ridiculous amount of these and I'll buy them all?\" Something about the design just really spoke to me, though I don't think it's supposed to look like it smokes weed.\n\n$30 at Aelfie $30 at Aelfie Uni-posca Paint Marker Pen (Set of 15)\n\nI saw on Instagram that Annu Kilpeläinen, an illustrator I really like, uses these markers, so I immediately purchased them, thinking, Oh, maybe these will make me a great artist! Apparently, it doesn't work that way.\n\n$24 at Amazon $24 at Amazon Rockin Roller Desk Chair\n\nWhen I was pregnant, I splurged on an Aeron chair because every single part of my body ached like hell every time I sat down, and then I sold it because I was short on cash. I was using a normal chair for a while, and then I was like, \"Damn, my back hurts.\" So I was just Googling around to see if a pink furry-ball chair existed. And I found it. It works because I am a short woman and I don't fit comfortably in most desk chairs. I wish I could take my pink fur orb with me to restaurants -- it's that good. Plus, I now have abs of steel.\n\n$149 at PBTeen $149 at PBTeen Crap Eyewear The Wild Gift Cat Eye Sunglasses\n\nI bought these because of the name, but they also look really cute. The sunglasses I usually wear are round, but they don't sell those anymore, so I just got these instead. I like cat-eye glasses. I think they're very flattering. They're futuristic and vintage at the same time, which is a nice combo.\n\n$62 at Urban Outfitters $62 at Urban Outfitters Diptyque Baies Indoor/Outdoor Ceramic Candle\n\nThere are hundreds of carpets in my studio, so to combat that woolly smell, I rely on this ginormous, decadent indoor/outdoor candle. There aren't a lot of candles that come this big, and most of the indoor/outdoor candles on the market are for mosquitoes and bugs, so there aren't a lot of great options besides Diptyque. The first time I smelled this candle was at a really fancy baby shower on the Upper East Side, where I walked in and there was this incredible smell. It took me about a year or two to figure out what the candle was, but I finally tracked it down at Club Monaco. They burn it at the Fifth Avenue store. And then it took me another two years to have a reason to buy it. The smell is extraordinary -- it really fills up the space.\n\n$315 at Saks Fifth Avenue $315 at Saks Fifth Avenue Okapi Frame\n\nI keep a little painting by Leah Goren in this frame, which I designed. I have two of her paintings on my desk, one is of one of my rugs and the other is of another one of my side-table designs and my rug.

I'm not even going to pretend like that's not the case. At this point, I'm like a fucking scholar of Law & Order just because I've been living with it for ... well, my husband and I have been together for ten years. I bought this as a gift for him, but it's still on my desk.\n\n$19 at Amazon $19 at Amazon GBSELL BM70 Mini Small GSM Mobile Phone\n\nOn Friday nights, I leave my iPhone at work and take my small-ass phone out on the town. It's my weird way of observing Shabbat (and saying \"fuck you\" to the man), but I also legitimately love phones and phone design. I got it because I was thinking about my phone usage a lot and how it changes our behavior and how we experience the city and each other.

                "body": "The family of Seth Rich, a former DNC staffer whose 2016 murder sparked a wild conspiracy theory involving WikiLeaks, Russia and Hillary Clinton, is suing Fox News for pushing a \"sham\" story that treated their son's \"life and legacy ... as a mere political football.\"\n\nFiled Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the suit also names Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman and Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, who are accused of playing a critical role in the spread of the conspiracy theory. The suit seeks compensation for \"mental anguish and emotional distress, emotional pain and suffering, and any other physical and mental injuries.\"\n\nOn May 16, 2017, less than year after Rich was killed in what police suspected was a botched robbery, Fox News published an article that said the 27-year-old was in contact with WikiLeaks before he was killed. This fueled a raft of conspiracy theories that suggested Rich was murdered by Hillary Clinton's henchmen for leaking DNC emails to the group.\n\nBut the premise of the article soon fell apart after the primary source, who is also suing Fox News, said he was falsely quoted. After leaving the article online for several days, Fox News issued a retraction, but no apology for the story, which by that point had whipped the right, including Sean Hannity, into a frenzy.\n\nBarrel-chested yogurt foe Alex Jones was among the many conspiracy mongers taken in by the Rich story, but on Tuesday it was another fanciful flight of paranoia that landed him on the wrong side of a lawsuit. Brennan Gilmore, who tweeted a widely viewed clip of a car plowing into protesters at last summer's Unite the Right rally in Virginia, sued Jones and several others Tuesday for spreading lies about him.\n\nA former State Department official, Gilmore was accused of knowing that white nationalist James Fields would drive his car into a crowd during the rally, killing Heather Heyer. Jones, along with Gateway Pundit's Jim Hoft and former Representative Allen West, who are also named in the suit, painted Gilmore as a \"deep state shill with links to George Soros,\" the suit says.\n\nGilmore suffered personally after the theories began spreading, the suit says. Not only was he attacked and doxxed online, but InfoWars fans soon found Gilmore in real life and accosted him on the street. He also says he received a powdery substance in the mail along with a note telling him to \"burn in hell.\" Gilmore is seeking $75,000 in damages.",

                "body": "British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from the U.K. Wednesday, a retaliatory move for the nerve agent attack on a former spy and his daughter in the city of Salisbury. On Monday, May said it was \"highly likely\" that Russia was behind the attack. She went a step further Wednesday in a speech to Parliament.\n\n\"This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom,\" May said. \"It must therefore be met with a full and robust response.\"\n\nMay reiterated the British conclusion that Russia was behind the attack, which targeted 66-year-old former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia. Both remain hospitalized, as does a police officer who first tried to assist them on a park bench in Salisbury. Hundreds more have been warned about possible exposure to the nerve agent.\n\nAlong with expelling the diplomats, May said the U.K. has suspended high level diplomatic talks with Russia, called off a planned visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and vowed to keep British ministers and royals away from this summer's World Cup in Russia.\n\n\"For those who seek to do us harm, my message is simple. You are not welcome here,\" May said.\n\nRussia remains defiant in the face of the accusations. Lavrov on Wednesday blamed Britain for \"acting out political drama\" and suggested that the attack wasn't carried out by Russia at all. Instead, he suggested that the country was framed by \"those who want to continue a campaign of Russophobia.\"",

                "title": "Lamb's Lead in PA-18 Likely To Hold",
                "body": "Conor Lamb claimed victory early this morning in the long-awaited special congressional election in the 18th district of Pennsylvania. While news media outlets held off on making a call, and Republican candidate Rick Saccone has refused to concede (the National Republican Congressional Committee continues to express confidence that their man will win once \"every legal vote is counted\"), it's actually pretty hard to see how Saccone can overcome Lamb's 641-vote lead.\n\nAll 593 precincts have been counted. So have absentee ballots in the three larger counties in the district. Yes, absentee ballots have yet to be counted in low-population Greene County, but there are only an estimated 200 of them, and so far Lamb has been leading among absentee voters even in the Republican areas. There are an unknown (but pretty small) number of provisional ballots to count; those typically lean Democratic. And then there could be another tiny batch of overseas ballots, though one local expert suggested these would be \"more college student semester abroad\" votes than military votes.\n\nYes, Saccone can request a recount, though it's not automatic. But in places like PA-18 with touchscreen voting machines, recounts rarely change much of anything; in 2016 the Green Party obtained recounts in 52 Allegheny County precincts, and the vote totals were unchanged.\n\nSo frustrating as it may be for Republicans to lose by so narrow a margin, that's where it's headed unless they choose to muddy the waters by claiming some sort of \"voter fraud\" (the \"every legal vote\" terminology deployed by the NRCC might hint at that disreputable but hardy option). There were no signs of any irregularities on Tuesday. But that might not deter the president of the United States, who could at any moment offer his take on PA-18 from his travels in California.",

                "title": "Pioneering Physicist Stephen Hawking Dies at 76",
                "body": "Stephen Hawking, the British theoretical physicist who shed new light on the mysteries of the universe and made complicated scientific theories accessible to the public, died on Wednesday at the age of 76.\n\nA University of Cambridge spokesman said Hawking died at his home in Cambridge, England, but did not provide further details. Hawking had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and his health had been deteriorating in recent years. The Associated Press noted that he canceled a series of lectures in 2015 due to poor health, and was hospitalized due to an infection in 2009.\n\n\"He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years,\" his children Lucy, Robert and Tim said in a statement. \"His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humor inspired people across the world. He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him forever.\"\n\nHawking was diagnosed with ALS in 1963, when he was a 21-year-old graduate student. People who have the disease typically die within five years of diagnosis, and Hawking fell into a depression when he was given two years to live. However, when the disease progressed more slowly than expected he forged ahead with his studies, completing his doctorate and becoming the Lucasian professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a position previously held by Isaac Newton. Hawking is believed to be the disease's longest-living survivor.\n\nHawking's first major scientific contribution was his finding that black holes, which were once thought to be so dense that nothing could escape their gravity, might actually emit thermal radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. The calculation was published in 1974 in the journal Nature. This was a revolutionary finding that helped scientists move toward a \"unified\" theory that would resolve contradictions between Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum physics.\n\n\"Black holes ain't as black as they are painted,\" Hawking once said. \"They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole, both to the outside, and possibly, to another universe. So, if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up. There's a way out.\"\n\nAside from possessing a brilliant scientific mind, Hawking had a gift for explaining complex physics in terms that people found engaging and understandable. His 1988 book A Brief History of Time, which tackles the history of the universe, became an international bestseller. Hawking celebrity grew as he wrote more best-sellers, lectured widely, and made guest appearances on TV shows like The Simpsons and Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\nHawking was an advocate for the disabled, and refused to let being paralyzed and limited to communicating through a computerized voice synthesizer keep him from pursuing and promoting scientific research. When he took a flight on a \"zero-gravity\" jet in 2007, he said he wanted to encourage public interest in spaceflight and show \"that people need not be limited by physical handicaps as long as they are not disabled in spirit.\"\n\nHawking had a tumultuous personal life, which was portrayed in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything, earning Eddie Redmayne a best actor Academy Award. Hawking met his first wife Jane Wilde in 1965, shortly before his diagnosis. She spent decades caring for Hawking and their three children, and eventually their marriage grew strained. In 1990 he left her for his nurse, Elaine Mason, and they married five years later. Hawking and Mason divorced in 2006.\n\n\"From his wheelchair, he's led us on a journey to the farthest and strangest reaches of the cosmos,\" President Barack Obama said when Hawking was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 2009. \"In so doing, he has stirred our imagination and shown us the power of the human spirit here on Earth.\"\n\nSources WaPo AP NYT",

                "title": "No Winner Yet in PA-18, But the GOP Has Already Lost",
                "body": "With a handful of precincts, and perhaps several thousand absentee, provisional, and military ballots outstanding, Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone are locked in a photo finish near-tie in today's special congressional election in the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania. It could be days before we find out which man gets to occupy a soon-to-be-vaporized congressional seat until the end of the year (one or both of them will probably run in very different districts created by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for the midterms). If you had to guess right now, it looks like Lamb is likely to prevail.\n\nBut while we don't have a clear winner in this election, we do have a clear loser: the Republican Party. This was, as I argued some time ago, the \"no excuses\" special election for the GOP. PA-18 is a strongly Republican, and a strongly pro-Trump district. Saccone wasn't a perfect candidate, but he wasn't a disaster like Roy Moore, either. He had enough outside money and enough get-out-the-vote help from the national party and from conservative groups to counteract anything Conor Lamb could throw at him. And he had massive support from the president, his family, and his administration, in an iconic Trump Country district that almost perfectly typified the Rust Belt areas that won him the presidency. If Lamb wins, it will represent a historic disaster for the GOP. If Saccone wins, it will still send a stark warning sign to the majority party in the House as we head toward November.\n\nRepublican message-meister Frank Luntz put it plainly this evening:\n\nIf you need a quick visual depiction of the reversal of the district's Republican \"lean,\" check out this map from the New York Times which shows the vote shift since 2016 for precincts in three of PA-18's four counties (the fourth did not report precinct-level votes tonight):\n\nYes, this is a special election, and some might imagine that in a regular election like the one in November more Republican voters would show up. The problem with that hypothesis is that turnout today was at full midterm levels. There's no reason to think turnout patterns in November will be more favorable for the GOP, particularly given the massive Trump administration attention PA-18 got in this contest.\n\nAnother Republican rationalization we have already heard from the Washington Examiner's Salena Zito is that Conor Lamb is not a real Democrat (because he was nominated by a convention and didn't have to win the votes of left-bent primary voters), and thus his performance does not show how real Democrats will do in November. But by any standard Rick Saccone is a real Republican who ran more than ten points behind the normal GOP vote in PA-18. And Lamb was lifted to parity with Saccone by the very same labor movement - battered and diminished that it is - that will be fighting for Democrats in swing districts all over the country. Dismiss labor, dismiss energized rank-and-file Democrats, and dismiss the ability of the donkey party to find suitable candidates like Lamb, and you're well on the way to underestimating the likelihood of a Democratic wave in November.\n\nYes, a lot of things can change between now and then. But we are now seeing a regular pattern of Democratic over-performance in special elections - whether they've won or lost - stretching back over the entire span of the Trump administration. PA-18 may just be another data point among many, but put them altogether and they unambiguously show big trouble for Trump and his party. To paraphrase Frank Sinatra, if they can't make it there (in southwest Pennsylvania) they can't make it anywhere. And it's time they woke up and smelled the bitter coffee.",

                "title": "Democrats Can Run the Conor Lamb Strategy Over and Over",
                "body": "Democrats need to win two dozen Republican seats to gain a House majority. Approximately 118 districts have more Democratic-leaning electorates than the 18th district of Pennsylvania, which voted for Donald Trump by nearly 20 points, and which Democrat Conor Lamb turned into a competitive race. Several days before a election, Republicans were already spreading the word that the discouraging outcome was the idiosyncratic result of the unusual candidates on the ballot. \"The lesson of this race is that campaigns and candidates matter,\" Corey Bliss, a Republican helping to direct the party's midterm strategy, told Jonathan Swan. \"In this environment, when one campaign out-raises and runs circles around the other, that creates a number of challenges that are tough to overcome.\"\n\nRepublican candidate Rick Saccone was not actually an especially weak nominee, having won several races in competitive environments before. (Saccone struggled in fundraising, but his shortcomings were offset by the Brinks-truck-level $12 million spent on his behalf by outside Republican groups.) It is true that Conor Lamb was an especially strong candidate. Young, lacking a voting record that could be picked apart, and possessing a background as a Marine, Lamb cut a favorable profile in comparison with the lifelong politician he faced.\n\nBut there are a lot of Conor Lambs out there. Very early in the election cycle, Democrats recruited candidates with non-traditional backgrounds, especially in the military, that would appeal to voters in red districts. \"A rough profile of [Democrats'] ideal candidate has started to emerge: veterans, preferably with small business experience too,\" reported Politico last April. \"They'd like as many of them to be women or people who've never run for office before -- and having young children helps.\" The next month, Axios reported that Republicans were already worried about \"Democrats recruiting unusually high quality House candidates for the 2018 midterms.\" It listed several:\n\n-Jason Crow to challenge GOP Rep. Mike Coffman for Colorado's 6th District. Crow's bio: \"[Led] a platoon of paratroopers during the invasion of Iraq and earned the Bronze Star for his combat actions during the invasion...\"\n\n-Chrissy Houlahan to challenge GOP Rep. Ryan Costello for Pennsylvania's 6th District. Houlahan's bio: Engineering degree from Stanford, Captain in the Air Force Reserve, chief operating office of an apparel company and of nonprofits.\n\n-Josh Butner to challenge GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter for California's 50th District. Butner's bio: Navy SEAL, serves as trustee on a school board, and currently works for the dive equipment company, Aqua Lung.\n\nThere are more, some of them so ridiculously wholesome they look more like trailers for a corny movie. When I saw the bio ad of Amy McGrath (KY-6), by the time she got to her mother's story, I thought I might be watching some kind of parody:\n\nRecruiting veterans is an effective strategy for overcoming the Republican tilt of the House map which requires Democrats to contest deeply conservative territory in order to have a chance to gain a majority. Republican politics for decades has used ethnonationalist themes to sell voters on an unpopular economic agenda. The election messaging is about American flags, crime, and being tough on terrorism, and the policy agenda is about lax business regulation and regressive tax cutting.\n\nThe disconnect between the politics and the policy is its weak point. The Republican strategy can be hacked. The most powerful Republican theme is that Democrats are not \"one of us,\" aren't tough, don't love their country. A candidate with a compelling biography, especially ones who have a military background, can disarm these attacks pretty easily. It is not a panacea, but a major advantage nonetheless. Army veteran Jason Kander lost a 2016 Senate race by three points in Missouri, a state Donald Trump won by more than 18 points.\n\nIt is obviously not always easy to find candidates who have this sort of background, a clean (or clean enough) record, and are willing to run for and serve in Congress, which is a miserable and soul-crushing job. But one of the ways in which Democrats benefitted from the massive counter-mobilization that formed immediately after the 2016 election is an unusually high number of people willing to rearrange their lives around the goal of saving their country from an unfit president. The corny and often self-serving narrative of the military veteran called to serve their country once again actually applies in many cases. Democrats have more or less unanimously regarded a Trump presidency and a pliant Republican Congress as a national emergency.\n\nThe unusual success Lamb showed in running a competitive race in Trump country is not a total fluke, but the proof of concept of a strategy that will replicate itself across the country.",

Several other former writers for the site have joined them since the secret project started up last year.\n\nThere are no details on what exactly said project is and how much control Musk actually has over it, beyond backing it financially. \"It's pretty obvious that comedy is the next frontier after electric vehicles, space exploration, and brain-computer interfaces,\" Musk, jokingly, told the Daily Beast. \"Don't know how anyone's not seeing this.\" A source also told the Daily Beast Musk considered purchasing The Onion, which was later purchased by Univision, in 2016. That, clearly, did not happen. Though it might have inspired a 2018 post from the site announcing \"Elon Musk Offering $1.2 Billion in Grants to Any Project That Promises to Make Him Feel Complete.\"\n\nAnother source said Musk would have no editorial control over the project. Which is, frankly, a bummer. Musk has a pleasantly dark sense of humor ... like that time he announced his plans for colonizing Mars but said he wouldn't be making the trip himself since the first voyagers will likely die and \"I'd like to see my kids grow up.\"",

                "body": "Californians have been bracing themselves for some classic Donald Trump weirdness during the president's quick trip to the border, San Diego, and Los Angeles this week. But this pronouncement during his address to the Marines at Miramar Air Station was unexpected. Gizmodo has the story:\n\n\"My new national strategy for space recognizes that space is a war-fighting domain, just like the land, air and sea,\" said Trump. \"We may even have a 'space force' -- develop another one -- space force. We have the Air Force. We'll have the space force. We have the Army, the Navy.\"\n\nOmitted from Trump's list of armed forces branches were the Coast Guard and (presumably comprising a large part of the crowd at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar) the Marines.\n\nTrump continued by noting that the concept of a space force was one he both thought up and had previously dismissed. \"I said 'maybe we need a new force. We'll call it the space force.' Not really serious,\" he told the crowd to mixed laughter, \"And then I said 'What a great idea. Maybe we'll have to do that.' That could happen.\"\n\nActually, despite Trump's claim of having originating it, the idea of a new branch of the military to be dubbed the \"Space Corps\" (under the umbrella of the Air Force) was embraced by the House Armed Services Committee in its version of the last defense authorization bill. But it was dropped from the House-Senate conference committee, and where's why, according to CNN:\n\n[T]he idea was opposed by Pentagon leaders and the White House, who argued the idea was premature and needed more study.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis even took the rare step of writing a letter supporting an amendment to remove the Space Corps from the House's version of policy bill earlier this year.\n\nWe have no way of knowing right now if Trump missed that whole series of events, or heard about it and substituted his own endorsement for Mattis's dismissal, or just ate a rich dessert before bedtime and dreamed the whole thing up. But his unfeigned excitement at \"his\" idea was a reminder that the oldest man ever elected president is in some respects a man-child.",
