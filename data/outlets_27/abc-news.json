She appeared on stage before hundreds of thousands of people to tell them about a dream her grandfather had, and that she, too, has a dream.\n\n\"My name is Yolanda Renee King, granddaughter of Martin Luther King and Loretta Scott King,\" she told the massive crowd. \"My grandfather had a dream that his four little children would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream that enough is enough, and that this should be a gun free world, period.\"\n\nYolanda, the eldest granddaughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., stood alongside Jaclyn Corin, a 17-year-old student who survived the Valentine's Day shooting at her Florida high school. The pair held hands and grinned from ear-to-ear as the sea of people before them erupted in a roar of applause and cheers.\n\nYolanda then beckoned the crowd to join in on an uplifting chant: \"Spread the word, have you heard, all across the nation, we are going to be a great generation!\"\n\n\"Now I'd like you to say it like you really, really mean it and the whole world can hear you,\" she yelled to the crowd with a big smile, before repeating the chant once more.\n\nThe March for Our Lives rallies were anchored by the main event in the U.S. capital, where students, teachers, parents and other members of the public marched for gun control and school-safety measures on Saturday, in the wake of last month's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. There were more than 800 so-called \"sibling marches\" planned worldwide for this weekend in solidarity of the main event.\n\nThe marchers across the country and around the globe called on American lawmakers to make schools safer and pass stricter gun control laws, such as by prohibiting the sale of high-capacity magazines and banning the high-powered, highly-lethal assault-style weapons often used in mass shootings.",

                "body": "Boston Red Sox ace Chris Sale says he expects to be fine to start on opening day after being hit by a line drive in his final spring training tuneup.\n\nSale was struck on the left hip Saturday by a liner off the bat of Houston's J.D. Davis in the first inning.\n\nSale immediately went to the ground, but walked off the field under his own power. The Red Sox called the injury a bruise.\n\nThe left-hander later said he was OK and expected to pitch Thursday when the AL East champions open at Tampa Bay. Chris Archer was set to start for the Rays -- on Friday, he was hit by a grounder in the forearm of his pitching arm and had to leave a minor league game.\n\nSale led the majors with 308 strikeouts last season, going 17-8 with a 2.90 ERA in his first year with Boston.\n\nSale's injury came a day after San Francisco ace Madison Bumgarner sustained a broken hand on his pitching hand when he was hit by a line drive. He is expected to miss at least a month.\n\nThe Red Sox already were looking at starting out with a depleted rotation. Manager Alex Cora announced hours earlier that pitchers Drew Pomeranz and Eduardo Rodriguez will begin the season on the disabled list. Knuckleballer Steven Wright has accepted a 15-game suspension under Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy.",

Prosecutors believe Benjamin Aparicio (ah-puh-REE'-see-oh) was denied food for more than three weeks.\n\nPolice began investigating after receiving a tip that congregants at the evangelical nondenominational church had held a failed resurrection ceremony before the parents took the body to their native Mexico.

After last month's shooting, Delta said it will no longer offer discounted fares to members of the National Rifle Association to reflect its neutral status on the gun-control debate.\n\nOther businesses made similar moves, which led to a backlash from gun advocates. The state of Georgia eliminated a proposed tax break on jet fuel in retaliation.",

                "body": "A hero French police officer who was killed by an alleged ISIS-inspired terrorist after stepping in for a hostage showed \"exceptional courage and sacrifice,\" President Emmanuel Macron said.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Arnaud Beltrame, 45, volunteered to swap out a woman who was being held captive in a supermarket in Trebes, which is in southern France Friday.\n\n\"By offering himself up as [a] hostage to the terrorist ... Beltrame saved the life of a civilian hostage, showing exceptional courage and sacrifice,\" the president said in a statement. \"In the heat of action, Lt-Col Beltrame showed exceptional cool and illustrated military virtues in a resonating manner, that deserves the respect and admiration of the entire nation.\"\n\nBeltrame was at the top of his class at military school, which Macron likened to West Point. He was later deployed to Iraq in 2005 and was decorated by the cross of military valor two years later.\n\nHe was also part of the security team at the Elysee Palace for four years, Macron added.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation, to which he had already contributed so much,\" Macron said. \"By giving his life to end the murderous rampage of a terrorist jihadist, he died a hero.\"\n\nThree other people died in the attack, allegedly carried out by 26-year-old Redouane Lakdi. He was killed after responding police officers -- guided by Beltrame's phone, which he left open so that he could be tracked -- stormed the supermarket and shot him.\n\nISIS later claimed responsibility in a statement via its Amaq News Agency, saying in Arabic that \"a soldier of the Islamic State\" carried out the attack in Trebes \"in response to calls to target the coalition countries.\"\n\nLakdi had demanded that authorities release Salah Abdeslam, the only living suspect and the alleged mastermind of the 2015 terror attacks in Paris that left 130 dead, according to French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb.\n\nA judicial source told ABC News that investigators found three homemade explosives, a handgun and a hunting knife inside Lakdi's apartment. Police also found digital files and a note mentioning ISIS that is being looked at as a well.\n\nA source close to the investigation added that a friend of Lakdi, who was born in 2000, was taken into custody.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump sent his condolences in a tweet, saying \"our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France.\"\n\n\"We grieve the nation's loss,\" he tweeted. \"We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support. We are with you @EmmanuelMacron!\"\n\nThe woman whom Beltrame swapped out has not been identified. But authorities credit Beltrame with getting her out safely -- and perhaps preventing further tragedy.\n\n\"He saved lives,\" Macron told reporters Friday.\n\nHe called on every French person \"to honor his memory.\"",

Stanley was one putt away from elimination in group play when he holed an 8-foot birdie putt, and then beat Paul Casey in a sudden-death playoff to advance.\n\nHe faced Thomas in the quarterfinals.\n\nIan Poulter won his fourth straight match, racing to a big lead against Louis Oosthuizen and holding him off to win in 17 holes. Poulter first was told reaching the quarterfinals would be enough to crack the top 50 in the world ranking and earn a Masters spot. Instead, he had to beat Kevin Kisner, a 1-up winner over Matt Kuchar, on Saturday afternoon.\n\nAt least he still has a chance.\n\nCharles Howell III, who grew up a few miles from Augusta National but has not been eligible for the Masters since 2012, needed to win two matches Saturday to get into the top 50. This week is the cutoff for the Masters taking the top 50 in the world who are not already exempt.\n\nHowell had a 1-up lead against Kiradech Aphibarnrat, only for the Thai to hole birdie putts of 8 feet on the last two holes to win.\n\nKiradech moved on to face Bubba Watson, who emerged a 2-and-1 winner over Brian Harman in the battle of Georgia southpaws.\n\nPatrick Reed, one day after eliminating crowd favorite Jordan Spieth, wasn't particularly sharp for the second straight round and this time he paid for it. Alex Noren lost only one hole in a 5-and-3 victory, advancing to the quarterfinals for the second straight year.\n\nNoren has won eight of his last nine matches. He faced Cameron Smith of Australia, who recovered from losing the opening two holes to knock out Tyrrell Hatton on England, 2 and 1.",

The AP saw a widely destroyed and empty town.\n\nTurkey launched a ground and air offensive on Jan. 20 codenamed Olive Branch to oust the main Syrian Kurdish militia known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG, from Afrin. Turkey considers the YPG a terror group and an extension of Kurdish rebels waging an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials and the country's state media said the Turkish offensive displaced more than 200,000 people from their homes.\n\nIn Afrin's town center, captured Sunday, allied Syrian forces patrolled the streets as Turkish tanks and armored personnel carriers drove past.\n\nIsmail Montaser Billah, a Syrian fighter, said the YPG withdrew from Afrin after resisting the offensive. \"They had left mines but thank God we took (the town) and we will step on their heads God willing,\" he said. Turkish and Syrian opposition flags were flying in the area.\n\nCivilians, including women and children, were out and about in central Afrin. Abdul-Rahman Mohammed, a civilian, said the YPG mistreated locals who did not cooperate with them. \"We are suffering because of a lack of food and water,\" he added.\n\nThe Turkish Red Crescent distributed food and aid in Afrin. Kerem Kinik, the organization's president, said some 100,000 civilians remained in and around Afrin.",

Some of the payments took place when Kuczynski was a government minister, raising questions about whether they were made in return for political favors.\n\nThe former Wall Street investor has denied any wrongdoing. He said the consulting firm, Westfield Capital, was then being managed by his business partner and that he paid taxes on all earnings from that era.\n\nOdebrecht has admitted to paying $800 million in bribes to officials across Latin America including $29 million in Peru.\n\nAt the same time the hearing was taking place, prosecutors carried out a search of Kuczynski's home in Lima and another property outside the capital.\n\n\"Peru since the 19th century has watched the sad show as presidents and ex-presidents flee the country and justice,\" said Hamilton Castro, the anti-corruption prosecutor who had requested Kuczynski be barred from leaving Peru. \"This is the historical behavior that we seekers of justice have to take into account.\"\n\nKuczynski's lawyer promised his client's full cooperation and said he would abide by the prosecutor's request not to leave the country. Kuczynski was not present at Saturday's hearing.\n\nKuzynski is the fourth former Peruvian president to be investigated for taking payments from Odebrecht. One is currently in jail while another, Alejandro Toledo, for whom Kuczynski served as finance minister, has refused to return to Peru from the U.S. to face charges.",

Kenneth mode with ABC news here live in Washington where the march for our own lives 45 minutes away from starting we are seeing a stream of people. We were walking toward Pennsylvania Avenue now where that is the apathy and around third fourth and Pennsylvania. On where people will be lined up for at least nine bought almost routine the White House we're told were hundreds of thousands of people are expected in the nation's capital today you thief. The capital right there behind me where. People are really hoping that the folks who worked inside that building on Capitol Hill. We're hear them and really move on them tougher gun control laws and making schools vapor people walking out of Union Station. Right now and they have been it's been guys were. Hours now at this point since early this morning we see people who have been coming off frames off but this off. The city's metro. And they've been making their way to get their spot on Pennsylvania Avenue because they want to be close to the main stage with stretches. All the way across Pennsylvania Avenue to get those speakers performers a number of celebrities from Jennifer hunt's then. Two Arianna grind de who reportedly former on that stage I'm the with a bit big benefit concert last night. And there are a lot of speakers and performers today applauded feeling spoke that are behind me hey guys does not let anything until we upwards at the second. Q why would that important for you guys to be here today. Because. It's really just gotten to a place where people aren't able to feel safe and thinks they really should end their school. Emory here to show that you know no matter who you are not where you live no matter what you come from a what you believe in you should really have a right to be safe. In a place we're trying to get an education. You've got to students I assume. Where he got the ten school where you're from I'm proud Maryland and I did not meet its at a community college and you. I'm Fran clean an analyst at. And I near Ayers that at some point you guys and college but at some point you were in high school could you imagine. Obviously high school students having to deal that. Having to look for exits having to a bill like they had they are not safe in their school. Now I mean that out there and that's and I think that's why you know coming here like you're saying is so important kansas' one of the ways we can have a voice and us. And the fact that those kids were completely alone and there are so many kids across the project completely alone when this happens and it's. You know they need a voice to stand up for them and obviously our. Government isn't doing enough so it's up so we. They're so maybe when this country who believe that. People were out here today they're here because they're anti god their anti Second Amendment argue anti Second Amendment. I'm. Stanley that does even the Second Amendment but personally I have. Never on interest and it it's just something that to me has always been scary and I won't ever understand why people look I think. Having guns just on them will be something that is like a hobby and something it's it's scary to think that somebody. Just things these deadly weapons let me ask you DCB either side of the debate. I think the constitution does it we moderates there arms but I also think that states we operate life. We have a right to pursue happiness in the artery to liberty and without regulation of dangerous conflict this with. And the hands of criminals and in the hands of people who are bigoted hearts and there is no way that people can pursue this other shapes like finger. And the young person and a school do you think the president comes accident on bonds stocks for instance yesterday. Will make an impact. I don't think it's enough. And I think we've really gotten to stay in the country where we all need to come together and really say that we need to accidents and even harsher regulations over what are currently being. Thank you guys that really appreciate it thanks for taking the time to tablet that's yet. Folks who are young folks from obviously from high school to college and wanted to be here this thing student. Glad peppered. Austin allied effort really globally across the world. Where hundreds of marches are planned in major cities in New York Los Angeles London Paris where they hear it gathered organized together. Without the help of adults really and they appliance something monumental like this and really what they're calling a move math folks you relieve these transportation centers. And make their way order Pennsylvania Avenue where they will line that the street. And really be their voices heard. Because again they want something done but have I mentioned in my questioning there they're than other side to this debate and me point to the fact that the NRA is the leader of that other side of debate at that you see some signs that say. It permits anti NRA I. That guns are not needed are certainly types ago that I testing assault rivals. Actually looking at some of the I mean you look across some of it people who were actually walking across that melt the guidance. Some would say that's pretty anti guide. I've been there are a lot of folks who were out here today who say they are not anti god and that they are for the Second Amendment. I'm but you're gonna get a different. Opinions and views that are out here if when you seating spoke beneath it this field and eighty that we have seen out here people from different backgrounds and generations of votes. Am laser com Ed tell you got a ten of them would ABC counts as a chat what you just perfect and if you guys are going to the march they've got designs. You the I was sockets and one earlier we talked about your position on god save melt the guy. Right well this is a slugging from a song that from about thirty years ago on it's just basically saying that we need to get rid of guns and on the go get rid of all the guns but it's a start. So we're just hoping for better gun control laws we also want better background checks. On in the ban on assault guns that we could just not the assault against Abbott B grade. But there are people who say it in you say assault weapons or Harry. When you turn around guns in general there are folks who say we need. Our are we need more power not lives. We don't need more firepower. We if you want to go hunting with that if you wanna hanging Karen Twomey be protector. That's fine but we don't need assault rifles we need guns that can kill. Hundreds of people. And run round that's ridiculous. QE coming from I'm from Norfolk Virginian I'm actually an elementary school teacher and I have for the last twenty years. Three of four times a year taking kindergarten and first graders into closets I did over that I don't wanna do that anymore curia apartments are gonna you wanna get down they get yours by your name my name is Kathy Gordon Kathy your school teacher. Do you want to be armed. No I did not want to be arm definitely did not going to be arm it wouldn't be impossible to. Have the teachers carry guns. It would jazz the results in two. Unwanted disasters it just would not work for teachers we can't beyond beat up on I don't wanna be responsible. Bird she needs somebody making mistake in shooting the wrong person. Week that's not where I went to needs to school to be a teacher I wanna teach kids I don't wanna be. On the liberian so army but my books. At the men and women inside that building just behind us here have they done enough to make the schools safer now of course. They haven't done nearly enough and I also would like to to say it's not just the school issue. There are many mass shootings in this country that nothing to do with schools and New Orleans Las Vegas. Charleston and this does not schools or churches as we're clubs is where outdoor events. It is the it is not just a school issue and I think that needs to be addressed to and that's by. Army's school teachers or putting in an armed guard at the school doesn't. Doesn't change in the of that you know I mean used to be able to go into your church and pray with your church group and not worry about. Nineteen year old kid he's gotten a gun he didn't get it back full background check and staying with going in tonight clever going to a concert. And the nightclubs. They have armed. They have been on guard there and he was shot. Says that's not the answer that's that we need to really think about the evening and making stricter gun control. Background shacks. I you know we have a license to drive you should have a license to carry guns that's how I feel about it. It beach and big for your service and in the education field as well. Thank you so much so yes says she's gonna take her place he'd better sign it's our group right there and they're gonna head down. I'm their spots we're seeing a lot of folks like that were coming from all over from. Virginia obviously a close plate but from several states all over to make their way to the nation's capital for this he beat some more young folks in families who were coming right now. Two march for our lives as they have the sticker that they fight for our lives here. So educators that young people here aren't as well all coming at Union Station to make their way over now we want to talk about. All those other people you know what. We've got a whole team here with ABC news Becky was trying to tell me something she's being shot right now I'm gunnery what shortly that they offer phone here. You know yes he's making the point that are very important to highlight here that there is a large organization. Here. That is happening here and not only with the people who are saying hey we need to pass tougher gun control laws. But we also need to vote that we think people were stationed around the smarts and carry even outside you these are right here. Who are having to walk when they hear air. Deputy this time I hear. This is somebody hey Heidi diet can of the ABC news you thing registered to vote now. We've got the march for our lives logo are talking over the main acts. Like that you think obviously is important not only to say hey we. Think about dismissive remarks are alive like get out and vote of well. Have chorus. I mean the one way we have a voice really be heard is through voting and I mean I truly think that every voice and every vote. As important and if you want have legislation that supports your beliefs and that leaves them. You know the majority of us then gotten out and. I'm. I just. Preach. It. And are you saying register a vote to give you were gonna act effort and a gun control loggers thing. Get out and vote and can be represented the and it hors. I mean at the democracies and free voice is unique to the person and so every voice. As equals. Stacy Saint Louis University where that's I get to see both like there are trying to mobilize organized and motivate people to make sure their voices are heard obviously that they. Big political statement that lead me out of here when you have. Groups that you know hundreds of thousand people work every day here with. Pretty much the same ideal goal and acting tougher gun control laws would got folks who were just trying to make sure. People exercised. Either write it civic engagement going as well so we're still thinking this instrument poker and it walking incidents that put us here at ABC news. We've got to cover this march paralyzed it cannot vote reporting from Washington.",

                "title": "Chen avenges his Olympic flop with world figure skate title",
                "body": "Nathan Chen's redemption is complete.\n\nWhile all of his top competitors fell, the 18-year-old Chen completed six quadruple jumps in the free program on Saturday to become the first U.S. winner of the men's world figure skating title since 2009.\n\nFor the rest, it was a fallathon: 14 sprawls, splats, and tumbles among five competitors as they attempted the all-mighty quad. There were three falls by silver medalist Shoma Uno of Japan, who matched his Olympic silver, and two by Mikhail Kolyada of Russia, who took bronze.\n\nSkating last, Chen said he knew the others made mistakes - though not quite how bad - and that gave him the freedom to attempt six quads, knowing he had room for error.\n\nAfter his woeful Olympic short program put the podium out of reach, Chen said at the worlds, \"I just wanted to redeem myself in the short, and try to maintain what I did in the long.\"\n\nHe did better than that. He finished first in the short, vanquishing that Olympic ghost.\n\nAnd then in the free, he completed six quadruples, with minor deductions for stepping out of the quadruple salchow, to score 219.46 in the free for an overall total of 321.40. That compared to his Olympic free program where he attempted six triples, completing five cleanly but putting his hands down on a quad-flip. That earned him an Olympic record 215.08 points.\n\nChen said the Olympic disappointment in the individual and team short programs helped pave the way to the world title, the first by a U.S. men's skater since Evan Lysacek nine years ago.\n\n\"I learned so much more from making those mistakes in both short programs, than if I would have skated better,\" Chen said. \"'Having that experience will propel me in the future better than if I had done the short program better.\"\n\nUno, the only Olympic medalist to show up at the worlds, finished nearly 50 points behind Chen.\n\nUno stunned the crowd when he fell on an opening quad loop, and circled around for another fall on a quad flip. The final fall came on a quad toe. But with the crowd urging him on, he finished strong with a quad toe in combination and two more combinations as Puccini's \"Turandot\" intoned the famed refrain \"vincero,\" ''I will win.\"\n\n\"I did not give up,\" said Uno, who injured his right foot after the Olympics due to an ill-fitting boot.\n\nSkating to an Elvis Presley medley, Kolyada fell on his opening quad lutz and a quad toe, hitting just one of his quadruple attempts. He showed his disappointment by pointing to his head as he waited for his marks to go up: 185.27 in the free for a total of 272.32.\n\nU.S. skater Vincent Zhou, the world junior champion last year, fell three times in the final skate, tumbling to 14th place after a strong short program put him within striking distance of the podium.\n\nThe generally chaotic programs, to some, reflected the long skating season, which started in September, and the pressure of turning around quickly for a major international championship. But the medal winners all said they had enough turnaround time and would compete again in an Olympic year worlds as long as one was scheduled.\n\nThe International Skating Union is considering other rule changes at its next congress in June, which could impact how the skaters plan their programs. Proposals include shortening the long program and limiting the number of quads that can be repeated.\n\nLater Saturday is the ice dance, with Olympic silver medalists Gabrielle Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron of France looking to reclaim the world title.",

The accused shooter, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, was a former student at the school and was armed with an AR-15-style rifle he had legally purchased a year ago, authorities said.\n\nNow, students around the country -- and their allies around the world -- are calling on American lawmakers to make schools safer and pass stricter gun-control laws, such as by prohibiting the sale of high-capacity magazines and banning the high-powered, highly-lethal assault-style weapons often used in mass shootings.\n\nAs thousands of people began to gather in the U.S. capital Saturday morning, other marches were already underway in cities abroad, including London, Paris, Rome, Berlin and Sydney.\n\nOutside the newly-built U.S. embassy in London, a young child participating in the March for Our Lives there held a sign that read, \"Love is greater than FEAR.\" A minute of silence was held in honor of the victims of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Florida.\n\nOne of the London event's organizers from Amnesty International told Sky News how he admires the strength and courage of the shooting survivors in the U.S.\n\n\"They have come together at a very difficult time and raised their voices and really taken control of the narrative around gun control in the USA,\" he said.\n\nMarch for Our Lives participants in Paris issued a poignant, rallying cry for gun control, with chants reminiscent of the Vietnam War protests. They shouted, \"Hey hey, NRA, how many kids were killed today?\" and \"Hey hey, ho ho, gun violence has got to go!\"\n\nIn Rome, American and international students wielding loudspeakers amassed near the U.S. embassy, some hoisting banners reading, \"Protect People, Not Guns,\" \"Enough is Enough\" and \"Dress Codes Are More Regulated Than Guns.\"\n\nAmerican citizen Katelin Meffert participated in the March for Our Lives in Berlin. Meffert, who's originally from Michigan, told ABC News she's expecting her first child in May and will eventually return home to the United States, by which point she hopes lawmakers will have enacted tougher gun-control laws.\n\n\"As an American abroad living in a country where I don't feel fear, I see the benefit of creating commonsense legislation that keeps people safe,\" Meffert said.\n\nAustralians participating in the March for Our Lives in Sydney read out the names and ages of the victims of the Florida school shooting.\n\nMarch for Our Lives organizers explain on the official website that they support the constitutional right of law-abiding U.S. citizens to bear arms, but say the recent surge of mass shootings, particularly at schools, calls for an honest discussion about guns.\n\nStudents, teachers and their supporters are taking to the streets because they \"will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar,\" the organizers say.\n\n\"Not one more. We cannot allow one more child to be shot at school. We cannot allow one more teacher to make a choice to jump in front of a firing assault rifle to save the lives of students,\" the organizers say in their online mission statement. \"In the tragic wake of the seventeen lives brutally cut short in Florida, politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns.

So we're just hoping for better gun control laws we also want better background checks. On in the day in an assault guns we could just not the assault guns that would be great. But there are people who say it you say assault weapons there are going to try to run guns in general there are folks who say we need. Are are we need more power not less. We don't need more firepower. We if you want to go hunting with that if you wanna hang on to navy protector. That's fine but we don't need assault rifles we need guns that. Can kill. Hundreds of people. And run round that's ridiculous story coming from I'm from Norfolk Virginian I'm actually an elementary school teacher and I have for the last twenty years. Three of four times a year taking kindergarten and first graders into closets I did over that I don't wanna do anymore. Q via apartments are gonna you wanna get down they get yours by your name my name is Kathy Gordon Kathy your school teacher. Do you want to be armed. No I did not want to be definitely did not going to be arm it wouldn't be impossible to. Have teachers -- guns. It would says it resolved in two. Unwanted disasters it just would not work for teachers we can't be on meet up on I don't wanna be responsible. Verdict sheet means somebody making mistake in shooting the wrong person week that's now where I went to beats. The school be a teacher I wanna teach kids I don't want to be. On the liberian so I mean that my books. At the men and women inside that building just behind us here have they done enough to make the schools safer. Now of course. They haven't done nearly enough and I also would like to to say it's not just the school issue. There are many mass shootings in this country nothing to do with schools and New Orleans Las Vegas Charleston and this isn't schools or churches as we're clubs is where outdoor event. It is the it is not just a school issue and I think that needs to be addressed to and that's why arming school teachers. Or putting in an armed guard at the school doesn't. Doesn't change any of that you know I mean used to be able to go in to your church and pray with your church group and not worry about. Nineteen year old kid he's gotten it done he didn't get it that full background check. And same with going in tonight and are going to a concert and the nightclubs. They have armed. They have been on guard there and he was shot says that's not eons that's why we need you really think about banning guns. Making stricter gun control. On background shacks. I you know we have a license to drive each and a license to carry guns.",

Brian Levingston, who was among the unofficial organizers of the protest. \"But today we stand right now to tell you we are human beings and the United States of America -- this is our country.\"\n\nDemonstrations continued across downtown Sacramento throughout the afternoon and into the night, eventually ending around 9 p.m.\n\nFriday's protests followed demonstrations on Thursday, when hundreds of people gathered outside a sports arena where the NBA team, the Sacramento Kings, were set to play against the Atlanta Hawks, causing a lengthy delay to the start of a scheduled game.\n\nThe demonstrations were ignited by the Sacramento Police Department's release of body-camera and helicopter infrared footage of Clark's killing in his grandmother's backyard.\n\nThe officers were responding to reports of a black male breaking into a car and hiding in a backyard when they encountered Clark last Sunday night. Police said Clark advanced toward the responding officers while holding an object in his hand. Initially, police reported that Clark was armed with a gun, then with a \"toolbar,\" but all that was found on him was a cellphone.\n\nThe footage shows Clark running from a neighbor's yard and onto his grandmother's property. Police are seen running down a driveway after Clark and taking cover at the edge of a building. The officers yell several times for Clark to stop and show them his hands before firing a barrage of gunshots.\n\nPolice fired 20 bullets at Clark, killing him.\n\nHe was a father of a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old, according to his brother, Stevante Clark.\n\nBoth officers involved in the shooting are on paid administrative leave.\n\nThe fatal shooting came less than two years after the killing of Joseph Mann, another unarmed black man who was shot by Sacramento police in July 2016.\n\nABC News' Josiah Bates and Julia Jacobo contributed to this report.",

                "title": "Red Sox's Steven Wright suspended for violating MLB domestic violence policy",
                "body": "The right-hander will not appeal.\n\nThe Red Sox were hopeful Wright would be ready to open the season on time after recovering from right knee surgery last year. His absence cements a spot in the rotation for left-hander Brian Johnson.\n\nMLB investigated a Dec. 8 incident involving Wright and his wife, Shannon. He was arrested at their Tennessee home on misdemeanor charges of domestic assault and preventing a 911 call. He was released the following day on a $2,500 bond, and his case was later retired by the Williamson County court and will be dropped if additional offenses don't occur within the next year.\n\nWright and his wife have been undergoing counseling since.\n\n\"While it's clear that Mr. Wright regrets what transpired that evening, takes full responsibility for his actions and has committed himself to treatment and counseling components of the [MLB domestic violence] policy, I have concluded that Mr. Wright's conduct on Dec. 8 violated the policy and warrants discipline,\" commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.\n\nIn a separate statement released by the players' union, Wright reiterated comments he made early in spring training when he insisted he \"did not make physical contact with my wife. The legal case that was retired supports that claim.\"\n\nWright also said he regrets his actions and takes full responsibility. His decision not to appeal the suspension was made \"in an effort to move forward and focus on my family and returning from injury,\" the pitcher said. He also apologized to the Red Sox, teammates, fans and his family and expressed gratitude for their support.\n\nWright's suspension matches last year's 15-game punishment for New York Mets closer Jeurys Familia. Other violators of the domestic violence policy, including New York Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman (30 games) and Mets infielder Jose Reyes (52 games), received longer suspensions.\n\n\"While we are disappointed that this incident occurred, we are encouraged that Steven is taking meaningful steps to learn from this unfortunate incident,\" the Red Sox said in a statement.",

                "title": "C ya! Mets' David Wright is baseball's lone captain in 2018",
                "body": "Anthony Rizzo is a three-time All-Star and the 2017 winner of the Roberto Clemente Award, baseball's biggest honor for sportsmanship and community involvement. Jon Lester is a three-time World Series champion, and Jason Heyward organized the most important meeting in franchise history.\n\nPlenty of leaders with the Chicago Cubs. No captain.\n\nOne of the most revered titles in sports is hanging by a thread in baseball, which treats its history with hallowed tones in almost every case, but doesn't seem the slightest bit concerned about the absence of the iconic C on the front of its uniforms. New York Mets third baseman David Wright is the majors' only captain on the eve of the season, and it's unclear if he will ever play again.\n\n\"Leadership is a taken role and people want to follow you just based on how you are, how you treat them, how well you listen, how well you interact daily, how much you really are into them as opposed to yourself,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, \"and that becomes obvious. Leadership is taken, man. It's hard to just place that out there.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old Wright was named the fourth captain in Mets history in 2013, joining Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter and John Franco. He made the last of his seven NL All-Star teams that same year before he was hampered by a series of injuries. He hasn't appeared in a major league game since 2016.\n\nWright declared right away that he wouldn't wear the C on the front of his jersey, so that special touch has been missing from baseball for a couple years.\n\n\"I'm not sure if there's a benefit to having a title and I've never been one to like come in here and say you have to listen to me because I'm the captain,\" Wright said. \"I would hope that if I have something to say that somebody would listen to me because of, you know, because of what I've hopefully displayed in the clubhouse and be considered kind of a leader in here.\"\n\nBut Wright made no attempt to hide the significance of the title to him.\n\n\"I'll say it again, that to this day it's probably the biggest honor away from the field of my career,\" he said.\n\nA variety of factors have contributed to the decline of captains. Many of the captains across sports spend most of their careers with a single team, but that has become a rarity in baseball. There also are no real responsibilities for the title.\n\nHockey captains serve as the team's liaison to the officials. NFL captains participate in the pregame coin toss. NBA captains also have specific responsibilities, but baseball barely mentions the word in its rulebook.\n\n\"There's no, like, formal meeting,\" Washington ace Max Scherzer said. \"It's not like football where you go out there and shake the other team's hands and you need captains to go do that. Baseball doesn't have that. So maybe that's why you don't see it. There's no coin toss.\"\n\nBut the list of baseball captains still includes some of the biggest names in the history of the sport. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Thurman Munson and Derek Jeter are on the list of 11 Yankees captains. Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider with the Dodgers. Jimmie Foxx and Carl Yastrzemski for the Boston Red Sox. Willie Stargell, Barry Larkin and other Hall of Famers.\n\nJeter thought he did something wrong when then-Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called to make him captain in 2003.\n\n\"The boss, Mr. Steinbrenner usually only called if you were in trouble during the season,\" Jeter said. \"He called me, we were in Cincinnati, and said he wanted to name me the captain. It was a welcome phone call.\"\n\nThe list of baseball captains underscores not only the special players to hold the title, but also the unique situations that led to their leadership position.\n\nRizzo, Lester and Heyward, who got the Cubs together during a key moment in Game 7 of their World Series win in 2016, could each serve as captain. But identifying one leader in Chicago's clubhouse at the possible expense of its other respected veterans likely would hurt the team more than help it. There are similar situations in several other clubhouses across the sport.\n\n\"Having a team captain could conceivably in some ways change the relationship between the manager and the coaches and the rest of the team,\" Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said.\n\n\"So, again, it's all about the people. It's not that it's a good idea or a bad idea, it's all about the people. It's not just the guy you're considering for that position but also everybody around him, your own players, the manager, the coaching staff. You really have to think of it in those terms.\"\n\nAP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick and AP Sports Writer Steven Wine contributed to this report.\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball",

                "title": "Why Trump's latest steps heighten risk of a global trade war",
                "body": "President Ronald Reagan once likened trade wars to the pie fights in old Hollywood comedies. One pie in the face leads to another. And then another.\n\nPretty soon, Reagan said in a 1986 radio address, \"everything and everybody just gets messier and messier. The difference here is that it's not funny. It's tragic. Protectionism becomes destructionism. It costs jobs.\"\n\nSuddenly, the world's financial markets are gripped by fear that an escalating trade rift between the United States and China -- the two mightiest economies -- could smear the world with a lot of splattered cream and broken crust. If it doesn't prove tragic, as Reagan warned, it may still inflict far-reaching pain.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average lost a combined nearly 1,150 points Thursday and Friday after President Donald Trump set his administration on a path to restrict Chinese investment in the United States and impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese products.\n\n\"We should be very worried,\" said Bryan Riley, director of the conservative National Taxpayer Union's Free Trade Initiative. \"It's very possible this could escalate into something that neither country intends.\"\n\nThe trade sanctions that Trump unveiled Thursday are meant to punish Beijing for pilfering technology from American companies or for forcing them to hand over technology in exchange for access to China's market. The announcement followed a seven-month investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative into the tactics China has deployed to try to overtake American technological supremacy.\n\n\"China has not been playing by the rules,\" said Stephen Ezell, director of global innovation policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation think tank.\n\nUnbowed, China immediately threatened to retaliate if the United States followed through on its actions.\n\nOn Friday, Beijing unveiled a broad list of U.S. products -- from apples and wine to pork to steel pipe -- that could face retaliatory Chinese tariffs in a separate trade spat with Washington. That dispute is over taxes that Trump imposed this month on imported steel and aluminum.\n\n\"We don't want a trade war, but we are not afraid of it,\" said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe stakes are even higher in the standoff over Beijing's technology policies than in the old-school dispute over metals. An industrial nation's ability to harness technology is increasingly vital to healthy economic expansion.\n\n\"If China dominates the industries of the future, it will be very difficult for the United States to have an economic future,\" Peter Navarro, a key White House trade adviser, told reporters.\n\nTrade tensions are rising at a delicate time. The world economy has finally emerged from the shadow of the Great Recession. Major regions are growing in tandem for the first time in a decade. International economic growth is expected to reach a seven-year high of 3.9 percent this year. Last year, global trade expanded 4.2 percent, the most since 2011.\n\nSome trade experts fear that a conflict over technology will erupt into an escalating war of sanctions between the world's two biggest economies -- Reagan's destructive pie fight.\n\nThe U.S.-China tensions remind economists and trade analysts of the Reagan-era skirmishes between the United States and Japan, which at the time appeared to pose a grave threat to U.S. economic dominance.\n\n\"This is 'Back to the Future' -- that old '80s film,\" said Rod Hunter, a former White House trade adviser. Indeed, Trump's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, is a veteran of the trade battles with Tokyo, having served in the Reagan administration.\n\nTo target China, Trump and Lighthizer dusted off a Cold War weapon from the Reagan years: Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which lets the president unilaterally impose tariffs. The provision was meant for a world in which much of global commerce wasn't covered by trade agreements. But with the arrival in 1995 of the World Trade Organization, Section 301 fell largely into disuse.\n\nIn some ways, a hard-nosed approach succeeded against Japan three decades ago. Under U.S. pressure, Tokyo agreed to \"voluntary export restraints\" to limit auto shipments to the United States. But to bypass the limits, Japanese automakers simply built plants in the American South.\n\nLikewise, the Reagan administration in 1985 strong-armed Japan, Germany, France and Britain to raise their currencies' values to help U.S. manufacturers squeezed by a strong dollar, which makes U.S. goods costlier overseas.\n\nBut the United States wielded unusual leverage with Japan. The two countries are close political allies; Japan depends on U.S. military protection. China, by contrast, is a geopolitical rival, far less likely to bend to U.S. pressure.\n\nIt's true that China has benefited enormously from access to the American market and has much to lose: Last year, it exported $375 billion more in goods to the United States than it bought in return -- a record trade gap that irritates Trump.\n\nBut a full-blown trade war would test Trump's fortitude for commercial combat and would certainly hurt many Americans, including some of Trump's supporters. Most directly, U.S. tariffs would raise costs for consumers and businesses.\n\nTrade groups are already lobbying the Trump administration to seek diplomatic solutions to the disputes. China's all-powerful leaders face no such public pressure.\n\n\"We live in a society where stakeholders in Congress are going to put a lot of pressure on the administration,\" said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"In China, they don't.\"\n\nStill, the 301 sanctions might be enough to prod the Chinese to return to the negotiating table to consider softening their aggressive technology policies.\n\n\"If this gets the two countries back to the table to talk about this, then that is a good outcome,\" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. \"If the idea is to inflict sufficient pain so that China feels it has no choice but to change its policies, then I'm skeptical.\"\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nFollow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at https://twitter.com/PaulWisemanAP",

                "title": "Can Facebook restore public trust after privacy scandal?",
                "body": "It's a scandal of privacy, politics and an essential ingredient of business success -- public trust.\n\nFacebook is confronting a costly, embarrassing public relations debacle after revelations that Cambridge Analytica may have misused data from some 50 million users to try to influence elections. Among its marquee clients: President Donald Trump's general election campaign.\n\nNow a company known as much for reminders of a long-lost friend's birthday and documentation of acquaintances' every whim is grappling with outrage -- and the possible loss of confidence -- from users around the globe that have made the social media site a part of their daily routine.\n\n\"I trust somebody until they give me a reason not to trust them,\" said Joseph Holt, who teaches business ethics at the University of Notre Dame. \"And Facebook has increasingly given me reasons not to trust them.\"\n\nLosing that would be a disaster, not just for Facebook, but for any Silicon Valley company that relies on users to open up their private lives.\n\nThe amount of trust placed in technology has soared. Cars sync with cell phones. Refrigerators know when there's no more milk and reorder it. Virtual assistants field answers to nearly any inane question.\n\nAnd with each turn of the steering wheel, sip of milk or request for dinner reservations, a trail of digital crumbs is left for companies to collect, analyze and profit off.\n\nThe public has largely been willing to accept the trade-off, knowing in exchange for giving up some data, Netflix will offer spot-on show suggestions, Amazon will prompt a diaper order and Google will figure out what to search before a user finishes typing it.\n\nNot everyone understands the darker side of data brokers in an always-connected society.\n\nEvery time a person shops online or at a store, loyalty cards linked to phone numbers or email addresses can be linked to other databases that may have location data, home addresses and more. Voting records, job history, credit scores (remember the Equifax hack?) are constantly mixed, matched and traded by companies in ways regulators haven't caught up with.\n\nWhile Facebook let slip data profiles on millions of people, \"it's much more than that,\" says James Grimmelmann, a professor at Cornell Law School. \"Trying to pin down any one breach as being the source of all the privacy harms out there is futile.\"\n\nFor Facebook, whose power and value are built on being so ever-present in people's lives, the impact has been immediate -- its share price is down nearly 14 percent since the scandal broke March 16.\n\nInvestors fear that Facebook users will start to think twice before posting the latest snapshots of their puppy, or clicking \"like\" on a news story or movie trailer.\n\n\"It's something that's going to remain in people's memory,\" says Mike Chapple, a University of Notre Dame professor with expertise in cybersecurity. \"I think it's changed people's perceptions.\"\n\nAfter the scandal broke, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized, admitted his company's mistakes and said security needs to be enhanced to protect users' data. He noted that this is a major trust issue for the public.\n\nIt follows closely on the heels of the company acknowledging it helped spread fake news and propaganda from Russian-linked trolls disrupting the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhile some disenchanted Facebook users have deactivated their accounts, others point out that breaking up can be hard to do. If a credit card company or an airline's data is breached, it's easy enough to switch allegiances. But for most of Facebook's 2 billion users there's no real substitute, says Aaron Gordon, a partner at Schwartz Media Strategies, a Miami-based public relations and crisis management firm.\n\n\"It's a lot harder to just up and leave,\" he says. \"So you go to Twitter or Instagram? It's not the same.\"\n\n(Besides, Instagram is owned by Facebook.)\n\nHolt, the business ethics professor, loved Facebook, but with all that's come out, he feels like he's in an abusive relationship. He estimates he cut his usage from about 30 minutes daily to about 10 minutes every other day and would happily flee altogether if a viable alternative emerged that more zealously protected data.\n\n\"I haven't left it yet, but I go less often and I feel less good about it,\" he says.\n\nFacebook is not the only company to deal with misuse of private information that has weakened public confidence. Equifax, the credit reporting agency, and Target, the retail giant, both suffered massive data breaches affecting tens of millions of people. Wells Fargo faced stiff government fines for a fake accounts scandal.\n\nThe public tends to get numb to this steady drumbeat of bad news, says brand strategist Rachel Brand.\n\n\"People pick their battles and daily outrage,\" she says. \"Facebook messed up royally, but most people are on a daily outrage roller-coaster and aren't sure if this is the hill worth dying on.\"\n\nMatt Sedensky reported from New York.

In our Washington bureau. David, good morning. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. I want to start by showing you a number from a recent ABC news/\"washington post\" poll. When we ask people whether they thought the spate of mass shootings in this country were a reflection of problems with our mental health care system or inadequate gun control laws, 57% said mental health, only 28% said gun control. So in light of that, what specifically are you hoping to achieve today? Today we are going to start a revolution. This is the beginning of a lifelong marathon not only for me but for my generation. We are sick and tired of the inaction in Washington and around the country at different state capitols and in different cities of politicians owned by the NRA and not listening to their constituents. We are the children and making our voices heard and we will change America with or without these politicians. And today is the beginning of that revolution. David, Dan and I both had the chance to speak with you and so many of your other students in parkland, Florida and Tallahassee about this movement and a big slogan was never again, never again allowing another school shooting to take place. What was the gut reaction when the shooting happened in Maryland earlier this week? I was -- I had to relive a lot of the previs memories that I had from my school shooting. Everybody takes grief their own way but for me it was realizing that because that was a percentage with a gun and in reality were they taken out by law enforcement, yes, and I'm so glad they were but they shouldn't have had to do that in the first place. It's due to a lack of training, mental health and gun and American problem is what we have here. David hogg, we appreciate you joining this us morning. Thank you very much.",

Many traveling to Washington overnight to call for action on gun control. But gun control is a heated topic in this country as we said. Not everybody believes restricting guns will make schools safer. ABC's David Wright is at the main rally stage in Washington for the March today with a look at what both sides are saying as we head into today. David, good morning. Reporter: Good morning, Dan and Adrienne. Very chilly morning here in Washington, but today this is ground zero for the national debate over guns and schools. Pennsylvania avenue, the capitol right behind me there, the white house just a few blocks that a way, hundreds of thousands of marchers expected to converge here led by students survivors from Stoneman Douglas high school. They're here from across the country. Hoping to send lawmakers in Washington a powerful message. It's terrifying knowing there is a chance a shooter might come in. I think this is going to be a real moment of change. I'm honestly fed up. Reporter: This group came from south Florida some hitching a free ride on a jet dough natured by the new England patriots. A like-minded local family is putting them up. Their host,s si sick of worrying about gun violence sdmrif the greatest guests ever. Six guests in my house, three boy, three girls. Reporter: Many celebrities are tweeting their support including Oprah Winfrey, Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber. Already signs lawmakers are getting the message. Our voices are loud, are clear and about to change history. There are also loud voices on the other side. We were disappointed to hear some of the president's comments. Reporter: Gun rights advocates believe the answer is more firepower not less. We protect our president and congressmen with guns and banks with guns but when it comes to schools all we do is put up a sign that says gun-free zone and it's not working. Reporter: Plenty of lawmakers agree, but today these marchers are hoping to convince them otherwise. Students are stepping up to take on the NRA because our elected leaders are afraid to. Reporter: America, we are your future. Why won't you protect us? Reporter: Now this event here in Washington is the main event today but there are events all across the country and around the world, frankly. This movement spreading far and wide. The organizers say 835 local events planned in all. Dan and Adrienne. Will it have an impact is the question? David Wright, thank you very much. For more on that question let's bring in David hogg, one of the organizers, also a survivor of the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in parkland, Florida. In our Washington bureau. David, good morning. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. I want to start by showing you a number from a recent ABC news/\"washington post\" poll. When we ask people whether they thought the spate of mass shootings in this country were a reflection of problems with our mental health care system or inadequate gun control laws, 57% said mental health, only 28% said gun control. So in light of that, what specifically are you hoping to achieve today? Today we are going to start a revolution. This is the beginning of a lifelong marathon not only for me but for my generation.

David, Dan and I both had the chance to speak with you and so many of your other students in parkland, Florida and Tallahassee about this movement and a big slogan was never again, never again allowing another school shooting to take place. What was the gut reaction when the shooting happened in Maryland earlier this week? I was -- I had to relive a lot of the previs memories that I had from my school shooting.

It's due to a lack of training, mental health and gun and American problem is what we have here. David hogg, we appreciate you joining this us morning. Thank you very much. Thank you. Let's get analysis now from ABC news chief political analyst, Matthew dowd who is in Texas and Republican strategist and ABC news contributor Alex Castellano. Let me start with you and turn to Alex. This is sh an emotional and seemingly intractable debate over guns in America. Do you think the March will move the needle. All social movements over the last 100 moments have been led by the energy of the youth combined with the mentoring of the older generations and that's what we're seeing. We've already seen some change as everyone knows Florida passed a ban on certain age limbs on guns. The president's reaction and banning bump stocks, all of those things are in the aftermath of the high school students standing up and giving voice and I think today is another step in that process and as David said they're not going away. They understand it's a marathon. They understand it takes a long time. Today is just a big energy boost for that movement. Alex, do you agree especially given the poll numbers that we've showed that showed many, many Americans don't have an appetite for stricter gun control? Well, I think these student also have an impact. It will be a modest impact of terms of making schools safer, unfortunately. We are seeing schools being hardened, locking door, perimeter security. Those are the kind of things we don't do now that we could do but as far as actually -- we already have a lot of laws against killing people. We have background checks and very few of these laws are being enforced against the mentally ill having a gun so, you know, we're not enforcing what we have now but we're going to pass more laws not to enforce. The big impact is going to be political. 2018. The women's movement, the me too moment, add that to the dreamers, immigrants and kids, millennials voting for gun control and Democrats in 2018, you have a big democratic wave coming. That's what is going to change. You know what, Matt, I have to switch the story line and continue this conversation over guns. What is the most meaningful thing that could come out of the stormy Daniels story line, aside from the tabloid details. What could come out of this? Well, we've seen a lot of suggestions from stormy Daniels' attorney there is evidence or information and obviously everybody is going to be tuned in for that \"60 minutes\" interview and there is a political and legal question. What do they have legally they can prove out a lot of this but from a political perspective, one, it's putting much stress on the president both in his professional-as president but I'm sure in his personal life as a husband to Melania and all of this and so I think what we're going to see come out of this is one, we'll see the evidence, what evidence there is, but, two, it continues to put unbelievable stress and time constraints on the president of the United States. And, Alex, of course, a lot of Republicans think this is more of a sideshow and many are growing weary of this. What's your take? Well, I have to say first time impressed with the president's stamina. When I heard that the president had sex with a porn star for 60 minutes I was impressed. What do you mean? That's a joke. The idea that is this going to have a political impact on the trump administration? I doubt it. You can't fall off the floor. You can't burn down the same house twice. Donald Trump is not regarded well by Republicans and supporters because of his moral turpitude. He is there because he is an alternative to two bankrupt party, Democrats and Republicans who are out of control and can't lead the nationx so he is useful. He is not a moral symbol. I doubt this is going to change the political equation, but it's going to be the super bowl of \"60 minutes\" interviews. I think some consider this",

Yeah, my hometown. The crowd blocking streets and bridges and in some cases clashing with drivers on major freeways. ABC's Marci Gonzalez is in Sacramento with the very latest. Good morning, Marci. Reporter: Adrienne, Dan, good morning. Definitely some tense moments on the streets here. But for the most Bart those protests stayed peaceful as demonstrators shared their outrage and heartbreak. Overnight an impassioned siejle. We got to stand together. Reporter: Clashes with police. Have love for us. Reporter: And unfiltered emotion. Stephon Clark's brother confronting officers on the streets of Sacramento. That was my brother. 20 times. 20 times. Days after body camera video captured officers shooting the unarmed young father 20 times. Show me your hands, gun, gun, gun. Killing him in his grandmother's backyard. No justice. No peace. Reporter: Demonstrators for a second day shutting down streets. What's going on here? We want answers. We're not going nowhere till we get the answers. Reporter: Answers the police chief say they are working to get. Our main focus is to gather all the fangs. Reporter: Reviewing aerial video they believe shows Clark on the run after reports of caravan daisms in the area and these dramatic body cam videos. Also questioning the two officers, one white, one African-American who are now on administrative leave about why they thought Clark had a gun when all that was found at the scene was this cell phone. ABC senior legal correspondent sunny Hostin telling our Dan Harris her perspective. What the law provides it doesn't have to be an actual threat. It doesn't have to be an actual gun. It only has to be that the police officer perceived the threat. I can't imagine that even an external investigation is going to determine that this shooting was unjustified. Reporter: But police say it's far too early to make any determination, explaining the investigation will likely take at least a couple of months. Adrienne, Dan, back to you. With so many people in that community watching very closely. Mar Marci, thank you very much. It was a tense scene especially outside of the kings game that was happening. The protest, knocking down security gbarrier, fans had to be turned away. They couldn't get inside. It's happening in yet another American community.",

Tidiness has been established. The favorites are here. Look at this. Reporter: Then there were eight after bracket busters left, right and center court in a tournament full of madness. The favorite strikeback. Villanova, Kansas, duke, restoring order. If your bracket isn't already busted beyond recognition. Stepback three. Reporter: With west Virginia's run coming to a bitter end in the sweet 16 round against the wildcats. The block party turning into a dunk fest. Kansas taking it back from Clemson. This game is over. Reporter: And duke squeezing past Syracuse overnight with a four-point win putting coach K into the ee legality eight for the 15th time. Evans' three. Reporter: With Texas Tech bouncing Purdue, red raiders heading to their first ever trip to the elite eight. Making last night a direct contrast to all the rest of this tournament has gone. Tonight with the final four on the line, three seeded Michigan versus nine seed Florida state. Kansas state to the elite eight. Reporter: And in the send irrell la bracket, number nine Kansas state and number 11 loyola-chicago. Honestly to be here in year four and we're in the elite eight, you know, we don't take these moments for granted. With their faithful companion sister Jean. We want to see that big \"W\" at the end of the game when the final buzzer goes off. Yeah, she's praying and her prayers have been working? They have. Loyola's 98-year-old chaplain. The question is, Tony, have they moved from sendcinderella to legitimate title holder. Amazingly, yes. I don't know if any of you went to catholic school, I'm under the impression it take twos miracles to become a saint. She's already working on three so I'm not saying anything. It's an incredible story for loyola-chicago and it's an incredible history for loyola-chicago. They won the whole title in 1963. Some younger and middle anded viewers are learning this right now. That team went on the court with four African-American starters. They were the first to confront the color barrier so this is a very rich history for loyola-chicago. They can beat anybody in any game, even if sister Jean picked against them now going forward in their bracket. Ah. She did before the tournament. She was hoping for the sweet 16. They were in the elite eight and now against Kansas state a match-up we've never seen nine versus 11. One is going to the final four, and we'll have to say good-bye to another. Who is she going to root for busting her own bracket. She's rooting for loyola-chicago. How dare you, Dan. Do not speak ill of sister Jean. I'm just asking the question. Tony. She wins either way. Thanks very much. The holy woman. Thanks, Tony. Enjoy the games.",

The ride was shut down two years later after the death of a 10-year-old boy and now comes the first criminal charges lodged against the schlitterbahn water park and Tyler Austin miles, a former executive. Matt Gutman has more. Reporter: The first charges this morning nearly two years after Caleb Schwab was tragically killed at the schlitterbahn waterpark. A former park executive along with the park itself are now charged with involuntary manslaughter after the 10-year-old boy was thrown from his raft while riding verruckt, a ride billed as the world's tallest water slide. Miles who what was the director of operations for the park at the time of the accident was named in the indictment Friday along with three others, all charged with having knowledge that the rafts were still going airborne in the days before the grand opening. I spoke with Caleb's parents about that tragic day last year. Six went to the@ park and five came back. Six went to the park and five came back. Reporter: Caleb's 12-year-old brother waited at the bottom of the ride when the unimaginable happened. He was screaming. He flew from verruckt. He flew from verruckt. Reporter: Caleb's father Scott was in such shock a bystander had to confirm the incomprehensible. I just need to hear you say it. Is my son dead? And he just shook his head and I said I need to hear it from you is he dead. He said, yes, your son is dead. There was a gentleman who wouldn't allow me to come close enough to see what was going on. And he just kept saying, no, trust me. You don't want to go any further. Reporter: These are the first criminal charges to be filed in connection with Caleb's death and schlitterbahn said in a statement Friday afternoon that it was deeply disappointed to learn any individual is being personally charged for the terrible accident on Ver ruck and added our review of the facts and circumstances of the accident has never shown any evidence of criminal conduct on the part of anyone. For \"Good morning America,\" Matt Gutman, ABC news, Los Angeles. Not only just looking in the eyes of that sweet little boy but thinking about his parents, entire family and it's just a heart rending story. It is, speaking as a parent myself. Oh. Very, very tough.

Overnight a candlelight vigil vigil and told 800 marches all over this country and the world today, in fact, the March in Sydney, Australia, has already taken place. You key how young some of these students are involved. In advance of this event, president trump who arrived in Florida overnight announced a ban on so-called bump stock, those are the accessories that can be used to turn semiautomatic weapons into machine gun.

Tara, good morning to you. Reporter: Good morning, Dan and Adrienne. That's right. The president acknowledged the thousands of students that which be protesting on his front porch but he's not there. He is here in west palm beach. There will be smaller demonstrations but nothing like at the white house. Before he left he acknowledged their desperate plea for gun control. President trump acknowledged the nationwide gun control rallies just hours before thousands of students descend on the white house. Tweeting that he's banning bump stocks devices like the ones used in the Vegas massacre. Trump initially suggested sweeping gun control after the deadly shooting in parkland, like raising the purchasing age and confiscating guns from criminal. We have to keep the guns out of the hands of those that pose the threat. But after a meeting with the NRA those proposals went nowhere. The NRA doesn't back any ban. Reporter: The newest regulation was swiftly attacked by the right. Many are still reeling over the budget busting spending bill trump approved on Friday. Initially he threatened to veto the bill. That his staff one day earlier told congress to support. Is the president going to sign the bill, the answer is yes. Why? Because it funds his priorities. Reporter: The $1.3 trillion bill allots $1.6 billion for a wall along the Mexican border. Or 33 miles of fencing. President trump who asked for 25 billion fumes it wasn't enough. I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again. Reporter: Less than 12 hours before a government shutdown Paul Ryan called him and secretary of defense general Mattis successfully made the case it was good for the troops. But then in a late night move trump announced a more narrow ban on transgender service members. The new policy bans troops who require surgery or medical treatment. That policy still is subject to court order against the original blanketed ban against transgender troops. The exact number of transgender members is still unknown. But officials estimate that there are only 200 that are requesting medical treatment. Now, democratic leader Nancy Pelosi slammed it calling it hateful.",

                "title": "'Melrose Place' actress faces 2nd re-sentencing for crash",
                "body": "A former \"Melrose Place\" actress whose three-year prison term for a fatal 2010 auto crash sparked outrage from the victim's family and prompted legal appeals must return to court for a second re-sentencing.\n\nA New Jersey appeals court ordered the new sentencing Friday for Amy Locane, writing that the trial judge's re-imposing of the same sentence last year didn't adhere to an earlier appellate ruling and didn't take into account the severity of the crime.\n\n\"The trial judge's legal analysis was not significantly different the second time he sentenced defendant than it was on the first,\" the three-judge panel wrote. They ordered the re-sentencing to take place before a different judge.\n\nJames Wronko, an attorney for Locane, said Friday he was preparing an appeal to file with the state Supreme Court. Wronko said Locane \"clearly acknowledges her role in this case and is extremely remorseful for what occurred.\"\n\nLocane, who acted in 13 episodes of the popular Fox series and also appeared in several movies, served about two-and-a-half years of a three-year sentence for the 2010 accident in Montgomery Township that killed 60-year-old Helene Seeman and seriously injured Seeman's husband, Fred. She was released in 2015.\n\nLocane was convicted of vehicular manslaughter, assault by auto and other offenses and faced a sentencing range of five to 10 years on the most serious count.\n\nProsecutors had sought a seven-year sentence.\n\nLocane's defense contended the crash was an accident and that a third motorist, whose car the actress had bumped into at a traffic light in the minutes before the accident, distracted her by honking at her and chasing her after being rear-ended.\n\nThough the indictment charging Locane didn't mention intoxication, a state expert testified her blood-alcohol level was likely about three times the legal limit and that she was driving roughly 53 mph in a 35 mph zone at the time of the crash.\n\nAfter the initial 2013 sentencing, the appeals court in 2016 ordered a re-sentencing and instructed state Superior Court Judge Robert Reed to offer additional justification for his decision to downgrade one of the charges and impose concurrent rather than consecutive sentences.\n\nIn Friday's opinion, the appeals court noted that while the jury convicted Locane of the lesser offense of second-degree vehicular manslaughter -- prosecutors had sought aggravated manslaughter, a first-degree crime -- Reed then downgraded that to a third-degree offense and imposed the lightest sentence available in that range.\n\n\"We fail to see on this record where the interest of justice demands a downgrade,\" the appeals court wrote. \"Accordingly, we vacate the downgrade.\"\n\nWronko defended Reed's actions and said the judge was intimately familiar with the case and his imposed sentence accordingly.\n\n\"He's not known as a liberal defense judge,\" Wronko said. \"He thought in his own evaluation that the appropriate sentence was three years in state prison.\"\n\nWronko said Locane could have to return to prison if a new judge upgrades the third-degree conviction to a second-degree conviction. A second-degree conviction carries a five-to-10-year prison sentence.",

                "title": "Judd Apatow memorializes mentor, the late Garry Shandling",
                "body": "After Garry Shandling died two years ago, his longtime friend Judd Apatow went through emails he and the comedian had recently shared. Then he started bawling.\n\n\"I realized that every single time I asked him for anything or wanted him to come to some event or to read something for me, he said 'yes' every single time,\" said Apatow. \"It really made me cry.\"\n\nShandling, a groundbreaking comedian not far from the neurotic characters he played, had dedicated his last years to consciously encourage and mentor his friends and fellow comedians but Apatow hadn't realized the full extent of his generosity.\n\n\"He had a lot of conflicts with people but he was also trying very hard to figure it all out so he could do better,\" he said. \"He was a complete, complex human being with all the flaws and all the greatness as anybody else in the world.\"\n\nApatow decided to memorialize his friend in an appropriate way. Shandling, who masterminded a brand of phony docudrama with \"The Larry Sanders Show,\" is now the subject of Apatow's four-hour HBO documentary called \"The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling.\"\n\nThe film includes interviews with James L. Brooks, Linda Doucett, David Duchovny, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jay Leno, Kevin Nealon, Conan O'Brien, Bob Saget, Sarah Silverman and Jeffrey Tambor. The documentary airs in two parts on March 26 and March 27.\n\nWhile four hours sounds like a lot, Apatow goes deep, drawing on 30 years of Shandling's intimate diaries and notes, childhood movies, stand-up performances and raw footage. Michael Cera reads the diary entries, which show a man trying to quiet his demons. \"You are scared of awakening. Let go of that,\" one entry reads.\n\n\"It was very difficult to sit down and read his diaries,\" said Apatow. \"It was like living in Garry's head for a while. It was very emotional. I felt all his pain and his joy.\"\n\n\"The Larry Sanders Show\" was the forerunner to a new kind of painfully awkward, authentic comedy that would inspire \"The Office,\" ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" ''Arrested Development\" and a generation of comics.\n\nIn the series, Shandling played an insecure and spineless late-night TV talk-show host with a regular habit of watching his show in bed at night. Shandling had already made a name for himself with the comedy series \"It's Garry Shandling's Show,\" in which the actors routinely broke the fourth wall to comment on what they were up to.\n\nApatow had a long history with Shandling, interviewing the comic when he was a 16-year-old high-school student doing a radio show on Long Island. He went on to write for Shandling, direct episodes of \"The Larry Sanders Show\" and considered his \"Freaks and Geeks\" a version of \"The Larry Sanders Show,\" only set in high school.\n\n\"The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling\" explores the development of both hit TV shows and delves into Shandling's childhood, his tortured romance with Doucett, his messy break with former manager Brad Grey and the time he became a target of private eye Anthony Pellicano.\n\nNealon praises the documentary, calling Apatow \"a skilled surgeon when it comes to putting the right things in there. He could have made it an eight-hour documentary and we still would have been riveted to it.\"\n\nThe film reveals that the death of Shandling's older brother from cystic fibrosis when Shandling was 10 became a pivotal event, reverberating in his relationship with his suddenly clingy mother, his future love affairs and his quest for honesty.\n\n\"When his brother died, his family didn't talk about it ever. That's how they dealt with it -- by not talking about it. And I think Garry became obsessed with presence and truth because he didn't get that as this important moment,\" said Apatow.\n\n\"This moment changed him. He was very happy as a little kid. He had a dream relationship with his brother. I can't say he ever seemed as much at peace in footage as he does in the footage when he's a little kid rising around with his brother.\"\n\nShandling died of a heart attack at age 66 in 2016. Apatow channeled much of his grief into the documentary, which grew out of short films he made for the memorial service.\n\n\"Now that's over I'm very sad because it's like letting go of my relationship with Garry,\" he said. \"I already miss him because the project is over.\"\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",

                "body": "His nose was round and bright red, his face as white as a sheet. His mouth was surrounded by an exaggerated smear of red makeup and his arched eyebrows hung ridiculously high on his forehead.\n\nSuch was the daily uniform of Bozo the Clown, who entertained kids for decades when TV was in its infancy. It's also a uniform that for many now seems grotesque and sinister.\n\nThe death of longtime Bozo performer Frank Avruch this week triggered both feelings -- warm memories from some and a shiver of fear from others who associate clowns more with the film \"It.\"\n\nWhich begs the question: When exactly did clowns go from birthday-party goofy to downright sinister? Well, hold onto your really big shoes -- experts are divided.\n\nDavid Carlyon, author, playwright and a former clown with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in the 1970s, argues that the fear of clowns -- known officially as coulrophobia -- is a relatively new phenomenon, born from the counter-culture 1960s and emerging as a popular force in the 1980s.\n\n\"There is no ancient fear of clowns,\" he said. \"It wasn't like there was this panic rippling through Madison Square Garden as I walked up through the seats. Not at all.\"\n\nCarlyon said clowns were considered sweet and funny for two centuries until an inevitable backlash that included Stephen King's hit novel \"It,\" the film \"Poltergeist,\" Heath Ledger's white-faced maniac Joker, the misanthrope Krusty the Clown from \"The Simpsons,\" the shock band Insane Clown Posse and Homey D. Clown from \"In Living Color.\"\n\n\"Anything that gets that much glorification and is sentimentalized within an inch of its life invites someone to snark at it,\" said Carlyon, who recently discovered the cover of a National Lampoon from 1979 with a girl cowering in fear of a malevolent clown.\n\n\"There's nothing in any available evidence that kids were afraid of clowns in the '40s, the '50s, the '60s, the '70s,\" he said. \"Who said that about Red Skelton?\"\n\nNot so fast, argues Benjamin Radford, an author and editor at Skeptical Inquirer magazine who literally wrote the book on the subject, 2016's \"Bad Clowns.\" Not to throw a pie in anyone's face, but he argues that evil clowns have always been among us.\n\n\"It's a mistake to ask when clowns turned bad because historically they were never really good. They've always had this deeply ambiguous character,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes they're good; sometimes they're bad. Sometimes they're making you laugh. Other times, they're laughing at your expense.\"\n\nRadford traces bad clowns all the way to ancient Greece and connects them to court jesters and the Harlequin figure. He notes that Punch, an evil puppet who frequently smacks his partner Judy with a stick, made his first appearance in London in the 1500s. \"You have this mass-murdering, baby-killing clown that's beloved by Britons everywhere of all ages,\" he said.\n\nClowns in America had their roots in circuses and they were at first meant to amuse adults, but clowning history took a detour in the 1950s and '60s when the squeaky-clean Bozo and Ronald McDonald became the \"quintessentially American default clowns\" for kids, Radford said.\n\nThe more sinister clown waited patiently for his day to shine. \"Stephen King didn't invent the evil clown. That was long before his time. But what he did was turn the coin over, if you will,\" Radford said.\n\nEven if there's debate on the issue, Radford paid homage to Avruch, the first nationally syndicated incarnation of the iconic Bozo. Without virtuous clowns like him to lay the foundation, the bad ones make no sense.\n\n\"The fact is that we need both bad and good clowns because without the good clowns like Bozo, there's no contrast, there's no tension to make the evil or scary clowns entertaining or interesting,\" Radford said.\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",

He notified airport authorities, which decided to keep the plane on the ground. It wasn't immediately clear if the 40-year-old co-pilot was detained.\n\nThe German news agency dpa reported Saturday that all 106 passengers were put up at hotels overnight. TAP tweeted Saturday that the passengers would only be able to fly to Lisbon on Monday, \"which is, at the moment, the first day with seats available.\"",

                "body": "The U.S. is big, and getting bigger. Since the 1980s, American adults' obesity is at epidemic proportions, and there does not seem to be an end in sight.\n\nRates of obesity in those younger leveled off between 2005 and 2014, but a recent report in JAMA wanted to know if there has been any change.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which takes various measures of the health and nutrition of children and adults in the U.S., using interviews and physical exams.\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI) measures from almost 30,000 adults and 17,000 young people tell the story between 2007 and 2016.\n\nOn BMI measurements: Adults are obese when their BMI is over 30; severe obesity is any BMI over 40. A normal BMI ranges between 18.5 and 24.9. In those under 20 years old, obesity is measured against what is normal for one's age -- obesity is greater than the 95th percentile, while severe obesity is at or above 120 percent of the 95th percentile.\n\nThe CDC results were mixed: in the young, the prevalence of obesity was 16.8 percent in 2007; it was 18.5 percent 10 years later.\n\nThere were no significant differences when looking at age or gender, but that's still nearly 2 out of every 10 kids weighing in as obese. Our youth aren't in the clear just yet.\n\nFor adults, it was a more stark story: obesity increased from 33.7 percent to 39.6 percent over 10 years -- it stood out most in women, and in adults over 40. That's a shocking 2 out of 5 adults.\n\nSeverely obese adults went from 5.7 percent to 7.7 percent, showing up the most in adults from age 20 to 59.\n\nAmericans, it seems, may not realize that these trends increase risk for all types of disease, from heart attack, stroke, and diabetes to many forms of cancer.\n\nAnd although we are seeing a potential plateau of obesity cases in our kids, we continue to hear about them being diagnosed with high blood pressure and diabetes, requiring medication management -- for diseases we often associate with adults.\n\nAlthough the report did not give any recommendations about these results, it is telling that the obesity epidemic isn't losing its heft.\n\nDoctors argue that we cannot accept this as society's new normal -- unless we accept a higher death rate as well. Perhaps the thought of raising more healthy families will prove to be motivation to change.\n\nDr. Najibah Rehman, MD, MPH, is a third-year preventive medicine resident at the University of Michigan, working in the ABC News Medical Unit.",

                "body": "On the eve of the landmark march by thousands of high school students and their supporters speaking out about gun control, an ABC News analysis of tax return records compiled by The Associated Press shows that the National Rifle Association Foundation has funneled millions of dollars into schools to promote shooting sports.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2016, the charitable subsidiary to the pro-gun group gave $7.3 million in grants to more than 500 schools, school clubs, and school districts to fund youth clubs and provide equipment for varsity competitive shooting teams.\n\nThe gunman charged with killing 17 people and injuring 14 others at a Parkland, Florida, high school last month was a part of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School's competitive marksmanship team partially funded by the NRA through a Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC), according to The Associated Press.\n\nBoasting one of the nation's largest JROTC programs, according to Broward County Public Schools spokesperson Cathleen Brennan, schools in Broward County, including the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, received nearly $127,000 in grants from the charitable arm of the pro-gun interest group between 2013 and 2016.\n\nView the interactive map of NRA grants to schools.\n\nNearly half of the more than 700 NRA grants to schools went through JROTC programs across the country.\n\nU.S. Army Cadet Command, which oversees the JROTC programs, did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nWith the success of its JROTC program, the Broward County Public Schools received an additional $5,066 from the NRA Foundation this year, but following the recent tragedy, the school district decided to return its latest NRA grants.\n\nBrennan said the school district will no longer accept grants from the NRA and it's reviewing all of its standard practices and procedures regarding shooting clubs and their funding. In the past, individual schools in the Broward County have applied for and handled outside grants for their marksmanship teams, and not typically tracked by the district, Brennan added.\n\nWhile some school districts have followed Broward County Public Schools to return NRA money, other schools maintain that the grants are essential for running the popular sports that open up many opportunities for students.\n\nWoodcreek High School Sportsmen's Club in Roseville, California, which has been overseeing the school's trap, skeet and sporting clays teams for 13 years, has received five-figure annual grants from the NRA Foundation, totaling $124,559 between 2010 and 2016.\n\n\"This school club allows students who do not have an interest in participating in traditional high school sports the opportunity to connect with, compete for and be a part of the high school sports experience,\" Woodcreek High School Sportsmen's Club head coach Alex Gray told ABC News.\n\nBefore joining the shooting team, Gray added, students are required go through an extensive one-day safety training class, during which new members learn about proper firearm handling techniques and practice extensively with coaches and experienced members of the team at live fire exercise.\n\nAt a small high school in Sutter, California, shooting clubs are among the most popular clubs that boasts more than 80 participants out of the total of 750 students.\n\n\"It's an expensive sport,\" Sutter Union High School Superintendent and Principal Ryan Robison said.\n\nRobison said the NRA grants to the school's trap and rifle teams -- a total of $79,000 between 2013 and 2016 -- account for less than half of the shooting clubs' total funding, but it helps open up the experience to as many students as possible.\n\nSimilarly at Woodcreek High School, Gray said the NRA grants to the club have provided about two to three shotgun to each competitive team member, reducing their costs by about $120 to $180 per season.\n\nShooting clubs funded by the NRA Foundation have also opened up college scholarship opportunities for students.\n\nAt Sutter Union High School, 20 students have received scholarships to train at Olympic training centers and participate in college-level competitions across the country.\n\n\"The nature of the sport attracts highly motivated and dedicated students,\" Robison said. \"It is a very technical activity and requires a high level of concentration and discipline.\"\n\nThe NRA did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.",

She's a self-described \"lover of English\" and aspired to study journalism at the University of Georgia.\n\n\"One minute, [DJ] is talking about her senior plans, and prom and whatever,\" her mother, Jen Tarr, said. \"All of that is out the window now.

At 17, Tarr quickly has found herself emerging in a new role as a gun control activist -- challenging the status quo against political leaders and the NRA.\n\n\"We've been using our voices as high schoolers, as people who aren't afraid to back down, who have nothing to lose, and who are eloquent enough to make sense in what they're saying,\" Tarr said.\n\nIn the immediate days following the shooting, Tarr traveled to the Florida statehouse in Tallahassee to meet with legislators and discuss stronger gun safety proposals. But coming out of those meetings, she called them \"disappointing\" at the subsequent rally.\n\nClad in oversized glasses, Tarr took the podium -- flanked by fellow students -- to deliver a powerful statement: \"We are not here to be patted on the back.\"\n\n\"We know what we want, we want gun reform. We want common sense gun laws,\" she said.\n\nTarr defiantly bucked those lawmakers who did not discuss policy, calling out those who \"failed us\" and proclaiming, \"Soon we will be given the ability to vote and we will vote them out.\"\n\n\"This is to every lawmaker out there,\" she said. \"We are coming after you.\"\n\nIn that moment, Tarr metamorphosed into a gun control advocate unafraid to demand action from Florida's state legislature and Congress.\n\nMany believed the killing of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012 would be a turning point on sensible gun laws, but those hopes were diminished after two major pieces of gun legislation, including one on universal background checks, failed to pass the Senate in 2013.\n\nTarr remains adamant that this time is different, that she and her fellow survivors will undo the normalization of gun violence -- setting themselves apart from other gun safety advocates who have survived tragedy by using the power of social media.\n\n\"I think this time we have a voice that is pretty unprecedented,\" Tarr said. \"We've used Twitter in a way that no other shooting survivor has been able to use ... [we know] how to get people to notice us and listen to us.\"\n\nOne of the last major pieces of gun safety legislation targeting the same firearm used in Parkland, Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, and Newtown was the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban that expired in 2004, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\n\"We're working as hard as we can and we know that the wheels of bureaucracy are slow turning,\" Tarr said. \"This isn't necessarily something that can wait.\"\n\nThis pack of high schoolers is pushing for changes to the Dickey Amendment, implementing \"no fly, no buy,\" bringing paper records into the 21st century, closing privatized gun show loopholes and straw purchases, and prioritizing universal background checks, Tarr said.\n\n\"These are the simple things,\" she said. \"The easy things that can get done now.\"\n\nHeightening the urgency for action, Tarr declares, \"People are dying. People died [Wednesday], people died the 14th and they are going to keep dying unless something actually happens.\"\n\nAnd some progress has come since Parkland. Three weeks after the shooting, Florida enacted sweeping gun safety legislation that raises the minimum age to buy firearms to 21 from 18 and also includes a measure to arm some teachers with state training. This is the first gun reform legislation in decades in the same gun-friendly state that passed the controversial \"stand your ground\" law.\n\nRaising the minimum age requirement is one of the policy proposals that has received a lot of attention in the post-Parkland gun debate, according to Dr. Shannon Frattaroli at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.\n\nOn March 14, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the first piece of gun legislation since Parkland -- the STOP School Violence Act -- to provide grants for school training and make schools safer. The omnibus spending bill that passed both chambers of Congress and now signed by President Trump contains several gun safety measures including offering states funding in exchange for compliance with the federal NICS background check system, implementing the STOP School Violence Act, and stipulating that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can study gun violence, rebuking the 1996 Dickey Amendment.\n\nTarr is aware that under the current Trump administration and makeup of Congress, there are still limits to progress, but she remains hopeful.\n\n\"We're doing a lot and even if it is not necessarily the assault weapons ban yet,\" she said. \"We're getting there. We're moving in that direction and that's undeniably true.\"\n\nThe pinnacle of their momentum will be at Saturday's March For Our Lives -- expected to draw hundreds of thousands to the nation's capital -- but Tarr aims to carry that momentum into the 2018 midterms as she herself is on the cusp of voting for the first time.\n\nShe turns 18 in July and is filled with excitement over the prospect of casting her first ballot. Tarr said that the stakes in 2018 are \"at the point where I am voting for my life.\"\n\nAs the most political member of her family, according to her mother, Tarr's enthusiasm to vote has only amplified and her engagement on the gun issue has become more and more central to her decision-making process as she heads to the ballot box.\n\n\"Before it was voting for the country, and voting for myself and voting for the people around me,\" she explains. \"According to our government, we do have the right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness but that's what I'm voting for. I'm voting for my own life and I'm voting for the lives of so many others.\"\n\n\"We know that with a shift in the people that are elected comes a shift in policy,\" Tarr said.\n\nTo the detractors who might say that a nearly 18-year old might not be old enough to speak on this issue, or even have an opinion, she said: \"We're expected to know what college we want to go to, what we want to major in, what we want to do for a living at this age so why can't we be leaders? Why do we have to wait for permission to take charge?\"\n\n\"I'm not here to be told from a politician that it's okay to give my opinion because I know that it's ok for me to give my opinion and I'm going to keep giving it,\" she added.\n\nHer mother feels the same.\n\n\"They can go out there and buy a gun at 18, but they can't have an opinion,\" Jenn Tarr asked rhetorically.\n\nWhile it is still too early to tell how the Parkland shooting could impact elections come November, Kristin Goss, an associate professor of public policy at Duke University, said that an important question this cycle will be \"whether the people that have pro-control feelings feel more strongly and prioritize it more highly in their political behavior including voting.\"\n\nAs she looks forward to joining the newest class of voters, Tarr wants simply the opportunity to educate voters on gun control so they know exactly what they are voting for, rather than who.\n\n\"Ultimately, I'm not here to tell people which way to vote,\" she said. \"I'm here to educate people so they can vote and know what they're voting for.\"\n\nAnd she wants people to understand the power of one person's voice and vote.\n\n\"I want every single person to know that they can make a difference and that they don't have to wait for permission to make a difference,\" she said. \"They don't have to be grown up, they can do it now.\"",

                "title": "In the Middle East, developments in May could determine its future: ANALYSIS",
                "body": "Around dinner tables and cafes in Beirut these days, discussions are increasingly turning to one topic: the likelihood of another war with Israel.\n\nIt has been an ongoing debate for several years now, gaining renewed vigor each time Israeli and Hezbollah leaders publicly promise to inflict more harm on each other than ever before if, indeed, the countries went to war.\n\nHowever, Iran's blatant and growing military presence on Israel's doorstep, and Tehran's rapidly deteriorating relationship with the United States, is introducing a greater likelihood of conflict.\n\nFresh from a March 5 meeting at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told his cabinet he believes President Trump will pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement before the next sanctions waiver deadline on May 12.\n\nAlthough President Trump has given no public indication what he will decide, his repeated threats, tweets and vocal dissatisfaction with Iran -- and specifically with the Iran nuclear agreement -- are reigniting fears that Washington is paving the way for a new Middle East clash.\n\nAlong with Israel, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is also a very strong opponent of growing Iranian strength and influence in the region. This week, he is being greeted with open arms and with great affection at the White House, with the question of what to do about Iran no doubt being one of the main points of discussion.\n\nThe latest rumor swirling around the Arab world speculates on the possibility of a preemptive aerial strike -- by the U.S. or Israel, or a combined show of force - against Iranian forces and militias building up inside Syria.\n\nIn addition to his speculation about Mr. Trump's intentions toward the Iran nuclear agreement, Netanyahu also returned from Washington declaring that he had secured historic contributions toward Israel's \"national security.\" The educated guess is that he received some kind of promise from Trump on not only withdrawing from the agreement, but perhaps even a tacit approval on military action.\n\nIsrael most certainly faces a dilemma over Iran's increasing reach. Eventually, Netanyahu -- or his successor -- will have to decide to either carry out a military strike to push Iran back from southern Syria or to simply accept the new reality of a permanent Iranian threat just across the border.\n\nIn any event, there is greater satisfaction in Jerusalem lately over America's shift against Iran, thanks to the Trump administration. Instead of Obama-led policy leaning toward more diplomatic engagement with Iran and nudging the country into the international sphere on social responsibility, America has reverted to classifying Iran as a clear threat to its principles and interests.\n\nSo far, the threatening arsenal of rockets owned by Hezbollah, Iran's staunch ally in the region, and the overwhelming retaliatory response promised by Israel, has served as a worthy deterrent to conflict in Lebanon.\n\nBut how long can this last?\n\nTaking into account Iran's close relationship with Hezbollah, any attack on Iranian targets inside Syria, or any attack on Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon, would likely, and very quickly, escalate into a greater region-wide war involving many more nations.\n\nBoth Russia and the United States have large numbers of troops in the region.\n\nWith considerable Russian tactical and strategic assistance, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been able to bounce back off the ropes and defeat many of his anti-regime rebel foes. His continued survival is thanks to partnerships with Russia and Iran -- two countries that see benefit from maintaining a long-term military presence inside Syria.\n\nAmid the rush to defeat the rising ISIS threat, Washington injected a considerable number of American troops into Syria to work alongside partner militia fighters in northern and eastern sections of the country. As of December, the Pentagon officially acknowledged there were about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.\n\nYet even though ISIS has been largely defeated, those troops still remain, presumably to disrupt further Iranian gains and to prevent an unbroken supply highway stretching from Tehran all the way to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guard is building military bases across Syria and commanders have taken leading roles in battles against Syria's enemies. In addition to its relationship with Hezbollah, Iran continues to back powerful militias inside Syria. Iranian drones now regularly cruise the skies above the Israeli-Syrian border to spy on enemies and to possibly even launch air attacks.\n\nThere is no doubt another Israeli-Lebanese war would be far more damaging, and far more costly to life and property, than the last one in 2006. Israeli military leaders have repeatedly accused Hezbollah of hiding weapons inside civilian buildings, leading many to believe Israel is preparing a case for far more liberal targeting strategies this time around; i.e., many more civilians will likely be killed and the Lebanese civilian infrastructure destroyed.\n\nFor Israel, the greatest risk would be from waves of missiles raining down, indiscriminately, on cities and towns across Israel. Add to this mix a potent Iranian presence across the northeastern border in Syria -- - with a possible invasion attempt across the Golan Heights -- - and it shapes up to be an extremely tough challenge for Israel.\n\nNotwithstanding all of these threats, Netanyahu may consider the timing for a preemptive Israeli strike to be better now, politically, than it has been in many years -- and most likely better than it would be again if Trump were to somehow lose a reelection bid to someone less staunchly conservative.\n\nOne thing potentially holding Netanyahu back are criminal investigations that will probably end his own stint in power before he could jump into a war. Either way, Netanyahu is aware that his era will soon be coming to an end. The question will be, does he choose to end his public career quietly, or amid a maelstrom of warfare?\n\nAlso happening in May that could stoke the flames: the U.S. is planning to officially move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem sometime in the middle of the month; elections are planned for May 12 in Iraq, where pro-Iranian parties are expected to make even more gains; and elections are also planned for May 6 in Lebanon, where MBS's heavy-handed attempts at changing the government there show just how sensitive he is to Hezbollah gaining even more power.\n\nIsrael is keeping a close eye on all of these events, analyzing what's happening and attempting to predict the direction President Trump will go from here.",

Heavy snow is currently falling throughout parts of southern Minnesota, northern Iowa and western Illinois. On the warmer side of the storm, locally heavy rain has developed across Nebraska, Missouri and southern Illinois.\n\nAs much as 8 inches of new snow has been reported in Minot, North Dakota, and 4 inches of snow has already been reported in Charles City, Iowa.\n\nWinter weather advisories and winter storm warnings currently stretch from the Dakotas into the mountains of Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nThe storm will quickly slide to the south and east today with locally moderate snow moving toward central Illinois, Indiana, southern Ohio, and into the central Appalachians. Peoria, Illinois; Indianapolis, and Cincinnati will all see snow and low visibility is expected in this region with travel delays possible.\n\nThe highest snowfall accumulations will be in central and northern Iowa, as well as western Illinois, where over 6 inches of snow is likely. In the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians snow will fall mainly during the day. The relatively high sun angle in late March will limit snowfall accumulations from Illinois to Virginia. Locally 3 to 5 inches of snow is expected from Indianapolis to Roanoke, Virginia, with most accumulation expected on grassy and elevated surfaces.\n\nThe storm clears the East Coast by late Saturday.\n\nHigh pressure will develop early next week across the East Coast, which will finally stop the parade of nor'easters and winter-like weather that has been affecting the Northeast over the last couple of weeks. By midweek, many cities in the Northeast will see their warmest temperatures since early March.\n\nNew York and Boston could make a run at its warmest weather since March 1, when it was 60 degrees. New York is currently running 2.8 degrees below its monthly average temperature in March. Boston is currently running around 1.3 degrees below its monthly March average temperature. The last time Philadelphia was above 55 degrees was on March 1, with a high of 58 degrees. March's average temperature is nearly 4 degrees below average.\n\nUnfortunately as we head toward April, there remains uncertainty whether the seasonable temperatures will stick around in this region.\n\nA new storm system will develop late Sunday in the high plains and move to the east on Monday. High pressure along the East Coast will slow the weather pattern down.\n\nAs a result, slow moving storms will develop along a cold front moving across the Southern Plains and Mississippi River Valley during the week.\n\nThe thunderstorms could turn severe on Monday across Oklahoma and Texas with damaging winds, large hail and possible tornadoes from Tulsa to San Angelo. A slight risk has been issued for that region already.\n\nThe slow-moving storms will slide off to the Mississippi River Valley and Gulf states by Tuesday and Thursday. The potential for widespread heavy rain and possible flash flooding by midweek is increasing, with many locations across the region forecast to receive at least 3 to 4 inches of rainfall.",

The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injures.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio Friday night before the announcement of his death that \"I'm not surprised. I knew it had to be him. He has always been like that. It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland.\"\n\nAsked if she was proud of him, she said he would have told her \"'I'm doing my job mom, that's all.'\"\n\nShe said to \"defend the homeland\" was his \"reason for living.\" RTL didn't give her name.\n\n6:35 a.m.\n\nFrance's top security official says a heroic officer who swapped himself for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket has died of his injuries.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Col. Arnaud Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nBeltrame offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raises the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition. The attack was the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.",

                "body": "In a wild NCAA Tournament full of upsets, it's somehow appropriate that the first ticket to the Final Four will go to a No. 9 or No. 11 seed.\n\nAnd the second could go to another 9-seed.\n\nWelcome to the madder half of the March Madness bracket. The Elite Eight games Saturday in the South and West lack the Selection Sunday favorites and instead feature a surging 3-seed (Big Ten champion Michigan), two teams who were power-conference also-rans (No. 9 seeds Florida State and Kansas State) and the upstart (11-seed Loyola-Chicago).\n\nThe Wildcats and the Ramblers meet in the first regional final to wrap up the South bracket in Atlanta, then the Wolverines and Seminoles meet in Los Angeles.\n\nFurther down the line, one of those teams will end up playing for the national championship in San Antonio.\n\nIt's quite a feat considering three of those teams faced at least some bubble uncertainty in the final month of the regular season. And that was particularly true of the Ramblers (31-5) , who went 15-3 in their Missouri Valley Conference but could have easily been left out of the field of 68 had they not won the league tournament.\n\nYet, the Ramblers beat 6-seed Miami 64-62 in the first round on 3-pointer by Donte Ingram with 0.3 seconds left. Then came a 63-62 second-round win against third-seeded Tennessee on another late shot, this one a jumper from Clayton Custer with 3.6 seconds left. And finally, they held off No. 7 seed Nevada 69-68 in the Sweet 16, putting them a win away from the national semifinals for the first time since winning the 1963 national title .\n\nWhew.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of parity in the game, and I love it for our league,\" Ramblers coach Porter Moser said. \"There was a lot of talk that we weren't going to get in if we didn't win the tournament, and we know in the Missouri Valley how good a league it is from top to bottom. And for us to get in here, I think it's going to spark conversation about this, and I know the committees have such a hard job.\"\n\nNow they're meeting the Wildcats in the first 9-vs-11 game in NCAA Tournament history.\n\nKansas State (25-11) caught a break when UMBC pulled the first 16-vs-1 upset of top overall seed Virginia, allowing the Wildcats to avoid the Cavaliers in the second round. Kansas State beat UMBC then took out Kentucky's latest crop of touted freshmen to reach its first regional final since 2010 and second since 1988.\n\n\"We know that every team right now is trying to make history,\" Kansas State guard Barry Brown Jr. said.\n\nHere are things to know about the NCAA Tournament's second week:\n\nROLLING AGAIN: For the second straight season, the Wolverines (31-7) got hot late in the year to win the Big Ten Tournament title and reach the NCAA regional rounds. Now they're the closest thing to a favorite in their half of the draw.\n\nLast year's team lost by one to Oregon in the Sweet 16, but Michigan blew out Texas A&M on Thursday to reach its third regional final in six seasons.\n\n\"I'd prefer more games like that,\" coach John Beilein said afterward. \"I don't think we'll see any more, but I'd prefer it.\"\n\nFor the record, Michigan has won 12 straight and hasn't lost since falling at Northwestern on Feb. 6 .\n\nLONG WAIT: The last time Florida State was in a regional final, two-sport point guard Charlie Ward was months away from claiming the Heisman Trophy as the Seminoles' quarterback, the Fab Five ruled at Michigan -- and the Seminoles were blown out by a Rick Pitino-coached Kentucky team featuring Jamal Mashburn.\n\nThat was 1993.\n\nThe balanced Seminoles (23-11) got here by upending 1-seed Xavier then beating a 32-win Gonzaga team in the Sweet 16.\n\n\"We just don't care who plays or who scores the basket, as long as everybody's happy,\" FSU's Braian Angola said. \"We buy into the system, and that's what we're doing right now.\"\n\nSEMBLANCE OF ORDER: The other half of the bracket looks much closer to form.\n\nIn the East, Jalen Brunson was fantastic in leading top-seeded Villanova past Press, umm, West Virginia in Friday's Sweet 16. That pushed the Wildcats -- the highest overall seed left -- into Sunday's regional final in Boston to face third-seeded Texas Tech, which beat 2-seed Purdue.\n\nAnd in the Midwest, bluebloods Kansas and Duke advanced to a chalk regional final in Omaha, Nebraska. Neither had an easy time of it, with the top-seeded Jayhawks holding off fifth-seeded Clemson while the second-seeded Blue Devils beat No. 11 seed Syracuse in an Atlantic Coast Conference-heavy doubleheader.\n\nCONFERENCE BREAKDOWN: The Big 12 and ACC are leading the way entering the Elite Eight.\n\nThe Big 12 earned seven bids and has three teams (Kansas, Texas Tech and Kansas State) still alive to go with an 11-4 tournament record (.733). The ACC tied its own record with nine bids and has two left (Duke and FSU) to go with a 12-7 record (.632).\n\nThe Big East (Villanova), Big Ten (Michigan) and Missouri Valley Conference (Loyola-Chicago) have the other spots.\n\nFAIL: ESPN says there were 17.3 million entrees into its bracket contest. And zero -- as in nary a one -- got the Elite Eight teams correct. So maybe you don't have to feel so badly about your up-in-smoke picks?\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP -- Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events",

                "body": "Transcript for California city to settle with couple in so-called 'Gone Girl' case: Part 5 The Vallejo police dept owes an apology to Ms Huskins and Mr Quinn. When we were doing the press conference I was furious. They had the opportunity to save me and they didn't do it. They had the opportunity to clear our names and they didn't do it. They had the opportunity to protect the public. They didn't do it. I was sad, angry, hurt. Reporter: But if Denise Huskins and her boyfriend, Aaron Quinn, were hoping for a public apology from the Vallejo police that was a pipe dream. Police remained defiant clinging to their original theory of a hoax. So does the department still stand by the statements that it made so publicly four months ago that this was a hoax that wasted valuable city resources? Yes. But, we're also continuing to investigate it. Did you drop the ball? I don't believe so, no. Reporter: But wait till you hear this. Aaron told us in those early hours when Denise was first abducted, the kidnapper told him he would call and e-mail him with instructions about the ransom. In they said I would have to go to the bank to get the money. I would have to keep my cell phone on the entire time. Reporter: But what did the police do? They took away Aaron's phone. And inexplicably he says, put it in airplane mode. There's no officer in this country that if you asked 'em if there was kidnapping that you would turn off forms of communication. No one would -- I think a 5-year-old would know better than that. No one would do that. Reporter: And in fact, muller did call Aaron twice. Calls that could have been traced back to muller's location in south lake tahoe. Where Denise was being held captive. Those phone calls weren't tracked 'till 24 hours later just simple investigative techniques would've saved Denise. Denise wouldn't have been raped the second T-- second time. And it was as simple as reaching out to other police agencies and -- and just seeing, like, has -- has something weird like this happened in your town? Reporter: Huskins says if Vallejo police had done their due diligence by reaching out to other precincts like the Dublin police later did, they would have learned about two eerily similar cases, both in 2009 in Palo alto and nearby mountain view. In each, a man wearing all black breaks into a home, and forces the female victim to put on swim goggles and drink a NyQuil like sedative. The victims were both restrained and blindfolded. Both were threatened with robbery and sexual assault. Reporter: And muller himself, although never charged, was even questioned in 2009 about one of those home invasions. I know people called your story stranger than fiction. But isn't it true that truth is often stranger than fiction? This is only strange because the law enforcement made it strange. If they came out and said, \"This is a kidnapping,\" followed the evidence, got Denise back no one would be talking about-- gone girl or anything like that. Ridiculous to stage your crime scene. The gone girl kidnapping, the kidnapping hoax. Had you ever seen that movie? I watched it maybe nine months after -- That could not have been -- How -- Easy to watch. No. The police didn't believe me because I wasn't bruised and beat up. You didn't fight back. No. To stay alive. Right. Whereas you see that movie, and she hits herself in the face with a hammer. If I was beaten or violently raped, they would have -- seen that movie and go, \"Oh no, she just did this to herself. She hit herself in the face just like the movie.\" They never let up on I didn't act like a good enough victim. The Vallejo police department did eventually apologize. Yeah, they wrote a letter of apology. Reporter: That letter was sent privately to Denise and Aaron after their press conference stating in part, \"We apologize for and regret comments made by representatives of the Vallejo police department. While these comments were based on our findings at the time, they proved to be unnecessarily harsh and offensive.\" They acknowledge that they were wrong. But they wouldn't have done anything different. It's kind of like sorry I'm not sorry. It was -- they gave it to us and said that they were gonna keep it private until the investigation was completed they've haven't ma a public apology. There's no accountability. The primary investigator got awarded officer of the year the same year that he falsely accused us. Reporter: That officer of the year detective Mathew mustard along with the public face of the investigation, lieutenant Kenny park would soon have another distinction. Both, along with the city of Vallejo, were named in a civil lawsuit filed by Denise and Aaron, alleging defamation and emotional distress. They had every opportunity to go, \"You know what, we made a mistake. Reporter: Last week, the city of Vallejo reached a tentative settlement with Denise and Aaron for $2.5 million. A payday but the city still steadfastly refuses to publically admit they were wrong. Yesterday we tried to speak to lieutenant park who held all those press conferences. Lieutenant park, can you speak for a moment? Reporter: But he seemed to be in a bit of a hurry. We tried to get any comment from the Vallejo police. You won't answer why the depth S not yet made an apology to Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn? I am not authorized to speak about that. And who is authorized to speak about that? Reporter: At Vallejo city hall -- so we tried her too. Hi Joanna this is Amy robach with ABC news. What we know is why the city of Vallejo has not publicly apologized to Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn. Let me see if I can get somebody to give you a call back. Reporter: She called back, but guess what we got. No comment at this time. Meanwhile, Denise and Aaron say they will continue to fight for change in the hope that future crime victims will never face the kind of trauma they did. We're not against law enforcement. We want to be part of the solution. We're speaking 'cause this shouldn't happen. And we hope people learn.",

                "body": "Reporter: Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn had a long awaited chance to condemn their captor in court last year when Matthew muller the Harvard lawyer turned tormentor was sentenced to 40 years in prison after pleading guilty to her kidnapping. In her victim impact statement, Denise said, \"I still have nightmares every night. Sleep is not rest for me, it is a trigger. The depth of the terror is so deep, I have had to learn how to live side by side with it.\" Reporter: Denise, a year ago you stood up in court and you faced Matthew muller. And you said, \"I am the woman behind the blindfold.\" Uh-huh. You got your voice back that day. Yeah. And I looked him in the eyes, you know, he saw me, every part of me, but he never looked into hi eyes and so I wanted to make sure that he saw me, and he did. Reporter: Muller is now facing additional charges including for Denise's rape. But Denise and Aaron fear justice is still not done. Despite the authorities' assertion that muller simply pretended to have accomplices still, Denise and Aaron are convinced he did not act alone. Why do you think it was more than just Matthew muller? 'Cause we know. When he was still present above us, next to us -- we could hear stuff going on downstairs. So cabinets opening or stuff being moved around. Camera being installed. Yeah, you -- I could hear people walk away. You know? It wasn't loud. But it was enough -- you know when there's vibrations of movement. It's convenient for H-- him to say he did it by himself or police to say he did it by himself. Right. 'Cause then the investigation's over. Right. Reporter: Those 48 hours of terror have transformed the once carefree couple. They say their careers derailed, their reputations ruined they were forced to leave Vallejo and rebuild their lives. The challenge is we have moments of joy. But there's always that trauma that lingers. And sometimes you feel guilty for almost feeling happy. And so there's not a moment that we don't experience what happened. It's with you. It's with you. Yeah. Always. I mean, every moment. What have you learned about yourself, Denise? Well -- that I have a lot of strength. Really you go through something like this and you're like, \"We can do anything, you know?\" Reporter: Part of what they want to do is help other victims of sexual violence find their own voice. Those two words of me too are so powerful. It's the biggest reason why we want to speak up. As terrifying as it is, is to let those people know we understand and they are not alone, and to help give them the spot that they deserve. Reporter: And finally, in their own story, there is a happy milestone. I wanna say congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. You're engaged. Yes. Yeah, we're excited to put thought into something that's gonna be a good day. Reporter: The wedding isn't exactly what they would have once envisioned. Denise's criminal attorney will officiate, and there will be some special guests. We're inviting all of our attorneys, which will be, like, 20 people with their significant others. Never thought we'd have a team of lawyers at our wedding. That was -- Right. Yeah. That never crossed my mind. But they have done so much for us in our life. We would be so lost without them, and so just really grateful for them. To know that I get to spend the rest of my life with her many people marry their best friend, but they don't get to",

                "body": "Reporter: Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn may be alive and back in each other's arms, but they feel anything but safe and secure. Their urgent warnings of a violent offender still at large have gone unheeded. We know that the public is in danger and we're trying to do everything to convince the police they're trained professional criminals. Like, we knew that it was going to happen again. Reporter: And sure enough, that botched home invasion in Dublin, California, is eerily similar to Denise's. Zip ties, duct tape, but this time, when that sleeping couple fights back the would-be kidnapper makes a colossal mistake. In his haste to flee, he leaves behind a crucial piece of evidence. A cell phone. Suspect left his cell phone upstairs. We have his cell phone. You might as well have a business card and put it in the mailbox and say ok, here's your clue, police. Reporter: The small-town police department in Dublin is about to do what the Vallejo police department could not. Crack both cases. That cell phone forgotten at the Dublin crime scene leads police 100 miles north, to an address in orangevale. Our lead detective started doing more research on it. Running all the different names associated with the orangevale address. Reporter: The homeowner tells police the phone belongs to her adult son. He had misplaced it the day before. Police get his name. Our detectives had a name and that name was Matt muller. Reporter: Matthew muller on the surface, he's an unlikely suspect. Mr. Muller had some great success in life. Reporter: He attended this Sacramento area high school. Played trumpet in jazz band and joined the computer club. A teacher says a, \"High achiever.\" He came from a good home. He had two parents that were educators. They're good people. Reporter: Muller joined the Marines, stationed in okinawa Japan, eventually returning to California, enrolling at Pomona college. Muller gets married, goes to Harvard law, then joins this San Francisco firm practicing immigration law fighting for clients in court and on TV. No, we will not even let you have your day in court. This is a guy by all accounts should've been doing really well in life. A well educated individual. But he had troubles. Reporter: The shooting star was about to flame out. His lawyer says inside that handsome head, a time bomb was ticking. Muller was getting disbarred. His marriage of about ten years ending in divorce. He says he was diagnosed with bipolar. We know that involves extreme highs and lows. Bi-polar people can swing like a pendulum. From severe depression and inability to function to severe manic behavior sometimes psychosis. Reporter: Muller's mother tells detectives her son is now living 85 miles away in south lake tahoe, in this house in the woods. Then, right nearby, jackpot, a Olen car. They found a Ford mustang that had been mentioned in the e-mails previously sent. So they thought, wow. We have actually found the car that the bad guy mentions in a previous communication. We go up to the residence and once the detectives made entry, they found Matt muller coming out of the bathroom. Reporter: Muller is quickly arrested. He was calm. He didn't give up any resistance. I believe that muller expected something eventually to catch up with him. Reporter: Investigators say the house and car yield a treasure trove of evidence. A gps still programmed to the Huntington Beach address where Denise was dropped, swim goggles, just as Aaron and Denise described, a tell-tale strand of blond hair snared in the duct tape. And that toy gun, the one the kidnapper was so proud of, he sent a picture to the newspaper. This is a really big find. It showed a direct link back to the abduction of this couple. And so this entire thing ties the case together. This is absolutely not a hoax. New developments tonight. A bizarre kidnapping store. Reality, stranger than fiction. Reporter: This is what an acquittal in the court of public opinion looks like. They are absolutely 100% positively, uni kwifbly, not just not guilty, but innocent. Reporter: Denise, still shaken, stands in the background, the lawyers do the talking. In the blink of an eye everything has changed. Denise and Aaron go from crackpots to credible hoaxers to heroes. Was there a moment of vindication when he was arrested and they realized, wait a minute, maybe these two were telling the truth all along? There's a lot more for me. A lot more hurt and pain because another family got traumatized. How can you feel, like, good and relieved about that? Like, of course, it happened. Like, we, you know, we knew the truth. Reporter: Authorities charge muller with Denise's kidnapping, but she and Aaron believe it's not just muller who must be held accountable, but the Vallejo police as well. If it wasn't for Denise, if she didn't get the kidnappers to let her -- to let her go, I would be behind bars. Both of our lives would've been over. Mine physically but -- And all we did was go to bed.",

                "body": "What's the White House's word worth?\n\nDays of conflicting and misleading statements from President Donald Trump and his top aides have fueled new questions about the White House's credibility, sowing mistrust and instability within the West Wing and leaving some congressional Republicans wondering if they have a good faith negotiating partner in the president.\n\nOne former congressional GOP leadership aide said it was becoming impossible for Republicans to negotiate anything with White House officials, given the president's willingness to undermine his own team's public and private assurances. In turn, White House officials have found themselves in the bizarre position of urging lawmakers to ignore some of the president's own statements.\n\nThat was the case on Friday, when Trump blasted out a morning tweet threatening to veto a massive government spending bill that the White House had guaranteed lawmakers and the public that he would sign. White House officials privately insisted the president was simply venting after watching news coverage that cast the deal as a defeat for several of his priorities. After hours of uncertainty, Trump's veto threat crumbled, and he ultimately signed the legislation.\n\nStill, it left some Republicans rattled.\n\n\"The spontaneity and lack of impulse control are areas of concern for lots of members on both sides of the aisle,\" said Rep. Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican who has been critical of the president. \"Disorder, chaos, instability, uncertainty, intemperate statements are not conservative virtues in my opinion.\"\n\nTrent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader from Mississippi, said GOP lawmakers \"feel a good deal of consternation\" about the White House-induced whiplash. But he added: \"I assume there was method in what the president did.\"\n\nMembers of both parties said they were troubled that Trump seems oblivious to how he has undermined his own clout and agenda by staking out positions and then brazenly abandoning them. Where legislators once might have attributed such missteps to the president's newness to Washington and its ways, not anymore.\n\nTrump's vacillating on the spending bill was just one in a series of recent instances that put the credibility of the White House's words under a microscope. Earlier this month, Trump bragged at a private fundraiser about having made up facts on trade during a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. And in recent days, he and his staff have issued stern denials about the prospects of national security adviser H.R. McMaster departing the White House and a potential shake-up on the legal team that handles Trump's role in the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference and obstruction of justice. Beyond public statements, White House chief of staff John Kelly had privately assured his staff that no shakeup was on the horizon.\n\nBy week's end, McMaster was out. And the legal team had lost one attorney and appeared to be looking for another one.\n\nTrump's trouble with the truth is hardly new. He frequently mangles the facts on everything from the size of his inauguration crowd to the scope of the tax bill he signed late last year. And as his boasting about his interaction with Trudeau underscored, the president rarely appears to be embarrassed or ashamed about repeating statements that have been proven false.\n\n\"There's a fundamental difference between this White House and those of the modern era that preceded it,\" said Timothy Naftali, a historian and the former director of Richard Nixon's presidential library. \"It doesn't care about its credibility outside of a narrow swath of the American people.\"\n\nNumerous polls show a majority of Americans don't believe Trump is truthful, including a recent Quinnipiac survey in which 57 percent said the president was not honest. Trump's backers sometimes point to the fact that he was elected even though polls during the campaign showed similar results.\n\nTrump's willingness to skirt the truth has frequently put his advisers in the awkward position of issuing strong statements in public that are quickly undermined by the president. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeatedly batted down reports about McMaster's ouster in the days leading up to Trump's announcement that he was bringing in a new national security adviser.\n\nAnd on the eve of Trump's spending bill veto threat, budget director Mick Mulvaney left no ambiguity about the president's plans to validate the measure.\n\n\"Let's cut right to the chase. Is the president going to sign the bill? Yes. Why? Because it funds his priorities,\" Mulvaney said.\n\nWhite House officials privately contend that they are often left in an impossible situation given Trump's willingness to change his mind. Even if their statements are true at the time, they say, there's no guarantee the president's position will hold.\n\nPeter Wehner, who served in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, said Trump ultimately has no one to blame but himself.\n\n\"He doesn't even know what his own stance is,\" said Wehner, a frequent Trump critic. \"It just devalues his word and his threats and promises and his presidency.\"\n\nFollow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Alan Fram at http://twitter.com/asfram",

                "title": "Pac-12 has solid day with Oregon State and UCLA advancing",
                "body": "It was a stellar day for the Pac-12 with Oregon State and UCLA both pulling off upsets to advance to the Elite Eight.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Beavers beat second-seeded Baylor, while the third-seeded Bruins knocked off No. 2 seed Texas.\n\nIt's UCLA's first trip to a regional final since 1999. It will face top-seeded Mississippi State on Sunday night for its first Final Four trip.\n\n\"I'm so happy for the seniors who were courageous enough to dream big and play big and have an opportunity to play for a spot in the Final Four,\" UCLA coach Cori Close said.\n\nThe Beavers will face top-seeded Louisville on Sunday for a trip to their second Final Four in three seasons. That year, Oregon State beat Baylor in the regional final to advance to the school's first Final Four.\n\nThe Cardinals spoiled a perfect night for the Pac-12, routing Stanford in the other semifinal in the Lexington Regional.\n\nThe other half of the Elite Eight will be set Sunday with the Albany and Spokane Regions set to play. The Mid-American Conference hopes for similar success to the Pac-12 by getting its two teams to advance. That would be a much taller order for the two 11 seeds: Central Michigan and Buffalo.\n\nBoth teams seem to be loose and ready to keep playing. Buffalo coach Felisha Legette-Jack buried a half-court shot during practice Friday.\n\nLegette-Jack will need shooting like that from her team to knock off defending champion South Carolina. The Chippewas face No. 2 seed Oregon.\n\nOregon coach Kelly Graves knows all about taking an 11-seed on a deep run in the NCAA Tournament. He was the coach at Gonzaga when the Bulldogs made back-to-back Sweet 16 runs in 2011 and 2012. Graves has been the head coach of the last two double-digit seeds to reach a regional final -- Gonzaga in 2011 as a No. 11 seed and Oregon last year as a No. 10 seed.\n\nGraves was asked if he had any advice for the No. 11 seed based off his past success as a lower seed.\n\n\"Just play, be who you are. I don't think at this point it helps anybody to change or to add new things or anything like that,\" he said. \"I think at this point pretty much every team has seen everything. They're not running anything tomorrow that we haven't seen before. I think just kind of be yourself, have fun with it.\"\n\nHere are a few other tidbits from the women's regionals:\n\nPERFECTION: Mississippi State star center Teaira McCowan was 11 for 11 from the field and made both of her free throws in the win over N.C. State.\n\n\"This time of year, you lose, you go home,\" McCowan said. \"You basically start over. So my team, my seniors -- the four I got -- I'm just trying to make it the best it can be, go as far as possible.\"\n\nTIMING: Louisville coach Jeff Walz complained about his team playing the late game Friday, more because of the burden on Cardinals fans having to make the drive with snow in the overnight forecast.\n\nTurns out he had nothing to worry about from their fan base, which showed up for the Oregon State-Baylor semifinal and comprised much of the 5,715 that hung around for the nightcap.\n\nWalz was feeling better after Louisville's rout, but still clock-watching.\n\n\"Are you past your deadlines?\" he asked reporters. \"We're past deadlines, so what you'll see is you can ask me as many questions tomorrow as you all would love to because I'd like to get these kids back to get into bed and we have a noon game on Sunday.\n\n\"My cell phone, I'll be happy to give it to you when we're done, you can call me, I'll give you as much as you want. But I'm finished with my statement because it's 12:10 right now and we play a noon game on Sunday. So I want to get these kids back to sleep. It's the student-athlete welfare that I think is important.\"\n\nAP Sports Writers Tim Booth and Gary B. Graves contributed to this story.",

                "body": "Transcript for Couple in so-called 'Gone Girl' case denounced by police: Part 3 ??? ??? We begin with breaking news. A woman who was reportedly kidnapped, has now apparently turned up. She's indeed here in Huntington Beach. Found safe in Huntington Beach. Reporter: When Denise Huskins turns up alive, her family rejoices. You'd think the Vallejo police would too, but -- Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins has plundered valuable resources away from our community. Reporter: Lieutenant Kenny park of the Vallejo police department publicly denounces the victims. We have had over 40 police detectives from the local, state and federal levels working 'round the clock, that is a tremendous amount of resources that, in my opinion, was wasted. So if anything, it is Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins that owes this community an apology. That was pretty amazing in a bad way. I was so shocked. If we feel that there is sufficient evidence to move forward, we will be requesting criminal charges. Can you imagine being rescued from a kidnapping and then the people are on you for committing a crime? Police say the kidnapping was a hoax. An orchestrated hoax according to officials. Denise Huskins, reported orchestrator of this possible kidnapping hoax. They had successful lives. They're helping health professionals. They had no motive. The Vallejo police told Aaron during this whole time that they thought it was a hoax so he could be on reality TV. That was their contention. Why would we ruin our lives to do something so absurd? We would never do that to our family and friends. There's truth, there's lies and there's nonsense. And what the police did falls in the category of nonsense. Reporter: Defense attorneys Douglas Rappaport and Daniel Russo are determined to vindicate their clients. I was not gonna stop. Dan and -- Dan nor I were gonna stop until her name was cleared. Reporter: And then, from the shadows of the internet, an unlikely supporter comes to Denise and Aaron's defense. Blowing up the in-boxes at the San Francisco chronicle. I read these e-mails like a page-turning novel. Reporter: The author of the anonymous e-mails claims to be none other than one of the kidnappers and in a dumbfounding, double Axel, display of unmitigated gall, sympathizing with the very people he victimized. Ms. Huskins was absolutely kidnapped. We did it. We will provide incontrovertible proof of that. We only started to question the police's account of what happened. Reporter: The author, at turns remorseful, and boastful, describes a gang of \"Professional thieves,\" \"Young adults, fairly recent college graduates\" who \"Fancied ourselves as a sort of ocean's eleven, gentlemen criminals.\" Reporter: Those e-mails describe random break-ins and car theft. Even specifically mentioning this white mustang. Saying they graduated to kidnapping. But the kidnappers unexpectedly developed a soft spot for their victim. Saying -- We were very impressed with the strength she showed and who she was as we passed time talking to her. Most crimes don't have their suspect writing to the media. Reporter: He also provides two photos. They show the room where he says Denise was held, and the pistol he says was used in the home invasion. It turns out to be a squirt gun, painted black, with a flashlight and laser attached. The cops are still not convinced. They accused you all of actually -- Yes. Yeah. Manufacturing the e-mails. Reporter: Then the mystery e-mailer goes suddenly silent. And for all intents and purposes the case is stalled. To realize your life is completely worthless to the people who are sworn to protect it, I think that was more devastating than anything that I experienced in that 48 hours with people who were plotting and planning to torture me. For four months they weren't believed. Imagine being doubted in the media for four months. What was that like? I mean, could you leave your house? Could you have a Normal life? Could you goo work? Well, no. Our work wouldn't talk to us because of what the police told them. Reporter: They say the police poisoned the public against them. I don't know how to describe what it's like to sit back silently and watch the world have a conversation and an opinion and judgment on the most horrific thing that you've lived through. Reporter: For nearly a year, they say, the police piled on refusing to return their cars, or even their driver's licenses. They wouldn't return my I.D. Right. I mean, they treated us like fugitives. Reporter: It appeared the story would end there the young couple stuck in the purgatory of their public humiliation. He has basically died and gone to hell. He is in terrible shape, he is exhausted mentally and physically. Reporter: That is, until the kidnapper allegedly strikes again. Just 40 miles south of Vallejo in the town of Dublin, another awful home invasion, with an m-o that's awfully familiar. We get a call of a 911 female caller, victim states that somebody came into their residence. Wearing all black clothing unknown weapon. Reporter: See if these details ring a bell, a couple confronted by an intruder, shining a bright light in their faces and attempting to restrain them with zip-ties. Standby is the subject that is still fighting still in the house? Reporter: But this time, the family fights back. The father suffering this nasty head injury. The intruder runs off empty-handed. They went out the residence. Down the stairs, out the residence. Reporter: He gets away, but the self-proclaimed criminal mastermind has made a fatal",

                "body": "We interrupt this March for underdogs with a reality check from some of college basketball's blue bloods.\n\nKansas, Villanova and Duke are still alive in the NCAA Tournament, ready to tilt the bracket back toward the favorites.\n\nCall Friday the exception to what has been an extraordinarily-maddening, upset-laden March. One that showcased three powerhouse teams, each good enough to be deemed the favorite if they reach the national title game.\n\nIn the East, top-seeded Villanova held up to fifth-seeded West Virginia's pressure. In the Midwest, top-seeded Kansas staved off fifth-seeded Clemson's late comeback attempt.\n\nNo. 2 seed Duke solved 11th-seeded Syracuse's zone to advance, too, and set up a star-powered regional final on Sunday against the Jayhawks.\n\nOrder restored in the tourney -- at least for one night.\n\n\"But they say this time of year is survive and advance, and we were able to do that,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said after his team held on for a four-point win in the Midwest Region.\n\nVillanova will face Texas Tech in the East final after the third-seeded Red Raiders beat a second-seeded Purdue team without injured starting center Isaac Haas.\n\nThe East and Midwest are on the right half of the NCAA tourney bracket, the half that hasn't had as many upsets. That foursome of teams alone would have made for an intriguing Final Four. Even Syracuse doesn't really count as a Cinderella team given its title-winning history.\n\nUnderdogs rule the left side.\n\nNo. 3 Michigan is the highest seed remaining in that half of the bracket and will face No. 9 seed Florida State in the West Region final on Saturday. In the South final, ninth-seeded Kansas State will face 11th-seeded Loyola-Chicago and its 98-year-old scouting chaplain and social media star, Sister Jean. It's the type of foursome that might meet in some early-season nonconference tournament held in Hawaii.\n\nNo favorite feels safe anymore in the NCAAs after 16th-seeded UMBC's history-making win over No. 1 overall seed Virginia last week in the first round.\n\n\"I'm not surprised there's low seeds in here. I mean, things happen,\" Ramblers coach Porter Moser said about the Elite Eight. \"They're finding ways to win, and things happen this time of year, especially when you get a group that just believes and has made some really clutch shots down the stretch.\"\n\nKansas guard Devonte' Graham said all the upsets have helped his team to avoid overlooking opponents.\n\n\"But also we just know we've got to be focused,\" Graham added. \"If we slip up and don't come prepared, it's going to be the end of the season.\"\n\nUnder pressure, Kansas passed its test, just like Villanova.\n\nThe Wildcats followed a familiar formula, shooting over Press Virginia from the 3-point arc to overcome 16 turnovers.\n\nVillanova didn't wilt in the face of the pressure. Coach Jay Wright decided to attack it head-on.\n\n\"So when I started watching film, I just thought, man, this is a tough matchup,\" Wright said, \"and if we survive this, we're a pretty mentally tough team, and this is going to be like an old-school, grind-out game.\"\n\nDuke also did what is expected of a tourney favorite, outlasting Syracuse thanks in part to its decided talent advantage. No easy feat, by the way, after the Orange's 2-3 zone took down Michigan State in Detroit in the second round.\n\nPerhaps feeling the heat, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski tore off his jacket and threw it to the floor in frustration after calling a timeout early in the second half to slow a Syracuse run. In time, the best player on the court, Duke's Marvin Bagley III, took over on the floor. He had 13 of his 22 points and eight of his nine rebounds in the second half.\n\n\"That was a tough game to be a part of. It came down the wire,\" Bagley said.\n\nBut for at least one more game, the higher seed prevailed, sanity ruling on a relatively ho-hum Friday.\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP -- Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events",

                "body": "Ramona Isbell is worried. What will people say when they find out? After all, she mostly kept her secret for more than 50 years.\n\nThe practices. The out-of-town -- and out-of-country -- travel. Her role as a hidden figure in a lesser-known aspect of integration brought on by the civil rights movement.\n\nHer life as one of the country's first black female professional wrestlers.\n\n\"I liked the freedom, I liked the money, I liked the travel, and I had fun,\" Isbell said.\n\nA new documentary explores the role of black women recruited as professional wrestlers in the 1950s and 1960s. Columbus was an epicenter for the female wrestlers thanks to promoter Billy Wolfe.\n\n\"Lady Wrestler: The Amazing, Untold Story of African-American Women in the Ring\" debuts Thursday at Ohio State University's Wexner Center for the Arts.\n\nFilmmaker Chris Bournea said people like Isbell wrestled not only before women were deemed capable of athletic accomplishments but before blacks had civil rights in many places.\n\nThey also didn't talk a lot about what they did, perhaps concerned about others' reactions. And when they were finished, they wanted to move on with their lives.\n\nBournea, who is black, grew up in Columbus without ever hearing the stories. After he learned of them as a journalist about a decade ago, he knew he had to do something.\n\n\"Awareness needed to be brought to these women's accomplishments,\" Bournea said.\n\nThe driving force behind their recruitment was Wolfe, a former wrestler and trainer, who was white. A gambler, cigar smoker and womanizer, he was a classic American hustler, said Jeff Leen, a Washington Post reporter whose 2009 book on Wolfe's wife, wrestler Mildred Burke, \"The Queen of the Ring\" offers a comprehensive history of the early years of women's professional wrestling.\n\nWhatever else he was, though, Wolfe wasn't prejudiced.\n\nWolfe didn't care if his wrestlers \"were straight or gay, black or white,\" Leen said. \"He cared if they were a great dynamic performer who was going to put butts in the seat and make him money.\"\n\nHe also wanted real athletes, despite the staged matches, and required women to work out diligently.\n\nThe matches promoted by Wolfe preceded the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling or GLOW syndicated TV promotion of the 1980s, now the subject of a Netflix comedy series.\n\nBournea said he has planned screenings in other cities with large professional wrestling fan bases and will then release the film on Amazon.\n\nIsbell signed with Wolfe in Columbus in 1961 in her early 20s, one of a few dozen black women that wrestled for Wolfe, in addition to many white women.\n\nIsbell practiced three times a week, and wrestled in modified one-piece swimsuits. She appeared throughout the U.S., wrestling white women in northern cities like Detroit, and black women only in the Jim Crow South. She made anywhere from $100 to $400 a match.\n\nIsbell also saw the world, wrestling in matches in Australia, Japan and Nigeria. Along the way she raised four children, who were vaguely aware of what their mom was up to. She wrestled into the 1970s, with a final appearance in a promotion in California in the 1980s. By then she was working for the state, retiring as a purchasing agent with the Ohio Industrial Commission.\n\nNow 78, she keeps fit through yard work, walks in the park, and exercising on a treadmill in her east side Columbus home.\n\nNext month, she plans to attend an annual professional wrestling reunion in Las Vegas held by the Cauliflower Alley Club, a pro wrestling preservation society.\n\nNews of her exploits is leaking out as word of the documentary grows in Columbus. But that doesn't stop Isbell from considering people's reaction.\n\n\"That's why I'm worried now,\" Isbell said with a laugh. \"What are they going to say at church?\"\n\nAndrew Welsh-Huggins can be reached on Twitter at @awhcolumbus .\n\nThis story has been updated to correct name of 1980s promotion to Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, not the Glorious Women of Wrestling.",

Ri was part of the North's delegation which attended the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang last month. He attended the games along with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong.\n\nNorth Korea said it will put \"its utmost efforts\" into preparing for the Inter-Korean Summit through the high-level talks at Tongilgak, Panmunjeom, on March 29, according to the Unification Ministry.\n\nThe Inter-Korean Summit is set to be held in April with both South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim in attendance. The talks on March 29 will be held to prepare for that historic summit.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's proposed meeting with Kim is still up in the air. Trump said in early March he would meet with Kim by May to discuss denuclearization by the isolated nation. But a date has yet to be set for the meeting, and a location is unknown as well.\n\nMoon proposed a summit between the U.S., South Korea and North Korea earlier this week to be held following the separate talks between the North and South, and then Kim and Trump.\n\n\"Holding a North Korea-U.S. summit following a South-North Korea summit itself is a historical event. And depending on their outcomes, they may lead to a three-way summit of South, North and U.S.,\" Moon said Wednesday, noting that \"it could be even more dramatic\" depending on the progress during the planning stage.\n\nABC News' Joohee Cho contributed to this report from Seoul.",

                "title": "French hero officer who swapped himself for hostage dies",
                "body": "A French police officer who offered himself up to an extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage has died of his injuries, the interior minister said Saturday.\n\nCol. Arnaud Beltrame was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday. His death, announced by French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, raises the toll to four. The gunman was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.\n\nThe gunman first hijacked a car and opened fire on police, then took hostages inside a supermarket. Baltrame volunteered to take the place of a female hostage and surreptitiously left on his cellphone so police outside could hear what was happening inside the store.\n\nOfficials said the decision was made to storm the building when they heard shots fired.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a vehicle and a building in central Carcassonne.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called \"Fiche S\" list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nA woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He did not identify her.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury was not serious, Lefebvre said.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.\n\nHe shouted \"Allahu akbar! (God is great)\" and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Thomas Adamson, Samuel Petrequin, Sylvie Corbet, Angela Charlton and Jerome Pugmire in Paris contributed to this report.",

                "title": "In Egypt, wall-to-wall el-Sissi banners inspire satire",
                "body": "In a surreal scene from the 2001 film \"Vanilla Sky,\" Tom Cruise runs through a deserted Times Square before screaming in despair. In a satirical version widely shared in Egypt, the square is filled with campaign billboards for President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\n\nOpen your eyes anywhere in Egypt these days, and you'll see billboards, banners and posters hailing the general-turned-president, who will stand for re-election next week against a little-known politician who has made no effort to challenge him.\n\nThe outcome of the election is a foregone conclusion, so the advertising blitz appears aimed at encouraging turnout to try and bolster the vote's legitimacy.\n\nIn the meantime, the displays have provoked a wave of grim satire on social media, one of the last remaining avenues for dissent amid a sweeping crackdown that has escalated in the lead-up to the March 26-28 vote.\n\nA still photo cropped from the 1997 blockbuster \"Titanic\" shows Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet seated on the doomed ship's deck with an el-Sissi banner in the background. Another shows the stars of \"Friends\" gathered at their favorite cafe, with a sign outside saying: \"Gunther and the rest of the staff at Central Perk support Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\"\n\nThe real banners are paid for by individuals and entities from all walks of life, from private businesses and loyal political groups to lawmakers, trade unions and state-owned companies. Even a small tea house or grocery store might hang a banner out front.\n\n\"You alone are our beloved,\" swoons one banner, sponsored by a private company in the Sinai Peninsula. Another, with the image of a child, says \"Mohammed Ahmed Mustafa supports Grandpa el-Sissi.\"\n\nAutocratic rulers across the Middle East have enjoyed similar displays of public adulation for decades. Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi stared down from ubiquitous signs and billboards -- until joyous crowds tore them down when the longtime dictators were overthrown.\n\nDuring Egypt's 2011 uprising, crowds tore down portraits of Hosni Mubarak and changed the name of a central metro station from Mubarak to Martyrs. When they took over Cairo's Tahrir Square they transformed it into a sprawling gallery of opposition banners, artwork and revolutionary graffiti.\n\nEgypt's first freely elected president, the Islamist Mohammed Morsi, was widely mocked, both online and off, during his divisive year in power, before being overthrown by the military on el-Sissi's orders. Since then, the government has silenced its critics, arresting thousands of Islamists as well as prominent secular activists, and blocking hundreds of independent and critical websites.\n\nImad Hussein, the pro-government editor of the independent Al-Shorouk daily, says the proliferation of banners in support of el-Sissi is part of Egyptian culture.\n\n\"It's like a traditional Egyptian wedding when the guests try to outdo each other with how much money they give the newly-wed couple to help them start their life together,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nOthers see the banners, and the election itself, as the latest evidence of Egypt's slide back into authoritarianism. A string of potentially serious candidates withdrew from the race under pressure or were arrested, and the resulting vote strongly resembles the one-man referendums held by Arab autocrats going back to the 1950s.\n\n\"Most of these banners are made by people as a means of self-preservation or as part of their pursuit of personal gain,\" said Ibrahim Awad, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo. \"The satire and sarcasm on social media show that a large segment of the population, especially activists, is not taking the elections seriously.\"\n\nA collage posted online has an elderly man waking up in his bed, shocked at the sight of an el-Sissi banner smiling down at him. Another has a statue of a nude Aphrodite with an el-Sissi sticker pasted on it. With her hand on her chest, she seems to plead with a passing museum visitor, saying: \"Enough with the posters already.\"\n\n\"The master of darkness and all death eaters support Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi,\" declares a banner hung over a scene from a \"Harry Potter\" movie with the staff and students of Hogwarts seated around a conference table.\n\nThe banners have inspired other jokes that are circulating the old-fashioned way, by word of mouth. There's the one about the voter who can't decide between the two candidates -- el-Sissi looking to his left or el-Sissi looking to his right.",

Griffin's comedy career was left in shambles last year after she posed for a photo holding a bloody mannequin head made to look like Trump. After the photo's release, venues balked at hosting her comedy tour and the rest of its American dates were cancelled. She was also dropped from her annual gig on CNN co-hosting on New Year's Eve with Anderson Cooper.\n\nGriffin tweeted she would be attending as a guest of the Washington Blade and Los Angeles Blade, an LGBT news outlet.\n\nThe annual White House Correspondents Dinner has been held since 1920, and traditionally features a visit by the current president. Trump, however, broke with that tradition in 2017 by not attending the dinner. The event is held by the White House Correspondents Association, a group of journalists who cover the White House on a daily basis.\n\nThe president usually faces a handful of jokes at his expense from the host, followed by his own roast of the reporters in attendance.\n\nTrump, of course, has made mocking the media into an almost-daily event. His cries of \"fake news\" have become a trademark, both during the election and while in office. He's already tweeted the phrase 25 times so far in 2018.\n\nHe tweeted, \"Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!\" before last year's correspondents dinner.\n\nThe president has not said whether he'll attend the dinner in 2018. Comedian Michelle Wolf from \"The Daily Show\" is set to host.\n\nGriffin was interviewed in a cover story in The Hollywood Reporter in January after spending months out of the spotlight. She spoke about the bloody head incident and talked about a potential comeback.\n\n\"I didn't commit a crime. I didn't rape anybody. I didn't assault anybody. I didn't get a DUI. I mean, my God, there are celebrities that f------ kill people,\" she told the magazine.\n\nGriffin initially apologized to Trump for the photo, which she posted on social media in May, in a video, saying, \"I sincerely apologize. I am just now seeing the reaction to these images. I'm a comic. I crossed the line.\" But the comic and actress, known for her roles on the sitcom \"Suddenly Susan\" and reality show \"My Life on the D-List,\" retracted the apology in an interview on Australian TV in August, saying, \"I am no longer sorry. The whole outrage was B.S.\"\n\nAt the time, Trump called the photo \"sick\" and first lady Melania Trump said it \"makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.\"",

The Wildcats advanced earlier Friday night with a 90-78 victory over West Virginia.\n\nBeard is in his second year in Lubbock after leaving Arkansas-Little Rock, where he led the Trojans to a double overtime upset over fifth-seeded Purdue in the first round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament.\n\nThis time, No. 2 seed Purdue (30-7) was hoping to join Villanova in the Elite Eight, getting 30 points from Carsen Edwards and 12 points and 13 rebounds from Vincent Edwards.\n\nBut Beard was in their way again.\n\nTexas Tech trailed for most of the first before scoring the last 10 points of the half to turn a five-point deficit into a 30-25 lead. The Red Raiders led 58-55 with 5:44 left when Evans hit two free throws and then a three pointer to start an 11-0 run that put the game away.\n\nPurdue star center Isaac Haas, the team's No. 2 scorer and rebounder, could only be a cheerleader -- and a one-armed cheerleader, at that. After breaking his right elbow in the first-round game against Cal State-Fullerton, he tried to convince Painter he could play; the Purdue engineering department even pitched in, designing a special brace for his right arm.\n\nBut Haas remained on the bench, replaced by Matt Haarms, a redshirt freshman who at 7-foot-3 measures an inch taller but at 40 pounds lighter is hardly the force under the basket of that his senior teammate has been.\n\nHaarms finished with four points and three rebounds.\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP -- Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events",

                "title": "Joint Chiefs chair sees signs of progress in Afghan war",
                "body": "In fits and starts, for nearly a decade, the U.S. has talked about and struggled to make progress on building an Afghan military that can take control of its own nation's security and lay the groundwork for a stable government.\n\nThis time, they think they have it right.\n\nAfter five days criss-crossing Afghanistan, meeting with everyone from the Afghan president to the new American trainers on the ground, Gen. Joseph Dunford headed home Friday with a palpable sense of optimism.\n\nJust months after the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan declared the war against the Taliban and other insurgents a stalemate, Dunford -- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- said he can see the makings of a shift.\n\n\"What we're already starting to see is, I think, momentum is going to favor the Afghan forces,\" Dunford told the small group of reporters traveling with him, adding that the deployment of 800 new Army trainers \"will serve as an accelerant to the Afghans being able to achieve momentum.\"\n\nOne thing that gave him hope was a recent Afghan military operation in the east, where the Taliban have long been strong. It delivered, in his words, a \"eureka\" moment.\n\nDubbed Saleb 1-23, the Afghan military operation was launched in mid-February in a move to oust the Taliban from a critical 10-kilometer stretch of valley in Laghman Province. Taliban fighters have used that area as a transit route across the border with Pakistan, where they enjoy safe havens.\n\nU.S. Army Maj. Marc Pfrogner, the operations adviser for the Afghans' 201st Corps, said the complex mission took 50 days to plan. He said it lasted until March 9, and got fiercer as the Afghans moved up Sangar Valley. Four Afghan forces died in the fight, and 30 Taliban were killed.\n\nBut what impressed the Americans was the coordinated battle the Afghans waged, using their own intelligence, gathered in part from the Scan Eagle drone they got last September.\n\nWith guidance from their American advisers, Afghan commandos launched the initial assaults, supported by Afghan aircraft. The Afghan National Army forces followed, clearing the area, and National Police units moved in to hold the ground, enabling local political leaders to retake the government.\n\nU.S. surveillance and strike aircraft provided support, but American military commanders said much of that was invisible to the local people, who saw the Afghan forces as their liberators.\n\nThe coordination between the intelligence collection, the fighting forces and the police, said Dunford, is what the U.S. has been waiting to see.\n\n\"If you want to talk about what right looks like -- from the Afghan security force and the government rolling in behind it -- that operation was about textbook,\" said Dunford. \"I'm trying to restrain my enthusiasm here, but I'm having trouble, because that is the most positive observation that I've had over the last two days. You're kinda like, eureka!\"\n\nTempering that optimism, however, are the steep challenges ahead -- from government corruption and political infighting to regional diplomatic tensions and struggles to build a consistent, enduring military. Too often in recent years, U.S. officials have seized on a glimmer of hope, only to watch the Taliban regroup and surge again, taking back territory and fueling its fight with the profitable poppy harvest.\n\nThat is all compounded by the persistent turmoil with Pakistan, which U.S. officials complain has still not done enough to eliminate Taliban safe havens and control the traffic of militants back and forth across the border.\n\nMilitary leaders and commanders know well the risks of a backslide, so the next several months will be critical as they watch for the progress they believe is possible. And they know that success will depend on more than battlefield victories.\n\n\"The military effort is necessary but not sufficient to get us to reconciliation,\" said Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, referring to the renewed campaign to get Taliban fighters to the peace table. \"There's a significant political component and diplomatic component.\"\n\nHe and others agree, however, that battlefield wins are key ways to pressure insurgents to surrender. And he said the influx in recent months of several thousand U.S. troops and trainers, additional strike aircraft and drones is helping the Afghans go on the offensive.\n\nOther U.S. commanders said the renewed American commitment to the war, driven by the strategy rolled out by President Donald Trump last August, has helped embolden Afghan forces.\n\nDown at Camp Leatherneck in the Taliban heartland of Helmand Province, Marines said the Afghan soldiers still struggle with logistics and maintenance issues, but they are seeing some progress.\n\n\"It's different now because they understand now it's their responsibility,\" said Marine Lt. Col. Ryan Benson, an adviser for the Afghan army. \"Before there was the understanding that they were in the lead, but there was always that crutch\" of coalition forces they could fall back on.\n\nAs the summer fighting season looms, Dunford said he will gauge success based on specific benchmarks. He said he wants the number of Afghan casualties to go down, and the percentage of the population living in secure, government controlled areas to go up. Currently, he said, about 68 percent of the population is living in secure areas, and the goal is 80 percent.\n\nHe also wants to see more Taliban abandon the fight and ease back into society through a formal Afghan reintegration program. And he said he'll be watching the Taliban's reaction when fighters increasingly see they're being targeted by Afghan aircraft and the number of Afghan commandos -- who have been their toughest enemy -- has doubled.\n\n\"This is not another year of the same thing we've been doing for 17 years,\" Dunford said. \"All of this should bring pressure to bear on the Taliban. ... They are not going to win on the battlefield, they have to be convinced of that.\"",

The two-time MVP immediately sat in a chair and put his head down before going into the locker room.\n\nNick Young scored 24 points with six 3-pointers as the defending champions were already down their other All-Stars -- Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.\n\nYoung, Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell and Zaza Pachulia joined Curry in the starting lineup. Pachulia had nine rebounds, while Bell scored 12 points.\n\nMcCaw went down hard and headed to the locker room at the 10:24 mark of the first quarter. He returned to start the second, playing with a bruised lower back. Young went to the locker room late in the first half but was OK.\n\nCurry overcame a slow start in his return, shooting 10 for 18. He had rolled the ankle at Atlanta on March 2 but initially kept playing before re-injuring it again.\n\nWhen asked what he expected of Curry in his first game back, coach Steve Kerr quipped: \"52 points. I have seen Steph come back from injury and nothing would surprise me.\"\n\nCurry began 1 for 6 and missed his first four 3s before connecting 62 seconds into the third. His 3 at 5:53 in the third pulled the Warriors within 60-56 then he converted a go-ahead four-point play with 3:03 left in the third. Soon after, his night was done.\n\nDurant missed his fourth straight game with a broken rib while Thompson sat out a fifth in a row with a fractured right thumb. Green has a pelvic contusion.\n\nThe teams combined to miss their first 16 3-pointers -- the Hawks 0 for 9 and Golden State 0 of 7 -- before Atlanta's Taurean Prince made the first shot from deep at the 9:21 mark of second quarter. Young hit the Warriors' first 3 with 4:24 before halftime.\n\nQuinn Cook contributed 13 points, eight rebounds and six assists off the bench on his 25th birthday, helping the Warriors to a seventh straight win over the Hawks and 12th in 13.\n\nPrince led Atlanta with 20 points. Dennis Schroder, who rested Thursday night in a loss at Sacramento, was back for Atlanta and scored 16 points. He briefly went to the locker room with 11:23 remaining in the game before returning for the Hawks, who HAD lost seven of eight.\n\nHe missed two key free throws with less than 5 minutes to play and his team down four.\n\nGolden State began 9 for 35 and fell behind 33-20 before trailing 51-43 at halftime.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHawks: The Hawks lost their sixth straight on Golden State's home floor. They haven't won at Oracle Arena since Feb. 25, 2011. ... G Kent Bazemore missed his sixth straight game with a bruised bone in his right knee.\n\nWarriors: Omri Casspi missed a third consecutive game with a sprained right ankle. ... Golden State improved to 16-2 following a loss this season and 47-9 since 2014-15. The Warriors have only lost back-to-back games eight times during that span. ... Local students were recognized at halftime by the Bay Area All-Star Scholarship Team, a collaborative effort by the Bay Area professional sports teams to provide scholarships for youth striving to continue their educations.\n\nMARCH FOR OUR LIVES\n\nKerr plans to participate in the Oakland \"March For Our Lives\" walk Saturday with his family to offer his support in the movement to end gun violence and mass shootings in the U.S.\n\nEarlier this month, Kerr took part in a town hall at Newark Memorial High School and challenged students to vote and make their voices heard. He shared how his father Malcolm, president of the American University of Beirut, was murdered in Beirut when Kerr was 18 and a freshman at the University of Arizona.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHawks: Visit Rockets on Sunday.\n\nWarriors: Host Utah on Sunday.\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball",

Shayne Denn, 26, and Eric Tyrrell, 28, are wanted in connection with the crime as well. Denn is wanted for the same charges as Almeida, but also is to be charged with three counts of larceny of a firearm. Tyrrell is wanted for receiving stolen property, according to police.\n\nPolice said they have recovered items stolen from Gronkowski's home, including an Apple watch, a Rolex watch and two rare coins from the 1800s after a search warrant was executed at Almeida's home in Randolph, Massachusetts. The firearms allegedly stolen by Denn belonged to Robert Goon, who lives with Gronkowski, and have not been recovered.\n\nGronkowski's Patriots lost Super Bowl LII on Feb. 4 to the Philadelphia Eagles, 41-33, at Minneapolis' U.S. Bank Stadium. The All-Pro tight end returned to his home to find it had been ransacked and burglarized. Gronkowski had two touchdowns in the game.\n\nThe five-time Pro Bowler had two years and $17 million left on his deal with New England, but is reportedly debating whether to step away from the sport and pursue acting or professional wrestling. Gronkowski, 28, made an in-ring appearance at last year's Wrestlemania.\n\nABC News' Alexandra Faul contributed to this report.",

They had the seventh- and eighth-fastest times, after topping the leaderboard in practice in dry conditions on Friday.\n\nThe heavy rains subsided by early afternoon, allowing the track to rapidly dry during the third practice session and making conditions safe for drivers to test their soft tires.\n\nStill, only a few drivers completed a timed lap with the softer compounds, with Mercedes, Red Bull and most of the others staying with their intermediates.\n\nSauber's Marcus Ericsson had the third-fastest time of the session on ultrasoft tires, followed by Red Bull's Max Verstappen on intermediates.\n\nHamilton remains the favorite to capture his fifth straight pole position at the Australian Grand Prix in qualifying later Saturday.

He exempted some countries pending negotiations and gave the immediate green light for others, like China.\n\nIn a separate case, he also ordered tariffs on about $60 billion of Chinese goods, again bypassing WTO arbitration. But in a sign that he will still turn to the WTO when it suits his interests, Trump had his government file a complaint through the organization to try to stop China from allegedly stealing technology from U.S. companies that operate there.\n\nIn applying the steel and aluminum tariffs, Trump's main concern is that China has for years overproduced steel and aluminum, depressing prices globally and causing job losses in other countries, like the U.S. but also in Europe.\n\nUsually, a country would file a complaint through the WTO to have another country rein in their industry. The risk now is that other countries might likewise sidestep the WTO and slap their own tariffs in retaliation, further undermining the WTO.\n\nIn the longer-term, that could create uncertainties for countries and businesses, which need to plan years into the future to invest in infrastructure or new operations.\n\nAmong the main concerns at the WTO over the Trump administration's move on steel and aluminum is that it is citing national security as a reason. The WTO allows a country to set up tariffs for that reason, but it is something of a taboo among countries to do so because if one country invokes national security, it increases the chance that others might as well.\n\nWTO chief Roberto Azevedo on Friday encouraged countries to use the WTO to settle disputes.\n\n\"Actions taken outside these collective processes greatly increase the risk of escalation in a confrontation that will have no winners,\" he said.\n\nMany countries went to the WTO on Friday to express concern about the U.S. move, with China and Russia specifically calling on the U.S. to follow WTO rules and uphold its commitment to the trade body.\n\nThe U.S. argues it needs a strong steel and aluminum industry to reinforce domestic production of warships, fighter planes and other national defense requirements. The European Union and other trade partners dismiss that as an excuse and say the U.S. merely wants to give its companies a boost.\n\nCountries affected by the measures, like China, can under WTO rules retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods worth a sum equivalent to the trading loss they would suffer from the U.S. tariffs. China has announced measures on $3 billion worth of U.S. goods.\n\nThe move on tariffs is only the latest case of Trump undermining the WTO. Ever since his presidential campaign he has threatened to pull the U.S. out of the body. On Thursday, he said the WTO was \"a disaster for us\" and insisted its arbitrations were \"unfair\" to the U.S.\n\nTrump's government has also hindered the WTO in practice by delaying the appointment of new members to the seven-strong appellate body that rules on disputes. That makes it slower for the WTO to rule on cases.\n\nBut while the U.S. government's move on steel and aluminum weakens the WTO, its complaint against China's technology-poaching suggests it may yet rely on the body when convenient.\n\nUltimately, for the WTO, the key question is how other countries respond to the U.S., according to Francois.\n\n\"The system certainly needs updating, but just ignoring treaty commitments is akin to tearing up contracts you have signed,\" he said.",

                "title": "Organizers hope to draw half a million to gun control rally",
                "body": "Thousands are gathering in Washington Saturday for a protest that organizers claim will be a defining moment in the long-simmering national debate over gun-control legislation.\n\nOrganizers of the March for Our Lives rally are hoping to draw 500,000 protesters; that would match last year's women's march and make this one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam era. It would also bolster claims that the nation is ready to enact sweeping changes to its gun control laws. More than 800 marches are planned in cities across America and dozens of locations overseas to be held at roughly the same time.\n\nWashington is generally nonchalant about protests, but Saturday's gathering has prompted more attention and speculation than usual. Washington officials say they are prepared to handle the crowds -- more prepared than they were for the women's march, which far exceeded the organizers' official predictions of 300,000.\n\nThe protesters, many of them high school students, claim that the youth leadership of this initiative is what will set it apart from previous attempts to enact stronger gun-control legislation.\n\nIn the wake of the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the students have tapped into a powerful current of pro-gun control sentiment that has been building for years. They have also partnered with well-funded liberal groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control advocacy group founded by former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg.\n\nPolls indicate that public opinion nationwide may indeed be shifting on an issue that has simmered for generations, and through dozens of mass shootings. A new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the United States should be tightened. That's up from 61 percent who said the same in October of 2016 and 55 percent when the AP first asked the question in October of 2013. Overall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun control laws.\n\nBut even with claims of historic social momentum on the issue of gun control, the AP poll also found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action. Among the questions facing march organizers and participants will be how to translate this one-day event, regardless of turnout, into meaningful legislative change.\n\nOne way is by channeling the current energy into mid-term congressional elections this fall. Students in Florida have focused on youth voter registration and there will be a registration booth at the Saturday rally.",

                "body": "Pakistan's biggest city will witness a high-profile cricket match for the first time in nine years on Sunday when the Pakistan Super League final is staged amid heavy security at a newly renovated National Stadium in Karachi.\n\nMore than 8,000 security personnel have been deployed for the Twenty20 final between Islamabad United and last year's champions Peshawar Zalmi.\n\nKarachi, now with a population of 15 million, last saw a major game with international players in February 2009 -- Sri Lanka vs. Pakistan in a test match.\n\nOn the same tour, terrorists attacked the Sri Lanka team bus at Lahore. On March 3, 2009, the bus carrying the visiting cricketers, part of a large convoy, was fired upon by 12 gunmen near Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. They were on their way to play the third day of the second test against Pakistan, and six Pakistan policemen and two civilians were killed, and six members of the Sri Lanka team were injured.\n\nThat resulted in an end to international cricket in the country, and the Pakistan Cricket Board was left with no choice but to choose United Arab Emirates as its \"home\" turf to host international teams.\n\nHowever, the PCB continued in its efforts to convince foreign nations to begin touring Pakistan. Lahore first hosted the PSL final last year, and there were Twenty20 international matches organized against a World XI (three matches) and Sri Lanka (one).\n\nBut a reluctance from some international PSL players to play in Pakistan remains. The preliminary PSL matches were played at Dubai and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates\n\nAustralian Shane Watson (Quetta Gladiators) and Englishmen Eoin Morgan (Karachi) and Kevin Pietersen (Quetta) all refused to accompany their respective franchises to Lahore earlier this week for two PSL eliminators.\n\nThe absence of the top stars hurt both franchises and drew an angry response from Gladiators coach and former Pakistan captain Moin Khan.\n\n\"We, in the coming season, should only pick players who have the consent to visit Pakistan,\" Moin said after losing the first eliminator against Zalmi.\n\n\"We do not need to push for individuality as our league has now become a bigger brand ... we don't need to get these players who don't want to come to Pakistan. In fact, this is hurting Pakistan as it is sending a negative signal and affects our country's image as well.\"\n\nThe provincial administration in Karachi has put up in place stringent security arrangements for Sunday's final. Spectators might have to wait in long queues hours before the evening final and will get into the stadium only after going through at least three security checkpoints.\n\nBut the city is giving a festive look to welcome foreign players like Peshawar Zalmi's Darren Sammy of West Indies and Chris Jordan of England, and South African J.P. Duminy and New Zealand's Luke Ronchi of Islamabad United.\n\nBillboards and player cut-outs have been displayed on the sides of main streets to celebrate an international-standard game for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nSammy has become a household name in Pakistan -- especially the way he has carried Zalmi to the final after playing four successive matches with a leg injury.\n\n\"Yes Karachi we're coming,\" Sammy said in a video message. \"I want you all to come and support Peshawar Zalmi. I want everybody to wear the yellow shirt, it's a yellow storm, we're coming.\"",

                "body": "Today in History\n\nToday is Saturday, March 24, the 83rd day of 2018. There are 282 days left in the year.\n\nToday's Highlight in History:\n\nOn March 24, 1958, Elvis Presley was inducted into the U.S. Army at the draft board in Memphis, Tennessee, before boarding a bus for Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. (Presley underwent basic training at Fort Hood, Texas, before being shipped off to Germany.)\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1765, Britain enacted the Quartering Act, requiring American colonists to provide temporary housing to British soldiers.\n\nIn 1832, a mob in Hiram, Ohio, attacked, tarred and feathered Mormon leaders Joseph Smith Jr. and Sidney Rigdon.\n\nIn 1913, New York's Palace Theatre, the legendary home of vaudeville, opened on Broadway.\n\nIn 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill granting future independence to the Philippines.\n\nIn 1944, in occupied Rome, the Nazis executed more than 300 civilians in reprisal for an attack by Italian partisans the day before that killed 32 German soldiers.\n\nIn 1965, Ranger 9, a lunar probe launched three days earlier by NASA, crashed into the moon (as planned) after sending back more than 5,800 video images.\n\nIn 1976, the president of Argentina, Isabel Peron, was deposed by her country's military. British war hero Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery, 88, died in Alton, Hampshire, England.\n\nIn 1988, former national security aides Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter and businessmen Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair. (North and Poindexter were convicted, but had their verdicts thrown out; Secord and Hakim received probation after each pleaded guilty to a single count under a plea bargain.)\n\nIn 1989, the supertanker Exxon Valdez (vahl-DEEZ') ran aground on a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound and began leaking an estimated 11 million gallons of crude oil.\n\nIn 1998, two students, ages 13 and 11, opened fire outside Jonesboro Westside Middle School in Arkansas, killing four classmates and a teacher. (The gunmen were imprisoned by Arkansas until age 18, then by federal authorities until age 21.)\n\nIn 1999, NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia, marking the first time in its 50-year existence that it had ever attacked a sovereign country. Thirty-nine people were killed when fire erupted in the Mont Blanc tunnel in France and burned for two days.\n\nIn 2015, Germanwings Flight 9525, an Airbus A320, crashed into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board; investigators said the jetliner was deliberately downed by the 27-year-old co-pilot.\n\nTen years ago: President George W. Bush pledged to ensure \"an outcome that will merit the sacrifice\" of those who had died in Iraq, offering both sympathy and resolve as the U.S. death toll in the five-year war hit 4,000. The FBI said authorities had recovered the remains of two U.S. contractors, Ronald Withrow and John Roy Young, who were kidnapped in Iraq more than a year earlier. Actor Richard Widmark died in Roxbury, Connecticut, at age 93.\n\nFive years ago: Just days after the 10th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, on a previously unannounced trip to Baghdad, confronted Iraqi officials for continuing to grant Iran access to its airspace and said Iraq's behavior was raising questions about its reliability as a partner. Rebels overthrew Francois Bozize, Central African Republic's president for a decade.\n\nOne year ago: President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal \"Obamacare\" off the House floor when it became clear the measure would fail badly. Former Penn State President Graham Spanier was convicted of hushing up child sexual abuse allegations in 2001 against Jerry Sandusky, whose arrest a decade later blew up into a major scandal for the university. (Spanier is appealing his conviction.)\n\nToday's Birthdays: Poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti is 99. Actor William Smith is 85. Fashion and costume designer Bob Mackie is 79. Actor R. Lee Ermey is 74.

                "body": "Villanova's 3-point party rolled past the pressure of West Virginia to bring the Wildcats to the doorstep of another Final Four two seasons after winning a national championship.\n\nThe top-seeded Wildcats continued their outside feast, downing the fifth-seeded Mountaineers 90-78 on Friday night to earn their second trip to the regional finals in three seasons.\n\nJalen Brunson led Villanova with 27 points and Omari Spellman had 18 with eight rebounds as Villanova overcame the West Virginia press by hitting 13 of 24 shots from 3-point range.\n\nJevon Carter and Sagaba Konate each at 12 points to lead West Virginia.\n\nVillanova (33-4) has now made 47 3-pointers for the tournament. The outside shots helped the Wildcats overcome 16 turnovers.\n\nVillanova's Sweet 16 plan for the team nicknamed \"Press Virginia\": Attack the stifling defense head-on.\n\nThe Wildcats struggled at times, especially in the first half, but dug out of a six-point hole in the second half with an 11-0 run.\n\n\"What a game, man. I hope that looked as good as it did from the bench, man,\" Villanova coach Jay Wright said. \"That was the most physically demanding, mentally draining 40 minutes we've played in a long time. They are so relentless.\"\n\nThe Mountaineers (26-11) stayed close throughout the night, ramping up the pressure and making Villanova play faster than it wanted to early. But foul trouble throughout the second half was too much for West Virginia to overcome after it gave up the lead.\n\nCarter was called for his third with 17:33 left in the game. That was followed by Daxter Miles being whistled for his third and fourth fouls over a two minute stretch that sent him to the bench with 15 minutes remaining.\n\nWest Virginia was able to adjust for a while and took advantage of a more than three-minute Villanova scoring drought to take a 60-54 edge with just over 11 minutes left.\n\nBut Villanova heated up again. Its 11-point run was capped by a thunderous block and dunk on the other end by Omari Spellman that pushed the Wildcats back in front 65-60.\n\nThe Wildcats kept the momentum going, stretching the lead to 76-66 on a 3-pointer by Brunson.\n\nWest Virginia never got closer than 4 points the rest of the way.\n\nVillanova led 44-42 at the half after a fast-paced opening 20 minutes. Brunson led all scorers with 16 points in the half, with West Virginia getting 11 points from Daxter Miles.\n\nThe Wildcats came out firing, connecting on their first seven field goals. They handled the Mountaineers' pressure well early. But the Wildcats had three turnovers over a 65-second stretch during an 8-0 Mountaineers run that put them in front 33-30.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWest Virginia: It's a tough loss for the Mountaineers, but it doesn't diminish the incredible effort by a senior class that reached the Sweet 16 three times in four years.\n\nVillanova: The Wildcats are back in the Elite Eight for the first time since they won the national championship in 2016.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVillanova awaits the winner of Texas Tech and Purdue in Sunday's regional final.\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP -- Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events",

Bumgarner said the timeline for recovery is four to six weeks and he will have a pin inserted into his pinkie Saturday.\n\n\"It's tough. But I can handle it,\" Bumgarner said. \"These guys can handle it. This obviously was not what I was expecting out of my last start. But it happened and I can deal with it.\"\n\nBumgarner, the 2014 World Series MVP, missed nearly three months with a shoulder injury last season after a dirt bike accident on April 20 during an off day in Colorado.\n\nHis latest setback is a huge blow to the Giants as they try to rebound from a surprising last-place finish in the NL West with 98 losses.\n\n\"It's just a downer. This was a short day. I feel for him,\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \"Obviously, we know what he means to us, but where he was, how well he's thrown the ball all spring. Unfortunately, you've got to deal with these things. But this one certainly was a downer today because we were all getting ready to go to San Francisco and now we've got to make some adjustments.\"\n\nAfter six straight seasons with double-digit wins, more than 200 innings and 30-plus starts, Bumgarner went 4-9 with a 3.32 ERA in 17 starts last season and threw just 111 innings.\n\nBochy wasn't ready to say whether right-hander Johnny Cueto would move into the No. 1 spot and pitch Thursday's opener at the NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers. Jeff Samardzija has a strained pectoral muscle that will shut him down for at least a week and likely force him to start the season on the disabled list.\n\n\"This is horrible news for us,\" Bochy said. \"There's nothing else we can do now except push on.\"\n\nCheslor Cuthbert hit a solo home run off Bumgarner and had four hits.

Freddie Freeman hit his second homer.\n\nASTROS (SS) 2, TWINS 2\n\nRyan LaMarre's double leading off the ninth inning was the first hit for Minnesota and Tanner English followed his first homer. J.D. Davis hit a pair of solo homers, raising his total to five.\n\nROCKIES 8, REDS 2\n\nHomer Bailey, picked to start the Reds' opener, allowed consecutive homers in the fourth to Nolan Arenado and Carlos Gonzalez.

                "body": "WATCH Court ruling: Transgender individuals can enlist in the military beginning Jan. 1\n\nIn a presidential memorandum on a Friday, President Trump banned some transgender service members from serving in the U.S. military, saying transgender individuals \"with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria\" are unable to service except under limited circumstances.\n\n\"Among other things, the policies set forth by the Secretary of Defense state that transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances,\" Trump wrote in statement released by the White House.\n\nIn a memo to Trump dated Feb. 22, Secretary of Defense James Mattis -- citing a panel of expert's \"professional military judgment\" and his own professional judgment -- recommended the following three policies which Trump concurred with:\n\n1. \"Transgender person with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service, except under the following circumstances: (1) if they have been stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to our accession; (2) Servicemembers diagnosed with gender dysphoria after entering into service may be retained if they do not require a change of gender and remain deployable with an applicable retention standards; and (3) currently serving service members who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the previous administration's policy took a fact and prior to the effective date of this new policy, may continue to serve in their preferred gender and receive medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria.\"\n\n2. \"Transgender person who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service.\"\n\n3. \"Transgender person without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all other service members, and their biological sex.\"\n\nTrump tweeted last July that he wanted to ban all transgender service members because the military \"must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.\"\n\nSince those tweets, federal courts have rejected portions of the proposed ban.\n\nMost notably, beginning Jan. 1, the Pentagon complied with a court order that allowed transgender individuals to join the military if they met strict criteria, including certifications from a medical provider about the status of their health.\n\nTwo transgender individuals are already under contract to serve in the U.S. military since that court ruling.\n\nThe policy announced by the White House on Friday will be subject to and restrained by existing court orders, unless the Department of Justice has judges dissolve preliminary injunctions.\n\n\"We will continue to adhere to federal law,\" Department of Defense spokesperson Maj. Dave Eastburn told ABC News on Friday.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis gave his private recommendation for the policy to Trump in late February, but it hasn't been revealed. Mattis' opinion was informed by a panel of experts established after Trump sent a formal presidential memorandum to the Pentagon in August.\n\nLast year, defense officials estimated there were about 200 transgender individuals in the U.S. military who had self-reported to their services a desire for some form of medical treatment related to their gender identity.\n\nHowever, the actual number of transgender service members is still unknown, primarily because military personnel records do not currently track transgender individuals.\n\nA 2016 Rand study, which was referenced by former defense secretary Ash Carter, estimated that 2,450 active duty service members might be transgender, with 1,510 in reserve units.\n\nThe same Rand study said the \"little research\" on transgender service members showed \"little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness.\"\n\n\"Commanders noted that the policies had benefits for all service members by creating a more inclusive and diverse force,\" the study said.\n\nAt the time of the study, 18 countries, including the United Kingdom, Israel, Canada, and Australia, allowed transgender personnel to serve openly.",

                "title": "New England Patriots lend team plane to Parkland students for March for Our Lives",
                "body": "The New England Patriots loaned its team plane to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and their families traveling to Washington, D.C., for the March For Our Lives rally.\n\nPatriots owner Robert Kraft reached out to the school to offer the use of the private plane for the cause, parent Meredith Barry told ABC News.\n\nBarry took the luxury flight to D.C. on Thursday from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport alongside her 16-year-old daughter, Isabela Barry, a junior at the school who hid in a closet during the Feb. 14 shooting. Isabela's best friend, 17-year-old Helena Ramsay, was one of the 17 people who died that day.\n\nEverything about the flight was \"amazing,\" Barry said, down to the hospitality of the flight crew, who provided \"lots of hugs\" and \"lots of love on that plane yesterday.\"\n\nEach seat was like \"first class\" and had a gift and a letter from Kraft in it, Barry said. Food and drinks were served, and a Patriots senior operations manager aboard the flight passed around the team's Super Bowl LI championship ring for everyone to see, Barry said.\n\nIn the letter, Kraft expressed his support for the families on behalf of the Patriots organization.\n\n\"In the wake of incredible tragedy, we have hurt for you, mourned with you and been inspired by you,\" the letter read. \"It is an honor for us to now partner with you as you push for progress.\"\n\nMost of the families of victims who were killed or injured were on the flight, Barry said. While being there was \"surreal,\" Barry described the experience as a \"giant family yesterday on that plane.\"\n\n\"There's definitely a lot of emotions,\" Barry said. \"It's very overwhelming, but you can tell there's a common goal with everyone here and what we're trying to do.\"\n\nThe MSD students who survived the shooting are still \"scared,\" especially at the onset of venturing into a large crowd, Barry said.\n\nBut \"they know is this something they have to do, because they need to be heard,\" she said.\n\nRoberta Weber, whose 16-year-old daughter, Melanie Weber, and 14-year-old son, Jake Weber, attend MSD, said the students are \"passionate about this cause.\"\n\n\"We will not rest until something is done,\" she said. \"It cannot go on the way it is now.\"\n\nWeber and Melanie took the \"wonderful\" flight up to D.C. together, where \"everybody was so sweet and so kind,\" she said.\n\nWhile the perks did lift their spirits, they were also a staunch reminder as to why they were traveling to the march in the first place.\n\n\"It cheers us up a little, but it's also with a heavy heart,\" Weber said. \"We would not have any of this if [the shooting] had not happened.\"\n\nBarry and Weber's daughters are traveling on behalf of the newly minted Shine MSD, an organization started by the school's drama club that aims to provide healing in the community through the arts and help students find a voice through music. Two students wrote a song called \"Shine,\" which will be performed during the march.\n\n\"They're trying to find a way to speak,\" Barry said. \"It's hard to talk. They kind of break down a lot. They're trying to find ways to heal, but in a positive way.\"\n\nWeber's son, Jake, lost a good friend in the shooting and decided to not attend the march, she said, adding that her children have been dealing with the tragedy in different ways. While Melanie has found her activist voice -- even traveling to Tallahassee with other students to demonstrate for gun safety -- Jake has been more reclusive with his emotions.\n\nOn Sunday, when the activists leave D.C., the Patriots team plane will also be used for their return flight home.\n\n\"What the Patriots did and the way they treated everybody was unbelievable,\" Barry said.\n\nTrue to her Floridian roots, Barry typically roots for the Miami Dolphins, she said. But, another team in the NFL's AFC East may have just wiggled their way into her heart.\n\n\"If I could hug every Patriot right now, I would,\" she said.\n\nThe Patriots did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nThousands of demonstrators are expected to attend the March for Our Lives rally, organized by the MSD students in the wake of the shooting that targeted their classmates and teachers.\n\nStudents are using the slogan \"Never Again\" and calling on lawmakers to make schools safer and enact tougher gun laws.\n\nThe march will start at noon ET in Washington, D.C., on Saturday.",

                "body": "No crazy comeback story here.\n\nTop-seeded Kansas brought at least a temporary halt to the insanity this March, withstanding a wild comeback from fifth-seeded Clemson for a too-close-for-comfort, 80-76 victory on Friday.\n\nMalik Newman led the Jayhawks (30-7) with 17 points in a one-time runaway that got much closer and, quite frankly, won't mean much if KU can't finish the job in the Midwest Region final Sunday.\n\nFor the third straight year as a No. 1 seed, KU made its way through the Sweet 16. Getting to the Final Four has been a different story -- and the Jayhawks are on the doorstep once again.\n\nAs a top seed the last two seasons, Kansas made it through the regional semifinals, only to flop a game shy of the Final Four both times. In fact, this is the sixth time Bill Self's team has been seeded first since winning it all in 2008; the Jayhawks haven't made the Final Four one of those times.\n\nIt could've ended Friday.\n\n\"We finished the game about as poorly as a team can,\" Self said. \"We know we've got to be a lot better Sunday, but we're really proud and happy to be in the game.\"\n\nClemson trailed 62-42 midway through the second half, but climbed to within six with 2:27 left. But thanks to Devonte' Graham's offensive rebound with 1:57 left, the Jayhawks ran almost a minute off the clock. The Tigers got the next rebound and had a chance to cut it to a one-possession game, but misfired on back-to-back 3s. From there, Kansas overcame a dogged Clemson press just long enough to ensure that the Tigers couldn't pull any closer until the final buzzer. Kansas came into the game a 4 ?-point favorite.\n\nGabe DeVoe had a career-high 31 for Clemson (25-10), which couldn't replicate the magic it showed in beating Auburn by 31 to reach its first Sweet 16 in 21 years.\n\nPIVOTAL MOMENT\n\nClemson had scored five straight points to cut KU's lead to 35-27 late in the first half when Elijah Thomas, after a review, was called for a flagrant foul. Silvio De Sousa knocked down the free throws, Lagerald Vick buried a 3 and Kansas cruised into halftime ahead 40-27. Vick, Newman and Graham then opened the second half with 3s to extend the lead to 20.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nFor Kansas, it's three down, three to go for a program that expects to compete for a national championship year in and year out. One of the most encouraging things about KU's takedown of Clemson was that it jumped ahead by 13 at halftime despite a 1-for-7 start by Graham, the Big 12 player of the year. Udoka Azubuike looked strong in his first start of the tournament with 14 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nClemson: What a wild 12 months it was for coach Brad Brownell. He entered the season on the hot seat after six straight seasons without even making the NCAA Tournament, but the Tigers reached the regional semifinals for the first time since 1997 even after losing Donte Grantham, arguably their best player. The big question next is whether 2017-18 will prove to be a fluke or the start of something big in the Upstate. The school has spent the money it needed to spend on facilities to become a basketball school -- but will it ever get out of the shadow cast by Dabo Swinney's football team?",

                "title": "Meet Sister Jean, Loyola-Chicago's not-so-secret weapon",
                "body": "DALLAS -- The first time Clayton Custer encountered Sister Jean Dolores-Schmidt, it was during a team prayer.\n\nIt was Custer's first game at Loyola-Chicago in 2015, a redshirt season after transferring from Iowa State. Before the Ramblers ran out of the tunnel for the game, they huddled around Sister Jean.\n\n\"The way she prayed just stuck out,\" Custer recalls. \"In the middle of her prayer there's a scouting report mixed in. She tells us who their best players are and what to watch out for. Sometimes she'll pray for the referee to make the right calls.\n\n\"And at the end, she'll literally pray that we come out on top.\"\n\nThat's vintage Sister Jean, Loyola-Chicago's team chaplain, a 98-year-old nun and the Ramblers' not-so-secret weapon.\n\n\"She's the biggest Loyola basketball fan I've ever met in my life,\" junior guard Marques Townes said.\n\nWhile fan is one way to describe her, it's only one part of what she does. Her team chaplain duties date back to 1994 and she has witnessed more than a half-century of the team's basketball history.\n\nHer story is well-documented: A basketball player in her youth, Sister Jean was part of the sport at a time when the court was divided into separate sections for women, with players restricted to specific roles. She later became a nun, then a grade school teacher and started girls sports programs. She is best known, however, for her relationship with the Ramblers. From 1961 to 1990, she taught at Mundelein College, an all-women's Catholic school that neighbored Loyola. After the two schools merged in 1991, she joined Loyola as an academic advisor before moving to her current role. She prays for the players, their health, for the referees to call a fair game and, of course, a Ramblers victory.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" Ingram said. \"I hope I'm like that if I make it to 98. She has so much knowledge, she has so much wisdom. She shines bright. Her spirit is so warm and loving.\"\n\nSaid Townes: \"I think that's one of our competitive advantages. Having her here blessing our team and blessing our coaching staff, giving us a warm prayer before the game, having her bless the team right before the game, it just means so much.\"\n\nRarely has she missed a home game until this season, when a hip injury disrupted her attendance. Even in her absence, she continued to send regular e-mails to coach Porter Moser after games, applauding the team's performance (or providing encouragement after losses). Players say she leaves individualized notes for each of them at the bottom of those emails. The Ramblers say it makes their day, especially the encouragement after tough games.\n\nNothing was going to stop Sister Jean from being present in Texas this weekend for the Ramblers' first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1985. When Ingram hit a game-winning 3-pointer to lead 11th-seeded Loyola to an 64-62 upset win over sixth-seeded Miami on Thursday, Sister Jean was at the American Airlines Center to witness it. Soon, she was thrust into the spotlight as the subject of a postgame television interview.\n\nSince that moment, Sister Jean has been busier than usual. Her name became a popular topic on Twitter, to the point that even former President Barack Obama gave her a shoutout.\n\nOn Friday, less than 24 hours after the Ramblers' thrilling victory, she fielded one interview after another at the team hotel. During a brief stretch on Friday afternoon, she did three interviews in succession: one with a television crew, a one-on-one with ESPN.com then a phone interview with the Washington Post.\n\nBIll Behrns, Loyola's basketball sports information director, estimates that he received \"at least\" 15 interview requests for Sister Jean this week, and that doesn't count other interviews that he might not have known about, likely bringing the number closer to 20. The New York Times profiled her earlier this week.\n\n\"My phone keeps ringing,\" Sister Jean said. \"That's fine with me. ... Whatever it is, whatever channel it is, it's fine with me. I love it for the young men, because this means a lot to them, too.\"\n\nFor the Ramblers, the nation is just now discovering what the team and university have long known.\n\n\"We've known how much of a blessing she has been to us for years, since I got the job,\" Moser said. \"To see her get the national spotlight, it's fun.\"\n\nDon't be fooled by the wheelchair that she's currently using. Sister Jean is as active and as sharp as they come. The hip injury might have slowed her down some (she's doing physical therapy twice weekly) but before that she was, as Moser said, \"booking around campus, on ice, rain, sleet, snow, whatever, getting to practice. She's energy. That's the Sister Jean we know.\"\n\nHer passion for the school is unrivaled. She lives in the dorms on campus and holds an office there that \"is literally always open,\" freshman forward Cameron Krutwig said. \"Anyone can walk in there, not just us. She's not just for basketball, obviously. She's for the whole university. She's a celebrity around the university and everyone loves her.\" She works with regular students and the school's other sports teams as well.\n\nShe can recall watching the Ramblers' 1963 national championship team and the celebration that ensued (she watched it on an 11-inch black-and-white television on tape-delay). She also can tell you what the Ramblers' RPI was last season, this season, and that maybe it should cease to be a criteria for evaluating tournament-worthy teams.\n\n\"We have to advance with time,\" Sister Jean said. \"We have to consider things that the bracketologists don't think about.\"\n\nAs the Ramblers bask in tournament glory for the first time in 33 years (they went to the Sweet 16 in their most recent appearance in 1985), Sister Jean is enjoying every minute of it. She has filled out two brackets, one that she calls \"realistic\" and has this current Loyola squad going to the Sweet 16. They can accomplish that with a win over Tennessee on Saturday.\n\nHer \"Cinderella dream\" bracket has the Ramblers going all the way to the championship game. To be able to bear witness to history once again is something she's grateful for.\n\n\"It just means so much,\" she said. \"I didn't expect to see this happen in my lifetime.\"\n\nOh, and she has a message for the Ramblers' next opponent. \"Tennessee,\" she said, \"watch out.\"",

We have the identity of the suspect and authorities now say that the SUV was loaded with propane tanks that guards tried to get the driver to stop. And now what they have recovered from that vehicle. ABC's chief global affairs correspondent, Martha Raddatz, leading us off. Reporter: Tonight, an urgent investigation into what may have been an attempted terror attack. That deadly explosion at the Gates of Travis air force base, home to more than 14,000 service members and civilians. Sources telling ABC news investigators have now identified the driver of the vehicle who was killed in the explosion, as hafiz Kasi, aged 51 who they describe as a nomad, and recovered in the charred wreckage, a potential clue, video from Kasi's cellphone. At approximately 7:00 pm Wednesday, the driver slowly approached the check point at the main gate. Ignoring signs from the guards to stop, igniting his vehicle. A flash is seen from inside. The vehicle still moving, quickly engulfed by flames, then crashing onto a median. Investigators now reviewing images posted on an unofficial air force Facebook page. He had something in there, there were some explosives because it was sounding like the fourth of July. The car basically just blew up, like, it was nothing. Reporter: Officials tell ABC news that propane tanks were inside the vehicle. Kasi was pronounced dead at the scene. Tonight, the FBI asking the public for information have about hafiz Kasi. And Martha with us live. Martha, we know that as part of that plea, the FBI is also trying to figure out if anyone else was involved. Reporter: Exactly, David.

                "body": "The two officers involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in Sacramento, California, have been receiving death threats, officials said.\n\nHundreds of outraged demonstrators rallied Thursday to protest the shooting 22-year-old Stephon Clark, who was killed in his grandmother's backyard. Police fired 20 shots at Clark.\n\nLinda Matthew, spokesperson for the Sacramento Police Department, told ABC News the investigation into Clark's death is expected to take two months at least. She would not confirm the names of the two officers involved.\n\nMatthew said while 20 shots were fired, police still do not know how many times Clark was hit by gunfire. She added that additional body camera video from responding officers will be released within the next 30 days.\n\nOn Sunday night, police were responding to reports of a black male breaking into a car and hiding in a backyard, officials said.\n\nWhen the responding officers arrived at the scene, they said Clark advanced toward them with an object in his hand, police said. Initial reports said Clark was armed with a gun and then later a \"toolbar.\"\n\nBut the only object found on Clark was a cellphone, police later said.\n\nPolice released body camera footage from the shooting on Wednesday night as well as thermal-imaging video from a Sacramento Sheriff's Department helicopter, which shows Clark running from a neighbor's yard and onto his grandmother's property.\n\nAfter police are seen running down a driveway after Clark and taking cover at the edge of the building, they yell several times for Clark to stop and show them his hands before several shots are fired.\n\nChopper video shows Clark moving toward the officers before the shooting, but it is unclear whether his arms were extended.\n\nWhen asked if there's any doubt as to whether Clark was in fact the suspect police were looking for, Matthew said police were still investigating.\n\n\"That's still part of the investigation, but there's where our detectives come in, in contacting everyone along that street, all of the neighbors, to find out, you know, what his actions were prior to our officers' arrival,\" she said.\n\nThe crowd at Thursday night's demonstration first went into Sacramento's City Hall, chanting \"Stand up, fight back\" and \"No justice, no peace.\"\n\nThe march then moved to Interstate 5 -- which was shut down as a result -- before protestors formed a human chain to block the entrance to Golden 1 Center, delaying a Sacramento Kings game. The basketball game eventually was played, but with few spectators as the doors to the arena were locked.\n\nBoth officers involved in the shooting are on paid administrative leave.",

Police helicopter video showing Stephen Clark, an unarmed father of two, shot and killed by officers in his grandmother's backyard. Police out in force today. Protesters on the streets of Sacramento blocking streets and bridges. ABC's Marci Gonzalez is there, and we warn you. The images are difficult. Reporter: Outrage tonight simmering in Sacramento over this disturbing bodycam video. You see officers looking for a vandalism suspect, confronting stephon Clark unarmed in his grandparents backyard. And after a brief encounter firing 20 rounds. Show me your hands. Reporter: Tonight, protesters marching to California's capitol building trying to block roadways for a second day. Thursday protesters crowding this arena delaying the start of an NBA game. Tonight, we're learning new details about the officers in that video. One white, one African-American on paid administrative leave tonight and getting death threats as police investigate the shooting. We have to look and see if it was reasonable to believe what they believe, and see what they did. Reporter: There were reports of someone vandalizing several vehicles. Helicopter cameras then begin recording following this man as he hops a fence. Police say officers on the ground then confront 22-year-old stephon Clark. He was a father of two. We don't have confirmation yet, of whether he was the subject breaking into the cars, but hopefully at some point as we gather the facts, we will know that one way or the other. Reporter: Police say they opened fire believing Clark was armed but no weapon was found only this cell phone. And David, the police chief here tells me that bodycam videos from all of the responding officers will be released. And tonight, authorities are urging all of those protesters to be patient and give them time to investigate. David? Marci Gonzalez live tonight. Thank you.",

                "title": "Canelo Alvarez's camp blames suspect meat for positive clenbuterol test",
                "body": "Golovkin and Alvarez are scheduled to meet on May 5 (HBO PPV) at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas in a rematch of their hugely controversial draw from September. It is unclear whether the positive test will affect the fight.\n\nAs part of the deal for the first fight, as well as for the rematch, both boxers agreed to be randomly tested by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association.\n\nAlvarez, who is training in his hometown of Guadalajara, Mexico, provided urine samples on Feb. 17 and Feb. 20, and both tests came back positive for trace amounts of clenbuterol, according to the letter VADA president Dr. Margaret Goodman sent to those involved on Monday that was obtained by ESPN.\n\nClenbuterol has shown up in drug tests for many Mexican athletes in recent years because of meat contamination in the country. Alvarez also said meat contamination caused his positive test.\n\n\"As part of the voluntary testing program that Canelo Alvarez insisted on ahead of his May 5 fight, one of his results came back positive for trace levels of clenbuterol, consistent with meat contamination that has impacted dozens of athletes in Mexico over the last years,\" Golden Boy Promotions, Alvarez's promoter, said in a statement addressing the positive test. \"As Daniel Eichner, director of [the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory], the WADA-accredited lab that conducted the tests stated in his letter [Monday], 'These values are all within the range of what is expected from meat contamination.' Upon receiving this information, Golden Boy immediately notified the Nevada State Athletic Commission and Gennady Golovkin's promoter, Tom Loeffler.\"\n\nIn the letter VADA sent disclosing the positive test, Goodman said she had spoken to Nevada State Athletic Commission executive director Bob Bennett and that \"the current plan is to continue to test Mr. Alvarez so that the Nevada State Athletic Commission can make a final determination. Mr. Alvarez has the right to promptly request analysis of the 'B' samples at his expense.\"\n\nAlvarez usually does the bulk of his training for fights in San Diego, and Golden Boy said he would immediately move his camp there \"and will submit to any number and variety of additional tests that VADA deems necessary ahead of and after May 5.\"\n\nLoeffler was notified of the positive test and said Golovkin (37-0-1, 33 KOs) is also aware of it but that they are waiting to hear more from the Nevada commission before making an assessment.\n\n\"We're not really going to comment until we get more detail from VADA and the commission. We'll reserve comment,\" Loeffler told ESPN. \"But Gennady has always insisted on VADA testing for any of his fights. He punches so hard that [trainer] Abel [Sanchez] wanted nobody to have any doubt about his training program. Gennady feels very strongly about a clean sport and level playing field for both guys. He can't comment on this test specifically, but that's his position. It's premature to say anything more without knowing all of the details.\"\n\nAlvarez said he was embarrassed by the positive test.\n\n\"I am an athlete who respects the sport and this surprises me and bothers me because it had never happened to me,\" Alvarez said in a statement. \"I will submit to all the tests that require me to clarify this embarrassing situation and I trust that at the end the truth will prevail.\"\n\nAccording to Golden Boy Promotions president Eric Gomez, Alvarez (49-1-2, 34 KOs) has undergone random testing administered by VADA or the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for his past 12 fights dating to his 2012 decision win over Shane Mosley.\n\n\"He's been tested many times and never had findings, nothing. And every fight they test him 10, 15 times, at least a dozen times,\" Gomez said. \"This is something Canelo insists on it. We're very confident that everything is going to be fine.\"\n\nBennett told ESPN that the Nevada commission would investigate the situation before ruling on whether the fight would take place.\n\n\"We will do our due diligence, and once it's done, we'll let it be known whether we're going to move forward [with the fight],\" Bennett told ESPN.\n\nThis is not the first time a prominent Mexican fighter has tested positive for clenbuterol in the lead-up to a fight.\n\nIn 2012, Erik Morales blamed contaminated meat for his positive tests ahead of his rematch with then-junior welterweight world champion Danny Garcia in New York. The fight went ahead, and Garcia sent Morales into retirement with a fourth-round knockout.\n\nIn 2016, then-junior lightweight world titleholder Francisco Vargas, also of Mexico, tested positive for clenbuterol during his training camp for a defense against former titleholder and countryman Orlando Salido. The California State Athletic Commission, in consultation with both fighters' camps, allowed the fight to go on because the panel gave Vargas the benefit of the doubt that the bad test was because he ate tainted meat in Mexico.\n\nVargas was, however, subject to much more rigorous random drug testing for the remainder of his camp. The fight went on in Carson, California, and Vargas and Salido battled to a hellacious draw in the 2016 fight of the year.\n\nIn 2016, former Houston Texans left tackle Duane Brown tested positive for clenbuterol. Brown, who now plays for the Seattle Seahawks, was not disciplined, and the drug program's independent administrator sent a letter warning players that consumption of too much meat in Mexico and China could cause a positive test for the anabolic substance.\n\nBennett said that \"naturally there will be increased testing\" for Alvarez and that the case \"appears to be a situation that runs parallel to Mr. Vargas'.\"",

                "body": "The Celtics say All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving is set to have surgery Saturday to alleviate pain in his left knee.\n\nIrving has been out since March 11, missing the last four games. There is no timetable for his return from the \"minimally invasive\" procedure.\n\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens was asked before Boston's game in Portland on Friday night the ramifications of Irving's surgery.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" Stevens said. \"He's going to have it tomorrow and we'll know more about timelines after that.\"\n\nThe knee is the same one that Irving injured in the 2015 NBA finals that required surgery.\n\nIrving is averaging 24.4 points, 5.1 assists and 3.8 rebounds per game. Friday was his 26th birthday.\n\nHe is one of several key sidelined players for Boston, which is at Portland on Friday. He joins Jaylen Brown (concussion protocol), Marcus Smart (thumb surgery), Daniel Theis (knee surgery, out for season) and Gordon Hayward (ankle surgery rehab).\n\nStevens said the team will focus on its strengths in light on the injuries.\n\n\"Do what you do best. That's it,\" he said. \"Everybody's got something they do well otherwise they wouldn't be in the NBA. Don't try to be something you're not, don't try to make up for Kyrie's absence, or Smart's absence, or Tyson's absence by trying to do what they do. Just do you and just be good at it, be reliable at it. That's all we're going to ask.\"\n\nStevens said he had not had a lot of discussion with the front office about adding another player.\n\n\"I think that there is the possibility of applying for an exception again because of all the knee injuries and the length of injuries. I don't know where we are with that, and I haven't talked to them about any particulars.\n\nHe said if the Celtics added anyone it would be to give the team perimeter depth.\n\nThe Celtics are currently in second place in the Eastern Conference, below the first-place Toronto Raptors.\n\nMore NBA basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball",

Foul trouble set in, Mississippi State clamped down defensively and North Carolina State coach Wes Moore was hit with a technical foul as the Bulldogs pulled away.\n\nThe Wolfpack also had no answer for McCowan, whose size presented all kinds of problems. The only junior in a senior-laden starting lineup, she finished 11 of 11 from the field and made both of her foul shots on a night that would have been perfect except for a trio of turnovers.\n\nThe Bulldogs, who lost to South Carolina in last year's title game, looked like they would cruise to the doorstep of another Final Four when they roared to a 17-7 lead in the first quarter.\n\nNorth Carolina State leaned on its defense, and one of the best rebounding margins in the nation, to claw back. Leslie's 3 early in the second quarter gave the Wolfpack a 20-19 advantage.\n\nMississippi State responded with another run, fueled almost entirely by its 6-foot-7 star. McCowan easily grabbed rebounds over the smaller Wolfpack, scored a series of layups and wound up with 16 points on 7-for-7 shooting in the first half, as the Bulldogs took a 36-41 lead into the break.\n\nMississippi State still led 49-37 midway through the third quarter when the Wolfpack's Akela Maize, who had tangled with McCowan all game, picked up her fourth foul.\n\nMoore came unglued and was slapped a technical foul, then continued his diatribe as the officials mostly ignored him. William made two foul shots and Johnson a layup for the four-point trip down floor, and the Bulldogs eventually pushed their lead to 20 points.\n\nThey rolled the rest of the way to the Elite Eight.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNorth Carolina State still has not reached an Elite Eight since 1998, when the Wolfpack advanced to the Final Four in Kansas City. The end of their season likewise means the end for a senior class that helped resurrect a program picked to finish eighth in the ACC this season.\n\nMississippi State needed a big night from McCowan with its backcourt slow to produce. But once the Bulldogs' guards began to contribute, they breezed to their 10th win in the past three tournaments.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Bulldogs, whose only loss this season came to South Carolina in the SEC Tournament, head to the Kansas City regional finals against the Bruins or Longhorns.",

I feel good. I'm excited to get going and ready to feel a little bit of adrenaline.\"\n\nKershaw altered his conditioning program during the offseason.\n\n\"It was never been about conditioning, but about trying to stay healthy,\" he said. \"Everything I've done has been geared about trying to keep my back healthy.\"\n\nA bad back limited Kershaw to 27 starts last season for the NL champions, but the seven-time All-Star still tied for the NL lead with 18 victories.\n\nKershaw will make his eighth consecutive Opening Day start, a franchise record, and will have an extra day of rest.\n\n\"I kind of like this way because you feel like you're still building into the season,\" Kershaw said.",

The Giants lost 98 games and finished last in the National League West.\n\n\"Because of what happened to me last year, how we did last year, the whole combination of things and the group of guys that we've got here this year and the new staff ... the players that they brought in, I'm really excited,\" Bumgarner said prior to his injury. \"I feel like we've got a good chance to compete and win some games this year.\"\n\nThe Giants open their season on the road against the Los Angeles Dodgers on March 29.",

After dropping her son off with a babysitter, the woman says she accompanied Simmons first to his hotel, then a nightclub, and then back to his hotel.\n\nThe lawsuit then claims Simmons lured the woman into his room by saying he wasn't interested in her sexually since he was dating a famous model at the time. However, once inside the room, the woman claims Simmons announced his intention to have sex with her, and that he also threatened her son. He then allegedly sexually assaulted her.\n\nSimmons responded to the lawsuit in a statement obtained by ABC News.\n\n\"I vehemently deny all the allegations made against me,\" he said. \"They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women.\"\n\n\"I have submitted myself to multiple lie detector tests...I also answered no to the question, 'Have you ever physically forced any woman to have sexual intercourse?' I passed all of the lie detector tests,\" he continued.\n\nAs previously reported, at least nine women have accused Simmons of sexual misconduct; he's denied any wrongdoing. He's also stepped away from his companies in order to \"commit [him]self to personal growth, spiritual learning and, above all, to listening.\"",

                "title": "Zinke supports restoration of grizzlies in North Cascades",
                "body": "The federal government intends to restore grizzly bears in the remote North Cascade Mountains of Washington state, a goal that represents \"the American conservation ethic come to life,\" Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Friday.\n\nZinke made the announcement during a visit to North Cascades National Park's headquarters in Sedro-Woolley, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) north of Seattle.\n\nThe Department of the Interior announced in 2014 that it would consider relocating grizzlies to aid their recovery in the Cascades. An environmental review has been underway, but in recent months there have been questions about whether it would continue. Zinke made clear it would, with a formal decision expected by the end of the year.\n\n\"Restoring the grizzly bear to the North Cascades Ecosystem is the American conservation ethic come to life,\" Zinke said in a news release. \"The loss of the grizzly bear in the North Cascades would disturb the ecosystem and rob the region of an icon.\"\n\nNumerous grizzlies roamed north-central Washington state in the past, but early settlers and trappers killed thousands for fur in the mid-19th to early 20th century. The region's booming population has also encroached on their habitat, and few have been seen in recent decades.\n\nThe last confirmed sighting of a grizzly in Washington's North Cascades was by a hiker in 2010. Experts say there may only be about 10 grizzlies in the North Cascades in Washington state, but there is also a population in the mountain range north of the Canadian border.\n\nOptions being considered include capturing bears from other locations, including British Columbia and Montana, and releasing them in nearly 10,000 square miles (26,000 square kilometers) of rugged backcountry. Two of the alternatives envision a goal of about 200 bears within 60 to 100 years with smaller initial releases, while a third option would aim to restore 200 animals in 25 years.\n\nA small number of grizzlies live in the Selkirk Mountains of northeastern Washington state, and the bruins have seen big comebacks in other parts of the West, including around Glacier National Park.\n\nLast year, Zinke announced that officials were lifting Endangered Species Act protections for about 700 grizzlies around Yellowstone National Park, opening the door to potential hunting in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. That decision is being challenged in court by conservation groups and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe.\n\nConservationists and Indian tribes have long pressed for the government to do more to bring the feared and revered animals back in the Cascades, saying it represents true wildness, and they praised Zinke's \"encouraging words of support.\"\n\nZinke has been under fire from conservationists because he has supported drastically reducing the size of some national monuments in the West, including Bears Ears in Utah. But dozens of demonstrators outside his appearance Friday cheered the news that he supported restoring grizzlies, the Skagit Valley Herald newspaper reported .\n\n\"We have never lost hope that the restoration of this American wildlife icon would proceed because the people of Washington have repeatedly demonstrated their overwhelming support for it,\" Joe Scott, international programs director for Seattle-based Conservation Northwest, said in a written statement. \"People recognize that we've forced the grizzly into a small fraction of its former range in four states, including Washington, and that we have a rare opportunity to right that wrong in some small way -- and to complete one of the missing chapters of the grizzly bear recovery story.\"\n\nThe ranching industry was far less enthused.\n\n\"Reintroducing as many as 200 man-eating predators into an area already reeling from exploding gray wolf populations is anything but neighborly,\" said a statement from Ethan Lane, federal lands executive director with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. \"This decision won't just impact ranchers -- it's a blow for the entire North Cascades ecosystem, the safety of locals and visitors, and the local economy, too.\"",

Just 24 hours after the white house said he would sign the spending bill to keep the government open, suddenly, he was threatening a veto, and this all comes as his top lawyer in the investigation quits. He now hires his third national security adviser. Here's ABC's chief white house correspondent, Jonathan Karl today. Reporter: Today, the president upended the political world with an early morning tweet. Lashing out against the massive spending bill congress just passed, the president declared, \"I am considering a veto.\" But wait, just yesterday, the president's top aides said he was fully onboard. Is the president going to sign the bill? The answer is yes. Reporter: What happened? For one, the president's favorite morning show hammered the bill saying it doesn't pay for trump's border wall. This is a swamp budget. This is a Mitch Mcconnell special, but there is no wall. Reporter: Soon after that, the president's veto threat and then an all-out scramble to stop him, including an early morning call from speaker Paul Ryan and a white house visit by defense secretary James Mattis who argued the military would be hurt badly if the bill went down. Finally, the president relented. I will say to congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Reporter: The episode capped another week of chaos in the west wing including the president's Twitter announcement he's picked John Bolton as his third national security adviser. His first was Michael Flynn who was fired for lying about his contacts with the Russians, and then replaced by H.R. Mcmaster. He's a man of tremendous talent. Reporter: Bolton himself seemed caught off guard. Your reaction to your new job. Well, I think I still am a Fox News contributor. No, you're not apparently. I didn't -- well, I haven't started there yet. I didn't really expect that announcement this afternoon. But it's obviously a great honor. Reporter: The arrival of Bolton, a former ambassador to the united nations under George W. Bush, puts a hard line conservative on the president's team just as he prepares to meet with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Question. How do you know that the north Korean regime is lying? Answer, their lips are moving. Reporter: He recently wrote that it would be \"Perfectly legitimate\" for the U.S. To respond to North Korea's nuclear build up by striking first. By striking first. Jon Karl with us live tonight from the white house. And Jon, president trump is ho hoping to meet with Kim Jong-un by the end of may, and Bolton is on record with what he thinks should happen in that meeting. Reporter: He thinks the president should go into the meeting and tell Kim Jong-un, simply, tell me you have bun total de-nuclearization because we're not going to have negotiations. You can tell me that right now or we will start thinking of something else. So David, if he takes the advice of his new national security adviser, it could be a very short meeting with Kim Jong-un. Jon Karl at the white house. Jon, thanks.",

A former \"Playboy\" model on her alleged ten-month affair with Donald Trump, and what she said about Melania trump. Here's ABC's Lindsey Davis. Reporter: Tonight, president trump boarding marine one alone. The first lady scheduled to be at his side but Melania trump was absent. Earlier, she was all smiles at the state department, presenting women of courage awards. Courage is the quality most needed in this world, yet it is often the hardest to find. Reporter: It comes less than 24 hours after that tell-all interview with a woman claiming to be the president's former mistress. There were real feelings between the two of us. Not just myself. Not just him. There was a real relationship there. Reporter: Still, former playboy model Karen Mcdougal tells CNN the first time she had sex with Donald Trump, he tried to pay her. Did he actually try to hand you money? He did. He did. I looked at him and said, \"That's not me. I'm not that kind of girl.\" And he looked at me and said, \"Oh.\" And he said, \"You're really special.\" Reporter: She says the moment blossomed into a ten-month romance in 2006. The same year Barron trump was born. Did Donald Trump ever say to you that he loved you? All the time. He always told me he loved me. Yes. Of course. Reporter: Mcdougal says she thought trump might marry her. She claims he once even brought her to trump tower. We passed a room, and he said, \"This is Melania's room. She likes to have her alone time or to get away to read or something like that.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay.\" That's when I kind of thought maybe they're having issues. I didn't ask. Reporter: Now, she is apologizing to the first lady. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I wouldn't want it done to me. I'm sorry. Reporter: Just before the election, Mcdougal's story was bought by American media incorporated, which publishes \"The national enquirer\" and is owned by a close friend of the president's. They told her it would never be published, a practice known as \"Catch and kill.\" She's now suing, claiming she was tricked into staying silent. Ami tells ABC news \"The suggestion that Ami \"Silenced\" Mcdougal is completely without merit.\" At the end of the presidential campaign, trump's then-spokeswoman hope hicks called the claims about trump totally untrue. Lindsey with us. You mentioned catch and kill. That's the practice where a tabloid will purchase a story to kill it and never publish it. It seems the strength of these agreements is being tested right now. Reporter: We're seeing more Ander many of np we are, David. Both Mcdougle and Daniels are threatening to sue. We're going to hear Daniels' story this weekend. Her attorney tweeted out a picture of a cryptic DVD saying, if a picture is worth 1,000 words, what does a video say? This is going to back up her story.",

I'm sorry for busting her bracket. I don't care how far you break my bracket as long as you have broken it. You have to go a little more now. Reporter: Thiweek we asked her about her divine intervention. It's David Muir. I'm curious what you say to the team. We see them kissing and hugging you. What do you say that could help them out, and all of us honestly? I say sometimes there is a little more than talking to god in the prayer, but I do begin with good and gracious god. I pray for the other team, perhaps not as hard. Reporter: It certainly worked. Another victory last night. The university of Michigan. Right behind number 13 there, the guy in the suit, Austin hatch and what a story. He got a scholarship to play, but then tragedy. Injured in a plane crash. That crash took the lives of his father and his stepmother. Unbelievably, eight years earlier, in another crash. It was in that crash he lost his mother and two siblings. I think god had his hand on me. Reporter: Austin now a manager for the team, his fiancee walking onto the court with him. The team following in spirit and strength. Across the country, we all have our teams. Does Syracuse play at 9:37 tonight? Reporter: Syracuse is taking on duke. Thankfully, not sister Jean. Thank you for watching. In the mornings and evenings this week, time to go watch some basketball. I hope to see you on Monday.",

                "body": "Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's former campaign chairman and then chief strategist to the president, maintains he did not know about Cambridge Analytica's alleged misuse of Facebook user data in Trump's 2016 campaign, despite serving as the data firm's vice president prior to joining the campaign.\n\n\"I didn't even know about the Facebook mining,\" Bannon told a group of media and technology executives Thursday at a New York symposium hosted by The Financial Times newspaper. \"That's an issue between Cambridge (Analytica), the professor\" - referring to Aleksandr Kogan - \"and Facebook.\"\n\nKogan, a Cambridge University researcher, collected information on millions of Americans through a Facebook app he says he originally created for research purposes but ultimately gave the data to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nBannon, along with GOP mega-donor Robert Mercer, helped expand the data analytics firm. The former Breitbart chief's role in Cambridge Analytica's operations came under the microscope after Facebook suspended the data firm for allegedly breaching millions of user profiles.\n\nCambridge Analytica has said it deleted all the Facebook data and related information in cooperation with the social media company, and that such information was never used as part of the data firm's work with the Trump presidential campaign. The data firm has said it was unaware the data was improperly obtained by a third party and that is was destroyed as soon as they were made aware.\n\nDeflecting attention away from himself and Cambridge Analytica, Bannon took aim at Facebook, accusing the social media giant of abusing its users' data for financial gain.\n\n\"They take your stuff for free,\" Bannon said of Facebook. \"They sell it and monetize it for huge margins. That's why the companies trade for such high valuations.\"\n\n\"The point is, that is Facebook's business.\"\n\nBannon then directed his ire at a familiar foe, the news media, for ignoring President Barack Obama's social media targeting in his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.\n\n\"The great opposition party - the media - never went after the Obama campaign,\" Bannon said, \"and in 2013, when I thought a data company might be important, it all of a sudden becomes global news.\"\n\nAfter his appearance on stage, Bannon was asked by CNN whether he was aware that Cambridge Analytica had acquired Facebook user data.\n\n\"I don't remember buying it, Bannon said. \"That was the Cambridge guy,\" again referring to Kogan.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on Bannon's accusations.",

                "title": "Loyola to test Kansas State's strong D in regional final",
                "body": "Kansas State has been an afterthought through the NCAA Tournament -- until now.\n\nEven in the South Region, where the top four seeds were bounced out on the first weekend -- a first for the NCAA Tournament -- no one was really talking about these Wildcats.\n\nThere were those other Wildcats from Kentucky, which Kansas State sent home; the comeback kids from Nevada and of course the feel-good story of the tournament, Loyola-Chicago.\n\n\"We played with a chip on our shoulder throughout the whole season, just trying to prove people wrong,\" said Kansas State guard Kamau Stokes. \"And I feel like we're showing them.\"\n\nThe ninth-seeded Wildcats are indeed making a point. And so is their opponent Saturday night, No. 11 Loyola.\n\nIt is an unlikely pairing to play for a Final Four berth.\n\nNo. 9 vs. No. 11 in the Elite Eight, another NCAA Tournament first.\n\nBut then again, perhaps Kansas State's path to the regional final should not be seen as a surprise. The Wildcats have brought back-alley toughness to the Elite Eight. They don't back down.\n\nThey are winning with consistently strong defense that is proving to be the equalizer against higher seeds.\n\n\"I don't feel like anyone should pay attention to seeds because they are just opinions, you know? Opinions,\" Stokes said. \"The Top 25 is all opinions and then of course you have to win to get to this tournament. So, once you get here, it's like seeds don't matter at this point.\"\n\nKansas State's opponents can't win if they can't score, and the Wildcats (25-11) have held seven straight teams below 59 points. The latest demonstration of Kansas State's defensive prowess came in Thursday night's 61-58 win over Kentucky, which was held to a season scoring low.\n\nAsked on Friday to define Kansas State basketball, junior Barry Brown said \"First off, it's defending. We take a lot of pride on defense.\"\n\nCoach Bruce Weber said \"there's no doubt\" Brown is the team's defensive catalyst.\n\n\"When he was a freshman, I said, who's going to be our defensive stopper, and he's very stubborn,\" said Weber of Brown. \"He's a little bit confident, overconfident, but he said 'I am going to be, coach.' ... He's been the leader. Xavier (Sneed) has really taken some pride as the season has gone on in being a stopper. We've convinced him of that. And then the other guys just have kind of bought into it.\"\n\nLoyola (31-5) has won its three NCAA Tournament games by a combined four points.\n\nIn each NCAA win the Ramblers found a different player to deliver the big shot in the closing seconds. In Thursday night's 69-68 win over Nevada, only 6.3 seconds remained in the game when Marques Townes barely beat the shot clock with his crucial 3-pointer.\n\nLoyola's 13-game winning streak, the longest active streak in the nation, has left the Ramblers one win away from only the second Final Four appearance in school history. The 1963 team won the national championship.\n\nKansas State will play for its first Final Four berth since 1964.\n\nHere are some more things to know about the Loyola-Kansas State regional final.\n\nLONG-AWAITED REVENGE: Former Kansas State player Ernie Barrett, who played on the team that lost to Kentucky in the 1951 national championship game, hugged players in the locker room following Thursday night's game.\n\nKansas State had been 0-9 against Kentucky before the regional semifinal. Barrett, 88, had to wait a long time to see his Wildcats finally beat Kentucky.\n\n\"It means a lot to us and this program, to the K-State history,\" Brown said Friday. \"He's been to a lot of our practices just to be there and see the hard work that we put in. ... We just wanted to go out there and just do it for him. And once we got it done, I knew he was so proud, was so happy ... just hugging everyone.\"\n\nMVC, TAKE A BOW: Loyola coach Porter Moser said his team's success in the tournament should bring more respect to the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of parity in the game, and I love it for our league,\" Moser said. \"There was a lot of talk that we weren't going to get in if we didn't win the tournament, and we know in the Missouri Valley how good a league it is from top to bottom.\"\n\nRESPECT FOR LOYOLA: Weber has tried to make sure his players respect Loyola, even if they may not know much about the team or its history.\n\n\"I told the guys, you can't look at the name, you can't look at the league,\" Weber said. \"You've got to look at the team. They're a good team, and I mentioned they beat Florida at Florida earlier in the year, they beat Tennessee who won the SEC; they beat Miami out of the ACC. So they've got to be pretty good, and whatever they've done here as of late, they're hot.\"\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org; https://twitter.com/AP -- Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events",

                "body": "WATCH Trump's lawyer calls for Rosenstein to end Russia probe\n\nFrom a 1973 encounter with the Department of Justice over his claims of housing discrimination to the recent battles over Trump University and alleged efforts by his attorney to silence a porn star, President Donald Trump is no stranger to the American legal system.\n\nNow, the newest additions to Trump's legal team may not be a done deal, with Trump's lawyers citing \"ongoing process of conflict review\" referring to other clients Joe diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing have had or currently represent.\n\nTrump, his companies and members of his family have been involved in thousands of lawsuits over decades and he has personally given dozens of depositions. His history of unorthodox legal strategies and friction with his some of his own lawyers offer clues about his chaotic effort to fend off Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nIn less than one year, he has faced two shake-ups of the legal team defending him in the special counsel's probe. Trump's longtime personal attorney Marc Kasowitz, whom he had retained as his lead lawyer to represent him in all matters related to the Russia investigation, was pushed from that role. While he remains on the legal team; he is no longer the lead lawyer.\n\nKasowitz was replaced by John Dowd, who abruptly resigned on Thursday.\n\nAnd last week Trump retained diGenova, famous for his fierce defenses of the president on cable television and his insistence that Obama-loyalist factions within the FBI and DOJ are biased against the president. DiGenova and Toensing are veterans in the Washington legal scene.\n\nSources close to Dowd tell ABC News that he resigned in large part because President Trump was increasingly ignoring his legal advice over the last several months. There's also growing friction with White House counsel Ty Cobb. Trump has discussed with the closest advisers potentially firing Cobb, the White House lawyer responsible for Russia matters, but has privately assured him his job is safe, sources say.\n\nWhile some of Trump's past lawyers have described their client as compliant and easy to work with, sources close to those currently representing the president have described a compulsive side of him that at times can be difficult to manage, say sources with direct knowledge.\n\nJay Goldberg, who represented Trump personally from 1990 to 2005, recalled to ABC News a client who was at the time \"very easy to control\" and \"very careful in his answers and followed direction all the time.\" He insisted Trump is a very different client than how he appears on television.\n\n\"People think he shoots from the hip and sometimes he is too lippy,\" Goldberg said of the president. \"But behind it is a very organized person who knows what he's doing.\"\n\nMichael Wildes, the managing partner at Wildes & Weinberg PC, represented the Trump Organization on immigration matters for more than a decade, as well as Trump Models, the Miss Universe Organization and Melania Trump and her family. He told ABC News that \"as a proud Democrat\" he profoundly disagrees with Trump on policy matters, but his experience representing him was generally positive.\n\nTrump has the ability to \"aptly cut through legal issues, to break things down to rudimentary elements, in matters that often got complicated. And he has a quick wit to boot,\" Wildes said. \"The people I dealt with in his inner circle were all highly talented, responsible and professional,\" Wildes said about his working relationships that predate Trump's presidency.\n\nThere's no question Trump is a demanding client, who expects only the best results from his lawyers.\n\nGoldberg recalls the often-used phrase from Trump: \"Don't tell me that it can't be done,\" Trump would say. \"Your job is to tell me how it can be done. You get it?\"\n\nLegal experts have been alarmed by what they consider questionable behavior in connection with some of the cases he has faced such as when he repeatedly blasted Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who presided over a case against the now-defunct Trump University.\n\n\"Everybody says it, but I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater. His name is Gonzalo Curiel and he is not doing the right thing,\" Trump said at a 2016 campaign rally. \"So what happens is, the judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great; I think that's fine. You know what? I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald trump when I give all these jobs, OK? I think Judge Curiel should be ashamed of himself.\"\n\nAnd his lawyers are facing a range of legal challenges with a client who makes no secrets of how he wishes to handle them.\n\nHe's given contradictory messages about the standing of those currently representing him, tweeting just days ago that reporting he was going to add another lawyer to his legal team was \"wrong\" insisting he is \"VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow.\"\n\nSince that tweet just twelve days ago, Dowd has resigned and Trump hired diGenova.\n\nHe tweets frequently about the special counsel probe, even as his lawyers and close advisers have strongly advised against it. That came to a head this week when Trump for the first time called out Robert Mueller by name -- attacking his investigation and the political leanings of the team he has assembled.\n\nAccording to sources Dowd had been at odds with Trump for months over the whether President Trump would meet with members of Mueller's team for an interview and had advised the president against it. Immediately following Dowd's resignation on Thursday, Trump declared: \"I would like to. I would like to,\" when asked if he would like to answer questions from the special counsel.\n\nGoldberg -- who believes the ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign's possible contacts with Russia should end -- says he still speaks to the president regularly.\n\nHe says he received a phone call from the president a recent Saturday morning and advised the president that it would be a mistake to sit for an interview with the special counsel.\n\nAdvisers also fear the president could contradict himself during a potential wide-ranging interview with Mueller, sources have told ABC News.\n\nWith John Dowd gone, it's unknown who will take the lead on negotiating a potential interview with Mueller's team, but one thing is clear -- the president says he still wants to speak with him.",

                "body": "The Latest on the NCAA Tournament (all times Eastern):\n\n7:15 p.m.\n\nThe CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Nebraska, looks like Allen Fieldhouse North as top-seeded Kansas faces fifth-seeded Clemson in the Midwest Region semifinals.\n\nThe upper and lower bowls of the 17,500-seat arena are mostly blue. One section of the lower bowl is filled with fans in the orange of Clemson.\n\nOmaha is a 3 1/2-hour drive from the Jayhawks' campus in Lawrence, Kansas.\n\nThe Clemson-Kansas winner will go to the Elite Eight and face the winner of Friday night's second Midwest semifinal between No. 2 seed Duke and 11th-seeded Syracuse.\n\nKansas had an 11-6 lead with 14:45 left in the first quarter.\n\n-- Eric Olson reporting from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n6:55 p.m.\n\nThe NCAA has tweaked its interpretation of a rule that allows padding to cover braces worn on the elbow, wrist or forearm.\n\nThe change could allow Purdue center Isaac Haas to play in Friday night's Sweet 16 matchup with Texas Tech, though it still remains a long shot. The star center has been sidelined since he fractured his right elbow in the Boilermakers' first-round NCAA Tournament win.\n\nAn initial version of a protective brace for Haas was ruled ineligible for the NCAAs because of a rigid metal component that it felt was a safety hazard to other players. Graduate engineering students at Purdue constructed a softer version using carbon fiber and shipped it to Haas on Tuesday.\n\nBut one of Purdue coach Matt Painter's markers for considering whether Haas would be able to play was if he could rebound using both hands and be able to shoot with it as well. Haas practiced Thursday, but displayed very limited mobility in the injured elbow, keeping it mostly at a 90-degree angle during the workout.\n\nHe performed a right-handed layup, but never attempted a jump shot during the 15-minute portion open to the media.\n\n-- Kyle Hightower, reporting from Boston\n\n6:30 p.m.\n\nMove over underdog darlings: It's time for some of college basketball's blue bloods to take the stage in the Sweet 16.\n\nVillanova, Kansas, Duke and Syracuse all tip off their regional semifinal games Friday night. All four schools have national titles.\n\nThe action tips off with Clemson taking on Kansas in the Midwest. Four teams will join West finalists Florida State and Michigan, and East finalists Kansas State and Loyola-Chicago to round out the Elite Eight.\n\nPower names in action means Friday night might actually be good for some wins for your long-busted bracket (if you haven't given up on it just yet).\n\nUnlike the South region, where one-tenth of 1 percent of ESPN bracketeers correctly selected Loyola-Chicago and Kansas State to make it this far, teams like Purdue, Villanova and Kansas are highly popular picks to reach the regional final.\n\n6 p.m.\n\nThe second half of the Sweet 16 is rife with compelling matchups.\n\nVillanova's Jalen Brunson vs. West Virginia's Jevon Carter. Duke's athletes trying to solve Syracuse's zone. The athleticism of Kansas and Clemson.\n\nShould make for some more drama in the NCAA Tournament on Friday night.\n\nThe marquee matchup comes in the East Region Friday in Boston, where Villanova, one of two No. 1 seeds remaining, faces the team nicknamed Press Virginia.\n\nThe Wildcats have been on a tear, making 31 combined 3-pointers in lopsided opening NCAA Tournament wins over Radford and Alabama. Villanova (32-4) has been even better on defense, holding its first two opponents to 37 percent shooting and less than 60 points per game.\n\nWest Virginia (26-10) is known for its defense, but rode its hot-shooting offense into the Sweet 16 for the third time in four years.\n\nSyracuse (23-13) faces its toughest test yet against the Blue Devils (28-7) in Omaha. Duke has a superb inside-out game with super frosh Marvin Bagley III in the middle and is averaging 85 points per game in the tournament.\n\nPurdue's 7-foot-2 standout Isaac Haas is hoping to get in the game against Texas Tech, thanks to an arm brace quickly engineered by grad students in hopes of meeting NCAA safety standards.\n\nAnd Kansas (29-7), the top seed in the Midwest, faces fifth-seeded Clemson (25-9) on a roll after a 31-point rout of Auburn.\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP -- Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events",

                "body": "Marion \"Suge\" Knight lost another defense lawyer -- his 15th -- on Friday and the three-year wait for his murder trial to start will grow even longer.\n\nJudge Ronald S. Coen released attorney Dominique Banos, citing a conflict of interest.\n\nBanos said outside court that she had told the judge she believes she is a target in the witness-tampering investigation that led to the indictment and removal of two of Knight's lawyers. She denied any wrongdoing and said she regretted leaving a case she felt was winnable.\n\nThe moment Coen finished announcing the dismissal, Knight launched into an animated, minutes-long monologue denouncing prosecutors and jail officials, saying their investigations and the limitations put on his visitors and phone calls have forced him to blow through attorneys and settle for bad ones.\n\n\"All this stuff's a way-out, crazy situation,\" said Knight, 52, as he sat in court in an orange jail jumpsuit and chains. \"I should be able to spend my money the way I want it.\"\n\n\"These attorneys,\" Knight went on, getting angrier, \"nobody in the world would use these attorneys for a jaywalking ticket!\"\n\nCoen, who has warned Knight to let his attorneys do the talking in court, finally intervened and said, \"You need to take a deep breath, Mr. Knight.\"\n\nThe judge appointed a 16th attorney, Robert DeBlanc, who Knight reluctantly accepted on an interim basis. Knight said he has already privately hired yet another lawyer, without giving his name.\n\nThe Death Row Records co-founder has pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder for running over two men outside a Compton burger stand in 2015.\n\nBanos was also released as Knight's attorney in a hearing that immediately followed on an unrelated robbery case where he has also struggled to keep attorneys.\n\n\"This must feel like deja vu,\" said Judge Craig Richman.\n\n\"It does,\" Knight said with a laugh. \"It does.\"\n\nFollow Andrew Dalton on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton .",

                "title": "Trump administration moves to try and effectively ban bump stocks",
                "body": "President Donald Trump tweeted Friday that his administration will ban bump stocks devices that \"turn legal weapons into illegal machines\" and blamed former President Barack Obama for allowing them in the first place.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions in a statement on Friday announced the Department of Justice has begun the process to amend federal firearms regulations to clarify that bump stocks should fall under the technical definition of \"machinegun\" under federal law. Such devices \"allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger\".\n\nThe announcement comes a month after the president directed the agency to work on a ban in the wake of a deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nBump stocks came under intense scrutiny after it was learned they were used in the Las Vegas mass shooting last year that left 58 people and hundreds of others injured.\n\nThe legal firearm attachments are designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to mimic the actions of a rapid-fire, fully-automatic weapon.\n\nIn 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms determined that it could not regulate bump stocks unless Congress changed the laws. Critics of the president's new push think any effort to reverse that ruling will be challenged in court.\n\nSen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif, who has proposed legislation to ban bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles, has said she believes a legal challenge would ultimately be successful.\n\n\"The ATF currently lacks authority under the law to ban bump stocks,\" Feinstein wrote in February 20 statement.\n\n\"If ATF tries to ban these devices after admitting repeatedly that it lacks the authority to do so, that process could be tied up in court for years, and that would mean bump stocks would continue to be sold.\"\n\n\"Legislation is the only answer,\" she said.\n\nThe actions taken Friday by the Justice Department effectively open a rule change for public debate.\n\nFollowing the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida last month, National Rifle Association spokesman Dana Loesch told ABC's This Week that the organization doesn't support a bump stock ban.\n\n\"The NRA doesn't back any ban, the NRA has asked the ATF to do its job and make sure that these classifications are consistent,\" Loesch told ABC's George Stephanopolous.\n\nSessions said the Justice Department will begin a public comment period on a proposed rule \"that would define 'machinegun' to include bump stock-type devices under federal law -- effectively banning them.\"",

                "title": "Mozilla, Tesla, other businesses take a Facebook pause",
                "body": "Mozilla, Tesla and other companies are distancing themselves from Facebook following revelations of a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nWhile the actions will not likely be permanent and won't have much of an effect on Facebook's bottom line, they're the latest fallout the social-media giant has to contend with from the ever-spiraling scandal -- along with a tumbling stock price and a #deletefacebook movement.\n\n\"We're taking a break from Facebook,\" Mozilla said in a blog post on Wednesday. The company, which created the Firefox web browser, said it is \"pressing pause\" on its Facebook advertising and won't be posting on its Facebook page. But it did not delete its page and said it will consider returning if Facebook takes stronger actions to protect users' data and improves privacy settings.\n\nGerman bank Commerzbank also said it was putting Facebook advertising \"on hold\" as it evaluates data security. And Sonos, which makes speakers and other electronics, said it is pulling advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Twitter for a week.\n\nElon Musk, meanwhile, made waves, saying in a Twitter exchange that he would take down the Facebook sites for his companies Tesla and SpaceX. As of Thursday afternoon, the sites appeared to be inactive. Tesla and SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile the actions are likely temporary, they're one more piece of the growing headache for Facebook since news of the leak broke a week ago. It has faced criticism because CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg did not speak out until five days after the story broke. The company's stock price shed 14 percent of its value this week. And the grumblings by users, and now, businesses shows no sign of abating.\n\n\"The Cambridge Analytica scandal, like many recent headlines coming out of Silicon Valley, raises questions about whether Big Tech is doing enough to balance its own interests with one of its biggest responsibilities: safeguarding your privacy,\" Sonos wrote in a blog post.\n\nBut Facebook downplayed the actions by the businesses.\n\n\"Most of the businesses we've spoken with this week are pleased with the steps we've outlined to better protect people's data, and they have confidence that we'll respond to these challenges and become a better partner and company as a result,\" the company said in a statement when asked about the advertiser defection.\n\nThe fact is, most advertisers need Facebook as a platform because its reach is so great, so any break is likely to only be temporary, said Allen Adamson, founder of brand-marketing consultancy Metaforce.\n\n\"Companies can take a short-term hiatus to get some positive spin in the market, but there's no other alternative for digital marketing today,\" he said. \"If you don't use Facebook, the other options are not great.\"",

                "title": "Oregon attorney general considers investigating Facebook",
                "body": "Oregon's attorney general said Friday she is reviewing whether to launch an investigation of Facebook, including whether it violated a state law that protects online customers' private information.\n\nAttorney General Ellen Rosenblum told The Associated Press that she and several other state attorneys general are drafting a letter to Facebook, asking about a leak of Facebook customers' data without their knowledge or consent.\n\n\"We're just full of unanswered questions at this point, and whether or not it's going to blossom into a full-scale investigation is still somewhat up for grabs,\" Rosenblum said in a telephone interview late Thursday.\n\nCambridge Analytica, a data mining firm that worked for Donald Trump's campaign, is accused of lifting data from some 50 million Facebook users to influence voters.\n\nFormer Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie says the firm sought Facebook information to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate. It amassed the database quickly with the help of academic Aleksander Kogan, who developed a Facebook app called \"This is Your Digital Life\" that appeared to be a personality test, Wylie said.\n\nThat app vacuumed up information from users who gave the app permission to access their accounts -- as well as additional data from tens of millions of their Facebook friends.\n\nCambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing\n\nKogan said he has been scapegoated by Cambridge and Facebook. He says the data firm approached him for the project and assured him that everything he did was legal.\n\nRosenblum credited Will Castleberry, a Facebook vice president for state and local public policy, for reaching out to her on Thursday, but added that tough questions need to be answered.\n\nShe said questions being prepared for the letter include how did Facebook monitor what the developers did with the data and did Facebook have protective safeguards, including audits, to ensure developers were not misusing Facebook user data.\n\n\"They've known about this for years and they didn't notify any of their users, which really concerns me,\" Rosenblum said. \"What we're trying to do is figure out ... how to keep this from happening in the future.\"\n\nIn an email to AP on Friday, Castleberry said: \"We appreciate Attorney General Rosenblum's interest and will be in touch with her office as we continue our review of the situation.\"\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized Wednesday during a CNN interview but stopped short of endorsing broad privacy legislation. Facebook's No. 2 executive Sheryl Sandberg said in an interview on CNBC Thursday that the incident was a \"huge breach of trust.\" She said she was sorry the company let so many people down.\n\nRosenblum said her office is looking at whether misuse of Facebook users' data violated a new Oregon law that makes it an unlawful trade practice for a business to collect, use or dispose of a consumer's information in a manner inconsistent with the business's own privacy policy as published on its website.\n\nRosenblum, who had championed the bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the Legislature last year, said Oregon is among the first states, if not the first, to pass such a law. She noted that much of the activity under scrutiny took place before the law took effect, on Jan. 1, but was confident that it would cover continued misuse of data.\n\n\"Facebook is just an unbelievably big platform,\" Rosenblum told AP. \"They have many opportunities to influence people ... and that's why it's so important for them at the front end to be properly monitoring the developers who take advantage of -- and have access to -- the data of the users.\"\n\nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky",

                "title": "Sympathy for white Austin bomber stirs debate about race",
                "body": "WATCH Austin bombing suspect was 'quiet,' 'very intelligent' as a kid, neighbors say\n\nWhen a law enforcement official described a cellphone recording left by the Austin serial bomber as \"the outcry of a very challenged young man,\" the remark caused an outcry of its own.\n\nBecause the bomber was white, some people almost immediately questioned whether the same level of compassion would have been afforded a person of color.\n\n\"Here you have a case of a young white male who killed and injured people of color, and we're culturally more concerned about his story, about his life, about what led him to take these lives,\" said David Leonard, professor in the department of critical culture, gender and race studies at Washington State University. \"It's a striking reminder of a racial empathy gap that persists.\"\n\nFor many observers and activists, the comments about Mark Anthony Conditt were just the latest example in which a white suspect seemed to receive an injection of humanity that is less often extended to blacks, Muslims and others.\n\nConditt kept the Texas capital in a state of fear for weeks, planting five bombs that killed two people and badly wounded four others. The 23-year-old community college dropout died Wednesday after setting off a bomb inside his SUV as police were about to arrest him.\n\nInvestigators said his motive was still unclear, despite the discovery of the 25-minute cellphone recording in which he talked about the bombs.\n\nAuthorities have avoided calling the attacks terrorism, which can have specific definitions in law enforcement contexts. U.S. law defines a terrorist as having ties to a foreign entity, such as the Islamic State or other known terror groups. Homegrown extremist groups such as neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan are not labeled that way, even if they employ similar tactics of violence and intimidation.\n\nSimilarly, when Stephen Craig Paddock was identified as the gunman who rained bullets down on a Las Vegas concert last fall, the white retired accountant was characterized as a \"lone wolf.\" That label has also been attached to other mass killers who acted alone, including Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooter James Holmes, a white man who killed a dozen people in 2012.\n\nOn the recording, Conditt \"does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate,\" Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said. \"But instead, it is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.\"\n\nThe reaction on social media was swift.\n\n\"Remember how they talked about innocent black children\" like Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice or Freddie Gray, tweeted Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\n\"I believe passionately in acknowledging the humanity of those who commit even terrible crimes. Reading this police chief's empathy for this young white man highlights the awfulness -- the plain awfulness -- of the persistent refusal to extend this empathy to young black people,\" Ifill added.\n\nThose young black males were described as \"thugs\" by some authorities and in popular discourse. Another case often cited is that of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old fatally shot by a white officer in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. The New York Times described Brown as \"no angel\" in a profile, a phrase that drew an angry response from readers and was criticized by its own public editor.\n\nBrown got into a scuffle with then-officer Darren Wilson after Wilson yelled at Brown and a friend to get out of the street where they were walking. Wilson said that when he shot Brown, the teen was moving menacingly toward him. Some witnesses said Brown was surrendering.\n\nThe initial unrest erupted after Brown's body lay in the street for hours in the summer heat.

Protesters gathered outside the Golden 1 Center where the Kings were set to play against the Atlanta Hawks, causing a lengthy delay to the start of a scheduled game.\n\nDuring the protests, authorities decided to close the entrance to the arena, preventing many ticketed fans from getting in for the game.\n\nThe Kings beat the Hawks 105-90, and team owner Vivek Ranadive addressed the sparse crowd afterward in the nearly empty arena.\n\n\"Good evening. Good evening all. Thank you for your patience tonight,\" Ranadive began. \"On Sunday, we had a horrific, horrific tragedy in our community. And on behalf of the players, the executives, ownership and the entire Kings family, I first of all wanted to express our deepest sympathies to the family.\"\n\nHe continued, \"What happened was absolutely horrific, and we are so very sorry -- we're so very sorry for your loss. I also wanted to say that we at the Kings recognize your people's ability to protest peacefully and we respect that. We here at the Kings recognize that we have a big platform. It's a privilege, but it's also a responsibility. It's a responsibility that we take very seriously. And we stand here before you, old, young, black, white, brown, and we are all united in our commitment.\n\n\"We recognize that it's not just business as usual, and we are going to work really hard to bring everybody together to make the world a better place, starting with our own community,\" he said. \"And we're going to work really hard prevent this kind of a tragedy from happening again. Thank you all for your patience, and have a good night.\"\n\nClark was killed Sunday night after Sacramento police encountered him while responding to reports of a black male breaking into a car and hiding in a backyard. Police said the 22-year-old Clark advanced toward the responding officers while holding an object in his hand. Initially, police reported that Clark was armed with a gun, then with a \"toolbar,\" but all that was found on him was a cellphone.\n\nPolice fired 20 bullets at Clark, killing him.\n\nHe was a father of a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old, according to his brother, Stevante Clark.\n\nBoth officers involved in the shooting are on paid administrative leave.\n\nThe fatal shooting comes less than two years after the killing of Joseph Mann, another unarmed black man who was shot by Sacramento police in July 2016.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings said in a statement that people who purchased tickets for Thursday's game directly through the team or Ticketmaster will \"receive detailed instructions to facilitate a full refund\" in the coming days.\n\nABC News' Josiah Bates and Julia Jacobo contributed to this report.",

She posted on Twitter that the All-Star third baseman forcibly attempted to kiss her following an autograph session at a mall in 2015.\n\nBetsy Bissen tweeted she screamed and resisted Sano until he gave up \"after a solid 10 minutes of fighting.\" Bissen, who has worked for publications including the popular fan blog Twins Daily, said in her tweet she long feared telling her story would cost her access to photograph Twins games.\n\nIn 2015, MLB and its players union unveiled a new policy covering domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse. Commissioner Rob Manfred has the power to levy discipline, with no minimum or maximum penalty, following an investigation.\n\nMLB said its investigation interviews of more than 20 individuals, including Sano and the complainant.\n\n\"I want to thank Major League Baseball for conducting a thorough investigation and I'm happy to put this behind me,\" Sano said in a statement.\n\n\"I look forward to focusing on the upcoming season and playing alongside my teammates. I want to thank my family, friends, the players' association, the Minnesota Twins and my fans for their continued support.\"\n\nSano is listed by the Twins at 6-foot-4 and 260 pounds, though he's often played at a weight much heavier than that. Sano made the AL All-Star team in 2017, his third major league season. He batted .264 with 28 homers and 77 RBIs despite missing the last six weeks of the season. Sano had a stress reaction in his left shin and had surgery in November.\n\nMore MLB baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball",

                "body": "By ricardo alonso-zaldivar and richard lardner, associated press\n\nTucked in the massive congressional budget bill is a provision that props up the price Medicare pays for a handful of medications, costing taxpayers millions at a time when the Trump administration is vowing to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nLawmakers acted after a lobbying campaign by a small Washington state pharmaceutical company called Omeros. Its main product is a drug called Omidria, used by hospitals in cataract surgery, which had recently lost a coveted Medicare reimbursement status. Individuals associated with the company also stepped up their political contributions.\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the fourth-ranking House Republican, took the issue to Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., securing a place for the drug provision in the 2,232-page spending bill signed Friday by President Donald Trump, aides said. The provision restores the drug's expired reimbursement status for two years, making it more lucrative for hospitals to continue using it.\n\nThe targeted provision succeeded even as broader health care measures failed to make the cut in the budget bill, from legislation to stabilize insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act for millions of consumers, to a drug-industry backed effort to roll back recent changes that shift some Medicare costs to pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the pricing break for the Omeros drug and three products from other companies will cost taxpayers $26 million over 10 years, taking into account long-range effects.\n\nSpeaker Ryan and Rep. McMorris Rodgers said they acted to preserve patients' access to an innovative drug.\n\n\"This provision is the correct policy, was approved by both Republicans and Democrats involved in writing the bill, and was included at the request of members of our conference,\" said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. \"To suggest any other reason is not only false but absurd and insulting.\"\n\nNate Hodson, a spokesman for McMorris Rodgers, said she pushed the measure \"to provide patients across the country access to safe, innovative, life-changing drugs.\" Omidria is injected in the eye to prevent excessive shrinking of the pupil during cataract surgery and reduce pain afterward. Cataract surgery is usually an outpatient procedure.\n\nDrugmaker Omeros had no initial response.\n\nSome saw a disconnect in lawmakers' actions.\n\n\"At a time when policymakers are saying that they are interested in reducing drug costs this is a policy that runs counter to those talking points,\" said analyst Andrea Harris of the investment research firm Height Capital Markets. \"This is a policy that maintains access to an innovative drug rather than putting downward pressure on drug prices.\"\n\nGetting the change was major priority for Omeros and its CEO, Gregory Demopulos.\n\n\"Our frustration, shared by physicians nationwide, remains patients' restricted access to Omidria following its pass-through expiration on Jan. 1,\" Demopulos said in a recent press release about the company's financial performance. \"Congressional and administrative efforts are ongoing, and we look forward to resolving this issue soon.\"\n\n\"Pass-through\" is the technical term for the Medicare payment status that Omidria had lost. Pass-through allows Medicare reimbursement for the full cost of the drug, rather than packaging it with the cataract procedure. That creates an incentive for hospitals to use the drug instead of a lower-price substitute.\n\nIn the nation's capital, Omeros was pressing its case through lobbying and campaign contributions to prominent lawmakers by individuals associated with the company.\n\nOmeros spent just over $1 million on lobbying in 2017, up from $645,000 a year earlier as the company brought aboard two new firms to make its case to Congress and the Trump administration, according to lobbying disclosure records filed with the House and Senate.\n\nOne of the new firms, The Nickles Group, was paid $275,000 to lobby lawmakers on \"issues related to Medicare payment policy in hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgical center settings,\" the records show.\n\nOmeros paid nearly the same amount to King & Spalding, a firm it hired in 2014, to press the House for the \"reimbursement of outpatient medications.\"\n\nIn December, Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Wash., introduced legislation to address the issue. McMorris Rodgers was a cosponsor.\n\nIndividuals associated with the drug company ramped up their political contributions.\n\nThe political money website Open Secrets shows that Omeros CEO Demopulos donated $39,600 in the 2018 election cycle to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans.\n\nFederal Election Commission records show that Demopulos also donated $5,400 directly to Speaker Ryan's campaign on Aug. 31, 2017. Demopulos gave $5,000 to Ryan's political action committee, Prosperity Action Inc., on the same day.\n\nDemopolus contributed $1,500 to Reichert in 2016.\n\nAnother company that's benefiting from the budget bill change expressed some puzzlement over the provision's inclusion.\n\nEli Lilly's imaging agent Amyvid is one of the three other products that will regain their lost Medicare reimbursement status. \"Lilly was not focused on this being included in the omnibus bill,\" said spokesman Scott MacGregor.\n\nAssociated Press Health Writer Matthew Perrone contributed to this report.",

They were aided by a heroic police officer who had offered himself up in a hostage swap and suffered life-threatening wounds as a result -- one of 16 people injured in the day's violence.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack near Carcassonne, a medieval city beloved by tourists, and the town of Trebes. It was the deadliest attack in France since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.\n\nThe officer who volunteered to take the place a female hostage was identified as Col. Arnaud Beltrame. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it.\n\nA police official who was not authorized to be publicly identified confirmed the officer's identity to The Associated Press.\n\n\"He saved lives,\" Macron said.\n\nMacron said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon, and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a vehicle and a building in central Carcassonne.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug-dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called \"Fiche S\" list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an extremist attack.\n\nA woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He did not identify her.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury was not serious, Lefebvre said.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.\n\nHe shouted \"Allahu akbar! (God is great)\" and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nGuibbert said he led his wife and sister-in-law and nearby customers into the meat locker. Then he went back to see where the assailant was and called police to describe the situation.\n\n\"At that moment, he (the gunman) ran after me. Of course I left, I lost him and when I turned around he wasn't there anymore. I took an emergency door and saw the police arrive,\" Guibbert said.\n\nAnother witness, an employee of the supermarket's butcher department identified only by his first name, Jacky, told Europe 1 radio he \"heard people shouting and a big 'boom.'\"\n\n\"It was a gunshot,\" he said. \"Then a second gunshot. After that, my colleagues came toward me saying: 'Come on Jacky, we need to leave! There's someone who's firing shots, he's shouting \"Allahu akbar,\" and he's shot people and he's shooting at everything.'\"\n\nHe said they left using an emergency exit behind the butcher's stall and they ran across the courtyard.\n\n\"We also helped people get out,\" he said.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nBoth Interior Minister Gerard Collomb and Molins praised Beltrame, who Molins said \"at the risk of his life took the choice to take the place of the hostages.\"\n\nThe gunman shot Beltrame several times after threatening to blow up the supermarket if police entered, Molins added.\n\nBFM television said Beltrame recently took part in a training exercise simulating a terrorist attack.\n\nAs the supermarket standoff reached a crescendo about 2:20 p.m., police heard gunshots inside the building and decided that elite forces had to storm it. Lakdim was killed and two other officers were wounded during the assault, Collomb said.\n\n\"He acted alone, there was no one else but him,\" he added.\n\nMacron rushed back from an EU summit in Brussels to Paris, where counterterrorism investigators took over the investigation. France has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people.\n\nWhile France hasn't had an attack in several months, \"the threat remains high,\" Macron said, describing ongoing risks from \"several individuals who radicalized themselves.\"\n\nMacron pushed through a tough counterterrorism law last year that gives police extra powers to conduct searches and hold people under house arrest.\n\nIn Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared with Macron and said, \"When it comes to terrorist threats, we stand by France.\"\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the Eiffel Tower would turn its lights off at midnight in tribute to the victims.\n\nAt the national stadium outside Paris, 80,000 soccer fans and the national teams of France and Colombia observed a minute of silence Friday night to honor those killed in the attacks earlier in the day. Poignantly, the stadium itself was the site of bloodshed in the deadly Paris attacks in 2015.\n\nAdamson and Petrequin reported from Paris. Sylvie Corbet, Angela Charlton and Jerome Pugmire in Paris contributed.\n\nThis version corrects an earlier statement by Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, who said the gunman was 26. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins later said the gunman was 25.",

                "body": "A United Nations official said Friday the multilateral organization will not provide any electoral assistance for Venezuela's upcoming presidential vote, an election that has been denounced as rigged by opposition leaders and many foreign governments.\n\nRepresentatives of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and independent candidate Henri Falcon traveled this month to U.N. headquarters seeking to persuade the body to send experts for the May 20 vote.\n\nThe main opposition coalition is boycotting the election over concerns it will be rigged and called on the U.N. to reject the request. The U.N. official confirmed the decision not to send an election mission to Venezuela, without giving reasons behind the move.\n\n\"The U.N. is not providing any electoral assistance to Venezuela,\" the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nOil-rich Venezuela has been sinking deeper into a political and economic crisis after global crude prices fell and the country's state-run oil production has been spiraling downward due to mismanagement under nearly two decades of socialist rule.\n\nThe hand-picked successor to the late President Hugo Chavez, Maduro is running for a second six-year term and has drawn condemnation abroad and at home for his tactics.\n\nOfficials loyal to Maduro have banned the largest opposition parties from participating and the most popular opposition candidates are imprisoned or in exile.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will reject the outcome of the election, which it says won't be free or fair. Several Latin American leaders have pressured Maduro's government to return to what they consider democratic rule.\n\nU.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told AP earlier Friday that a letter was sent to Venezuelan authorities about their request for election experts. But he would not disclose the contents.\n\nA campaign representative for Falcon said the independent candidate was considering his next move. Falcon, a former governor, had demanded U.N. participation as a condition for his own candidacy.\n\nThe Falcon representative told AP the situation has now changed, but he stopped short of saying Falcon would drop out of the race. The official agreed to discuss the matter only if not quoted by name.\n\nAssociated Press writer Edith M. Lederer reported this story at the United Nations and AP writer Scott Smith reported from Caracas, Venezuela. AP writer Fabiola Sanchez contributed to this story.",

ESPN does not typically identify people who make accusations of sexual assault unless they have chosen to go public with their names.\n\nSano unequivocally denied the allegation and after interviewing more than 20 people, including Bissen and Sano, and reviewing documents including communication records, the commissioner's office \"found that there was insufficient evidence to support a disciplinary determination against San? due to conflicting and inconsistent witness accounts and the absence of contemporaneous substantiation.\"\n\nSano, 24, issued a statement released by the Major League Baseball Players Association. \"I want to thank Major League Baseball for conducting a thorough investigation and I'm happy to put this behind me.

The exact figure depends on the number of off-days during the ban.\n\n\"While it is clear that Mr. Wright regrets what transpired that evening, takes full responsibility for his actions and has committed himself to the treatment and counseling components of the policy, I have concluded that Mr. Wright's conduct on Dec. 8 violated the policy and warrants discipline,\" Manfred said in a statement. \"Mr. Wright has agreed to speak to other players about what he has learned through this process, and to donate time and money to local organizations aimed at the prevention of, and the treatment of victims of, domestic violence.\"\n\nWright also apologized to Red Sox management, fans, teammates and his family.

South Sudan, Myanmar, Iran and North Korea garnered one each.\n\nHaley railed Friday that when the council \"treats Israel worse\" than such countries, \"it is the council itself that is foolish and unworthy of its name.\"",

                "title": "NBC documentary looks at images that propelled civil rights",
                "body": "Gruesome images of a lynched Emmett Till were seared into the minds of many black Americans in 1955 and helped lead to the modern civil rights movement. But few whites knew of their existence at the time.\n\nThat reality is at the top of NBC's two-hour documentary about how images propelled the civil rights effort. The film premieres Saturday at 8 p.m. ET as the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King's assassination approaches.\n\nTill was the 14-year-old black Chicago boy visiting relatives in Mississippi, killed after a white grocery store clerk claimed he treated her rudely. Decades later, she recanted her story. That was far too late to save Till from being bludgeoned, shot in the head and thrown into a river. Two men were acquitted of the crime, even though they later admitted to it.\n\nGiven a casket nailed shut, Till's mother ordered it open and Jet magazine took pictures of his horrible maimed head, beaten beyond recognition.\n\n\"For a mainstream, news audience, my guess is a large number of people knew his name, but didn't really know what happened, which is the best and highest calling for a documentary like this,\" said NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack. \"Seeing these pictures underscores what happened, what really happened, why the murder of Emmett Till was such a shocking and important event in the civil rights movement.\"\n\nThere's no evidence that NBC ever showed the picture of Till's body until a \"Today\" show story on the anniversary of his death in 1985, the network said. NBC wasn't alone among the mainstream media.\n\n\"It was a different America,\" Lack said.\n\nAs if to make amends, the documentary shows the image of a murdered Till seven times. NBC compared Mamie Till's insistence that the brutal truth of what happened to her son be made visible to actions 2016 by the girlfriend of Philando Castile, who streamed the aftermath of his shooting by a police officer outside of St. Paul, Minnesota where he had been pulled over for a busted light.\n\nMamie Till went to Jet because, at the time, it was the top news source for black America, said MSNBC's Joy Reid, who participated in the documentary. \"If you were a mother in Mamie Till's position, you wouldn't go to NBC or CBS or even The New York Times,\" she said.\n\nThe pictures \"took the issue of lynching away from the grainy photographs of a body hanging in the woods,\" she said. The anniversary of Till's death was later chosen as the date of King's March on Washington, she noted.\n\n\"The civil rights movement never forgot Emmett Till,\" Reid said. \"He was to that movement what Trayvon Martin was to Black Lives Matter, a symbol that remained incredibly potent.\"\n\nNBC's documentary shows how King innately understood the power of images beamed by the still-infant medium of television. A peaceful march or sit-in could draw yawns from a general public, yet a march of well-dressed children set upon by police with dogs and fire hoses produced pictures that made many Americans recoil when they saw them on the evening news.\n\nRepeatedly, King could count on racists to reveal themselves and provide the pictures he needed to give the movement momentum. Many demonstrations were planned before noon to give enough time for film to be delivered to New York to be shown on the network evening news.\n\nNoted civil rights icon John Lewis is quoted in the documentary as saying, \"without television, the civil rights movement would have been like a bird without wings.\" The movement changed television, too: evening news programs expanded from 15 minutes a day to half hour to keep up with the news.\n\nLack said he also hoped the documentary would give attention to some notable black journalists from the time. Two examples: Ernest Withers, who took the picture of a man who stood in the courtroom and pointed to Till's murderers during their trial, and L. Alex Wilson, who followed black students integrating a high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, and continued walking despite being beaten by a crowd of angry whites.\n\nThe documentary was initially made for MSNBC but, midstream, Lack said he felt compelled to request a prime-time window on the network. Once common, documentaries are now such a rarity on network television that NBC said it hasn't aired a two-hour film like this since 2004.\n\nIt is being repeated on MSNBC Sunday at 9 p.m. ET.",

                "title": "Family of Penn State pledge who died after fall announces new anti-hazing bill",
                "body": "Following the recent death of Penn State fraternity pledge Tim Piazza, who died after falling down stairs at the Beta Theta Pi house during a pledge ceremony, his family has joined with a local state politician in announcing a new anti-hazing bill in the hopes to \"change the landscape\" in Pennsylvania and become a model for the nation.\n\nUniversities throughout the county are struggling \"with what has become an epidemic\" and current laws are not a \"sufficient deterrent\" to prevent hazing, Piazza's father, Jim, said during a news conference Friday.\n\nThe state bill -- the Timothy J. Piazza Law -- was introduced today, and his father said he thinks it could make Greek life safer, hold those who commit hazing accountable and save lives.\n\nAt today's news conference, Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman called the bill the \"most comprehensive\" rewriting of hazing law, not just in the state, but likely in the nation.\n\nHe said the law would: create tiers for hazing offenses, which would give local prosecutors more \"flexibility\" with charges to more accurately reflect the crime; hold organizations like fraternities accountable by charging them with a 3rd-degree misdemeanor or felony if serious injury or death occurs; and hold institutions like colleges and universities responsible by punishing them with fines for hazing offenses.\n\nCorman also today praised Tim Piazza's parents, who channeled their pain to do something good and prevent other parents from the heartbreak they went through, he said. Breaking down a bit, Corman said if he lost his child to a similar incident, he would likely curl up in bed and stay there.\n\n\"But because of their courage, we're here to make sure this never happens again,\" he said.\n\nThe bill is scheduled for action next Tuesday and if it gets support, it will head to the state senate when it reconvenes in April.\n\nThe bill stems from the alcohol-fueled hazing ritual 19-year-old sophomore Tim Piazza participated in at the Beta Theta Pi frat house on Feb. 2, 2017.\n\nAfter the ritual, a heavily intoxicated Piazza was heard falling down the stairs, and later found lying face down at the bottom. What happened next is described in horrific detail in a grand jury report citing evidence including surveillance video, witness testimony and phone records.\n\nMembers of the fraternity carried Piazza up the steps and put him on the couch. They dumped water on his face and slapped him in an apparent attempt to wake him, to no avail. When one pledge tried to intervene, insisting they get Tim Piazza some help, he was shoved into a wall and told the brothers had it under control, the grand jury report says.\n\nAs the night went on, Tim Piazza tried over and over to stand on his own, falling each time and eventually going still. By the next morning, he was breathing heavily, with blood on his face. When a fraternity member finally called 911 for help, Tim Piazza's skin had turned gray, the report says.\n\nHe died a day later of traumatic brain injuries.\n\nProsecutors claim the frat brothers then tried to cover up the alleged hazing and underage drinking.\n\nOne former fraternity member allegedly texted his girlfriend \"drink hazing can send me to jail,\" and \"I don't want to go to jail for this,\" prosecutors said. \"I think we are f-----,\" he added.\n\nAnother text read, \"Make sure the pledges keep quiet about last night and this situation.\"\n\nTwenty-six men are facing various charges, including involuntary manslaughter, hazing, and conspiracy, though aggravated assault charges were recently withdrawn. A hearing is underway today to determine if there's enough evidence to go to trial for several of those men.\n\n\"Our review is ongoing,\" Pennsylvania Attorney General Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a statement last week.\n\n\"When any parent sends their son off to college to get an education, they don't expect him to be found at the bottom of the basement steps of a fraternity house after a night of hazing, unconscious and fatally injured,\" he said. \"We will seek justice for the Piazza family. My office is committed to holding every responsible individual accountable for their actions, consistent with the law and the evidence in this case.\"\n\nBeta Theta Pi has since been barred from Penn State.",

The former Breitbart chief's role in Cambridge Analytica's operations came under the microscope after Facebook suspended the data firm for allegedly breaching millions of user profiles.\n\nCambridge Analytica has said it deleted all the Facebook data and related information in cooperation with the social media company, and that such information was never used as part of the data firm's work with the Trump presidential campaign. The data firm has said it was unaware the data was improperly obtained by a third party and that is was destroyed as soon as they were made aware.\n\nDeflecting attention away from himself and Cambridge Analytica, Bannon took aim at Facebook, accusing the social media giant of abusing its users' data for financial gain.\n\n\"They take your stuff for free,\" Bannon said of Facebook. \"They sell it and monetize it for huge margins. That's why the companies trade for such high valuations.\"\n\n\"The point is, that is Facebook's business.\"\n\nBannon then directed his ire at a familiar foe, the news media, for ignoring President Barack Obama's social media targeting in his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.\n\n\"The great opposition party - the media - never went after the Obama campaign,\" Bannon said, \"and in 2013, when I thought a data company might be important, it all of a sudden becomes global news.\"\n\nFacebook declined to comment on Bannon's accusations.",

No to horror!\"\n\nPoland has one of the strictest abortion laws in Europe, allowing abortion only if the woman's life or health is at risk, the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or the fetus is damaged.\n\nAn attempt by Polish officials to ban all abortions in 2016 sparked mass nationwide protests by women dressed in black that forced the government to abandon the plan.\n\nThe new proposed legislation would still allow abortions when the woman's life or health is at risk or the pregnancy results from a crime. But it would ban abortions of irreparably damaged fetuses or those with Down syndrome.\n\nIn Warsaw, protesters gathered at the seat of the influential Roman Catholic bishops, who are pressing the government to tighten the abortion law.\n\nBeating drums and blowing horns, they marched to parliament and then to the headquarters of the ruling right-wing party.\n\n\"I hope this protest has the same effect as the one in 2016. Forcing women to have babies is inhuman,\" said Karolina Chelminska, a 26-year-old graphic designer.\n\nIn other protests, thousands gathered in Krakow's market, and hundreds in some other cities, including Wroclaw, where some signs read \"I will not give birth to a dead baby.\"\n\nThe European Union's Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muiznieks, and U.N. experts are urging Poland's parliament to reject the abortion bill, saying it puts Poland in conflict with its international human rights obligations.",

                "body": "Four months ago, Shaim Russell knew nothing about carpentry.\n\n\"I could hang up a picture in the house, banging a nail into the wall,\" the 31-year-old truck driver said. \"That's was about it.\"\n\nNow, Russell is about to start a career as a carpenter, having been trained and lined up with a job through a program run by the developers of the new Hard Rock casino and a local community group. They sought out and selected 15 young Atlantic City residents for training and employment for casino and other projects.\n\n\"This is something I'll have my entire life,\" he said Friday after graduating from the program. \"It's the biggest change in my life. It's like the clouds parted and this incredible opportunity landed in my lap.\"\n\nThe program, \"Training To Hire,\" was sponsored by Hard Rock, its local development partners, Joseph Jingoli & Son, and Jack Morris, the CEO of Edgewood Properties. It was run by Anthony Brower, whose community group identified promising city residents.\n\n\"This isn't charity; this is good business,\" Joseph Jingoli said. \"These are excellent employees. That there had to be a 'program' to find and train these amazingly capable young men and women has to change. They're smart, talented, loyal and eager to work. We won't be satisfied until programs like this are no longer needed.\"\n\nThe jobs are unionized and will pay the prevailing wage for apprentices. That means between $21 to $24 per hour for Russell. That's significantly more than he earned driving a beer truck.\n\nPriska Conrad trained to be an electrician, and was supported every step of the way: When she had problems finding a place to live for her and her family, the program found her an apartment and an office job while she learned construction.\n\n\"It's a career, not just a job,\" she said. \"A career, they need you. A job, you need them. I was unemployed and I was scared. I never had anybody give me a hand before. It's a blessing, and I want to pay it forward to others.\"\n\nConrad, 44, originally wanted a career for her son. Instead, the program trained them both. Levi Bell Jr., an electrician who trained Conrad, said she's ready to work in the field.\n\n\"She is an excellent worker, asked lots of questions and met every goal I set for her,\" he said. She's now qualified to read blueprints, plot the positioning of electrical outlets, and install wiring.\n\nConrad will work either on the Hard Rock casino project, or on the project at the opposite end of town, where a new campus for Stockton University and a corporate headquarters for South Jersey Gas is being built.\n\n\"The biggest misconception is that there are unemployable people in Atlantic City,\" said Mayor Frank Gilliam. \"Without programs like these, you may never get a chance to see the brilliant people we have here.\"\n\nBell, the electrician who trained Conrad, said he benefited in the 1970s from an affirmative action program aimed at African-American workers.\n\n\"It was the welcome mat for people who look like me,\" he said. \"The marketplace needs to know there are qualified people that are anxious to work and improve their lives right here.\"\n\nFollow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC",

                "body": "Authorities issued a warrant Friday for the arrest of Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Bennett, accused of injuring a paraplegic woman as he tried get onto the field at last year's Super Bowl to celebrate with his brother.\n\nThe Harris County district attorney's office said the warrant was issued after a grand jury indicted Bennett on a felony count of injury to the elderly.\n\nBennett was a spectator at the game at NRG Stadium in Houston in February 2017 when he tried to get onto the field immediately afterward to see his brother, Martellus Bennett, a tight end for the Patriots at the time, officials said in a statement. Prosecutors allege he pushed through security personnel, including a 66-year-old disabled woman who had told him to use a different entrance to access the field.\n\nThe charge of injury to the elderly can be filed if a person intentionally or knowingly causes injury to a person 65 or older. It carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n\nHarris County authorities say they're talking with Bennett's legal team about surrendering on the charge.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles earlier this month acquired Bennett from the Seattle Seahawks, where he became one of the dominant defensive linemen in the game.\n\n\"We are aware of the situation involving Michael Bennett and are in the process of gathering more information,\" the Eagles said. \"Because this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nBennett's agent, Doug Hendrickson, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday.\n\nBennett had 8 ? sacks last season and has 54 in his nine-year career. The 32-year-old Bennett has three years remaining on his contract, with a base salary of just $1.65 million in 2018. That number jumps to $6 million in 2019 and $7.5 million in 2020.\n\nMore AP NFL: https://pro32.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP -- NFL",

Maybe he's in a better place, but back then he was in a very ... it was rough,\" added Hader of the singer. \"Everybody's usually on great behavior.... Bieber is the only one in my experience ... he just seemed like exhausted or just at the end of a rope. I mean, he was just so huge.\"\n\nBieber, now 24, appeared as the host and musical guest on a 2013 \"SNL\" episode when he was in the middle of his Believe world tour. During his time on the show, the singer appeared in nearly every sketch and performed two songs acoustically: \"As Long as You Love Me\" and \"Nothing Like Us.\"\n\nHe used the show as an opportunity to poke fun at himself for everything from his singing and dancing to his physical appearance to his marijuana usage.",

                "title": "Army seeks changes to chemical weapons disposal in Colorado",
                "body": "The U.S. Army wants to change the way it destroys part of its huge stockpile of obsolete chemical weapons in Colorado, but some people worry that could increase the chances of contamination escaping into the air.\n\nThe Army's Pueblo Chemical Depot is eradicating 780,000 shells filled with thick liquid mustard agent -- many of them dating to the Cold War -- under an international treaty banning chemical weapons.\n\nThe Army built a highly automated, $4.5 billion plant to do the work, but officials said this week they want to buy two closed detonation chambers for about $30 million each to destroy 97,000 problematic mortar shells. The plant has also experienced a series of setbacks and is currently shut down.\n\nIt still has to complete an environmental impact assessment and get state and local permits before proceeding.\n\nThe mustard agent in the shells is believed to be contaminated with more rust than originally expected, making it difficult for the plant's robotic equipment to open them, said Greg Mohrman, the project site manager.\n\nIf the shells don't open cleanly, workers would have to don protective suits and intervene, Mohrman said. That increases the risk they would be exposed to mustard agent, which can maim or kill by blistering skin, scarring eyes and inflaming airways.\n\n\"The primary issue is worker safety,\" he said.\n\nMohrman said the shells would not have to be opened if they are destroyed in the detonation chambers. The chambers would heat the shells to about 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (540 Celsius) to detonate or burn them and the mustard. Gases would be captured, burned and filtered.\n\nMohrman said the technology is safe and has been used to destroy chemical weapons in Alabama and Kentucky as well as seven other nations.\n\nAt least two members of the Pueblo depot's Citizens Advisory Commission, established by Congress as a liaison between the public and the plant operators, have reservations.\n\n\"I am very, very concerned on the control of the air emissions -- what comes out, how it is controlled,\" said Irene Kornelly, the longtime chairwoman of the commission. \"And those are issues we really want to delve into.\"\n\nCommission member Ross Vincent said he hopes the environmental impact assessment will provide more details about the emissions.\n\n\"No matter how hard they try to remove them, some of them get away. There's no way to avoid that,\" he said.\n\nKornelly and Vincent agreed worker safety is paramount.\n\n\"We can't continually have workers in (protective) suits going in and cleaning up the mess,\" Kornelly said.\n\nIf and when the Army decides to buy the chambers, it could take two years to have them delivered, installed and put to work, Mohrman said.\n\nHe believes money for the chambers is available through an Army office that oversees the destruction of weapons, but isn't sure if Congress would have to approve the purchase.\n\nMohrman said the rust comes from water contamination that was in the mustard when the shells were assembled. The water reacts with the mustard agent to create an acid that corrodes the inside of the shells.\n\nThe type of steel and the design of the 97,000 mortar shells are different than the other shells at the Pueblo depot, making them more susceptible to rust, Mohrman said.\n\nVincent questioned why the Army didn't better prepare for the rust problem when defense contractor Bechtel Corp. designed and built the plant.\n\nMohrman said the Army did anticipate some rust, but it was worse than expected.\n\nThe plant uses a combination of water and bacteria to neutralize the mustard agent after it is drained from the shells. Operations began in September 2016 after 12 years of construction.\n\nThe rust is the latest in a series of setbacks. Full plant operations have been suspended since September 2017 because of a leaking shell and problems with a cooling system and a system that circulates liquid as part of the neutralization process.\n\nLast summer, the Army had to truck about 250,000 gallons (946,000 liters) of wastewater to an incinerator in Texas because the Pueblo plant could not process all of it at the time.\n\nMohrman said he hopes the plant will be back in full operation in May.\n\nFollow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP.

An open murder charge allows the jury to decide between first- or second-degree murder.\n\nPolice allege Gelia broke into Southwell's home in Nov. 2016 and fired several shots. She died from a single gunshot wound, the medical examiner said. The bullet entered Southwell's ride side, punctured her lungs, hit her rib and hit her spine.\n\nAuthorities arrested Gelia that evening after they saw him in a white SUV matching the description of a vehicle leaving the scene. Gelia told officers he'd been holding a gun to his head when they stopped his vehicle.\n\nJackson Police Sgt. Wes Stanton interviewed Gelia the night of the arrest. A recording of the interview was played for the jury, and showed Gelia saying he \"didn't want to hurt anyone.\"\n\nThe 25-minute Facebook Live recording that Gelia allegedly made before and during the shooting is also expected to be played for the jury.\n\nAndrew Kirkpatrick, Gelia's attorney, said he won't deny much of what his client is accused of, but is seeking a lesser charge.\n\n\"By the end of this trial, I will ask you to find him guilty, but I ask you to find him guilty of the appropriate charge,\" Kirkpatrick said. \"Everything he did that night was an act of human stupidity.\"\n\nInformation from: Jackson Citizen Patriot, http://www.mlive.com/jackson",

McMaster with John Bolton is not only part of a broader shakeup but represents a shift toward an increasingly hawkish foreign policy posture as he faces major decisions within weeks on North Korea and Iran.\n\nBolton has a well-established reputation as a hard-liner, often advocating military action over diplomacy -- including most recently as a high-profile contributor on conservative-leaning FOX News, a Trump favorite.\n\nBolton served in both previous Bush administrations, as UN ambassador and Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security - and during that time strongly supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nRobert Malley, who served on the National Security Council during the Obama and Clinton administrations, says Trump's choice of Bolton amounts to nails in the coffin for the President Barack Obama's landmark foreign policy achievement, the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nBolton has been vocal in advocating for tearing up the deal, an idea that President Trump has also expressed support for even as he has stopped short of withdrawing from the deal thus far.\n\nBolton is joined in opposing the Iran deal by CIA director Mike Pompeo, the president's nominee to replace Rex Tillerson, an Iran deal supporter, as secretary of state.\n\n\"All signs have been pointing toward a likely decision by President Trump to withdraw from an agreement that was working,\" Malley said. \"I think the dismissal of Secretary Tillerson with Mike Pompeo was a sign that the deal was probably dead and I think the replacement of H.R. McMaster by John Bolton is a sign that the deal is not just dead, but dead and buried.\"\n\nMalley remains hopeful that European nations who are partners in the Iran nuclear deal may be able to prop up the agreement with Iran, even without U.S. participation. But if not, Malley worries that the alternative options hold dangerous implications for global security.\n\n\"If we're tearing up this deal ... we will be in a situation where either Iran will continue its nuclear program because they'll no longer be constrained by the deal or the U.S. will decide, along with some of our allies, that we're going to stop it militarily,\" Malley predicts.\n\nAnd at a time when Trump is staking out a softer path for diplomacy with North Korea by accepting an invitation to sit down for direct talks with Kim Jong Un, Bolton has struck a very different tone in arguing that there is a legal case for a pre-emptive strike against North Korea.\n\n\"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current 'necessity' posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first,\" Bolton wrote in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed in February.\n\nMalley says the entrance of Bolton to the president's foreign policy team now means the president will be torn between his instincts as a deal-maker and the voice of Bolton, who has staked out his support for military action.\n\n\"He's going to have two voices in his head, so it will be interesting to see which deal prevails,\" said Malley.",

                "body": "Transcript for Trump signs spending bill despite veto threat Hi there and welcome to a special edition of the briefing room coming out pretty extraordinary event over at the White House for the president. Society massive omnibus spending bill on ABC news political director Rick Klein joined here by Katherine folders and are let science. I want to start with Jon Karl over the White House. Ridiculous situation is the president's quote so I've got a new name for my garageband John but it. It also seems like it. A pretty apt description of this whole last 24 hours what led up to this and what are you may what's the upshot from the presidency. That he signed it but did it with all of these reservations and I'll never do it again. All. One of the strangest. Bill signings these actually let me take back these strangest bill signing I've witnessed. He spent half the time condemning the bill half the time praising the bill. And he said this is the last time he's gonna sign a bill like this and he said Rick that he. Needs to see two big changes he wants an end of the filibuster in the senate and he wants a line item veto I can promise you. That neither one of those two things is gonna happen. There's actually no way the Republicans that would go along within into the filibuster in the senate. And a line item veto has been on the wish list of fiscal conservatives for. For decades. Probably wouldn't pass constitutional Muster anyway but this is this was a very strange situation ultimately said. He's signing this funding bill because he gets a big increase from the military and he said his number one job as president is to keep the country safe. So he needs he was basically forced to sign a bill he doesn't like because it's the only way get the money for the for defense that he says he needs. And John before illegal I just struck me that it was almost something on trump be about this that the VV that the theater is very tropics but. The idea of of saying well I've won some things but I didn't win some things I like something's I don't that's not very that's not very tropic usually he says it's the biggest is the best. He got all these winds and there are lots of things as allies are telling him. He could get out of this why did he try to split this like this what what what's your sense of why he decided to sign this even with all these reservation. I think that Dutch general Mattis was a key factor here you know that general Mattis came down talk to the president that he was at his side. During this during this press event. And Mattis made the case that that the military absolutely needs this funding increase. If we were going to another government shut down if we were unable to. This bill was not signed by the president the military. Would be the what would be would be would suffer more than anybody because most of this spending bill roughly half of the spending bill goes. To defense. So I think ultimately that's what it came down to but this was a very conflict that president Viktor exactly right it's not the kind of president we use of these stay. I think that's why we saw him alternate behind. Praising what he used on here saying this is going to be the greatest military ever but condemning something that he was signing he seemed. At times to be almost speaking from rated TV that his demeanor during this event was one of I thought I I sensed a sense of an angry president. Forced into a situation that that he did not want to be it is. Our job related back to the White House a couple more hours for the president takes off tomorrow Lagos so lots of news can still be committed but we know we'll we'll see you back on world news tonight thanks down. It's so guys I. It is it is extraordinary what would you feel like it if there is strategy behind all of this is. This is done this week has put us on circuit overload we've have a war of words we've had the firings we've had the nice words for potent. All the that the trade war with China all of these wacky stories not to mention that the women that are coming out of the woodwork now. What what do you make of the week this has been handled from the communications perspective Catherine you're talking to people people why excited this morning by the potential beetle from what the president got a. Perhaps a strategy of one from president trump you know there were some people who were is saying yesterday he randomly announces national security advisor to. It's so. People wanna viewed McDoogle interview on CNN an outcome from this perspective it came after he wants them. A Fox News. People making the case against this bill and any came out with this week night in. Tell you that from talking people on the White House this morning they are all scrambling after this week created new way is he going to sign is he not going to sign it so from a communications. Point of you I think it's he's acting as on comes director here and then has come shop was really taken a back. What you do if you Paul writer Mitch McConnell. Lectured to about how you have to Cagle the senate rules. You're told that this bill is is atrocious a ridiculous situation the president says. It was written by Paul Ryan's allies in the house. Optical sign off on it. They don't want it they don't like change and blocked the senate rules this is a strange message to to end the budget fight of the year with. Hot and keep do you means what you heard repeatedly saying he's not going to change filibuster rules and these are two lot makers who have been in the house and senate effort many years they know how easy marks they know that things need to get done and if the president talk them out. You know when he did this isn't necessarily the right up in the consideration next time around with folks ain't had no idea what happened this morning a lot of add people were speculating whether the president would actually need it and threw it. And one thing that was telling was that there was never any discussion among congressional leaders. About continuing resolution and he. Has sure gone there yeah. If. Rickey minor and his budget director came yesterday and briefed reporters on this and so that this bill on his priority on the the president is. Evidently he's said. Let's cut right to the chase is the president going to sign as though the answer is yes and of course he was right eat yeah he ultimately minds right but it you know of course the president and has that bill signing anything you know he's happy and mentioned it happens with. The president likes to position himself against congress sometimes in in in this part of this is this I think part is also reacting to an angry conservative base you've seen the tweets by Laura Ingraham and Coulter. I even Bob Corker saying please veto this thing they feel like this was a mistake for him to sign. But I as this was going on a text or Republican health Samper who made the point that look he he is now watered down the veto threat. By backing ominous by big in the veto threat and as saying why did it but I did it reluctantly. What does it need you to the public can ever take seriously the idea that I might veto this when they're getting all these mixed signals and by the in any decided that they anyway. Yet they mean I didn't really have to hold on to all of their cards and stay in it you're ready to veto something preemptively it and not actually following through that they may not to users. I do wonder about the public perception visiting monstrosity of only 2200 pages would read it a vote seem like the president was read it. The guy if you look at a military items but but. He's what what's that the message that he communicates to the public. That this is a mistake this is terrible this is about process. At least its pass by his people and he signed it. If it seems like there's always be offered. Then there's always going to be a contradiction but I feel I get it we've seen this with him before. Great you know he. Says it's it's a bad thing that he'll do it anyway so at this I don't it's a muddled message but at the end of the day I don't think it really matters for those people. Looking on at least for his support. And it gets plaintiff has base and he has base doesn't want to CEO one point three trillion dollar. They also this is a way that he can saying I didn't. And I am opposed these things but I sought by. Here's what we need for. And the president as I said as is leaving for a weekend that are illogical and a couple of hours but he's not doing it without having blown up yet another part of this team he's replacing I was national security advisor. HR McMaster replaced by John Bolton off a hardliner this comes on the heels of of replacing secretary of state if Twitter. On the heels of his shakeup in the legal team issue and even a rhetoric carefully. Katherine his national economic council advisor Eric hone on as well different fear they're. He's gonna he's blown things up along the way this is seen with disruption as domination it seems like an important one to focus on right now the president. We've been told internally is getting more comfortable in the job even as it would seem like there's more chaos. In in PE he's. Joke that is that chaotic day in it is that he wouldn't necessarily in at sea ray he's brick and replaced them McMaster sources houses with. A planned thing but at the same time you saw John Malone on Fox News yesterday it was. Surprise heavy enough that we gave when it ditty it was Fox News contributor and there is. A some debate about that so yeah it's it's definitely a part of the minute and it is chaotic but what the Bolton. Announcement chosen their excellence and protections is that there are. Likely going to be serious changes in foreign policy. Need to be Iran and North Korea especially ahead of that North Korea meeting. Yet seems like policy. Policy is real here what it was exactly yesterday John Bolton appeared on Fox News he didn't really delve into how he file and at the current state things will be interesting to see what happens in Korea as the president's planning. That. Reported meeting when it leaders confront them. And almost as an L by the way and all of this last night on CNN as he referenced earlier. A former playmate model talks extensively about a long term extramarital relationship. With president trump story Daniels will be on sixty minutes this weekend it doesn't sound like it's going to be a quiet next couple has cycles. Now and it's really seems like there's just board structure truck coming out these relationships that the president supposedly had. According to these women it's gonna be really interesting to see the president himself as you know are actually directly across its best. We've only really been hearing from spokespeople and lawyers deny he happens. He's surprisingly been able to dodge questions on stormy day and Dino and I am thinking that the White House has denied. If this relationship that he is there's been some news wrecked them down you know he hasn't. I'm taking questions on and so he's even apply under the radar their little bit but he leaves tomorrow on Saturday you know he leaves from the south on. He looked again isn't it chatting me so he could never thought about. Right we'll see if we get more ridiculous situations that right now. Bowler Charlotte science thanks everyone for watching the special edition of the briefing room will be back if there's more news.

                "body": "The Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee has asked Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to brief the committee on the department's decision to spend $139,000 to replace three sets of doors in his office at Interior headquarters.\n\nIn a letter to Zinke, Rep. Trey Gowdy says the committee is aware of \"allegations of excess cost.\" He asks Zinke to provide more details on the process of negotiating the contract before April 6.\n\nZinke told a different House committee last week that the department has negotiated the price to half of the original contract and the cost will now be about $75,000.\n\n\"The Secretary has directed that the contract be modified to change the scope of the project for a substantial cost savings,\" department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement.\n\nWhen the department first confirmed the purchase after it was first reported by the Associated Press, it said that the $139,000 cost was to repair three sets of double doors in Zinke's office. The director of the department's office of facilities said in a statement that two sets of doors led outside and were in need of repair because water leaked in during bad weather and damaged the wood floors.\n\nSwift also said that he was not aware of the cost earlier this month but that the secretary thought it was too expensive.\n\n\"This project was requested by career facilities and security officials at Interior as part of the decade-long modernization of the historic FDR-era building. The secretary was not aware of this contract but agrees that this is a lot of money for demo, install, materials, and labor. Between regulations that require historic preservation and outdated government procurement rules, the costs for everything from pencils to printing to doors is astronomical. This is a perfect example of why the Secretary believes we need to reform procurement processes,\" Swift said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nZinke testified last week that the cost was driven up by government purchasing rules and guidelines for preserving historic buildings, though he did not go into detail.\n\n\"But a lot of the issue is on historic buildings, you have to follow such stringent rules, even though some of them don't make common sense, then it just cost the taxpayers to - and we're bound by those rules. I don't even have a choice,\" Zinke told the House Natural Resources Committee in a hearing on the department's budget Thursday.",

Scrawled across the top in headline-sized typeface: \"CAN I PLEASE GET A PUPPY?!\" (Please and puppy underlined for added emphasis.)\n\n\"Having studied my habits and preferences, my daughter hacked my attention this morning for her political agenda,\" Greeley joked.\n\nAs the tweet has gone viral, the writer has marveled at the marquee names (\"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling, for instance) who have retweeted the photo.\n\nAfter noticing \"The Wire\" creator David Simon's retweet, he quipped, \"I always kind of hoped that @aodespair would someday notice my writing. Reader, he did not. He noticed my daughter's viral banner ad begging for a puppy. The Lord hears your prayer. Then he answers in a manner of his own choosing.\"\n\nSo, did Greeley's daughter's well-placed plea work?\n\n\"Ok, #teampuppy, you win,\" Greeley wrote, urging people to donate to the SPCA of Anne Arundel County.\n\n\"Wife, children, dog AND NOW EVIDENTLY A DAMN PUPPY, TOO,\" the dad's Twitter bio now reads.",

IS claimed that Lakdim -- who was known to French police for petty crime and drug-dealing -- was one of its \"soldiers.\"\n\nFrench officials also didn't say what, if anything, Lakdim promised in exchange for Abdeslam's freedom.\n\nAbdeslam likely holds importance for would-be attackers in France as the only living suspect thought to have participated directly in the Paris attacks. Last month, he emerged from nearly two years of isolation in a French prison to be tried in Brussels over the shootout that resulted in his capture.\n\nThe verdict for the trial is set for April 29.\n\nAbdeslam has refused to answer the French investigators' questions regarding the carnage in Paris that resonated around the world.\n\nIt's not the first time a gunman and hostage-taker in a French supermarket has made a demand on behalf of fellow jihadis.\n\nIn January 2015, Amedy Coulibaly took over a kosher supermarket and demanded police to back off their pursuit of two brothers who had killed staff members of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo days earlier.\n\nCoulibaly killed four hostages before he was shot and killed.\n\nTen months later, the Paris attacks at multiple venues killed 130 people.\n\nAbdeslam is back in solitary confinement in France.\n\nLori Hinnant contributed to this report",

One hitter may crush fastballs. Another may hammer change-ups. That doesn't mean either is a better hitter. They just have different strengths. Outfielders are similar. Whenever we have a chance to maximize a man's strengths to get an additional out, we'll do so.\"\n\nStrange shifts are nothing new to baseball. The influx of analytics has led managers to try different things.\n\nChicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon tried a four-man outfield last season against Cincinnati's Joey Votto. Third baseman Kris Bryant moved to left-center field and shortstop Javier Baez remained on the left side of the infield. Votto hit a double down the first-base line.\n\nHouston Astros manager A.J. Hinch took the strategy a step further against Miami's Justin Bour this spring. Third baseman Alex Bregman moved to left field and shortstop Carlos Correa slid over to the right side of the infield, giving the Astros no fielders between second and third. Late in the count both Correa and second baseman Jose Altuve dropped deep, essentially playing short right field, so that only first baseman Marwin Gonzalez was on the infield dirt.\n\nHinch also experimented with four infielders on the right side of the diamond in a game against Washington.\n\n\"It's happened before but that's one of the most extreme shifts I've ever seen -- you'll probably ever see,\" pitcher Dallas Keuchel said. \"I think unless you have an athletic pitcher on the mound, you probably won't see that. I pride myself on the defense and A.J. knows that so I think he's willing to take a risk and try it out. What better way to try it out than in spring training.\"\n\nBut these shifts aren't as drastic as Kapler's plan.\n\nMoving outfielders back-and-forth mid-inning is a bold concept. It might require ego-massaging because some players may be offended if they are moved away from the ball. Even weekend warriors in beer leagues across the country would be embarrassed if a coach makes that kind of switch.\n\nPhillies slugger Rhys Hoskins has the right attitude, however.\n\nHoskins, a converted first baseman, is Philadelphia's least experienced outfielder. He's slower and has less range than Nick Williams and Aaron Altherr, who are expected to play right field.\n\n\"I think it's going to give us a chance to get more outs throughout the season,\" he said. \"Kap has stressed he wants to put his players in the best position possible to succeed and I think we're pretty blessed with some good outfielders. Logically, it only makes sense to use those guys as much as we can. And if gets us one, two, three more wins, that could push into the playoffs.\"\n\nKapler insists it's more about taking advantage of the superior defender than hiding a weaker fielder.\n\n\"It has nothing to do with any individual other than the guy we're moving to put in the ideal spot,\" he said. \"Think about it like this. If you have Ozzie Smith and you knew a ball was going to be hit where Ozzie can catch it, you would want Ozzie Smith near that ball. It's really about an exceptional defender and putting him in the right position to succeed.\"\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals right fielder Dexter Fowler doesn't buy it.\n\n\"I don't like that,\" Fowler said. \"If a guy is in left field, he should be a left fielder. If he's in right field, he should be a right fielder. If he's not capable of playing, he probably shouldn't be out there.\"\n\nKapler could be an innovator. Perhaps he starts a trend other managers will follow. Of course, it's not for everyone.\n\n\"I'm not going to experiment with it,\" Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"I'm not into moving my outfielders hitter to hitter, no. I've got confidence in my outfielders so I'm not into moving them hitter to hitter.\"\n\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ap -- robmaaddi\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball",

                "body": "Just the thought of Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge in the same lineup sent fans into a frenzy. Come opening day, all of baseball will see which teams really have the muscle.\n\nA season of haves and have-nots begins March 29 with Derek Jeter's pared-down Marlins playing the pumped-up Cubs. Later that day, the New York Yankees unleash their most potent pair of sluggers since Mantle & Maris.\n\nMVP Jose Altuve and the World Series champion Houston Astros added ace Gerrit Cole to a rotation with Dallas Keuchel and Justin Verlander. The Dodgers and Indians are still poised after coming within one win of that elusive crown. The Nationals hired a new manager to help free agent-to-be Bryce Harper, Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg reach the top. And the Red Sox got the bopper they needed.\n\nWhere does that leave the Reds, Pirates, Tigers, Rays and A's? Well, better luck next year. Or the year after that.\n\nMajor League Baseball is in a hurry these days, with record home runs and strikeouts the new norm. But please, get that last out in under three hours.\n\nA season that will include games in Mexico and Puerto Rico is set to start. And, if all goes as planned, the final game will come in October.\n\nHere's an early best-of-seven:\n\nWELCOME\n\nSlugger J.D. Martinez moves to Boston, which hit the fewest homers in the American League. Andrew McCutchen and Evan Longoria go to the retooling Giants, Jake Arrieta joins the rebuilding Phillies, Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain become part of the Brewers' outfield, Marcell Ozuna provides pop in St. Louis and Yu Darvish is now pitching for the Cubs. Also, six new managers: Alex Cora (Red Sox), Aaron Boone (Yankees), Dave Martinez (Nationals), Mickey Callaway (Mets) and Gabe Kapler (Phillies) try for the first time, and Ron Gardenhire (Tigers) returns after a four-year absence.\n\nWORTH WATCHING\n\nBabe Ruth or bust? We'll see whether newcomer Shohei Ohtani becomes the most successful two-way player in the bigs since the Bambino. The 23-year-old Japanese star struggled at the plate and on the mound this spring, but it's early. Tampa Ray reliever Jonny Venters has been out of the majors since 2012 while having three Tommy John surgeries. Alex Rodriguez, meanwhile, keeps getting more popular in retirement as he moves into the ESPN booth for Sunday night telecasts.\n\nHIYA\n\nIn a game of numbers, make way for some new letters to go along with ERA, OPS and WAR: MVs. Mound visits will be posted on scoreboards, tracking how many times catchers, infielders, managers and coaches go talk with a pitcher. It's part of MLB's new pace-of-play rules, designed to cut down the incessant back-and-forth between batteries. Teams are allowed six trips without making a change. After that, every visit requires a new pitcher. For sure, this will take a few weeks to sort out. And no shenanigans -- what if a shortstop thinks a reliever is out of gas, and trots to the mound on his own to force a switch?\n\nOUCH!\n\nDodgers catalyst Justin Turner is among several banged-up stars who will miss opening day. Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, Orioles closer Zach Britton, Milwaukee starter Jimmy Nelson and Blue Jays shortstop Troy Tulowitzki are out, Nationals second baseman Daniel Murphy is doubtful. Mariners ace Felix Hernandez is recovering from being hit by a line drive in spring training. Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel is healing from hand surgery, then will serve a five-game suspension for making an offensive gesture toward Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish during the World Series. Twins shortstop Jorge Polanco begins an 80-game drug ban, and will be ineligible if Minnesota makes the playoffs.\n\nYUMMY\n\nThe plate will be tasty -- at concession stands. In Texas, the Dilly Dog is a dill pickle, hollowed out and stuffed with a hot dog, served up battered and fried. PNC Park presents Greens and Grains that includes kale, quinoa, sunflower seeds and other healthy items. Fenway Park provides dessert, a creme brulee French toast topped with Vermont maple syrup. Want a bolder option? Try the Rocky Mountain Po'Boy at Coors Field. That's Rocky Mountain oysters, topped with guacamole, pico de gallo and more, on a roll (um, Rocky Mountain oysters aren't really seafood. In Colorado, that's what they call cattle testicles).\n\nFAN-TASTIC\n\nAll 30 teams will have expanded netting to protect fans, reaching at least to the far end of the dugouts. ... At Camden Yards, the Orioles will offer free tickets in the upper deck to kids 9 and under for the first month of the season. ... At the Coliseum, the A's are opening a garden beyond the outfield seats, growing produce and flowers in redwood planters. ... At Dodger Stadium, there will be bar stools behind the plate, plus a painted blue seat in right field to mark where Kirk Gibson's home run landed to win the 1988 World Series opener.\n\nTHE EX FACTOR\n\nFrom Triple-A Pawtucket down to rookie Pioneer League Idaho Falls, extra innings will have a different look in the minors. Every half-inning will start with a runner on second base. They say it'll shorten games and help preserve the arms of pitching prospects. They do this in the World Baseball Classic, international baseball and -- heck -- even Central Park softball. Purists, note: Commissioner Rob Manfred has stated this idea isn't being considered for any major league games that count. For real, right?",

He became expendable as rookies Dede Westbrook and Keelan Cole emerged into larger roles for the Jaguars in 2017.\n\nOn Thursday, the Cowboys signed Deonte Thompson to a one-year deal worth up to $2.5 million that included a $1 million signing bonus. Thompson is coming off his best season with 38 for 555 yards and two touchdowns, splitting time with the Chicago Bears and Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe Cowboys also were in the talks to sign Sammy Watkins, who signed a three-year, $48 million deal with the Kansas City Chiefs on the first day of free agency.\n\nIt all puts Dez Bryant's time with the Cowboys in jeopardy. Bryant is set to make $12.5 million this season and count $16.5 million against the salary cap in 2018.\n\nHurns, after catching 64 passes for 1,031 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2015, was signed to a four-year, $40.05 million extension in 2016 that included $20 million guaranteed. He is one of just four players in Jaguars franchise history to surpass 1,000 receiving yards in a season.\n\nSince signing that extension, however, Hurns has missed 11 games because of injury and has caught 74 passes for 961 yards and five touchdowns over the past two seasons.\n\nESPN's Todd Archer and Michael DiRocco contributed to this report.",

A lot of stuff is predicated off him attacking and drawing the defense, so we're obviously going to have to have a little better ball movement.

                "body": "Transcript for Jenna Fischer, Oliver Hudson talk 'Splitting Up Together' Thank you. We know each other from the movie \"Hall pass\". That's right. Ji played a shrishrink. I had to tell her to let her husband cheat and come back. Anyway, Jenna, I hear you're a big fan of \"The view.\" I am. And this is my first time being on the show. Oh, welcome. Plaus Yeah, I watched the 20th anniversary special and I, like, cried. It was so emotional. This show is like a time caps sewell -- capsule of current events. Everyone's been on it. And that's just the cast. Sorry, sorry. That's funny. But you know, so it's cool. It's special. I'm excited to be here finally. Good. So, so, we were talking about how your spouse can make you fat. Is that your experience? I think it's like a ride or die situation. Oh. That's a Meghan phrase. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, if we're going to eat together and then we're going to get skinny together, we're going to work out together, the problem is -- and this is actually happening right now currently in my marriage. She went to like this we care spa and she's all healthy. See. And I'm not. I'm on the couch doing what I'm doing, eating what I'm eating. Now she's giving me stuff for not -- but I'm like, wait a minute, hold on, this is not fair because when I'm working out or doing my thing, I don't give you crap. Exactly. You don't have to do the triathlon. No. You do you and I'll do me. That's what I think. That's right. I said, look, you do you. Yeah. And then I'll do me. You want to swim and run and bike, you do it. And we can do each other later. Is that legal? Yes. Jenna, you're married. What about you? I'm married, it will be eight years this July. Okay look -- oh that's before we had children. Look how rested we look. We look so rested. Oh, those days, I remember them. No, I feel like we both have that same, like, three to five pounds of like pumping that we -- Happy puj. That we wrestle with. Yo Yo? Yeah, you're like five pounds up. Now I'm at where I like it. But we sort of are the same. I have that too but it's 30 pounds. It's a range. In your new show, splitting up together, it's about a new phenomenon which is the first time I'm hearing about this, real-life divorcing couples bird nesting? Yeah. It makes sense, right? Why move the kids. Keep the house, get an apartment, the kids can stay in their place and the parents can move in and out. I think that's better. That's the idea. Isn't that what most people do? Most people do that. I wish that too. Most people get two different homes and the kids have to back a bag each week. In this we have to pack the bag and the kids stay in the home. What's difficult is that requires a lot of -- it's like you're divorced but you're still managing a home together and you're still co-parenting. And we go through this on the show where on mom week the chores get done and the house is clean and the fridge is stocked. And then when I come back from dad week, I come back to like a pile of laundry and an empty fridge. I'm like, no, no, no. So it's almost the same issues as being married. It is. Exactly. In a way. Without the sex. Without the sex. You don't even have to be divorced to relate to the show. You see other people? She sleeps with a couple guys right off the bat. What? Oh, my god. Because, I do. I'm a relationship guy. She's just out for fun. I'm looking for something stable. Oh, is that -- oh, okay. And you see the chemistry here and you see it on the show, and you guys say that you have that because you -- let me quote this correctly. You attribute it to the fact that you remind each other of your real-life spouses. This is true. How so? He is so much like Lee, and you tell me that I'm like your wife. Yeah, yeah. There's not a lot of getting into character. I feel like we're playing these amplified versions of ours. I'm fly by the seat of our pants. When the kids were babies, she would pack up bags for weather that would never come to los Angeles. Very important. Oh they're gorgeous. A beautiful family. I'll move out of the way. Yeah, so I'm more take a diaper and put it in my back pocket. That's who I am. Just one? Just one. If one kid pees, the other one's screwed. What he just explained gives me hives. That's heart palpitations to me. Like his wife I will pack -- this happened when my son was like a year old, there was a day I had to work. My husband was going to take him out for the day so I packed this elaborate diaper bag, changes of outfits and snacks and things to do. My husband left it at home. He put a clemmen tine in his pocket for the whole day. And I came home and I was like -- he's like, we lived. It was okay. So I like it. My husband and I balance each other out. I hate to plan. I hate to plan. It always backfires. I know something else about you because I have seen some of your social media. You like to show your butt on social media. What is that about? Do we have pictures? Oh! Why is the bar there? This is a family show. First of all, I think naked is just funny. Generally naked is funny. Does that run in your family? You know, this famous family, Goldie Hawn is your mom. Yeah. Does she like to pose naked also? Oh yeah. No, we do have a very naked family by the way. It always has been that way. Wow. You know, not to say that, like -- You're in malibu or something, right? I went on a long bike ride and I had to air it out. Wait, wait. Please say you didn't ride your bike like at. I took off my clothes. The sad part is my best friend Jesse was the one who had to take the picture. He's like, what are you doing, man. I'm like, don't worry about it, just take the picture. He's free. He feels free. Very freeing. Got to air the jewels every once in a while. I'm still laughing at the bar up there. You recently wrote a book called the actor's life to survive guide. You had some interesting gigs when you first started out. I had a chuckle. I did. I wrote a book about -- it's for aspiring actors and artists if they're wondering about the biz. So I studied theatre in college and I came out to L.A. And I was convinced that within six months a I was going to be a rich and famous actor even though I knew no one. And you were. You were successful pretty quickly if I recall. 8 years. That's not so bad. We know in perspective 8 years is actually a short amount of time. Yeah. But, um, so I thought my first big gig was going to be a TV show or movie or martin scorsese film and it was -- why are you making fun of me? She's got to go. I'm so sorry. So the end is that it was -- I played -- it was a sex education video for mental patients upon their release from the hospital. Not a bad gig. Yeah. I knew you were going places. I made $100. So great to have you two. You're a lot of fun. Our thanks to Jenna Fischer and Oliver Hudson. \"Splitting up together\" premieres Tuesday at 9:30 P.M. Right here on ABC.",

Even as Trump appears poised to formally approve the legislation, it only becomes official with his signature.\n\nThe president tweeted earlier Friday morning that he had been considering a veto.\n\nAfter Trump tweeted Friday morning some members of Congress like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, encouraged him to veto the measure.\n\nThis is a developing story. Please refresh for details.",

                "body": "After months of political upheaval in Peru, congress has accepted the resignation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, making way for a new government led by a little-known former governor.\n\nMartin Vizcarra will lead a nation where a vast majority of voters no longer have faith in their elected officials and a congress dominated by lawmakers loyal to the daughter former strongman Alberto Fujimori.\n\nHere's a look at what lies ahead for the Andean nation:\n\nKUZCYNSKI'S EXIT\n\nKuczynski becomes the first sitting president to exit office over his ties to Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction company at the center of Latin America's biggest corruption scandal. He has denied any wrongdoing. Two former Peruvian presidents are accused of accepting bribes from Odebrecht and a third is under investigation.\n\nWHO IS VIZCARRA?\n\nVizcarra, who celebrated his 55th birthday Thursday, is the former leader of a sparsely populated department in southern Peru who became vice president in 2016.\n\nHis brief stint as transportation minister ended following questions about his handling of a new airport being built near Cusco. More recently, he's served as Peru's ambassador to Canada, where he kept a low profile.\n\nA recent poll showed a majority of Peruvians don't know the vice president's name.\n\nNEW CHALLENGES?\n\nVizcarra will face many of the same obstacles that Kuczynski encountered, but there are a few factors that could work in his favor.\n\nThe opposition Popular Force party led by Keiko Fujimori has lost seats in congress: Her brother and a small faction of lawmakers abandoned the party following Kuczynski's pardon of the feuding siblings' father, former President Alberto Fujimori.\n\nKeiko Fujimori herself is under scrutiny for allegedly having accepted money from Odebrecht. The company has admitted to paying $800 million in bribes to officials around Latin American in exchange for public works contracts, including $29 million in Peru.\n\nWORK AHEAD\n\nAnalysts say that for Vizcarra to succeed, he will need to do something Kuczynski failed to master: Building alliances across Peru's political spectrum in order to pass legislation through congress.\n\nVizcarra is expected to continue Kuczynski's pro-business agenda, but he could start off on a different foot by appointing cabinet members from a wider range of Peru's political parties.",

                "title": "Foreign adoptions by US families drop by 12 percent",
                "body": "The number of foreign children adopted by U.S. parents dropped more than 12 percent last year, accelerating a decline that's now continued for 13 years, according to new State Department figures.\n\nSharp drops in adoptions from China and Congo more than offset notable increases from many countries, including India, Colombia and Nigeria.\n\nThe department's report for the 2017 fiscal year, released Friday, shows 4,714 adoptions from abroad, down from 5,372 in 2016 and nearly 80 percent below the high of 22,884 in 2004. The number has fallen every year since then.\n\nChina, as has been the case for several years, accounted for the most children adopted in the U.S. by far. But its total of 1,905 was down nearly 15 percent from 2016 and far below a peak of 7,903 in 2005.\n\nSuzanne Lawrence, the State Department's special adviser on children's issues, attributed the lower numbers to increased interest in domestic adoption among China's growing middle class. She also said new Chinese regulations affecting non-governmental organizations had disrupted partnerships involving some U.S. adoption agencies.\n\nIn 2016, Congo was second after China, accounting for 359 adoptions. The number fell to four in 2017 as the Congolese government -- which has been concerned about adoption fraud -- halted international adoptions pending a possible overhaul of regulations.\n\nReplacing Congo as No. 2 in the new report was Ethiopia, accounting for 313 adoptions. It was followed by South Korea, Haiti, India, Ukraine, Colombia and Nigeria.\n\nFor a third straight year, there were no adoptions from Russia, which once accounted for hundreds of U.S. adoptions annually, but imposed a ban that fully took effect in 2014. The ban served as retaliation for a U.S. law targeting alleged Russian human-rights violators.\n\nAccording to the new report, 83 children were adopted from the United States to seven foreign countries, including 41 to Canada and 20 to the Netherlands.\n\nLawrence noted that international adoptions have been declining worldwide, and said the United States accounts for half of the total, including large numbers of children with special medical and psychological needs.\n\nHowever, the National Council for Adoption, and many of the adoption agencies it represents, have faulted the State Department for failing to reverse the decline in foreign adoptions. This constituency has decried a newly implemented accrediting system that will subject them to tighter monitoring and oversight, and raise fees either for the agencies or for the families they serve.\n\n\"The number of orphaned, abandoned, and relinquished children worldwide continues to grow, yet international adoptions continue to decline,\" Chuck Johnson, CEO of the adoption council, said in an email. \"Does the number have to reach zero before top officials at the Department of State will admit that their policies are failing children miserably?\"\n\nJohnson called on Congress and President Donald Trump's administration to investigate whether officials in the department's Office of Children's Issues were \"purposefully sabotaging intercountry adoption.\"\n\nThus far, the State Department has taken a tough stance in the face of such criticism, warning that foreign adoptions by U.S. families might grind to a halt if the new accrediting system is disrupted.\n\nAssistant Secretary of State Carl Risch, whose dossier includes the Office of Children's Issues, issued a statement Thursday saying efforts to maintain international adoption as a viable option \"are greatly undermined when foreign countries lose trust in our accreditation system.\"\n\n\"The Department will continue its efforts to ensure that the best interests of children and families, both birth and adoptive, are paramount and that they are protected,\" he said, stressing the need for stringent oversight of U.S. adoption agencies and foreign adoption practices.\n\nConcerns about corruption, child-trafficking and baby-selling have prompted the United States to suspend adoptions from several countries in recent years, including Cambodia, Guatemala and Nepal. Domestically, the State Department shut down an Ohio-based adoption agency 14 months ago after alleging extensive improprieties in handling international adoptions.\n\nAmong other efforts to improve adoption practices, the department is pressuring the agencies to comply with requirements by foreign governments to regularly submit post-adoption reports on the welfare of the adopted children. Negligence in this regard had prompted some countries to warn they might reconsider their support for adoptions to the U.S.\n\nFollow David Crary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/CraryAP",
