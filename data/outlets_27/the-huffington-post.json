                "body": "For some, a lipstick is just a lipstick. But for others, it's a source of strength, creativity and expression. In our series Power Faces, we'll explore the relationship between strong women and the makeup they choose to wear -- or not. Our eighth subject, Scarlett Costello, is a model and student living in New York City.\n\nI love my eyebrows now, but to be honest, I don't really think of them. I was born with a unibrow, so these are just my eyebrows, you know what I mean? But I did start waxing them at a really young age, probably in sixth or seventh grade. My mom is a hairdresser, so I grew up in a salon basically my whole life. I'd be there with her after school, and the waxing woman, who's my mom's friend, would wax my eyebrow because I was embarrassed of it. Then in high school I just became a lot more confident, and became attracted to things that no one else had. Like with clothing, I liked to dress like no one else would -- I just like the individuality of it.",

                "body": "Engagement rings may no longer be required to cost three months' worth of income, but they are still pretty expensive. It might be the last thing on your mind when you got engaged, but just like any other forms of valuables, financial protection is called for in case something bad happens to it.\n\n\"People often make the mistake in thinking that an engagement ring is automatically insured under a homeowners policy,\" says Jerry Ehrenwald, president and CEO of the International Gemological Institute. \"However, many policies only provide limited coverage, which could leave you footing the bill -- or a big chunk of it -- if you need to replace an expensive item.\" Every couple should consider a insurance policy appropriate for their ring.

I carry that trauma everywhere I go.\"\n\nThe teen, who is an activist and youth leader in Los Angeles, spoke passionately about the need not only for gun law reform but also for drastic cultural change in schools. She emphasized that more guns and more police on campuses is not the answer, noting that cops in schools are more likely to \"profile and criminalize\" black and brown students than to make them feel safe.\n\n\"Arming teachers will not work,\" Chavez said. \"More security in our schools does not work. Zero tolerance policies do not work. They make us feel like criminals. We should feel empowered and supported in our schools.\"",

                "title": "Opinion | We Can Cure Tuberculosis If World Leaders Step Up",
                "body": "We are at a critical moment in the fight against tuberculosis (TB). On one hand, we have saved 53 million lives since 2000. On the other, TB remains the leading infectious disease killer, responsible for 1.7 million deaths in 2016, even though it is preventable, treatable and curable.\n\nOn this World TB Day, we as a global community have a choice: We can either chip away at the problem or we can insist that our leaders take direct aim to stop TB.\n\nI believe that we are becoming part of a movement that says, \"It is TB's time.\"\n\nWe saw the beginnings of this global movement at the historic meeting in Moscow last November, when Russian President Vladimir Putin in his keynote speech expressed his personal commitment to ending TB in Russia. And just last week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reaffirmed his government's commitment to end TB by 2025 and stressed the need for all partners to come together to reach this goal.\n\nWorld leaders are showing real commitment toward eradicating this deadly disease and for the first time ever, they will gather to specifically focus on TB as we head into the U.N. High Level Meeting (UNHLM) on TB in September. For those of us who have participated in the U.N. High Level Meetings on AIDS, we have seen how bringing leaders together around one issue is a very powerful motivator for action. And there is no doubt action is needed.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately one-third of the world's population carries the TB bacteria, with about 10.4 million of whom developing \"active\" TB each year. Globally in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people developed drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and an estimated 4.1 million new cases of TB have not been officially reported. Moreover, only one in five cases of MDR-TB began treatment, while most who are eligible for preventive treatment are not receiving it.\n\nMore than 95 percent of TB cases and deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa and the Western Pacific. TB primarily affects adults during their most productive years, greatly impacting the livelihood of families while also threatening already vulnerable economies in developing nations. Of the estimated 10.4 million new cases of TB globally, a million are found in people living with HIV. More than 1,000 people infected with HIV die every day from TB. As the former U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and the current U.N. Special Envoy on TB, I can attest to the fact that HIV/AIDS and TB are true partners in crime.\n\nThe spread of this disease is a global crisis that's beginning to hit close to home. No one is immune to TB. It is airborne, highly contagious and knows no borders. And with the growing challenge of MDR-TB or TB-HIV co-infection, TB could spread quickly with a tremendous impact on all Americans. In 2017, 97 cases of MDR-TB occurred in the United States.\n\nI have my own prior history with TB. When I was a young doctor, I was diagnosed with latent tuberculosis. I was fortunate. I was diagnosed, the active disease was ruled out and I received treatment with Isoniazid for six months, which successfully rid my body of the disease.\n\nThis is not the case for everyone. Some people remain undiagnosed. Some find the regimen too difficult to follow or, particularly in the developing world, too expensive. Others become resistant to the drugs they are using. And while we now have improved treatment options for latent TB, we must get better at delivering them to patients in need.\n\nOur heads of states hold the keys to unlocking the stranglehold of TB.\n\nAs we head toward the UNHLM on TB, I am honored to be co-chairing the Lancet Commission on TB, which is working to issue recommendations on how to put the world on a path to defeating the disease. The commission is focused on four areas for action. First, we must ensure implementation of evidence-based strategies to combat the disease. While the world is in need of new tools and innovations, we must continue to build on what we already know is working to prevent, detect and treat TB.\n\nSecond, it is critical that we invest in TB research and development. Treating the 10.4 million people with TB around the world, and the approximately 4 million who are undiagnosed or untreated, means aggressively fostering innovation, research and development. While we are seeing promising development results, current tools simply cannot address the growing challenge of MDR-TB or TB-HIV co-infection.\n\nThird, significant resources must be dedicated to implement strategies to end TB. The disease is among the most cost effective health interventions. The commission is reviewing data to provide guidance on country investments for health and finance ministers.\n\nFinally, we must address the serious social, financial and clinical barriers to care that undermine TB control efforts - and include civil society in the discussion. It is my hope that the commission's report will provide a roadmap for countries as they tackle their TB epidemics.\n\nIt is also my hope that between now and the UNHLM in September, all who care about ending TB use their voices to demand that their leaders act. We have the cure for TB - now we need the will. Our heads of states hold the keys to unlocking the stranglehold of TB. Some have recognized the problem and are taking steps to reduce the incidence in their countries - but more countries must step up to the plate.\n\nWe are at a moment. We have waited years - some of us decades - for this moment. Let us seize it and build a TB-free world once and for all. It's TB's time.\n\nAmbassador Eric Goosby, MD, is the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Tuberculosis.",

And the meeting came two months after bipartisan negotiations began in the Senate -- negotiations Trump has mostly stayed out of.\n\nAny deal on DACA will require Democratic support, in part because some of the Republicans involved in Thursday's meeting have opposed proposals that give legal status to undocumented immigrants. The Republican senators who attended the meeting were John Cornyn (R-Texas), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Tillis -- of them, only Graham is still heavily involved in talks with Democrats on Dreamers.

But as the president tried to pit U.S. citizens and Dreamers against each other, many on Twitter raised their voices in solidarity with immigrants.\n\nTrump cited the 2016 killing of two New York teens by members of the MS-13 gang while pushing for his new immigration plan, seemingly comparing millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. to violent gang members.\n\n\"For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities,\" Trump said during his speech. \"They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\"\n\nThis maneuver left many Americans on Twitter unimpressed, as they called out the president and declared their solidarity with immigrants. Some even pointed to studies that show immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born citizens.\n\nJust because you are an inmigrant does not mean you are a criminal. If Trump cannot get it now, he will never get it. Make your voice count. -- Carmen Yulín Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz)\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nJust to be clear: Trump brought out a grieving family to use as a part of a political performance meant to demonize immigrants as being inherently violent when the research clearly shows that immigrants, both documented & undocumented, commit less crime than native born Americans -- Clint Smith (@ClintSmithIII)\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nAll immigrants have merit and all immigrants have need. No one leaves their home frivolously and everyone deserves a chance at what we were lucky enough to be born into. -- Jesse Thorn (@JesseThorn)\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nI reject this administration's bigotry.\n\nI believe in a kinder America, where immigrants are welcomed and embraced, and are free to pursue the American dream.\n\nIf you do too, please support @UNITEDWEDREAM: https://t.co/RMhKLqrpuU #StateOfTheDream pic.twitter.com/DIyWzmC86l -- Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano)\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nWe have become numbed to the vileness of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric--but it's pure racism & deeply un-American. In last night's \"unifying\" speech he once again tried to link all immigrants to murder, rape & danger. -- David Rothkopf (@djrothkopf)\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nWhether you support the President or not, this can't be changed: immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born people. 40 MILLION of our neighbors are foreign-born. Few are MS-13. -- Ray Suarez (@RaySuarezNews)\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nMany politicians who attended the SOTU also showed their support.\n\nDaisy was my guest at the State of the Union. Smart, driven, kind and generous. She's a Dreamer. Works two jobs, takes care of her family, believes in her country. She's the example of how immigrants make us safer, stronger, a greater country. #sotu pic.twitter.com/j9MV5FfOgs -- Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke)\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nWhy is that whenever the President speaks of immigration it always seems to be in the context of gang members and murderers? There were dozens of DREAMers at the #SOTU tonight who could teach him a lot about immigrants. -- Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff)\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nPerhaps most notably, immigrants and children of immigrants spoke out in response to Trump's divisive rhetoric. Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and former U.S. Chief Data Scientist DJ Patil even listed the ways in which they've contributed to the country as immigrants.\n\nNever forget immigrants, and children of immigrants, can and have done it all in America, most of the time without speaking English as our first language. And we still do it all - usually harder, better, faster and stronger. Because we have to. You're welcome. #SOTU -- Wajahat Ali (@WajahatAli)\n\nJanuary 31, 2018",

Maybe even the most expensive television show ever made.\n\nAmazon already paid around $250 million just to acquire the rights to create this project. Now it's looking like the company will spend another $250 million on production.\n\nOf course, money isn't really a problem for Amazon.

But instead it will probably be a heartwarming tale in the vein of a David vs. Goliath story to make you feel like Amazon is \"good\" and on your side. Can't wait!",

Vulture had a great essay about what the end of that show means. \"Portlandia\" remained very funny until the end. It didn't seem to earn much attention, but there's this amazing and long horse-related sketch in the new season that you should seek out.\n\nAnother recommendation on Vulture is the outlet's quiz titled \"How Well Do You Know Your Generic Network Dramas?\" That quiz is surprisingly very hard. Did you know that show \"Bull\" is based off Dr. Phil's life? What the hell.\n\nNews about Netflix, Hulu and Amazon at those respective Streamline articles.",

They're going to be millionaires! Millie Bobby Brown will apparently be making even more than the rest of the kids. The two main adults, Winona Ryder and David Harbour, will be making around $350,000 an episode. This news also comes right after last week's Netflix controversy about Claire Foy earning less than Matt Smith on \"The Crown,\" despite playing the queen. The producers of \"The Crown\" apologized.\n\nAmy Poehler is going to have her directorial debut with Netflix. The movie is called \"Wine Country\" and stars Poehler, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer, Paula Pell, Maya Rudolph and Emily Spivey -- and features Tina Fey. The story focuses on a group of friends going to Napa, California, for a 50th birthday party.\n\nThe upcoming season of \"13 Reasons Why\" will have a warning message that points to mental health resources. The first season graphically depicted a suicide and arguably glorified the act. It was wildly popular and so there was concern that teens may be inspired to commit suicide themselves after watching the show.\n\nNetflix secured the international rights to the entire \"Monty Python\" back catalog. Those movies will join the service in the United States later this year. If you live in the United Kingdom or Canada, you can start streaming them on April 15.\n\nThe New York Times is getting its own Netflix show. Specifically the New York Times Magazine's column \"Diagnosis\" is getting adapted. The column has focused on mysterious illnesses and was an inspiration for the show \"House.\" If columns are getting shows now, Netflix should consider the far less popular and less deserving column, Streamline, for a show.

It's an all-too-familiar story in a country that has already seen more than a dozen school shootings in 2018 alone.\n\nBut this shooting was different. The students who survived the slaughter stood up, demanding that those in power act to stop making assault-style rifles so easy to obtain.\n\nAt a vigil following the shooting, Parkland students chanted \"No more guns!\" The next day, students at a high school just a couple of dozen miles down the road from Douglas walked out of school to protest a lack of action on gun control. And one day after that, more than a thousand Floridians gathered around the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale to demand action.\n\nOne of the leading voices of the movement, Douglas student Emma Gonzalez, first made her voice heard at the courthouse protest.\n\nThe protests that started in Florida had a snowball effect across the country. On March 14, one month after the shooting, thousands of students across the country left their classes -- some facing punishment for the act of civil disobedience -- to demand gun reform.\n\nThrough all this, the survivors have been told they're too young to have opinions. They've been attacked by politicians. They've been called crisis actors. Yet it hasn't deterred them from making sure more children don't die.",

                "title": "Kacey Musgraves Dreams Of A Day When 'We Have A Gay Country Music Icon'",
                "body": "\"If we had someone who could be that voice, a first-person account of that voice in our genre, I think it could be a really powerful thing.\"\n\nKacey Musgraves has been one of country music's most outspoken LGBTQ-friendly voices since 2013, when the singer released \"Follow Your Arrow,\" a song that urged listeners to \"make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys, or kiss lots of girls, if that's what you're into.\"\n\nSince then, she's played Pride festivals and charity events for LGBTQ organizations. In 2015, Musgraves held a record release party alongside drag queens at a popular Nashville gay club. And last year, she penned a \"love letter\" to the LGBTQ community to mark the start of Pride Month, in which she described her own evolution on the issue of equality.\n\nBut now, five years after releasing the song that became a \"queer country anthem,\" Musgraves is ready for someone else to assume her mantle: namely, an artist who, unlike her, is gay.\n\n\"I keep dreaming of the day when we have a gay country music icon, that is loud and proud and really, like, a hero for country music fans, especially in these small towns where [LGBTQ people] are terrified of being themselves and feel like they have to hide,\" Musgraves, 29, told HuffPost in a recent interview ahead of the release of \"Golden Hour,\" her latest album set for release March 30.\n\n\"If we had someone who could be that voice, a first-person account of that voice in our genre,\" she said, \"I think it could be a really powerful thing.\"\n\nThere have been notable country music singers who have come out as gay: in particular, Chely Wright, who came out in 2010, and Ty Herndon, who followed four years later. But while Wright and Herndon still perform and release new music, they were both more than a decade removed from their last major chart successes by the time they came out.\n\nWright and Herndon received support -- mostly of the quiet variety -- from within country music industry, they both told HuffPost. But their decisions to come out also didn't fully break down the barriers facing LGBTQ people in country music, an industry with a deserved reputation as a somewhat unfriendly place for gay artists and fans.\n\n\"I think that the rap that country music gets for being a bit homophobic, or a lot homophobic, we come by that honestly,\" Wright said.\n\nThese days, Nashville is moving toward broader acceptance of LGBTQ people, Herndon told HuffPost, especially as more and more people within country have come out, and an increasing number of industry insiders have spoken out in favor of equality.\n\nShane McAnally, who helped write \"Follow Your Arrow\" and is one of Nashville's most accomplished songwriters, came out in 2013. In January 2017, Country Music Television host Cody Alan did, too. And Brandy Clark, a songwriter who co-wrote \"Follow Your Arrow,\" is now perhaps the closest thing country has to that openly gay star Musgraves is dreaming of.\n\nEarlier this month, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) resigned from the Country Music Association's board of directors thanks to backlash over his anti-LGBTQ views from country musicians and industry insiders.\n\nBut Herndon still isn't sure the industry is ready to put an openly gay singer center stage, especially because many inside it fear alienating a fan base that skews toward traditional and cultural conservatism.\n\n\"Can there be an openly gay guy or girl on the radio singing about their hearts and who they love?\" Herndon asked. \"I think we're getting to a place in Nashville where the industry would do it. I just don't know how the fans would react to it.\"\n\nIn 2013, when Musgraves released \"Follow Your Arrow,\" some industry insiders were skittish about a young artist releasing such a politically charged song so early in her career.\n\n\"I was told ... that it would tank and that it would be terrible for me,\" Musgraves said. \"But I said, 'I don't really care.' I think it's a message we need, and I liked the song.\"\n\n\"Follow Your Arrow\" didn't tank. Instead, it became one of Musgraves' most successful singles, rising to No. 10 on Billboard's Hot Country Chart -- which combines radio play with sales and online data -- and earning Song of the Year honors from the Country Music Association.\n\nStill, the song was a relative failure on the radio, peaking only at No. 43 on Billboard's Country Airplay Chart, which measures radio play exclusively. It was a sign that many country stations were at least a little reticent to play it, and yet another indication of the power country music's fan base has over radio programmers and producers' decisions.\n\n\"The third rail of country is sexuality,\" said Keith Hill, a longtime radio programmer. \"Ninety-nine percent of it is guys getting excited about a country girl.\"\n\nBut with \"Follow Your Arrow,\" Hill said, country radio \"missed an opportunity\" to have a true \"sea-change moment.\"\n\n\"Most [radio producers and programmers] are not homophobic, but they know their fan base,\" Wright said. \"They know who calls in on morning drive, who's calling in on afternoon drive, who's showing up at appreciation shows. Putting the onus on radio guys and gals is probably unfair, but a significant portion of their fan base -- their political and faith based allegiances lean right, and they know it.\"\n\nStill, it's obvious to artists like Herndon and Wright what sort of impact an openly gay singer can have on their own fans. For Herndon, it's not uncommon to look out during his performances and see \"two cowboy hats two-stepping together,\" or for younger fans who've recently come out to approach him after shows they attended with their parents.\n\n\"We have a large rate of suicide in the South, and around the country, from LGBTQ kids,\" Herndon said. \"And having a kid come to your show and finding out they're 14 and the parents brought them because he just came out to them, I get emotional.\"\n\nMusgraves' newest album, \"Golden Hour,\" doesn't include anything quite as outspoken \"Follow Your Arrow.\" But her activism hasn't stopped: She played an LGBTQ benefit dinner in Manhattan in late January.\n\n\"I look out at all of my shows and I see gay couples singing and crying and holding each other, and it makes me feel good that they feel like they have a safe place at my shows to be themselves,\" she said.\n\nAnd while country music may not have its openly gay superstar yet, that won't stop Musgraves from arguing that it's a place where LGBTQ artists should be welcome to tell their own stories. McAnally in particular, she noted, has written major hits for nearly every big-time country star, including Sam Hunt, Kenny Chesney and Miranda Lambert, because the stories and topics that form the backbone of country music are universal.\n\n\"Country music has always been about real life,\" Musgraves said. \"If you look back at Hank Williams and Willie Nelson and all them, their songs were all about heartbreak ... and divorce and cheating and losing your job, and all these things that are struggles in everyday life.\"",

The actress was nominated for an Oscar for the role. When she arrived at the award ceremony, she made her mark in a stunning (yet age appropriate) emerald green gown.\n\nFrom there, her red carpet style matured with her. Over the years, Ronan has proven she's not afraid to rake style risks, whether that means sporting a bright red jumpsuit, mixing prints or playing with different silhouettes.\n\nStylist Elizabeth Saltzman (No. 4 on The Hollywood Reporter's Most Powerful Stylists list) is partly responsible for putting together some of Ronan's most memorable red carpet looks, including the stunning mermaid-esque Calvin Klein gown she wore to the Oscars in 2016, and the sophisticated Versace gown from this year's Golden Globes.\n\nWe can't wait to see what she wears next as she continues on the award show circuit.

                "title": "Opinion | Trump Wants His Cabinet To Serve His Ego, Not The Nation",
                "body": "In commenting on his decision to remove Secretary of State Rex Tillerson from his position last week, President Donald Trump explained to reporters at the White House, \"We were not really thinking the same. Really, it was a different mindset, a different thinking.\"\n\nThat different way of thinking had been apparent from the start of Tillerson's stint at State, visible not only in the secretary's disagreement with Trump on how best to handle North Korea, but also in the pettier matters that have come to define this pitiful presidency. Tillerson, a former Eagle Scout, reportedly objected to Trump's gross politicization of his visit to the Boy Scout Jamboree over the summer. And he found the president's ability to command basic facts so unimpressive that he reportedly referred to Trump as a moron in front of other administration officials.\n\nWhile the coming negotiations with North Korea's Kim Jong Un provided a useful cover for Trump's hasty actions, Tillerson's exit really owed to his failure to fall in line with the president, something Trump assured reporters would not be a problem with his new appointee to State, Mike Pompeo. \"We're always on the same wavelength,\" Trump said of Pompeo.\n\nPerhaps anticipating more criticism of the continually revolving door that is the White House these days, Trump defended his move. \"I'm really at a point where we're getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things I want,\" Trump explained, as if the West Wing's constant turnover was some refining process of personnel rather than a crisis of presidential leadership.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump continued his staffing shuffle, naming John Bolton as his new national security adviser in place of H.R. McMaster. Trump's selection of Bolton, the warmongering U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under George W. Bush, is a chilling prospect for those who hoped Trump's saber-rattling with North Korea might be tempered by cooler heads inside the White House. Bolton is an aggressive hawk who is certain to cheerlead Trump's worst impulses.\n\nAll of these moves undercut Trump's businessman boasts that he would bring only the \"best people\" to Washington, of course. But they also make plain that the real business of this administration is to serve Trump's ego rather than the nation. In cutting out dissenters or even strong counterweights in his administration for the steady stream of sycophants and, let's not forget, fawning family members he has gathered around him, Trump has ensured his White House will never be mistaken for Abraham Lincoln's \"team of rivals.\" Instead, Trump is assembling a cabal of cronies.\n\nIn early American administrations, presidential Cabinets often included fractious elements who battled with each other and their president over what the young nation's course should be. But Lincoln's decision to appoint the three men he had defeated for the Republican nomination in 1860 - William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward Bates - along with three former Democrats to his Cabinet established the adversarial model that subsequent presidents would follow.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt may have best continued the tradition. Faced with the challenges of leading the country through the Great Depression and up against a Republican Party that wanted him to fail, FDR might have chosen a Cabinet that affirmed his every step. Instead, Roosevelt selected a team of advisers notorious for arguing and rarely in agreement. Believing the best ideas would arise out of this maelstrom, FDR understood that he would have to first take on counterarguments inside his own ranks if he hoped to bring about the large-scale changes he desired for the country.\n\nOther presidents followed suit. John F. Kennedy chose two Republicans to fill spots in his Cabinet, a move he hoped demonstrated a bipartisan spirit after a razor-thin win over Richard Nixon in 1960. Just as FDR had wanted his staff to challenge his ideas on how to deal with the nation's economic crisis, JFK purposefully sought voices of disagreement as he determined how to handle the escalating tensions with the Soviet Union. The strategy paid off during the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nMore recently, George W. Bush assembled a Cabinet that included powerful, qualified officials, including Robert Gates and Colin Powell, to fill in the spots where his inexperience would show. (Trump has shown no similar thoughtfulness about how a carefully selected Cabinet could help cover up his glaring inadequacies as chief executive.)\n\nBarack Obama frequently cited Lincoln's \"team of rivals\" style of leadership as the reason for stocking his administration with his former competitors for the Democratic nomination, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, and picking three Republicans for his Cabinet. (One of those, Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, withdrew from consideration before he was confirmed as secretary of commerce, however.)\n\nTrump is no student of history, certainly, and his leadership style veers more to the impulsive than the pragmatic. Still, it's worth taking stock of the personality cult Trump has built for himself inside the White House, and what it means for the nation that he is using the presidency as his personal form of therapy.\n\nStaff members provide Trump with folders twice a day filled with favorable news articles, flattering tweets, and even pictures of the president for him to pore over. This for a man who can't be bothered to read national security briefings, we might remember.\n\nRecall also the Cabinet meetings that have begun with Trump calling on each member to praise him and express appreciation for working for him. Other presidents usually prefer hearing updates about the work those secretaries' departments are carrying out, but Trump has made clear to those around him that what he most wants to hear is how well they think he is doing. The nation can take care of itself.\n\nThat's not to say there's no pushback. But Tillerson's experience shows what a self-defeating approach that voicing dissent can be in this White House. Jeff Sessions may be the next to learn the lesson. Although one of Trump's first and most enthusiastic backers, Sessions now finds himself on the outs with the president and possibly next in the firing line due to his refusal to follow some of Trump's ideas about how to use the Justice Department.\n\nWhether Sessions stays or goes, Trump will continue to use the threat of expulsion to draw out unquestioning adherence and unwavering loyalty - his favorite word - from those around him. But most of that effort will be merely for show. Trump consults few of his advisers, in fact, and relies mostly on his own flawed and impetuous judgment. In the end, this emperor has no close associates.\n\nFrighteningly, Trump's tendencies for isolation and self-direction will only increase in whatever time he has left in office. As The New York Times reported this week, Trump, having grown confident in the role of president, now feels \"newly emboldened\" to ignore the advice of those around him and follow only his own instincts.\n\nAfter more than a year in office, Trump may have finally found his sea legs. But that doesn't change the fact that he's captaining the Titanic while his obsequious lackeys in the White House quietly rearrange the deck chairs.\n\nNeil J.

When shots rang out, elite police stormed the building to kill the assailant. Police sources said Beltrame was shot three times.\n\nPolice arrested two people after the attack, one of them a woman connected to Lakdim, on Friday and a 17-year-old man said to be one of his friends overnight, judicial sources said.\n\nThe Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the attack. Macron said security services were checking that claim.\n\nMore than 240 people have been killed in France in attacks since 2015 by assailants who either pledged allegiance to Islamic State or were inspired by the ultra-hardline group.\n\nFrance is part of a group of countries whose warplanes have been bombing Islamic State strongholds in Iraq and Syria, where in recent months IS has lost much of a self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" of territory it seized in 2014.\n\nOne multiple attack by Islamist gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015 while another killed close to 90 when a man ran a truck into partying crowds in the Riviera seaside city of Nice in July 2016.\n\nBeltrame, who is survived by his wife, was a qualified parachutist who served in Iraq in 2005. He also worked as part of the elite Republican Guard that protects the presidential Elysee Place offices and residence in Paris, Macron said.\n\nFriday's assault was the first deadly Islamist attack in France since October 2017, when a man stabbed two young women to death in the port city of Marseille before soldiers killed him.\n\nSeveral attacks over the past year or more have targeted police and soldiers deployed in big numbers to protect civilians and patrol sensitive spots such as airports and train stations.\n\nMacron said of Beltrame: \"In offering himself as a hostage to the terrorist holed up in the Trebes supermarket, lieutenant colonel Beltrame saved the life of a civilian hostage, showing exceptional self-sacrifice and courage.\"\n\nThe news of Beltrame's death was first announced France's interior minister, who said in a Twitter post: \"Dead for his country. France will never forget his heroism, bravery and sacrifice.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide Editing by Mark Heinrich)",

In contrast, 63 percent of white women who voted did so for Moore.\n\n\"America got one more confirmation that Black women are superheroes who save the day time and time again,\" wrote Luvvie Ajayi, author of I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual on her blog after the election. \"I am tired of the world being run into the ground by white men who prove time and time again that they are ill-equipped.\"\n\nAjayi was inspired to find a list of black women politicians she could support. Not finding any, she enlisted the help of three friends to create Black Women in Politics, a living document of black female candidates seeking election in 2018. It's now an online database that includes more than 400 names.\n\nTo start, Ajayi, along with friends Sili Recio, Lucrecer Braxton and Candace Jones, searched through Twitter mentions, polls and did some old-fashioned googling, gathering more than 100 names of women seeking election in 2018.\n\nThe list doubled in under a month, and its creators enlisted the help of a coder to help them turn it into a searchable database. They ultimately moved the database from Ajayi's personal website to its own domain.\n\nBlack women vote in higher numbers than any other demographic, yet are underrepresented in political positions of power.\n\nThe site's mission statement explains why the database is so crucial.\n\n\"There are Black women running for political office all over the United States, and we need to know who they are,\" it reads. \"It is abundantly clear that we need to start following the lead of Black women, because we show up and do what is important, even when we are being disenfranchised and sabotaged from doing the work.\"\n\nAs of Jan. 25, the database has 414 entries. Visitors can filter the candidates by searching for women running for federal seats, state seats and local seats. They can also choose to view candidates running specifically in blue or red states. There's a section detailing which candidates are incumbents and which are challengers, as well as a page where where users can suggest more politicians to be added.\n\nThe database includes a disclaimer noting it is not an endorsement of every woman running.\n\n\"Think about it as a phone book,\" the site states.\n\nWith midterm elections happening this November, it's especially important for information on black female candidates to be easily accessible for those seeking to support them, Ayaji wrote on her blog.\n\nShe added that the database is just the first step. People should use the information provided in the list as a starting point for supporting these candidates.\n\n\"The goal is to make it easier to find the information we need to support those we have got to support,\" she wrote.",

                "body": "Getting the Duchess of Cambridge's wavy locks is WAY cheaper than you think.\n\nThough the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are themselves relatively tight-lipped about their personal lives, the secret to getting Kate Middleton's gorgeous, lustrous locks isn't anymore.\n\nThanks to a since-deleted Instagram post this week from Kate's personal hair stylist, we now know just how many products it takes to get those royal-ready locks, and it's a lot. Thirteen brushes, six combs, three curling irons and two blow dryers, to be exact. That's in addition to an array of styling products and finishing serums.\n\nAmong them are some surprisingly affordable drugstore brands like L'Oréal's $11 extra strong hairspray. The product most likely responsible for taming Kate's nonexistent flyaways is Kiehl's $16 Creme With Silk Groom.\n\nThough it sounds like an unusually large number of hair tool and products for one person, it's not that unusual for a traveling stylist to overpack with multiple options. The news of Kate's haircare routine comes just as it's revealed that she donated 7 inches of her well-maintained locks to charity this week.\n\nFor those interested in getting Kate's trademark waves for themselves, here are a few of the products revealed in her hair stylist's photo:\n\nHuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.",

                "body": "I have dry hands. Not ashy-and-flaky kind of dry, but crack-and-bleed kind of dry. Needless to say, I've been on the hunt for lotions and potions to actually cure my aching knuckles, not just soothe them.\n\nThe best remedy I've found is also probably the absolute ugliest. Labeled an \"As Seen On TV\" product, Miracle Of Aloe's Miracle Hand Repair is somehow the best dry-skin salve I've used, while also managing to be the only one I want to stealthily tuck away when guests come over.\n\nMade with 60 percent aloe vera leaf juice, this cream goes on thick -- almost like triple antibiotic ointment -- but not greasy. Rubbing it in is a full-blown ordeal. Though it's scentless, it looks like it would and should have a menthol odor. But, appearances are deceiving.\n\nThe first time I used it, my hands felt instantly smoother, softer and, I dare say, brighter -- probably due to a miraculous lack of ashiness. And, because it also comes in tiny travel sizes, I no longer need to hoard tiny lotion bottles in my bags while on the go. It even comes in a Miracle Foot Repair Cream, which I can only imagine is just as gloriously healing as the hand lotion.\n\nIt seems I'm not alone in my love for this grandma-looking hand cream. It has a rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars on Amazon, where users can't get enough of it:\n\n\"Love this product. Have tried others but none worked like this one. My son has cracked hands & this is helping him. Using this & his hands don't hurt like they did.\" -- Amazon Reviewer\n\n\"My hands are severly chapped, flakey and red due to chemo meds that I must take. I've tried so many creams, ointments, body butters....you name it. Then someone told me about this stuff, so I thought what the heck. It has sure helped! While it hasn't gone away completely, it has helped with the flakeyness and redness. I would recommend it.\" -- Amazon Reviewer\n\n\"No pun intended, but, hands down the best hand cream I've ever used. Every winter I get small extremely painful cracks at my finger tips. This cream works in well and leaves my hands feeling light and smooth with a very faint fragrance, not greasy and unable to touch anything. Cracks heal quickly. Great product.\" -- Amazon Reviewer\n\nThe only big downside to this product is that it's not entirely made with clean, all-natural ingredients, despite its high aloe vera content. But still, if you need a solution for dry and cracked hands and knuckles, this is the best fix I've found that not only cures the symptoms, but helps prevent dryness in the first place.\n\nStill skeptical? Find it on Amazon and give it a try yourself, or get it for $1 cheaper on Jet.\n\nHuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.",

John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) for allowing Trump to make them \"look like flakes.\" He also advised them to \"bail now\" in order to \"save their faces.\"\n\nBut Young did suggest there may be some light at the end of the tunnel. \"The best thing that's going to happen from Trump is the dismantling of Trump's mess, which will result in a new rebuild of America that pays attention to today's world,\" he claimed.",

                "body": "The weapons were kept in patrol cars \"in case we accidentally hit somebody,\" the former detective testified in court.\n\nCops in Maryland carried BB guns intended for planting on unarmed suspects in dirty shootings, according to shocking testimony during a police corruption trial.\n\nMaurice Ward, a former detective with the Baltimore Police Department's Gun Trace Task Force, reportedly made the claim while on the witness stand last week.\n\nWard testified that fellow officers kept BB guns in their vehicles \"in case we accidentally hit somebody or got into a shootout, so we could plant them,\" according to The Baltimore Sun.\n\nWard did not say whether a BB gun or replica handgun had ever been planted. But when Detective Marcus Taylor, one of the defendants, was arrested in 2016, police found a replica gun inside the glove compartment of his vehicle, the Sun reported.\n\nThe corruption case involves eight members of the Gun Trace Task Force. They've been accused of multiple crimes, including robbery, extortion and fabricating evidence.\n\nSix of the eight -- detectives Ward, Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix and Jemell Rayam and sergeants Thomas Allers and Wayne Jenkins -- have pleaded guilty to racketeering charges. Taylor and detective Daniel Hersl pleaded not guilty and are now on trial.\n\nWard's testimony, as Vice noted, is especially disturbing given all the fatal police shootings -- at least 86 nationwide in 2015 and 2016 -- involving suspects who allegedly had BB guns or replica firearms. Most notable in recent years was the 2014 fatal shooting of Tamir Rice in Cleveland. Police in that case said the 12-year-old was armed with a pellet gun.\n\nIt was unclear as of Wednesday if authorities in Baltimore would re-examine shootings their department had been involved in. A request for comment from the department was not immediately returned on Wednesday.",

In other words, if the base is warm (dark, golden blonde), the highlights should be warm (buttery blonde). If the base is a cool, sandy blonde, then the highlights should be in the cool family as well, like a light beige.",

                "body": "Lungis are quintessential afternoon loungewear for some Asian dads.\n\nCenturies after Asian dads figured out the simple pleasure that wearing lungis can bring, it seems the Spanish fashion retailer Zara wants in on the style.\n\nThe lungi (also known as a longyi, sarong, etc.) is a wide strip of cloth used mainly by men in South and Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Arab world. The cloth is wrapped around the hip and tied together in the front to form a loose drape.\n\nSome wear the breezy, often-checkered cloth for comfort while doing manual labor in hot climates. Others use upgraded versions as formalwear for weddings. More often than not, lungis are simply the quintessential lazy Saturday afternoon loungewear for Asian dads who just want to watch television and drink their chai in peace.\n\nBut some eagle-eyed social media users recently spotted that Zara is selling a \"check mini skirt\" that bears a curious similarity to the venerable lungi.\n\nThe product is described as a \"flowing skirt with draped detail in the front.\" There's a \"front slit detail\" at the hem.\n\nOne major difference is that Zara's model needs to be secured with a zipper in the back, \"hidden along the seam.\" The average South Asian dad holds his lungi up by sheer force of will.\n\nBut the biggest shock for these Twitter users was the product's price. Lungis can be purchased for less than $1 in India. Zara is selling its \"mini skirt\" for a cool $89.90.\n\nSome Twitter users noted that the whole thing smacked of corporate cultural appropriation -- when companies take aspects of people's culture and sell them for inflated prices in other parts of the world, often without crediting the original source. Global brands and celebrities culturally appropriate things all the time.\n\nLol @ZARA check yourself before you appropriate clothing from another culture.

It was also a year in which it became obvious how much collective action and empathy matter.\n\nIn 2018, we resolve, as we did last year, to care more, even when it's overwhelming. We resolve to care more about the people around us and the people we've never met, to embrace joy in the face of hate and light in the face of darkness.\n\nBelow are 29 things, big and small, that we'll be giving a shit about in 2018. Consider joining us.\n\n1. Difficult conversations. Not only are they essential if we ever want to tackle our nation's deep polarization, but they can also be beautiful.\n\n2. Showing up -- for friends, family members and, perhaps most important, communities that you're not a part of.\n\n3. Dreamers. They make America great.\n\n4. So-bad-it's-good and so-good-it's-good TV. Indulge your escapist tendencies once in a while, because everyone deserves to turn their brain off sometimes.\n\n5. Seeing the world. Travel abroad if you can, and when you can't, connect with the rest of the world virtually. America is not, in fact, the center of the universe, and it's healthy to remind yourself of that.\n\n11. Tiny acts of kindness. Give that stranger directions, donate $5 to that canvasser you pass every day, lend that girl in the bathroom line your ponytail holder.\n\n15. Men who step back, listen and follow women in the fight for gender equality. (Note: No gold stars are to be given out for this one.)\n\n16. Gun control legislation, because it's about fucking time.

In 1987, my uncle passed away in a tragic car accident and shortly after, my mother passed his middle name and surname on to me. I felt that, as his namesake, I was left to carry on the legacy and memory of my uncle. Because of this, growing up, I was always intrigued by tales of my late uncle.\n\nI felt connected to my late uncle not only through blood, but through family photographs, as well. The photographs of his youth and of his time in the Colombian military captivated me, and the more I stared at the photographs, the more I spent time with them, the more I found aspects of myself reflected in the images. However, I also found aspects of an identity that felt distant and foreign to me. These photographs of my uncle exuded a Hyper Masculine energy and identity that felt unfamiliar. As a young Latino boy still trying to understand his own sexual and cultural identity, these images were both enlightening and alarming. On one hand, they were a window into my uncle's life, an insight that bonded us from the beyond; yet on the other hand, these images represented a blueprint to Masculinity that I felt I could never live up to.",

                "title": "These Bloody Dollhouse Scenes Reveal A Secret Truth About American Crime",
                "body": "In Frances Glessner Lee's miniature replicas of real-life crime scenes, dolls are stabbed, shot and asphyxiated. A woman lies facedown on the stairs in a nightgown, her body oddly stiff. Another woman is crumpled in her closet, next to a bloody knife and a suitcase. One woman is found tucked in bed, a red lipstick stain on the underside of a pillow the only clue to her demise.\n\nThe dollhouses, known as ''The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death,'' were put together in minute detail as tools for teaching homicide detectives the nuances of examining a crime scene, the better to \"convict the guilty, clear the innocent, and find the truth in a nutshell,\" in a mantra adopted by Lee. Before she created her striking dioramas in the 1940s and '50s, crime scenes were routinely contaminated by officers who trampled through them without care; evidence was mishandled; murders were thought to be accidents and accidents, murders. Today, even as forensic science has advanced by quantum leaps, her models are still used to teach police how to observe scenes, collect evidence and, critically, to question their initial assumptions about what took place.\n\nThe 19 existing nutshells were recently on display at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Lee's pedagogical models having aged into a ghoulish sort of art. I saw them on a freakishly warm day in Washington, D.C., amateur sleuths crowded around me. Each model was accompanied by a card explaining basic facts about the case -- the solutions are kept secret -- and by a flashlight so that viewers could investigate the various clues more closely.\n\nBut something else was going on in the exhibit. Look closely at the nutshells: What unites them are the scenes of domestic horror that Lee, considered the \"mother of forensic science,\" portrays in such unsettling detail. Most of the victims are women, found dead inside the comfort of their homes. Dioramas that appear to show domestic bliss are slyly subverted to reveal the dark underside of family life. Unwittingly or not -- her private life offers only scattered hints as to her motivation -- Lee, with each nutshell, was leaving clues that pointed to the culprit in the larger story of American crime. Many of these scenes of murder are in fact scenes of misogyny in bloody apotheosis.\n\nPeering inside \"The Kitchen,\" I felt as though I'd interrupted a profoundly intimate moment of pain. Lee handmade her dioramas at a scale of 1 inch to 1 foot -- classic for dollhouses -- and they are accurately and overwhelmingly detailed. In \"The Kitchen,\" there's fresh-baked bread cooling in the open oven, potatoes half-peeled in the sink. Outside the window, female undergarments are seen drying on the line. But on the floor, flat on her back, is a deceased woman in an apron, her cheeks blazing red. On further scan of the room, viewers will notice that newspaper has been stuffed under the doors, blocking air passage, leading to the conclusion that she died from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nAt first glance, it looks like a suicide. But why would this housewife kill herself in the middle of cooking dinner? Maybe, one exhibition viewer theorized on a Post-it note, \"she died of sheer misery over her dull repetitive unfulfilled life.\" But then why is the table near the window askew? Could someone have staged the suicide and escaped out the window?\n\nThe only narrative available to investigators (and to viewers of the exhibition) comes from the woman's husband, who reported that he went on an errand for his wife, and when he returned she was dead. Huh. It was this type of case that Lee wanted investigators to examine more closely, instead of accepting the obvious answer and moving right on.\n\n\"She was about championing the cases of people who were overlooked. And as a woman, she felt overlooked by the system,\" said Nora Atkinson, the show's curator. When Lee was building her models, the field of law enforcement was almost entirely male, she explained. \"When they came across a scene, they didn't take the cases against women that seriously, just like they didn't take the cases against a drunk or a prostitute that seriously. She focused on people who were on the fringes of society, and women fell into that.\"\n\nThe most gruesome of the nutshells is \"Three-Room Dwelling,\" in which a husband, wife and baby are all shot to death. As the diorama doesn't have a roof, viewers have an aerial view into the house. Even though the victims are dolls, it's a disturbing crime scene. In the kitchen, a gun lies on the floor near a bloody puddle. In another room, a baby is shot in her crib, the pink wallpaper behind her head stained with a constellation of blood spatters. The wife is shot in bed, turned on her side. Her husband is facedown on the floor, his striped blue pajamas soaked with blood.\n\nAtkinson said when she observes crowds discussing \"Three-Room Dwelling,\" men and women have very different theories on the perpetrator. \"The women believe that it was the husband who did it, and the men believe that it must have been an intruder,\" she said. \"It's really sort of a psychological experiment watching the conclusions your audience comes to.\"\n\nFor the record, I too am confident the husband did it. Maybe that's because I've covered so many similar cases, and they're sadly predictable. But I wasn't surprised to hear that others were reluctant to reach the same verdict. As someone who writes almost exclusively about male violence against women, I've noticed a deep unwillingness among the public to recognize domestic abuse at the heart of violent American crime.\n\nMost people would be startled to learn that over half of all murders of American women involve domestic violence. New York City's first murder of 2018 was a woman stabbed to death by her husband. And despite how mass shootings are often portrayed in the media, most of them closely resemble \"Three-Room Dwelling.\" They are committed by husbands and boyfriends, take place within the perceived safety of the home and are anything but random.\n\nPrivate violence also begets more violence: Our prisons are filled with men and women who were exposed to domestic violence and child abuse. \"In looking for the genesis of crime in America, all trails lead back to violence in the home,\" said Casey Gwinn, who runs a camp for kids who grew up with domestic abuse (where, full disclosure, I have volunteered in the past).\n\nThat inability to see domestic violence as crucially interwoven with violent crime in the U.S. leads to massive indifference. Funding for services is bleak, \"desperately inadequate,\" in the words of Kim Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. Among the media, there's an impulse to categorize crimes involving intimate partners as trivial, and to compartmentalize them as private matters that exist wholly separate from Real Crime. I often wonder if it's the word \"domestic\" that positions it so squarely within the realm of milk and cookies, instead of as part of a continuum, with murder and mass death terrifyingly adjacent.\n\nIn one hyperlocal example this week, no reporters showed up to a news conference on domestic violence homicides held by the Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women. Why? Well, the Super Bowl is about to take place in the state, and all eyes are focused on that instead.\n\nSo from where did these dark creations emerge? What inspired Lee to spend so much time replicating trauma? She was born into a wealthy family in the 1870s and was intrigued by murder mysteries from a young age, the stories of Sherlock Holmes in particular. While she was studious and bright, she never had the opportunity to attend college. She married at 19 and had three children, but eventually divorced. Later in life, after her father's and brother's deaths, she began to pursue her true interests: crime and medicine.\n\nIn the 1930s, she used her fortune to help establish the Department of Legal Medicine at Harvard, the first of its kind in North America. And she started working with her local New Hampshire police department, becoming the first woman in the country to achieve the rank of police captain. At the age of 65, she began making her dollhouses, which would be her longest-lasting legacy.\n\nThe teaching tools were \"intended to be an exercise in observing, interpreting, evaluating and reporting,\" she wrote in an article for the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology. \"One of the essentials in the study of these Nutshells is that the student should approach them with an open mind -- far too often the investigator 'has a hunch,' and looks for and finds only the evidence to support it, disregarding any other evidence that may be present.\"\n\nLittle is known about why Lee chose the particular scenes she did, and why she narrowed her lens on the domain of domestic life. The nutshells are all based on real crimes, with some adjustments.\n\n\"When she was traveling around with police officers and investigators in the New England area, these were in part a reflection of the scenes that she had access to, and the crimes that were taking place,\" said Corinne Botz, an artist and author who published a book exploring the nutshells through a feminist lens.\n\nPerhaps Lee felt those cases were not getting the attention they deserved, she said, noting that many of the nutshells are overt stereotypes: the housewife in the kitchen, the old woman in the attic.\n\n\"Lee picked the cases that interested her,\" Botz said. \"She is trying to make investigators take a second look, and not make assumptions based on what a neighbor reported or what first meets the eye.\"\n\nAtkinson thought it was possible Lee was subconsciously exploring her own complicated feelings about family life through the models. \"A lot of these domestic environments reflect her own frustration that the home was supposed to be this place of solace and safety,\" she said. \"The home wasn't necessarily a place where she felt safe and warm. It was a little bit of a prison for her.\"\n\nLee hinted at her difficulties in a letter penned in her 70s. \"This has been a lonely and rather terrifying life I have lived,\" she wrote. \"Chief amongst the difficulties I have had to meet have been the facts that I never went to school, that I had no letters after my name, and that I was placed in the category of 'rich woman who didn't have enough to do.'\"\n\nBut her nutshells, and their portrayal of violence against women, have ultimately transformed the way investigators approach crime, said Jeanie Foley, who creates full-size, realistic simulated crime scenes based on true cases to teach students at Boston College School of Nursing. The scenes she builds are similar to Lee's nutshells, but on a much larger scale and with far less detail.\n\nDecades after Lee built her nutshells, the field of forensic science is now dominated by women.\n\n\"Today, in the 21st century, the science of forensics plays a crucial part in the solution of crimes,\" she said. \"Lee's models gave women a better opportunity to have a fair investigation. A more open-minded investigation.\"\n\nDeliberately or not, Lee's nutshells urge us to acknowledge that American crime is born in the home -- and we ignore it at our own peril.\n\nClarification: A previous version of this story indicated that Lee's father prevented her from attending college. While Lee said her father \"believed that 'a lady didn't go to school,'\" according to Botz's book, Botz and other experts on Lee's life have not definitively concluded why she did not attend.\n\nThis story has also been updated to include more detailed information about the comments provided by Gwinn.",

                "body": "Police found Bernstein's body, which had been stabbed over 20 times, in a park in California last week.\n\nThe man suspected of murdering Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old college student from Orange County, California, told police he believed the victim had been hitting on him, according to a court document obtained by a local newspaper.\n\nSamuel Lincoln Woodward, a 20-year-old who had attended high school with Bernstein, was arrested Friday on suspicion of homicide after DNA evidence linked him to Bernstein's death, The Associated Press reported. He is being held in Orange County Jail.\n\nInvestigators discovered Bernstein's body, which had been stabbed more than 20 times, on Jan. 9 in a park in Lake Forest, California -- nearly a week after his parents reported him missing. Bernstein had been home on winter break from the University of Pennsylvania at the time.\n\nNo weapon was recovered at the scene and detectives are investigating whether the killing was \"an act of rage,\" reported The Orange County Register.\n\nPolice interviewed Woodward shortly after Bernstein's disappearance was reported. The victim's Snapchat led investigators to believe Woodward picked up Bernstein around 10:30 p.m. the night he went missing, reported the Los Angeles Times.\n\nWoodward told investigators that they had driven to Borrego Park that night, when Bernstein exited the vehicle and walked away, according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by the Register.\n\nAfter waiting an hour for Bernstein to return, Woodward said, he left the park to meet a girlfriend, whose last name and address Woodward told police he could not remember. He said he returned hours later to look for Bernstein.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Woodward had clenched fists as he claimed Bernstein had kissed him on the lips during their time together that night. He told investigators that he pushed Bernstein away and \"wanted to tell Blaze to get off of him.\"\n\nText messages reviewed by investigators indicated Bernstein had discussed his previous interaction with Woodward with friends, according to the Register.\n\nWoodward was going to \"hit on me,\" Bernstein reportedly said in one text conversation. \"He made me promise not to tell anyone ... but I have texted every one, uh oh.\"\n\nThe 16-page affidavit suggested Woodward was known at his former high school for having conservative political beliefs and often made his love of the Bible and guns known through his social media posts, the Register reported.\n\nOn Monday, hundreds of people gathered to mourn Bernstein's death at a memorial service at the University Synagogue in Irvine. Bernstein, who was the managing editor of Penn Appetit, a student-run food magazine, and a columnist for the university's student newspaper, was remembered for being a talented writer and a passionate cook.\n\n\"Blaze was on a path to repair our world and it is a moral imperative that we all take steps now to make sure that his dream is realized,\" the Bernstein family said in a statement released before the service.",

But last week, the 37-year-old learned that as far as the U.S. government is concerned, her services will no longer be needed.\n\nGuzman has been working legally under what's known as temporary protected status, a program that has allowed nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to remain in the U.S. since 2001, when their native country was rocked by devastating earthquakes. The Trump administration, which has vowed to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration, announced Jan. 8 that it will end the TPS program for Salvadorans next year, meaning people like Guzman will lose their work permits and face deportation.",

                "body": "Groups say the nation is home to unlicensed rehab clinics that believe homosexuality is a mental illness.\n\nBOGOTA, Feb 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Gay people in Ecuador are forced to undergo \"conversion therapy\" in secret clinics where they are raped and beaten, even though homosexuality is legal, said campaigners calling for courts to deliver justice to end more than a decade of abuse.\n\nScores of unlicensed rehabilitation clinics in the Andean nation offer illegal \"treatments\" for gay people based on the idea that homosexuality is a mental illness that needs to be \"cured,\" local rights groups said.\n\n\"Corrective therapy, in mostly private and clandestine alcohol and drug addiction clinics, continues in Ecuador,\" said Cayetana Salao, of Taller de Comunicacion Mujer, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights group.\n\n\"It's a reality.\"\n\nEcuador's health ministry said no \"conversion therapy\" was found in the more than 60 clinics it has shut since mid-2016 for insanitary conditions or operating without a licence.\n\nNone of the closures were due to human rights violations, said Maria Jose Espin, head of technical management at the health ministry's regulatory agency, ACESS.\n\n\"We frequently verify with our teams that these types of establishments do not exist, where rights violations can take place,\" Espin told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\"There are no de-homosexualization clinics. They shouldn't exist,\" she said, adding that homosexuality was not a disease.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 1990 but conversion therapy still takes place across the world, from China to South Africa and the United States.\n\nEcuador, Brazil and Malta are the only countries that have banned the controversial treatment, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).\n\nBut hate crimes and human rights violations against LGBT people have taken place in more than 100 clinics across Ecuador since 2012, said Salao, a project coordinator, as evangelical groups gain influence in the Catholic-majority nation.\n\nEcuador legalized homosexuality in 1997 and allowed same-sex civil unions a decade ago.\n\nGay people, mostly lesbians, are typically admitted to clinics by their parents or other relatives and held against their will for at least three months, with therapy costing up to $1,500 a month, campaigners say.\n\nTaller de Comunicacion Mujer documented testimonies of four victims who said they were locked up against their will and underwent conversion therapy from 2014 to 2016.\n\nThis included psychological and physical abuse - beatings, solitary confinement, being chained to a bed for days, force-feeding of medicine and being made to wear makeup and high heels.\n\nVictims also reported \"corrective rape\" by fellow patients and staff with the aim of changing their sexual orientation.\n\n\"A morbid creativity for torture exists,\" said Ane Barragan, coordinator at Causana Foundation, which has been campaigning to stop conversion therapy for more than a decade.\n\nAbout 200 unlicensed clinics are operating across Ecuador, rights groups estimate.\n\n\"No one regulates or monitors them,\" said Barragan.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization, the WHO's regional office, said in 2011 that conversion therapy was \"a serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people.\"\n\nBut the Catholic Church and most Christian evangelicals view homosexuality as a sin and say sex should only take place in marriage between a man and a woman.\n\nState prosecutors have investigated six cases involving alleged human rights violations against LGBT people in rehabilitation clinics since 2012, Salao said.\n\n\"No one has been found guilty or punished,\" she said.\n\n\"We call on the judiciary to move these cases forward and hold those people responsible to account.\"\n\nCarina Vance, Ecuador's former health minister who is openly gay and spearheaded a crackdown on the clinics, said she has no doubt that conversion therapy continues in the country.\n\nVance said police and prosecutors carried out 116 raids during her tenure as health minister from 2012 to 2015, resulting in the closure of more than 100 clinics.\n\nBut some received tip-offs and many re-opened under different names within months of being closed, Vance said.\n\n\"This business is very lucrative,\" said Vance, who now heads the South American Institute of Government in Health (ISAGS), a regional health think tank.\n\n\"These clinics have a lot of power, there are a lot of economic interests behind this.\"\n\nAlthough Ecuador passed a law in 2016 allowing people to choose their preferred gender on their identity cards and its first transgender lawmaker took office last year, socially conservative attitudes are entrenched, she said.\n\n\"There are families using these so-called services and this has to do with a prevalent, a very homophobic ... a sexist society,\" Vance said.\n\n\"Cultural change is very difficult to produce.\" (Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Katy Migiro.

The iconic rapper teamed up with Google to create \"We Continue to Rise,\" an open letter and video paying homage to the legends whose music embodied blackness in all its forms.\n\n\"I was raised to understand that every month was Black History Month,\" he wrote. \"That every day, my ancestors, contemporaries and everyday dreamers like myself can, shall, and continue to make history.\"\n\nThe letter goes on to describe the unique hold music had on Nas' life from day one. His father, a musician himself, decorated the house with instruments and surrounded his son with with the notion that music was an extension of black history and culture. The young rapper came to understand that black music, from jazz to folk to funk, tells a story.\n\nIn the accompanying video, Nas reads part of his letter, set against a montage of black artistic icons. The section he reads touches on the importance of music and how it gave him a deeper understanding and appreciation of his culture.\n\n\"Our music has been a relentless advocate for our story, which plays a crucial role in the American narrative: Red, white and blues, baby,\" he says.\n\nNas wraps up the letter by naming those that influenced him directly. Individuals such as Robert Johnson, Sarah Vaughan and Slick Rick are just a few of the storytellers who inspired him by centering black experiences and preserving black culture, regardless of genre.\n\nBut he also emphasizes that these kinds of figures don't exist solely in the past. Instead, Nas emphatically states that, like those that came before, modern black musicians continue to make history and shape culture.\n\n\"We are here. From the beginning. For forever,\" he wrote. \"From science labs to spaceships, from jazz riffs to higher consciousness, we continue to rise.\"",

The site's editors have been producing the popular poems, intended to help writers avoid language and grammatical errors, for some time.\n\nThe use of the singular \"their,\" Merriam-Webster noted on Twitter Wednesday, seems like a grammatical error, but is in fact appropriate.\n\n\"There is a long tradition in English of using plural pronouns (such as 'they,' 'their,' or 'them') for a singular character, rather than ascribing gender in a seemingly indeterminate fashion,\" the site notes. \"The habit of always using 'he,' 'him,' or 'his' began to be strongly advocated for after 18th century grammarians decided that indefinite pronouns should be singular.\"\n\nThe editors conclude: \"In recent years, the acceptance of gender-neutral third person pronouns such as 'their' is growing.\"\n\nSome people on Twitter responded gleefully to the dictionary's embrace of \"their,\" and even offered their own poetic takes.\n\nLast year, the dictionary added the definition of \"shade\" as it was popularly used in the queer black and Latino ballroom scene: To express contempt or disrespect for someone publicly especially by subtle or indirect insults or criticisms. (Thanks to \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and the \"Real Housewives of Atlanta,\" this use has become increasingly mainstream.)\n\nThe company's 2017 word of the year was \"feminism.\" Editors noted that \"feminism\" was chosen because the term had enjoyed multiple lookup spikes as well as a 70 percent rise in searches from 2016.",

                "title": "Opinion | Harry Potter Fans Deserve An Openly Gay Dumbledore",
                "body": "A decade after J.K. Rowling revealed that she \"always thought of [Hogwarts Headmaster Albus] Dumbledore as gay,\" LGBTQ fans of Harry Potter and their allies are still waiting to see themselves truly reflected in the Potter franchise's stories.\n\nThe latest film set in the Potter universe, \"The Crimes of Grindelwald,\" will feature a young Dumbledore (played by Jude Law) leading the charge against dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). As teens, Dumbledore and Grindelwald connected passionately. They were inseparable as they plotted their rise to power, and Rowling has intimated that their relationship was more than a platonic friendship.\n\nHowever, according to director David Yates, the new film will \"not explicitly\" acknowledge Dumbledore's sexual orientation. Why? Perhaps because Yates has an eye on international ticket sales in less LGBTQ-friendly countries. Perhaps because gay leads still tip films into a niche too small to justify their $200-million-plus budgets. Or, perhaps, simply because this film takes place after Dumbledore's teen years and during a war, in which romance is far from everyone's mind. With three more Potter prequels on the horizon, there may be a deeper exploration of Dumbledore's identity in the works. But the message Yates is sending with this film is all too familiar to many LGBTQ people: It's OK to be gay, just don't make a big deal of it.\n\nPotter fans immediately expressed their dismay, accusing Rowling of making promises she wouldn't keep. One fan tweeted, \"JK Rowling: Oh yeah, Dumbledore is gay! Just didn't put it in the books. Us: Ooh! Maybe they'll do better in the Dumbledore-centric movie -- Director: No, he's just gay off-page and off-screen. He's gay in your hearts.\" Rowling curtly chided her disappointed fans, many of whom have grown accustomed to her regular tweets in support of the LGBTQ community. So far, Yates has remained silent in response to fan criticism.\n\nWhat does it mean that Dumbledore is allowed to be gay in our collective imagination but not in the books or on the big screen? What message does that send to the devoted fans who still excitedly await any new Potter installment? It means the Harry Potter franchise joins a long line of films in which queerness is relegated to the realm of the implicit.\n\nFor decades, mainstream media have reduced queer stories to subplots and made jokes at the LGBTQ community's expense. Everything from the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy to homophobic jokes on hit sitcoms has told queer people to be a little less visible: a little more discrete in their love, a little quieter in their truth. Minimizing Dumbledore's sexuality sends a similarly subtle but strong message: You don't belong in this story.\n\nThe Potter films themselves acknowledge the cruelty and danger of that message. The first film in the new franchise, \"Fantastic Beasts,\" hauntingly portrays how the suppression of one's true nature corrodes, warps and obliterates. After years of torture at the hands of his adoptive mother as punishment for his magical abilities, Credence Barebone seethes with explosive rage and self-loathing. The repression of his magic creates an Obscurus, a dark parasitic energy that eventually consumes him and a large chunk of New York City. Under the pressure of social stigma, his magical abilities, which could have been used to connect and create, became deadly and destructive.\n\nThe power of representation, of seeing your story reflected back to you, cannot be underestimated. Representation is a beacon of light in the darkness. Representation is the clarion call of \"You are not alone.\" For LGBTQ people, 74% of whom have hidden their sexual orientation for fear of discrimination, representation is still frequently a matter of life or death.\n\nFurthermore, representation is not merely about doling out equal seats at the table and ensuring everyone has their moment in the spotlight. As Credence's story highlights, it is essential to the health of our whole society that all people are seen and accepted as who they are. At a time of increasing polarization and identity-based isolation, our collective growth depends on our capacity to tell more nuanced stories that do not sugarcoat, edit or erase other's truths. When fans react angrily to Yates' and Rowling's waffling on their portrayals of Dumbledore, they are speaking from a place of fear and vulnerability. They are asking to be seen and to be granted full acceptance, not conditional love.\n\nIn choosing to portray Dumbledore as only implicitly gay, Yates has opted to keep queer fans in the shadows. And in dismissing fan criticism, he and Rowling missed an opportunity to make those fans feel seen and heard. Rowling could have responded with empathy and clarity: Yes, Dumbledore was gay. Yes, these films will chronicle the whole truth of his life. And, yes, she understands that LGBTQ stories matter and hopes her work contributes to telling them. As Dumbledore himself said, \"Words are our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable of both inflicting injury and remedying it.\" Rowling, of all people, knows that her words have the power to build worlds and to undermine them.\n\nThe team behind \"The Crimes of Grindelwald\" has the opportunity to do just that: to tell a nuanced story about a queer hero. When we head to theaters in November, I hope we see a Dumbledore who is exploring who he is and how he might realize his dreams. I hope we see a Dumbledore who is working to make sense of himself in a wizarding world that perhaps lacks the language to describe his queer experience.\n\nThe Dumbledore readers met over a decade ago taught younger fans, and reminded older ones, what it is like to be young and in love with both a person and with the world they seem to open up for us. He risked opening his heart and learned that the people we dare to love are always our greatest teachers, even when we don't have a happy-ever-after ending. That's a lesson that queer fans, just like straight ones, need to see on screen.\n\nWe don't need to see Dumbledore proclaiming his unequivocal love for other men and donning a rainbow-plumed wizard's hat (although that would be fun!). But queer Potter fans -- all Potter fans, in fact -- need a Dumbledore who is wholly himself at whatever point in his journey we encounter him. We deserve to see an authentic portrayal of a person navigating love, power and his role in building a better world. Yates, Rowling and their team are not responsible for solving the deficit of LGBTQ representation. But they do have the opportunity to tell a bold, honest story that allows all of us to learn a little more about what it means to be our whole selves.\n\nAaron Rose is an educator, writer and cultural steward who teaches and writes about identity, conflict transformation, empathy and all things LGBTQ.",

                "body": "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reportedly supports allowing transgender service members.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Friday that he's sticking to his ban on transgender people in the military, even though the Pentagon showed little enthusiasm for the proposal.\n\nIn a memo released Friday night, the White House said that transgender individuals are \"disqualified from military service except under limited circumstances.\" The full ban was set to officially take effect Friday, though a pair of federal courts in December ordered the U.S. military to allow the recruitment of transgender citizens into the armed forces despite Trump's declaration.\n\n\"Transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances,\" the memo says.\n\nTrump's decision to keep the ban comes one month after a Washington Post report suggested that Mattis would urge Trump to allow transgender citizens to continue serving in the military.\n\nMattis delivered his recommendations to Trump in late February, but their conversation remained private.\n\nThe Trump administration's controversial transgender military ban has faced opposition at every corner since Trump announced the policy change in a series of surprising tweets last summer.\n\nIn July, Trump said he was banning transgender citizens from the armed forces because of the supposed \"burden\" of their \"tremendous medical costs.\" (Transition-related care costs the military only a fraction of its overall budget. The Department of Defense spends tremendously more on Viagra for erectile dysfunction than it does on transgender medical costs.)\n\nHis tweets, which reportedly took the Pentagon by surprise, were followed by an official White House memo sent to the departments of defense and homeland security that provided details and a timeline for his proposed ban.\n\nThe memo required the armed forces to stop accepting transgender recruits by Jan. 1 and halt the use of federal funds for transition-related care for military personnel by March 22.\n\nDespite the memo, the Pentagon began accepting transgender recruits again on Jan. 1, complying with federal court orders calling for a halt to the ban while it was being legally challenged.\n\nIn late February, the U.S. military accepted its first openly transgender recruit to sign up for service since Trump's pronouncement. The Department of Defense confirmed that the recruit had signed a contract for service in the military and would be attending basic training in the coming months.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman said that the Defense Department will continue allowing transgender people in the military as ordered by the federal court, despite the Trump administration's announcement. Speaking to the Washington Blade before Friday's announcement, Army Maj. David Eastburn said the \"DOD will still comply with federal court rulings and continue to assess and retain transgender service members.\"",

After footage of the incident came out, hundreds took to the streets of Sacramento on Thursday to protest the latest police killing of an unarmed black man.\n\nAfter a series of bombs terrorized Austin this month, killing two black men and setting the city on edge, the suspected bomber, 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt, died on Wednesday after a device exploded in his car during a confrontation with police. While law enforcement struggled to find a motive, some denounced officials and the news media for humanizing the white bomber and not labeling the attacks \"terrorism.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica, a political consultancy hired by the Trump campaign, reportedly secretly accessed and misused millions of Facebook users' data. On Tuesday, U.S. lawmakers called for Facebook to explain the privacy breach. As an online movement began to grow calling for people to #deletefacebook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally apologized on Wednesday and said he would be willing to testify before Congress -- maybe ... if he's the \"right person.\"\n\nAfter 45 U.S. trade groups urged Trump not to impose tariffs on China -- warning it would be \"particularly harmful\" to the U.S. economy -- Trump signed a memo on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports. After the news hit, U.S. stocks plunged.\n\nOn Thursday, national security adviser H.R. McMaster left the Trump administration -- the latest of at least a dozen Trump aides to have stepped down from their posts in a little over a year. He was replaced by former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and notorious foreign policy hawk John Bolton.\n\nThat same day, John Dowd, President Donald Trump's lead attorney on the Russia probe, resigned. Dowd reportedly felt Trump was ignoring his advice on how to deal with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nA man killed three people on Friday in a deadly rampage across multiple towns in southern France. After an hourslong hostage situation and standoff with police at a grocery store, the attacker was killed. French President Emmanuel Macron called the incident a terrorist attack.\n\nOn Friday, just hours after Trump had threatened to veto the omnibus spending package, he signed the $1.3 trillion bill -- preventing a government shutdown and funding the government through September. After signing, Trump called the bill a \"ridiculous situation.\"",

                "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Climate change skeptics may have outlived their usefulness to the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThat was one of the key takeaways from a five-hour climate tutorial held Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Judge William Alsup, who has a history of digging into the scientific and technical details of the cases before him, ordered the tutorial to better understand climate science before presiding over a case in which the cities of San Francisco and Oakland are suing the five largest fossil fuel companies -- ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips and Shell -- over the damages of climate change.\n\nAlthough both sides presented the science that would seem to most help their cases, it was clear that the age of discrediting climate science in general is over. Faced with media investigations, fraud probes and at least a dozen climate liability suits from coastal cities facing large bills as they attempt to adapt to climate change-induced sea level rise, fossil fuel companies have been forced to move away from the position that climate science is invalid or that human-caused emissions don't contribute to climate change. Instead, they're focused on emphasizing a history of uncertainty in climate science, downplaying the severity of climate change and minimizing their role in it.\n\nIn this California case, the oil companies are being accused of promoting doubt about climate science, which has delayed regulatory action and left coastal cities to deal with eroding coastlines, property loss and infrastructure damage. The state sees a precedent in its lead paint cases, \"where we had to pay out a lot of money to address a damage created by a company, and so to hold those companies responsible we set up an account that they all paid into to cover those costs,\" explained San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera.\n\nThe writing has been on the wall for outright climate denial ever since documents unearthed by the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York in an ExxonMobile fraud probe revealed it publicly promoted doubt about climate science even as its own scientists' research showed otherwise.\n\nFossil fuel companies are in a tight spot. No company wants to be subjected to the multiple investigations Exxon is facing, so it's no longer safe to push the narrative -- or pay others to -- that man-made climate change doesn't exist. (Although the persistence of those narratives does make the industry's recent embrace of climate science seem more reasonable and forward-thinking than it actually is.) At the same time, they don't want new emission-constraining regulations that will leave their assets stranded or margins reduced.\n\nNow the industry largely accepts the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's summary reports on climate science, which pull together thousands of experts from around the world to synthesize the science every five to seven years. Each of the defendants named in the California case has made public statements accepting that human emissions contribute to climate change, and that climate change poses various risks, including to their businesses -- most recently Exxon.\n\nAt Judge Alsup's climate tutorial, Chevron was the only defendant that chose to present. Its lawyer, Ted Boutrous, pointed to areas of the most recent IPCC report in which there was a low degree of consensus, or of confidence, in the available data.\n\n\"With the Antarctic ice sheet, we can see that there is a high confidence that it is losing mass but low confidence that the rate of loss is increasing,\" he told Alsup. \"Now we know that anthropogenic warming is having a substantial impact on all of the other ice sheets, but in Antarctica there are modeling uncertainties and disagreement between studies.\"\n\nBoutrous spent a large portion of his presentation pointing to graphs and charts on sea-level rise that contained nearly six-year-old data, arguing that there's only a 1 percent chance of the 10-foot rise the plaintiffs' expert had described as \"certainly possible.\"\n\nBoutrous reiterated multiple times that there was \"a great deal of uncertainty in the science until about 2000.\"\n\n\"It's the new form of denialism: First it was that climate change isn't happening, then it was that humans weren't contributing, then it was pointing out the other sources -- what about the sun, what about volcanoes? -- and now it's going with the most moderate projections and playing up the uncertainty of the science,\" said Naomi Ages, Climate Liability Project lead for Greenpeace, who was watching the hearing closely to gain insight for her organization's approach to climate liability claims.\n\nSeveral in the courtroom pointed out that Boutrous seemed to be cherry-picking data points, said Julia Olson, the executive director and lead counsel for Our Children's Trust, a nonprofit that represents youth in climate cases. Olson is not involved in this case but is the lead counsel in another climate rights suit against the U.S. government that will head to trial later this year. She noted that the modeling in the most recent IPCC report that Boutrous used estimates a 20- to 38-inch rise in sea levels by 2100 if emissions continue to grow, or 11 to 24 inches if they are curbed. The problem, Olson said, is that \"assumes a linear rate of sea level rise, and the seas don't rise in a linear fashion.\"\n\nA 10-year flood that would have come once every 10 years is now coming 10 times a year. Gary Griggs, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, UC Santa Cruz\n\nThe most recent science, which Gary Griggs, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, presented in this week's tutorial, estimates that it is entirely possible we'll see an increase from a historic average of 13 inches of sea-level rise per century to an average of 39 inches -- potentially much more if the Antarctic ice sheet melts, which it is doing more rapidly than IPCC projections anticipated. That amount of sea-level rise coupled with more extreme storms results in more flooding and damage, Griggs explained. \"A 10-year flood that would have come once every 10 years is now coming 10 times a year,\" he said.\n\nDon Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois and a lead IPCC author, emphasized the discrepancy between the latest IPCC projections and the most current science in his own presentation before the judge: \"To pull together the 2013 report, we had to stop looking at any science done after 2012, but that doesn't mean the science stopped. It has moved on considerably since then.\"\n\nWhile Chevron's lawyers avoided the more ridiculous denier talking points, several high-profile climate science skeptics submitted a friend-of-the-court brief that argued there is no scientific consensus that human-caused emissions contribute to climate change and that, in fact, a warming climate is good for people and the planet. The brief was signed by a half dozen vocal skeptics (and promoted by the conservative Heartland Institute, which funds much of their work), including former British Independence Party politician Viscount Christopher Monckton, former Delaware state climatologist David Legates (who was asked to resign from the position and then was fired when he refused) and Harvard astrophysicist Willie Soon, who has claimed that \"too much ice is really bad for polar bears.\"\n\nAlsup almost immediately asked the brief's authors who had funded their research, and the responses included Peabody Coal and ExxonMobil. But the brief only served to highlight the tightrope that fossil fuel companies need to walk between the positions they promoted not too long ago and those they embrace now.\n\n\"I was surprised to see that amicus brief get filed and would have liked to know if the fossil fuel companies knew that was coming or not,\" Ages said. \"It doesn't really help them at this point.\"\n\nBut for decades it did. Skepticism of climate science helped to minimize concern about climate change both in the general public and among politicians. It's not clear whether shifting their talking points now will help fossil fuel companies in court.\n\n\"It's too late. They don't get credit for suddenly saying that IPCC science is good and real and they accept it,\" Ages said. \"We're still in a position where we have no federal regulation, and we have an entire administration full of climate deniers. They sowed the doubt that created an environment in which that could happen.\"\n\nStill, the current narrative is a fairly large leap from what fossil fuel companies were saying even recently. \"This has been the story they've been telling lately, but if they had been asked to tell the history of climate science 10 years ago, it would have looked a lot different,\" said Alyssa Johl, a climate lawyer and consultant on climate litigation.\n\nMeanwhile, activists and climate litigators have also moved on in the past decade. Just as fossil fuel companies have come to embrace the IPCC, advocates now often refer to the IPCC synthesis reports issued every five to seven years as outdated and not necessarily representative of the best, most current science.\n\n\"Experts we're working with, many of which are also lead IPCC authors, all tell us that the IPCC needs to be taken for what it is: Some of the scientific papers used and condensed for that report are high-quality research and others are less so,\" Olson said. \"This is science from around globe, so there's a wide variety of quality.\"\n\nAs the fossil fuel industry begins to shun the skeptics it once propped up, it remains to be seen whether conservative groups like the Heartland Institute, and the politicians they support, will continue to promote the idea that climate change isn't happening.\n\nWhile Chevron, Exxon and the rest have put up pages on their website clearly stating that climate change is happening, that humans contribute to it and that it poses multiple risks, their legacy of undermining climate science speaks louder. It's what helped give the country a president and an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who deny the reality of climate change and regularly promote denier talking points.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry may have turned its back on that stance now, but the last three decades have ensured that there are plenty of others willing to pick up the flag of denialism and wave it proudly.",

                "body": "\"I let [my faith] guide me, because if I try to take the wheel, it's about to be a mess,\" she said.\n\nYvonne Orji knows what she wants and knows how to get it.\n\nThe 34-year-old known for her role as Molly on Issa Rae's \"Insecure\" has been putting in work for years. Upon returning to the U.S. after working on HIV prevention in Liberia, Orji took a leap of faith and abandoned her original game plan of becoming a doctor for a career in comedy.\n\n\"I remember my mom [saying], 'I don't know... this acting thing, I don't know,'\" the Nigeria-born, Maryland-raised actress told HuffPost of her mom's reluctance to buy into her career change. \"Then Lupita won an Oscar, and then she said, 'Your friend has won.' I didn't even know Lupita at the time ... but it became real for my mom.\"\n\nFor seven years, Orji hustled to perfect her craft. She wrote, took acting classes, waited tables and seized every available opportunity to perform when she moved to New York. She eventually got a job as an artist in residence at the University of Richmond before moving to Los Angeles to write for TV One's \"Love That Girl.\" While in LA, she wrote a web series loosely based on her own life, \"First Gen.\"\n\nIt took nearly a decade of consistent grinding, but Orji finally got her break in October 2016, after auditioning for what's now one of the biggest shows for black millennials. She's also toured with Chris Rock and has a forthcoming project with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish.\n\nShe shared that the recipe to her success has been preparedness and faith.\n\n\"'Stay ready' has been like my mantra before 'Insecure' and all. A lot of people hustle differently, and I was like, you know what, let me hustle and create and let me have something to show, cuz my hustle led to opportunity,\" she shared.\n\nOrji spreads this message in her latest campaign with Colgate Total, in which she advises folks to \"stay ready and you don't have to get ready,\" because opportunity is likely to knock when you least expect it.\n\n\"For me, staying ready has always been like the preparations, do the behind the scenes or do what you think that's not sexy that nobody will see, but when they do see it, it's like, 'Oh, snap ... what she's doing on her own, we'll add to that and it'll blow up.'\"\n\nThe other side of the formula, Orji's Christian faith, is what keeps her going when the path to the finish line isn't always as clear.\n\n\"I let [my faith] guide me, because if I try to take the wheel, it's about to be a mess,\" she said. \"I can only see what's in front of me, but God can see what's behind, what's ahead of me, what's beside me, and it just makes it so much easier to release control, cuz at the end of the day, if He brought me to it, He's gonna have to bring me through it.\"\n\nIt's only up for Orji, who's currently filming Season 3 of \"Insecure.\" She takes the space she occupies seriously, championing the complexity and diversity of black people that should be celebrated on screen.\n\n\"I learned so much about black friendships, black experiences, through the show. I'm like yo, I'm learning a different type of blackness by being in the show,\" she said, calling the opportunity a \"blessing.\"\n\n\"There are different types of experiences, and all of them are valid and all of them deserve to be portrayed in a real way.\"\n\nOrji even dished a tad on her take on Molly's messy-ass relationship with Dro -- who claims to be in an open marriage -- in the forthcoming season.\n\n\"I told Issa, I said listen, can you just give me like 2 episodes of happiness? She was like, 'Nah. If we do that, then the show's over,'\" Orji said. \"Y'all know my character is hecka messy and I hope she gets it together for my sake and for hers.\"",

                "body": "Many people don't know what the abbreviations stand for -- or how we should refer to noon and midnight.\n\nAmericans use many abbreviations in everyday speech and writing. Shorthands like \"yd\" for yard and \"a/c\" for air conditioning are pretty straightforward, but there are some misconceptions about others.\n\nFor example, take \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\" People in the U.S. are constantly thinking and talking about time in terms of a.m. and p.m., but if you ask someone what those letters stand for, you may be surprised how little people actually know about the abbreviations.\n\nSome say it's \"after midnight\" or \"past midday,\" but that isn't exactly true...\n\nIn fact, like many words and phrase in the English language, a.m. is short for a Latin phrase, \"ante meridiem\" (or \"before midday\"), while p.m. is short for \"post meridiem\" (or \"after midday\").\n\nWhile there isn't a ton of information out there about when exactly a.m. and p.m. came into popular use in the English language, the 12-hour timekeeping system dates back to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. During the Renaissance period, mechanical clocks with 12-hour analog dials appeared in churches and palaces throughout Europe.\n\nToday, most of the world uses a 24-hour system, while many English-speaking countries follow the 12-hour clock. In the places that use the 12-hour standard, there is some debate around what to use for noon and midnight.\n\nBy convention, people in the U.S. say 12 p.m. in reference to noon and 12 a.m. for midnight. But some believe that going from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. and from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. is confusing. Others would argue that noon and midnight are neither a.m. nor p.m. since noon IS midday, it can't technically be ante meridiem or post meridiem midday. Likewise, midnight is both 12 hours before midday and 12 hours after midday, which makes it confusing to choose between a.m. or p.m.\n\nTo avoid this confusion, many prefer \"12 midnight\" or \"12 noon,\" but that can seem a bit redundant, given that \"noon\" or \"midnight\" alone convey the same information.\n\nA lesser-known option is to denote noon with \"m\" for \"meridiem,\" as in 12 m -- though you run the risk of people interpreting that as \"12 midnight.\"\n\nGiven all the confusion and debate, maybe we should go with the 24-hour military time and be done with it? After all, who doesn't love staying up late on Dec. 31 to shout \"Happy New Year!\" at zero hundred hours? (Or is it twenty-four hundred hours?)",

PAC has been in existence for almost 20 years, and our mission is inclusion for all,\" she stated. \"We are proud to support Erin with her project, and we will continue to be an active and visible presence in Columbus.\"\n\nWith this event, Bailey joins a growing number of teens who are looking to make a difference in the world. She wants people to recognize Columbus as more than the city Pence was born in.\n\n\"We are so much more than just a small town that he grew up in. It is important for this event to be happening now so that others know that even in this time of hatred that is going on in the White House, we don't all agree with it,\" she said. \"We want to show our support as an all-inclusive community.\"",

                "title": "The Most Scandalous Part Of The Stormy Daniels Story Isn't The Sex",
                "body": "It's tempting to get swept up in the salacious details of President Donald Trump's (alleged) sexual antics.\n\nThe possibility of a sex tape or, God forbid, Trump nudity isn't actually what matters about his (alleged) extramarital affairs with former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, and former model Karen McDougal. Those affairs (allegedly) took place over a decade ago, when Trump was simply a reality TV star. Adultery is not a crime; nor is it surprising, given what we know about the president.\n\nWhat's important here is the way Trump and his circle of enablers went about trying to cover up these (alleged) affairs, while Trump himself was seeking the top political office in the country.\n\nTrump's personal lawyer and his allies at the National Enquirer used nondisclosure agreements to silence these women, taking a page from the corporate playbook.\n\nNDAs are already far too common in the business world, used to paper over a host of misdeeds, most crucially sexual harassment and discrimination. Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is perhaps the most egregious abuser of NDAs, which allowed him to harass and assault women for decades.\n\nTo be clear, Clifford and McDougal both say they had consensual relationships with Trump.\n\n\"He always told me he loved me,\" McDougal told Anderson Cooper in a nearly hourlong interview Thursday. Clifford is set to appear in her own interview with Cooper on \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday.\n\nBut with Trump, the stakes are even higher. \"The entire country pays the cost of not knowing things about the president,\" said David Hoffman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who specializes in contracts and psychology.\n\nBoth payouts happened when Trump was the Republican nominee for president and are already the subject of federal complaints for possibly violating election laws.\n\nDonald Trump is acting like he personally owns this information, as though he can act like a king and take any measures to control the way people talk about him. Heidi Kitrosser, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota Law School\n\nTrump's use of these agreements is even more critical now because he is reportedly wielding NDAs in the White House -- an unprecedented act -- in an attempt to silence his staffers, according to The Washington Post.\n\nMost First Amendment lawyers think those agreements would not be enforceable in court. However, the contracts do serve to intimidate and chill speech about public matters -- essentially how the government runs. Stories about the president, from staffers, are critical to understanding history.\n\n\"Donald Trump is acting like he personally owns this information, as though he can act like a king and take any measures to control the way people talk about him,\" said Heidi Kitrosser, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota Law School. \"You can't do that when you're acting with the power of the federal government.\"\n\nThe public rarely finds out about NDAs. But thanks to lawsuits filed by McDougal and Clifford, their contracts are now publicly available.\n\nThe women are both suing to break free of their contracts and talk about Trump; he's pushing back hard. The White House denies that he ever had an affair with McDougal. Though she's recently started talking to the media, McDougal said she fears legal repercussions.\n\n\"There could be financial ruin,\" she said on CNN. \"Do I feel threatened? Absolutely.\"\n\nSeparately, Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has filed suit against Clifford seeking $20 million because he claims she violated their agreement. Lawyers say Cohen is mainly trying to intimidate Clifford and stop her from talking. Previously, he admitted to paying her $130,000 out of his own pocket, but denies Trump was involved.\n\nBoth women argue in their suits that there is a public policy interest in their stories -- meaning that because they have information about the president of the United States, Americans have a right to know what happened.\n\n\"When we have a public figure -- the most public figure, the president of the U.S. -- the details are something that the public needs to know,\" said Orly Lobel, a labor law professor at the University of San Diego School of Law who's written extensively about the societal dangers of NDAs.\n\nBut there's little precedent for that argument in court, contract lawyers told HuffPost. None could think of any other instance in which a president was fighting to silence private citizens in this way.\n\n\"Trump is sui generis in a lot of ways,\" Hoffman said, echoing many of the lawyers who spoke with HuffPost, who agreed Trump is in a class all to himself.\n\nIf these women win in court, it will likely be because of the way their contracts were negotiated -- particularly Clifford's, which was written with pseudonyms. Clifford is referred to as Peggy Peterson (PP) and Trump as David Dennison (DD). DD never signed the thing, which is the primary argument Clifford is using to try to invalidate the contract.\n\n\"It's a weird document,\" said Greg Germain, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law, noting the pseudonyms and a few other factors that are out of the ordinary about the deal. He also said that Cohen's explanation for the deal -- he paid Clifford $130,000 with his own money and claims that Trump was unaware -- makes no sense.\n\n\"The lawyer saying he's acting on Trump's behalf but didn't tell him,\" Germain said. \"I don't know where he thinks that's going.\"\n\nHoffman said the Clifford agreement is the hot topic among contract lawyers at the moment.\n\n\"You just never see this stuff,\" he said, referring to NDAs. \"It never emerges from the swamp. It was never supposed to be tested in the light of a thousand suns.\"\n\nMcDougal's case is perhaps the stronger of the two, lawyers told HuffPost, because according to the suit she was misled into silence.\n\n\"It's a very straightforward application of longstanding contract principals,\" Hoffman said. \"if you're lied to in making a contract, then the contract is not valid.\"\n\nMcDougal's story may be the more troubling one. She appears to have been manipulated in a manner reminiscent of so many sexual harassment cases. For her silence, she was promised career opportunities.\n\nAmerican Media Inc. paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story (her lawyer took nearly half) and assured her she would be able to write fitness columns for two years. AMI also said she would land on the cover of several of the company's publications, including Star magazine, Radar Online and Men's Fitness, where she had appeared in 1998. In pushing her to sign the deal, the men at AMI emphasized McDougal's age, telling her that since she was an \"older model,\" the deal would be very important, according to the suit.\n\nMcDougal was excited about the opportunity, she told Cooper. \"Who wouldn't want this work?\" she said.\n\nShe signed the agreement in August 2016, shortly after Trump won the Republican nomination. (Clifford signed her deal about a week before the presidential election.)\n\n\"They wanted to squash the story,\" McDougal told Cooper -- presumably to protect Trump, she added. \"They didn't want to hurt him.\"\n\nAMI is now saying McDougal can discuss her alleged affair, but says it still owns the life rights to her story.\n\n\"I almost feel violated in that I didn't know what was happening behind the scenes. I'm angry,\" she said. \"I want my life rights back. I want to share my truth. Everyone else is talking about it. I'm standing up for myself.\"",

                "title": "Culture Mag To Its Writers: Money? It's Pretty Obscure. You Probably Haven't Heard Of It.",
                "body": "Paste Magazine is too indie to pay its contributors properly.\n\nGetting paid can be a job unto itself for contributors to Paste Magazine, a sort of catch-all culture publication, with music and arts coverage mixed in with lefty politics.\n\n\"I kept writing and submitting every two weeks, submitting invoices at the end of each month,\" former columnist Katie MacBride said. \"After a month or so, I started emailing my editors regularly and he would assure me he was looking into it, it was coming, etc.\"\n\nLike a lot of websites of its generation that survived into the next, HuffPost very much included, Paste was successful in large part thanks to the work of under- and occasionally uncompensated writers. It was founded in 1998 as a music-focused website, then expanded with a print edition from 2002 to 2010 before reverting back to being solely a web publication. That latter shift created some ripples; as Gawker's Hamilton Nolan put it at the time, freelancers said they were \"having trouble finding out about what will become of their unpaid debts\" when the print edition folded. One anonymous writer claimed he or she was owed $2,700, with invoices going back a year and a half.\n\nBy the next year, those financial worries seemed over. The site was bought in 2011 by Minnesota businessman William Sagan's music streaming company, Wolfgang's, then named Wolfgang's Vault. Founder Joshua Jackson stayed on as editor-in-chief.\n\nWhile the site has widened its remit, contributors are asking the same question freelancers were asking eight years ago: Where's our money? There's MacBride, for instance. She wrote a column, beginning in April 2016, called \"Ask an Addict.\" The recovery advice column was published bi-weekly, MacBride said, and she followed instructions on billing, dutifully sending in invoices every month.\n\nBut the checks didn't come.\n\nDespite the lack of compensation, MacBride said that she continued her work because of the platform Paste offered and the promises of payment. \"I thought about not writing any more columns until I got paid but I thought (or at least hoped) that my column was helpful to people and I didn't want to just shut that down,\" she said in an email, \"especially since I kept getting assurances that I would be paid.\"\n\nPaste isn't making millions, but they're keeping the lights on due to the pieces we're writing for them. Paul Blest, former writer for Paste\n\nBy July, the magazine had paid her for only two of five invoices, and unpaid work was piling up. MacBride said that after threatening legal action, she was paid in September. Some of the work was backlogged from May.\n\nThat's not how things are supposed to work, per Paste's writer contract. The language in Annex A-1 clearly states that contractors should expect payment \"upon publication,\" yet MacBride waited through the summer for her paychecks. Her story is far from unique: Many freelancers from Paste dealt with long wait times on payment, vague promises and a lack of communication from the company in 2017.\n\nThe problems are partly due to an expansion in coverage at the magazine. Paste's politics vertical became popular in late 2016, at the height of the election. Health, business, media -- all those sections opened and closed in the last year and a half. Freelance opportunities dried up for writers, and the payment logjam began in earnest for Paste's army of freelance writers.\n\nI was one of them. Though my issue was resolved -- I was compensated for my work, albeit after almost six months -- I can relate to the stress of waiting for a check that is frequently promised but never arrives.\n\n\"It's true that we sometimes experienced longer-than-usual delays in making freelancer payments last summer,\" editor-in-chief Joshua Jackson said in an email. \"But we've always lived within the terms and limits of our freelance agreements.\"\n\nJackson added: \"We improved our payment system late last year, and I believe we're as quick as any other publication at getting freelancers paid now.\"\n\nNot everyone recalls the delay as just \"longer than usual,\" however. Marie Myung-Ok Lee, an adjunct professor in Columbia University's Undergraduate Creative Writing Program, waited almost a year before being paid in late January for work she had done for Paste in the winter and spring of 2017. And it cost her money -- her assistant handles the invoices and the frequent follow-ups.\n\nUltimately it took threats from her agent to force Paste to pay.\n\n\"My agent basically called them and calmly threatened or whatever she does and they squirted out the check for ALL MY MONEY in a day,\" Lee said in an email.\n\nFor Paul Blest, a journalist from North Carolina who is now a writer for Splinter, Paste's willingness to publish his work at first outweighed the low pay.\n\n\"The money wasn't much but I liked writing for the site so I was fine with it,\" Blest told HuffPost.\n\nAfter months of nonpayment, though, the outlet's behavior left a sour taste in his mouth. Blest's story follows a familiar pattern: He wrote pieces for Paste, was promised payment upon invoice and was subject to a long wait period that ended only when he implied he might take action against the company.\n\n\"I'm getting DMs and emails from people I don't even know (who don't even write for the politics section) asking if I've ever gotten paid by Paste because they haven't gotten paid yet, either,\" Blest had written to his editor in an email. \"I can imagine at least a few people are considering legal action.\"\n\nYet even when Blest was paid, it was for only three of the four pieces he had written for Paste. He decided to drop it, he told HuffPost, for his own peace of mind. While Blest still isn't sure why he wasn't paid for all four pieces, the reason may lie in the way the company handles invoices. They \"must be submitted within 30 days of the story being published,\" according to a July email from politics editor Shane Ryan to contributors.\n\n\"I emailed my editor the day I got my check and said, 'Hey, this is only for $375, should I put in for another $125?' and never got a response,\" Blest said. \"I never followed up because at that point I was over it, and wasn't going to send like nine emails harassing different people for $125.\"\n\nJackson said that despite the contract's language stating a 30-day deadline for invoices, the magazine had extended a grace period to a number of freelancers.\n\n\"Of the more 900 writer invoices we've paid in the last six months, there have only been a handful of extremely late examples (a couple of which included stories published more than one year prior to being invoiced) that we've refused payment on,\" Jackson told HuffPost.\n\nBut that's not the story told by former editors Emily Ray and Mack Hayden. Ray posted a fiery attack on the company's ownership and editorial and business practices to LinkedIn in late December. Ray claimed that Paste management had stifled creativity and continually denied payment to staffers -- especially women.\n\nIn fact, when I mentioned to Ray that HuffPost had been contacted by men whom Paste hadn't paid, she expressed surprise and said she had never heard of any men who'd experienced such treatment.\n\nRay pursued litigation to pry her payment out of the company, she said, and \"agreed to accept half\" of the money she was owed \"in exchange for striking the gag/nondisclosure terms within Paste's proposed settlement agreement.\"\n\n\"Haven't been paid or heard a word,\" Ray told HuffPost in an email on March 20.\n\nRay wasn't the only editor to leave the company last year. Hayden, former assistant editor for politics at Paste, was laid off in August. He'd gotten the job after writing for Paste for a number of years, \"first in music, then mostly in books, then eventually in politics.\"\n\nOnce he was brought onto the editorial team, working on a contracting basis, Hayden said, he spent much of his time \"fielding pitches, editing pieces, getting them all set to [go] live, etc.\" But working as an editor, Hayden told HuffPost, didn't mean Paste was any more responsive.\n\n\"I experienced a lot of the same frustrations as an editor as I did as a freelancer: checks showing up at unspecified dates, sometimes taking close to four months, unresponsive staff on top of that, promises to rectify the situation that proved fruitless,\" Hayden said.\n\nCompounding the bad feelings was the fact that Hayden was subject to emails and communications from freelancers on a regular basis complaining about nonpayment -- that the money they weren't being paid was needed for basic necessities. That was \"pretty heartbreaking to me,\" Hayden said.\n\n\"We did raise the issue multiple times to higher-ups, but it seemed like most of the biggest issues were still not repaired by the time I got let go,\" said Hayden. \"I don't know what it's like now.\"\n\nAccording to Hayden, he and Ryan, his immediate superior, raised the issue of nonpayment to management many times, but the accounting department was generally unresponsive to their concerns. Hayden said that editor-in-chief Jackson and news editor Scott Russell were receptive to the feedback -- but nothing changed.\n\n\"Aloof seems more the case\" than Paste intentionally not paying writers, Hayden said.\n\nWhatever the case, the website's management wields power over those still waiting for their checks. Three people, two of them women, reached out to HuffPost anonymously to share their stories of delays in payment -- and, in one case, months of nonpayment. The latter said she wanted to keep her identity secret out of fear that Paste might not pay her at all if she spoke out under her own name.\n\nThere may be options for those still awaiting payment from the magazine if Paste continues to delay or refuse payment on invoices. Larry Goldletter of the National Writers Union said his organization has been aware of Paste's freelance issues since the summer -- but no writers have yet come forward to take advantage of the union's services.\n\n\"We know it's out there,\" said Goldletter. \"And we can get people paid; it's a pretty cut-and-dried breach of contract.\"\n\nBlest, the North Carolina writer who was paid for three of the four articles in September, recalled an email from Ryan, the politics editor, indicating that the slow payment wasn't just a glitch in the system; it was simply the way things were done.\n\n\"If you're in a place where you need to be paid quickly for future articles, and it's going to be a source of stress for you if it doesn't happen,\" wrote Ryan, \"I would recommend that you take a break from Paste for a while until I can guarantee you that we have a streamlined system that won't leave you in the lurch.\"\n\nThat, said Blest, sums up the problem.",

                "body": "Nearly 15 years after a federal judge ordered the biblical laws out of a state building, voters may allow them back.\n\nAlabama's voters will decide in November whether the Ten Commandments can be displayed on state property.\n\nThe state's House of Representatives voted 66-19 on Thursday to advance a ballot provision that would amend Alabama's constitution to allow the monuments. The state Senate has already approved the Republican proposal, which does not need the governor's signature, The Associated Press reports.\n\nThe move comes 15 years after Roy Moore, then the chief justice of Alabama's Supreme Court, lost his job for refusing to enforce a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments display from a state judicial building.\n\nUnder the proposed amendment, the Ten Commandments may be displayed on property belonging to public schools and in other state-owned buildings \"in a manner that complies with constitutional requirements.\" Those include placing the commandments alongside \"historical or educational items\" as part of a larger display.\n\nThe ballot proposal, submitted by state Sen. Gerald Dial (R), would prohibit the use of public funds to defend the measure's constitutionality if it is challenged in court. Private money would fund the displays, the AP reports.\n\nDial has brought up similar measures for years, according to AL.com.\n\nTen Commandments displays in Alabama have provoked controversy in the past. In 2003, a federal judge ordered a 5,200-pound Ten Commandments monument removed from the lobby of the state judicial building in Montgomery. Moore refused to comply, and state judicial authorities ousted him as a result.\n\nThe Alabama Republican lost a special U.S. Senate election in December after several women came forward with sexual abuse allegations against him.\n\nDemocratic opponents of the proposal say it would violate the separation of church and state, the AP reports. They also worry public schools may have to pay attorneys' fees if they face lawsuits over the displays.\n\nCritics also said the legislation was a part of a GOP push to get conservative voters to the polls during a state election year.\n\nThe Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union claimed the bill did nothing to expand or limit religious freedom protections that are already guaranteed under the First Amendment.\n\n\"This is absolutely a waste of the state's time and potentially money,\" Executive Director Randall Marshall said in a statement. \"Particularly when Alabama is facing so many other problems like failing public schools and overcrowded prisons.\"\n\nRepublican supporters of the bill said it is an affirmation of the right to religious liberty. The state has had a \"religious freedom\" amendment on the books since 1998, passed in response to the perceived weakening of religious protections.\n\n\"I wish and pray that we get to a point where people would be free to express faith without fear of being sued,\" Rep. Danny Garrett, a Republican, told the AP.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Berry Forte said it's not important to display the Ten Commandments, but to live by them.\n\n\"The devil can display the Ten Commandments,\" Forte told AL.com.\n\nTen Commandments displays have remained a contentious issue in many states. Last June, a privately funded monument to the biblical laws went up outside the Arkansas State Capitol with the state Legislature's approval. Less than 24 hours later, a man drove a car into the display. The destroyed monument will likely be replaced this April.",

Tensing claimed that DuBose tried to drive away during the interaction, saying DuBose dragged him with his car and forced him to open fire.

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The student-led national movement against gun violence will face its most high-profile moment on Saturday: As many as 500,000 people are expected to march in the nation's capital to demand political action on gun control, and sibling marches are set to take place around the country.\n\nThe March For Our Lives in Washington, D.C. -- which students from Parkland, Florida, began planning after 17 people at their high school were killed last month in a mass shooting -- boasts high-profile donors and celebrity attendees, and has inspired other communities around the U.S. to plan events.\n\n\"We have never lived in a world where there weren't major school shootings,\" said Kate Lebrun, 18. \"It should have been enough a long time ago, enough for people to start doing this amount of stuff. I realized if we don't start now, it's never going to happen.\"\n\nMore than 150,000 students in the U.S. have experienced a shooting on campus since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, according to a Washington Post analysis.\n\nLebrun and a few other students from Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, Maryland, helped coordinate lodging for teens who are coming to D.C. for the march but might have trouble finding or affording a hotel room.\n\nTeens are expected to travel to Washington from all over the country, and some area restaurants are offering free or discounted meals to student activists. More than 100 GoFundMe campaigns have sprung up to organize bus trips to marches in major cities, according to a spokesperson for the crowdfunding platform.\n\nLilly Pribish, a 17-year-old high school junior from outside of St. Louis, plans to attend the march by herself and stay with family in the D.C. area.\n\n\"Having Congress and the people in power right now see how many people are supporting these victims of gun violence ... hopefully that pushes the fact that there needs to be a change,\" she said. \"This is serious now -- like, it's not a joke, and there's a lot of people that are done with seeing issues like this on the news.\"\n\nMarch For Our Lives Action Fund, the 501(c)(4) nonprofit connected to the event, has raised millions of dollars. The money is covering expenses associated with the D.C. march, but will also be used to lobby for gun safety legislation. It's not clear what those legislative priorities are yet, and it's likely they will continue to evolve. A board of directors, which includes public servants, legal experts and professionals, will work with a student advisory board to make decisions on how to spend the money, a spokesperson told HuffPost.\n\nAs a 17-year-old, I really don't have a voice in Congress or in politics because there's not much I can do. If there's an opportunity for my voice to be heard, to do something, I'm going to take that. Lilly Pribish, student\n\nTop Republican lawmakers have so far shown little appetite for major reforms. Generating the political will to take more forceful steps, like mandating universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons -- two priorities of the student activists from Parkland -- is likely to be a tough road. Both proposals have failed to gain traction after prior mass shootings.\n\nThe only congressional legislation that currently has broad bipartisan support is the Fix NICS Act, which aims to reform the National Instant Criminal Background Check System by improving data collection for state and national law enforcement agencies. Capitol Hill leaders included the limited step in this week's government spending agreement, which also features language that would lift a long-standing ban on federal gun violence research.\n\nIn addition to supporting Fix NICS, President Donald Trump released a minimal set of proposals, largely backed by the National Rifle Association. He has backpedaled after boasting that he would stand up to the NRA and suggesting he might be open to measures such as raising the minimum age for gun purchases, which the NRA opposes.\n\nBut students planning to attend Saturday's march in Washington told HuffPost that they hoped the event -- and the \"the sheer volume\" of activists coming out to protest gun violence, as Pribish said -- could start to move the needle.\n\n\"I hope that there will be real change, instead of this bogus [proposal] that the president has put forth, which doesn't even mention assault weapons at all,\" said John Papanier, a 17-year-old high school senior from Staten Island, New York. \"I'm talking real laws. They're just trying to quiet us with a joke of a [proposal].\"\n\nIt's unclear how many counter-rallies might take place. Spokespeople for the Second Amendment Foundation and the National Association for Gun Rights told HuffPost earlier this month that they were not aware of any. News reports have since indicated that protests planned in Indiana, Montana (dubbed \"March For Our Guns\") and Utah (\"March Before Our Lives\"). In New Jersey, parents reportedly plan to rally for armed security officers in schools.\n\nMarch For Our Lives will help gauge whether students can sustain the momentum of their movement and push lawmakers to act. The event follows last week's National School Walkout, when high school students around the country left class to hold a moment of silence for the Parkland victims. Students are planning a similar walkout on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the shooting at Columbine.\n\nPerhaps the biggest test of this activism is still to come: It has yet to be seen whether the momentum can make it to the ballot box. But for now, teens -- some of whom can't even vote yet -- are leading that charge and refusing to stay quiet.\n\n\"As a 17-year-old, I really don't have a voice in Congress or in politics because there's not much I can do,\" Pribish said. \"If there's an opportunity for my voice to be heard, to do something, I'm going to take that.\"",

                "body": "Finally, Vanessa Keefer stands her ground against the emotionally abusive father of her child.\n\nIt takes all day, but, finally, Van comes to a harrowing realization about her relationship with Earn.\n\n\"Helen,\" the latest episode of \"Atlanta,\" begins with the pair taking a road trip to an Oktoberfest in the predominantly white city in White County where Van grew up. The opening scene, in which the two drive down a country road and almost hit a wild pig, is a clear reference to the beginning of \"Get Out.\" In fact, the entire episode gives off horror film vibes, but with enough jokes about white people that the satire is evident. Festivalgoers are wearing creepy masks and costumes that you think only white folks would wear, and Van takes a trip into a dark alley alone -- something a lot of black people frequently make known we just don't do.\n\nIn the middle of it all is the matter of Van's mental and emotional well-being. She has run-ins with her close childhood friend and her man, and then, due to a traditional German \"demon thief\" at the fasnacht festival in Helen, her iPhone is snatched. As she's strolling alongside an unnamed bartender during the phone hunt, Van discusses her broken relationship with Earn. \"We can be good together, but only when we really have to be,\" she says in fluent German. \"And I'm slowly figuring out that maybe we don't have to.\" She reveals the true meaning of an episode laced with references to the hostility directed at black people in white spaces: Women everywhere who have put up far too long with an undeserving hostile man should get out of the situation.\n\nIn the episode's climax, Van tells Earn that she wants to be in a committed relationship with someone who treats her with respect. Earn likes things as they are. And, in a move similar to Monica's in \"Love and Basketball,\" Van invites Earn to a game of Ping-Pong in which the back-and-forth of their tattered relationship becomes literal. But in a departure from one of the culture's favorite movies, they're done if she wins.\n\nOn this week's \"Run That Back,\" Taryn Finley and Julia Craven discuss how men are trash, white people are trash and black people who uphold anti-blackness are, yup, trash.\n\nThe episode begins with Earn performing oral sex on Van before they embark on their trip to an Oktoberfest in Helen, Georgia. On the way there, the two are happily discussing their weekend plans. Van is preparing him for the events ahead. She knows that Earn doesn't do well in white spaces and she wants to coach him on how to survive. As she's letting him know what's up, the pair almost hits a wild pig standing in the middle of the road eating some sort of melon. They joke that it made them hungry because anything can make you hungry when that loud hits.\n\nTaryn: So I was already a Van stan but this episode really cemented my adoration for her. Van is really the GOAT, not only of this episode but of this entire series. But that first scene tho ... LORDT.\n\nJulia: Why on God's sweet green earth is Earn's broke ass trying to have another baby?\n\nTaryn: WHO KNEW EARN COULD THROW THAT NECK LIKE THAT? That took me aback but I was here for it.\n\nJulia: I was here for it last night but after watching the entire episode it just made me angry. Like, this is something else Van has to give up. She has to give up good, consistent dick because Earn is a jerk.\n\nTaryn: Yea, that really makes me feel for Van but she deserves sooo much more. Also, did you peep what she said in the car on the way to Helen? Apparently it wasn't as good as it looked cause she lowkey played him and said he has more \"tongue confidence\" when he's high. I died.\n\nJulia: fghhnjadnfgfuujghvgh. Aight -- the road trip to Helen. Let's rewind a bit. It reminded me of \"Get Out\" only instead of a buck it was a wild pig. It's obviously because they're about to go into a hostile white space. And weren't Chris and Rose in bed in the opening of \"Get Out,\" too?\n\nTaryn: But yea, very much \"Get Out\" vibes. I'm also pissed that they almost hit the hog before we could get into Van's high-ass question: Are black girls considered brunettes? I can't say I haven't wondered the same thing.\n\nJulia: That's a serious question though! Are we considered brunettes? I guess so but I don't know. I wanted to hear them figure it out. The streets need answers. I'm still thinking about this lmao. And it the opener really made me think about their safety. I was like, clearly it's gonna be hostile but how hostile? Are they gonna die? It put me on edge in a good way. It was suspenseful but also, knowing Donald Glover, I was wondering what lesson Van (and we) would learn. And the moral is that Van deserves MUCH BETTER THAN EARN. Such a fucking lame.\n\nTaryn: Same thing so many black people have to think about when going into predominantly white spaces. So Van is prepping him on what to expect when they finally make it to Helen, where she grew up. You know it's about to be some shit because she's telling him that it's a tradition for some white man to run around in blackface (which, gtfo) and gives him a taste of how she's treated in town. She likens herself to the Serena Williams of Helen, which I think is brilliant: a black woman being undeniably great in a white space while still getting criticized because of her race/appearance. She's saying this while two old white ladies are staring at Earn and Van through a window like they've seen a fucking ghost.\n\nJulia: YES -- SO MUCH YES! I loved that. With Van, we really do stan a legend. And, even still, she doesn't seem to be as concerned about how Earn will be treated as she is about how Earn will treat them. She was obviously right because Earn is seriously trash and he refuses to not be.\n\nBUT -- and I'm not caping for Earn. Let me preface this with that statement. I understand how out of place he felt and how Van kinda did leave him to fend for himself a few times. HOWEVER, that doesn't excuse him shitting on her culture and making a mess of something that makes her happy.\n\nWhen you love someone, you compromise. My nigga don't like doing everything I ask of him -- and vice versa -- but if it means a lot to me and it's within reason, he does it. Making your partner happy is part of being with someone. Period. But Earn cares about only himself and that's one of his many failings. (Side note: I loved how Van, like Zazie Beetz, the actress who plays her, is also half-German.)\n\nTaryn: The way this episode is formatted is purposeful. We get a more tangible taste of Earn's perspective and uncomfortableness in the first half because we ALWAYS see the black man's view before the black woman's -- that's how it's always prioritized. We really feel Earn's discomfort with the woman who comes up and rubs his cheek, thinking he's in blackface. Then again during hootzkootz when he makes a basket on his first go 'round and everyone's stunned (he becomes the new Serena Williams at this point). And also when the presumably flirty white guy was speaking in German with Van in his face. We feel his discomfort without realizing that Van has had to grow up and come of age in this discomfort -- which we get into later in the episode.\n\nEarn pulls Van to the side during a dance competition. He wants to play Ping-Pong because he's uncomfortable and having a tough time meshing into the festivities. Van, however, really wants to dance. She beats him at Ping-Pong and asks to return to the dance floor. This bruises Earn's ego and sends him into a tirade where he ignores her genuine concerns about their relationship and she always compromising for him before throwing the fact that he pays her bills in her face.\n\nJulia: Now let's only talk about Van. Because OK, Earn is uncomfortable. Great, I get it. And I don't care. Fuck him. Van's interaction with her \"friend\" Christina BLEW ME.\n\nTaryn: I wanted to yoke up Earn's ol' fragile-ass masculinity talmbout Paper Boi's shows are \"paying your fucking bills.\" Ugh. I wanna fight him. I digress though -- cause Christina can get these hands, too.\n\nJulia: Oh we can go into Earn's masculinity. Let's address it before we get to #her because I have a lot of thoughts about Earn saying that shit to Van.\n\nTaryn: LMAO #her. Get it off your chest, sis. Cause the fact that a game of Love and Ping-Pong got his sensitive ass worked up like that made me hot in the face.\n\nJulia: Earn is homeless and he was living with Van. I get that he pulled her off to the side in hopes to find something familiar -- Ping-Pong since \"it's the only white game\" he knew. However, after she beats him, he gets real froggy. He starts being really cruel to her. He calls the festival -- and her culture -- stupid. She lets him know that she deals with his plans and his shit ALL THE TIME! And how she really only wants to spend time with him and be considered his equal -- like going to the strip club and Paper Boi's concerts. But then, this piece of shit is gonna have the AUDACITY to say: \"I wouldn't shit on that. That's paying your fucking bills.\"\n\nYou're homeless, Earn. And let us not forgot that he was homeless and using the mother of his child, playing upon her love for him, to get a place to live for next to nothing. He is so so so so so trash. It is insane how horrible of a person Earn is. Then he gets mad at the bartender, a man who showed Van more affection than he ever has and this dude don't even know her. Earn is pathetic and has such shitty relationships with women. He has no emotional IQ and an odd desire to be perceived as hypermasculine, but he isn't, so he overcompensates by being cruel to the one person who actually cares about him. But I guess that's what makes him a black man.\n\nEarn is every shitty man I've ever dated so I'm triggered but I also get how Van feels. You put all this emotional labor into a man and this is what you get back. You can't even get respected and treated like a human. You're treated like an incubator or, as she so beautifully put it, \"an accessory.\" And I think that this season we're gonna see Earn lose Van and his position as Paper Boi's manager and other things he holds dear to him. And, at the end of it all, ain't nobody rob Earn. He robbed himself.\n\nFin. I'm done. Fuck Earn always. Now onto Christina, or #her.\n\nTaryn: Earn robbed himself. Earn robbed Van. I feel like Earn robbed me. Fuck his broke ass forreal.\n\nJulia: I'm so mad.\n\nAfter Van walks away from Earn, she tries to confide in her friend Christina, another half-German, half-black woman. A white couple walks up and Christina immediately brushes Van off to talk to them before introducing her as \"Lotte's mom.\" When Van addresses it privately with Christina, she condescendingly explains that it's OK for her to treat Van that way since Van \"chose black\" and she \"chose white.\"\n\nTaryn: Christina ain't a real friend. She caters to anti-blackness and anti-womanhood. You can get a glimpse of that when that when Van is trying to confide in her about her argument with Earn. She pushed her to the side to cater to whatever her white friend and her boyfriend needed. THEN had the audacity to introduce Van as Lotte's mommy. Then the white guy whose name I don't care to look up identified her as Earn's girlfriend. I'm sick at this point because everyone is trying Van by tying her to her relationships as if she hasn't been a full person with her own identity her entire Black-German ass life. That shit happens to black women so much, yo. I was even more pissed that it came from Christina, your \"friend\" who you knew most of your damn life. Before motherhood, before Earn.\n\nJulia: When Christina said Van \"chose black\" and that she \"chose white,\" my initial reaction was \"what the fuck is this nigga talking about?\" You're still black, Christina. And you're right, this happens all the time. Black women are relegated to some sort of secondary role. Our personhood only matters if it's connected to whiteness, a man or a child that is \"well-behaved.\" (Yeah, I peeped that from ol' girl's white friend.)\n\nTaryn: Christina really needs to get her head out her ass. She's had this delusional view of race her entire life. She's presumably treated Van like shit her entire life based off their argument. Christina think's she's better than Van because she's aligned herself with white people. What she can't seem to get through her thick-ass skull is that she'll never be white. Just because Christina's boyfriend is white and Earn is black doesn't mean Van \"chose\" black and she \"chose\" white. Girl, get over yourself. Under that heat damage is a similar grade of curly, coily hair that you've judged Van for for so long. Your man probably trash too, Christina. Don't be so fucking judgy. Just loud and wrong. Ugh!\n\nJulia: Very strong and wrong. And whyyy did I think about heat damage when Van said Christina straighten her hair? Because that blow out was #laid. So eye know that heat damage is ..... yikeeeeessssssssssss. Or it could be creamy cracked down. Who knows? All I know is Van needs better friends. She doesn't need a man but my God if she's gonna have one I want her to have a better one than Earn.\n\nTaryn: \"Creamy cracked down!\" I'M HOLLERING!\n\nJulia: Listen, I have scalp burn PTSD. And we still pretending we not black in 2018? Wow. GET OUT, SIS!\n\nTaryn: And if everything else wasn't falling apart, Van's phone goes missing because of the witching-hour ritual that I didn't totally understand. She's walking outside among a big group speaking German with the flirty white guy as Earn's scary ass is in the back smoking with some random guy. I'm not sure if Van knew he was there or not, but Earn, walking around with this stupid ass mask still on his face, knew Van was right in front of him. Idk why he didn't speak up then. Or even better, follow Van into the dark-ass alley when she went to pee by herself since you wanna be so damn manly all of a sudden.\n\nJulia: His masculinity is contingent upon her needing him and taking care of her. He doesn't care to actually fix things or be of any true service. He only cares about him, which is pathetic. He showed us that when he said, \"This works for me.\" Which, how many of us have heard that?!\n\nWoman: I want something real.\n\nMan: That's valid, but I like just fucking you and using you at my discretion.\n\nTaryn: Whatever, I'm glad she finally found her phone. Of course, he texts her and they meet up back at the Ping-Pong table. For the umpteenth time this episode, I was ready to fight Earn when he initially didn't have an answer when Van asked him, \"What do you want?\"\n\nJulia: When he said the question felt like a trap??? I lost it. It's not a trap! She wants to know where y'all stand and she deserves to!!!\n\nTaryn: Kudos to Van for telling him straight up that she wanted a committed relationship \"where I'm valued as a human being and not an accessory you can fuck.\" She took so much power back when she said that. Then his sorry ass response was their \"arrangement\" works for him ... GTFO witcho sorry ass, Earn.\n\nVan was like oh word? BET!\n\nJulia: \"We can be good together, but only when we really have to be. And I'm slowly figuring out that maybe we don't have to\" was a BOPPPPP.\n\nTaryn: It really was. She reclaimed her time via a Ping-Pong rematch and whooped his ass (a second time). Van is tired of not being appreciated for the emotional labor she's been putting into their relationship. Van is every woman who's ever been with a fuck nigga for way too long, treating him better than his trash ass deserves.\n\nJulia: Her beating him in Ping-Pong was so symbolic of how she is in fact better than him. Earn doesn't deserve that woman and I'm glad she sees that.\n\nTaryn: Ugh. Van and women like her deserve so much better. They don't deserve to be constantly tired. I think this time she's truly over his shit. You could tell because she didn't take the blunt from him on the car ride back lol. I know it hurts because she has a big heart and cares for Earn, but she sees her value and it's gonna get her further than ever she would've gotten with him. So, this take on \"Get Out\" was really for underappreciated women with trash ass partners. Leave now, sis, before this ain't shit nigga costs you your sanity.",

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Ben Carson, the current HUD secretary.\n\nOn Aug. 1, HUD chief of staff Sheila Greenwood sent a message to the department's staff announcing a group of hires, including Hunter, according to an email shared with HuffPost by a HUD employee:\n\nFormer HUDster Matthew Hunter returns to us as Assistant Deputy Secretary for Field Policy and Management, bringing 25 years of experience in data science and audience engagement to the Department. Matthew most recently served as Director of Political Affairs with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nA slightly different but similar version of this announcement is online here.\n\nHunter's official HUD bio, however, has no mention of Cambridge Analytica, even though it was the job he held right before his political appointment to the Trump administration.\n\nHunter didn't return requests for comment about the dates he was employed at Cambridge Analytica and why his bio omits his previous employer. HUD's press office also didn't reply.\n\nHunter isn't the only Cambridge Analytica employee working as a Trump political appointee. As HuffPost reported Thursday, Kelly Rzendzian, a special assistant to the secretary at the Department of Commerce, worked at SCL Group -- Cambridge Analytica's parent company -- from March 2016 through February 2017. The résumé she used to apply for the government job says she worked at Cambridge Analytica at that time.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing wrong necessarily with hiring people who worked at Cambridge Analytica. The firm is facing multiple investigations over its data harvesting practices, but these specific individuals don't face any known allegations.\n\nAnd the firm was obviously well-connected in Republican circles, making it likely that some of its people would get hired into plum political jobs. But it seems that people who did work there aren't bragging about it these days.",

Gersh and her family ultimately received more than 700 threatening and harassing communications. With the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, she sued Anglin last April for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of \"emotional distress\" and violating a Montana anti-intimidation law.\n\nAnglin went into hiding and evaded process servers trying to give him notice of the litigation. On his website and through his lawyer, Marc Randazza, he threw out feints about his location. First, it was Nigeria. Then Russia, the Philippines, Greece and Cambodia. Randazza, who also represents far-right propagandist and smear artist Mike Cernovich, used the misdirection to argue that Anglin had permanently established himself overseas in an undisclosed location and, therefore, existed beyond the reach of the federal courts as a \"stateless\" person, an unusual legal category that applies to American citizens who live abroad with the intent to remain there indefinitely. For that reason, the lawsuit should be dismissed, Randazza contended.",

                "body": "NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In a rare win for gay rights campaigners in Kenya, its Court of Appeal on Thursday ruled that it is illegal to force people suspected of being homosexual to undergo anal examinations.\n\nThe landmark case was brought by the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC) after two men were arrested in 2015 on suspicion of having gay sex, which is illegal in Kenya and punishable by 14 years in jail.\n\nThe men said they were subjected to forced anal examination by security personnel and a public hospital in Kenya's coastal city of Mombasa to determine if they had engaged in anal sex and were homosexual. They were also forced to take HIV tests.\n\n\"The NGLHRC has long argued that the tests are a violation of rights to privacy and dignity and amount to torture,\" said a statement from the charity, which represents the rights of sexual minorities in the conservative east African nation.\n\n\"The violating examinations, which include being made to lie with legs up in a humiliating position and having instruments forced into your rectum, are widely accepted to have no medical merit.\"\n\nHomosexuality is taboo across Africa and the persecution of gay people is rife. Sexual minorities are routinely abused, assaulted by mobs, raped by police or vigilantes, or enslaved by criminals, campaigners say.\n\nThe judgment ends a three-year legal battle by the NGLHRC to prove that the examinations violated the rights of Kenyan citizens. It originally lost the case in 2016 when Mombasa's High Court ruled the anal tests as constitutional.\n\nThe charity then challenged the ruling in the Court of Appeal in Mombasa, which has now ruled in its favor - but many African countries such as Uganda, Zambia, Egypt and Cameroon still conduct forced anal examinations.\n\n\"The humiliation and pain caused by these useless anal examinations will follow our clients for the rest of their lives,\" said NGLHRC's head of legal affairs Njeri Gateru.\n\n\"However, we are emboldened to see our constitution at work, ensuring that all Kenyans have the right to dignity.\"\n\nThe NGLHRC is also challenging a British colonial-era Penal Code which criminalizes gay sex. The court is expected to announce on April 26 the date that it will deliver its ruling.",

                "title": "In Louisiana, A Plan To Relocate The Country's First 'Climate Refugees' Hits A Roadblock",
                "body": "The state just announced the new location it has selected for relocating a community threatened by climate change. It wasn't the community's plan.\n\nA small Louisiana tribe hoping to reunite its members in a new, upland community before their island home disappears under rising seas is now watching that goal recede.\n\nIn January 2016, the Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded the state of Louisiana $92 million for disaster resilience in coastal communities facing rising sea levels, wetlands loss and increasingly severe hurricane damage. Of that amount, $48 million was earmarked for the relocation of the Isle de Jean Charles Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe. Isle de Jean Charles lies in Louisiana's bayou country, about 80 miles southwest of New Orleans, and has seen a 98-percent loss of land since 1955.\n\nThe 600-member tribe had been planning to relocate for two decades, and rejoiced at the news the project was finally moving forward. The plan has received plenty of national media attention, heralded as the \"only government-funded climate relocation in the country\" and the tribe as the \"first American 'climate refugees.'\" But just a few weeks after the plan was announced, the tribe got bad news: The state of Louisiana had decided to change the project's scope after a rival tribe intervened, claiming that they have jurisdiction because some of their members live on the island. And now the state is moving forward with a plan that many tribal leaders aren't happy with.\n\nMost of the residents of the Isle de Jean Charles Tribe (IDJC) are descendants of Biloxi, Chitimacha and Choctaw people who retreated deep into forbidding bayou country -- locals call the region \"down bayou\" -- to escape the brutal forced relocations of Southeastern tribes under the Indian Removal Act of the 1830s. Over the years, the 22,000-acre island became a thriving, self-sufficient community, led by a line of hereditary chiefs.\n\nBut decades of levee construction, land subsistence and sea level rise have shrunk the island to just 320 acres. Most tribal members, including almost all the leadership, were forced to retreat to higher ground to keep jobs or preserve their household assets. Today, less than 100 residents, most of them natives, are left. The grant allocated to the tribe would allow them to create a new community for all tribal members and current island residents so they could be reunited, with a 2022 deadline to complete the move.\n\nThe tribe's community plan was developed with assistance from several nonprofits and architects working pro bono. It included 175 sustainable homes, health and wellness facilities, agriculture and aquaculture, meeting spaces and classrooms, all incorporating facets of the tribe's culture and economy into a town that could grow with the generations.\n\nThe plan called for island residents to be relocated first, since they are in the most precarious situation. Other tribal members would be able to move to the new town after that. If the state hadn't intervened, the new location would likely be chosen by now, and pre-construction started. Now construction at the new location isn't expected to start until June 2018.\n\nThe problems started when the United Houma Nation wrote to Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards about four weeks after the relocation plan was first announced in 2016, stating that they were \"shocked that we were never informed and brought to the table in the discussion.\"\n\nHouma Principal Chief Thomas Dardar Jr. wrote that 34 of its 18,000 tribal members were among the island's remaining residents, but he felt they \"were not brought to the table\" for the discussions. The Houma Nation, he wrote, had already acquired property \"to implement a nearly identical community development plan.\"\n\nPatrick Forbes, executive director of Louisiana's Office of Community Development, said his office enacted several changes to the plan after that letter. \"We were under the understanding that we were dealing with just one tribe,\" said Forbes. \"We realized we had a different situation on the ground than when we wrote the application.\"\n\nEven after Isle de Jean Charles' Hereditary Chief Albert Naquin Jr. addressed the Houma tribe's statements in a subsequent letter, and despite further attempts to address the state's concerns, the original project was curtailed. Under the revised plan, remaining Isle de Jean Charles residents will receive new homes first, then those who were displaced after Hurricane Isaac in 2012. Any remaining tribal members -- including those who have already relocated themselves -- will be on their own, and may have to compete with non-Indians for home plots in the new community.\n\n\"We won't restrict who can buy and build a house in the new community,\" Forbes said in February. \"We understand the IDJC's desire to reunite everybody, but that's not how we can run the project.\"\n\nHe said the state is bound by the federal Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing, to \"treat everybody [who lives on the island] the same.\" While federally recognized tribes are exempt from FHA's requirements, none of the tribes on the island are federally recognized (though they are able to get housing funding through HUD).\n\nThe Louisiana Office of Community Development formed a new advisory committee for the relocation that included the daughter of the island's non-Indian marina owner. The state also hired new architects to recreate the town's master plan, and held new community meetings. This week, Louisiana announced it has selected a location for the new town: a 515-acre site in north Terrebonne Parish, about 40 miles away.\n\nAll the changes have already put the project two years behind. Naquin said he is extremely concerned about how the tribe's plan went awry. \"This was supposed to be just for us,\" he said. \"The state is changing how this works.\"\n\nSocial anthropologist Steven L. Austin works with tribes across the United States, and while he's not involved in this case, he said the dispute between the tribes predates the relocation. Documents indicate that the Houma and the Chitimacha lived near each other as far back as the late 1700s and early 1800s and \"definitely did not like each other very much.\" The Houma were also incensed when IDJC and two other smaller tribes pulled out of the Houma Nation in the mid-1990s. He also said that the Houma have long attempted to claim the Isle de Jean Charles land as their own, and do not acknowledge Naquin as the tribal leader.\n\nNaquin and the other the Isle de Jean Charles leaders \"did all the work to make sure that people in the island community did not end up completely under water and homeless,\" said Austin in an email. \"As I understood from him, his intention was to see that every person on the island, even a white family that moved there in recent years, would benefit.\"\n\nHouma's assertion that it can intervene in IDJC's plan \"is not necessarily illegal,\" said attorney Gabriel S. Galanda, an enrolled member of the Round Valley Indian Tribes of California, \"but it is highly unethical and immoral.\"\n\n\"And, it is simply not how indigenous peoples behaved historically,\" he continued.\n\nNaquin says Houma's leaders were invited to meetings to discuss the IDJC's relocation project, but chose not to attend.\n\nThe United Houma Nation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNaquin said his tribe had been working to raise the additional $62 million needed to finish the project beyond federal grants, but the state's abandonment of the plan to create a Isle de Jean Charles tribal community homeland has slowed them. \"We've had philanthropic organizations say they are reconsidering providing the remaining funding,\" he said. \"I'm beginning to wish we had gone a different route to relocate our people.\"\n\nUnder the new plan, the IDJC has little control over the new location and what gets built there. The state's website indicates that representatives met with the IDJC leadership only once, in July 2016, before forming the new committee, and the state is working almost exclusively with current island residents to determine the future of the project. The rest of the tribe is treated only as \"other stakeholders.\" And while construction on the new location is supposed to start this summer, it's not clear when anyone will actually start moving there, although the state has said it intends to stick to the 2022 deadline.\n\nThe delay has left some IDJC tribal members struggling to keep life together on a disappearing spit of land, while other tribal members are spread over the region.",

McMaster as his new national security adviser.\n\nFEC records show that from 2014 through 2016, John Bolton's super PAC paid Cambridge Analytica $1,152,299 for \"research\" and \"survey research\" work.\n\nThe company has found itself mired in scandal this week following allegations it illegally used data harvested from 50 million Facebook users to inform its voter targeting operations.\n\n(At the same time, the firm's CEO Alexander Nix also was caught on camera touting the company's use of sex workers to apparently entrap rival political candidates in elections around the globe, and using social media to slyly \"infiltrate\" online communities with political messaging -- including the phrase \"crooked Hillary,\" which the firm claims to have invented.)\n\nThat foisted data was absolutely used to produce reports for Bolton's group, said Christopher Wylie, a founding team member of Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\"The data and modeling Bolton's PAC received was derived from the Facebook data,\" Wylie told the New York Times. \"We definitely told them about how we were doing it. We talked about it in conference calls, in meetings.\"\n\nWylie added that Bolton's PAC wanted to make people more \"militaristic\" in their worldview and was \"obsessed\" with the idea that America had become \"spineless\" on national security issues.\n\nAccording to CNN, only four other Republican campaign committees paid Cambridge Analytica more than Bolton's PAC during that time frame: Make America Number 1, a super PAC backed by Robert Mercer, a billionaire who founded Cambridge Analytica in 2014 ($1,476,484); Cruz For President ($5,805,552); and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.

But he said he had decided against a veto because the bill boosts military spending.\n\n\"As a matter of national security, I've signed this omnibus spending bill,\" Trump said.\n\n\"There's a lot of things I'm unhappy about in this bill. There's a lot of things we should have in the bill,\" he added. \"I'll say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I'll never do it again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old.\"\n\nThe bill provides $1.6 billion for border security measures including secondary fencing, levee fencing, pedestrian fencing and replacement fencing. Yet that amount falls far short of the $25 billion the White House had requested to construct a full wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe bill landed on Trump's desk six months after it was due, but around two days after it was first introduced.\n\nCongress passed five continuing resolutions to keep the government funded while Republicans and Democrats negotiated priorities. Gridlock resulted in two brief shutdowns earlier in the year.\n\nThe president called on Congress to ban the practice of delaying votes with filibusters and to grant him the power to reject individual provisions of government spending bills so he could prevent future budget problems.\n\nAccording to Trump, only President Barack Obama has signed a larger spending bill.\n\n\"And I'm sure he wasn't too happy about it, either,\" Trump said.\n\nThe bill passed the House 256-167 on Thursday, and passed the Senate 65-42 early Friday.",

                "title": "Democrats Finally See A Chance To Make Obamacare Better",
                "body": "President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010 -- eight years ago Friday. But this anniversary feels different than the ones that came before it.\n\nIn the past, Democrats have been preoccupied with implementing the law and fending off efforts to destroy it. That was especially true last year, when President Donald Trump and his Republican allies came within a single senator's vote of passing repeal legislation.\n\nNow the political environment is different. Republicans have not given up on repeal, but their assault on the law has made it more popular than ever. Meanwhile, the midterm elections are approaching. For the first time since 2010, Democrats could have governing majorities in one or even both houses of Congress -- and, two years after that, control of the White House as well.\n\nThe shift means that Democrats can focus more on the conversation they wanted, and were trying to have, all along. It's the conversation about how to fix the Affordable Care Act's shortcomings, in order to realize its ultimate goal of universal coverage.\n\nOne sign of the shifting debate came on Tuesday, when Sen. Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts became the latest high-profile Democrat to introduce a bill to upgrade the Affordable Care Act -- in this case, by offering more financial assistance to people buying insurance on their own and bolstering the law's consumer protections.\n\nWarren was also among nearly two dozen Democrats who, back in January, stood alongside Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, when he introduced a proposal that would wipe out private insurance and create, in its place, a program like Medicare that would enroll all Americans.\n\nIn unveiling his bill, Sanders (who co-sponsored Warren's bill as well) was simply introducing a new variation on an idea he has touted for years and, famously, made the centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign. But it was the first time he got support from so many of his colleagues, including, conspicuously, pretty much every Democratic senator thinking about a White House bid in 2020.\n\nLiberal think tanks are likewise putting new muscle into policy proposals. The Center for American Progress in February released a plan that would also create a Medicare-like government program. It's the most ambitious proposal the center has released since back in 2008, when it was writing white papers destined to become blueprints for the Obama administration.\n\nAnd just a few weeks before that, the Century Foundation and American Prospect magazine -- both well-known incubators of ideas Democratic officials end up using -- convened a Washington, D.C., conference. It included some of the most influential liberal policy experts. The goal was to begin hashing out the details of plans for improving or replacing the system the Affordable Care Act has created, on the theory that opportunities to pass ambitious legislation may not be far away.\n\nNone of the proposals under discussion are especially new. Most have been around since long before the phrase \"Obamacare\" was even part of the lexicon.\n\nAs president, Obama promoted many of them as ways to make his signature legislative accomplishment work better. As a candidate in 2016, Hillary Clinton proposed a $250 billion plan that would have helped people struggling with premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, much like Warren's plan would.\n\nBut even Clinton's proposal had a wistful feel to it, given that Republicans were all but certain to hold one house of Congress, blocking anything that smacked of \"helping Obamacare.\" When Clinton lost to Trump, it looked like the law's days were numbered, rendering discussion of improvements moot.\n\nAs it happens, the GOP's effort to undo the law's accomplishments ended up demonstrating just how popular those accomplishments are. Millions of people have insurance they couldn't get before, because they couldn't afford it or because they had pre-existing conditions. Americans may not be thrilled with Obamacare, but they have no appetite for giving up those gains.\n\nThe backlash was strong: Polls showed GOP repeal proposals were among the most unpopular legislative efforts in decades. And it doesn't look like the voters haven't forgotten. It is almost certainly a big reason the electoral prospects for Democrats look as promising as they do.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act's architects always expected to revisit health care. They understood the law would not fix all of the problems in the U.S. health care system -- and that it would create some new ones along the way. Still, they hoped to create a program that would run smoothly, make coverage available to most residents and prove broadly popular.\n\nIt worked out that way in states like California and Michigan, but not in states like North Carolina and Tennessee -- states where insurers over the last few years have jacked up premiums or dropped out of the markets altogether because they were losing so much money. In many of those same states, millions of low-income people remained uninsured, because officials have not made Medicaid available to them.\n\nAn obstacle to progress in these states has been ambivalence, or outright hostility, from Republican state officials in charge of implementation. It is GOP politicians who, taking advantage of leeway they got from a Supreme Court decision, have refused to expand their Medicaid programs as the Affordable Care Act's architects had intended. It is GOP officials who have declined to promote enrollment aggressively.\n\nRepublicans in Washington, D.C., have also done their part to undermine the law. Marco Rubio, the GOP senator from Florida, led a successful crusade to pull funding from the Affordable Care Act's \"risk corridor\" program, which was supposed to insulate insurers from big losses in the early years of implementation. Some insurers took big losses as a result, and a few even shut down.\n\nThese efforts have gotten even more intense since Trump took office. His administration has pulled funds for enrollment outreach and proposed regulatory changes that, experts say, will undermine guarantees of coverage for pre-existing conditions. Late last year, Republicans passed -- and Trump signed -- a tax bill that eliminates the penalty for people who don't buy insurance.\n\nWithout that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to get coverage. That will cause yet more problems for insurers, who will respond in the same way they have before: by raising rates or pulling out of markets altogether.\n\nTrump and the Republicans have all but admitted they are trying to sabotage the program. Their efforts appear to be paying off.\n\nAnd yet -- these efforts might not have such a big effect if the coverage available under the Affordable Care Act were more affordable in the first place. For many Americans, it hasn't been. One reason is the decisions Democrats made when they wrote the law.\n\nHealth care in the U.S. is so expensive that comprehensive insurance, the kind generous enough to provide real protection from medical bills, is costly even for most middle-class families. A typical employer policy for a family costs nearly $19,000, according to last year's HRET/Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation annual study, although few Americans realize it because employers are paying most of the bill directly.\n\nOn a per-person basis, this is way more than health care costs in any other country. Closing that gap was a major focus of the Affordable Care Act, which ratcheted down what Medicare pays hospitals and introduced incentives for higher quality, but less costly, care. It was part of a broader effort to push the health care system in the direction of more efficiency, in the hopes that more efficient care would also be less expensive.\n\nThe law's architects understood that process would take time, however. That's one reason they were determined to make private coverage more affordable the right away -- by offering people tax credits to offset the cost of premiums and, in some cases, out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThat arrangement has mostly worked for people with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty line, which works out to $62,750 a year for a family of four. For them, the tax credits are so generous that insurance is well within reach -- and sometimes even free! (The ones who have incomes above or just below the poverty line can simply enroll in Medicaid, as long as their state has expanded eligibility.)\n\nBut federal assistance tapers off at higher incomes and cuts out entirely at four times the poverty line, or $100,400 for a family of four. People getting little or no assistance can really struggle to pay for insurance. That's especially true for older consumers because insurers still have some leeway to charge them higher premiums. In the most extreme cases, insurance costs these people 20 percent of their income or more, not including out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nEarly versions of the legislation Democrats debated in 2009 and 2010 envisioned subsidies that were both more generous and available to more people. Had that kind of legislation passed, many fewer people would be struggling with premiums today.\n\nBut Democrats scaled back the assistance to reduce the overall price of the bill, in an effort to appease more conservative lawmakers as well as more conservative voters -- and to follow through on a pledge, which Democrats had made, that the law would pay for itself.\n\nThe health care law's architects also backed off some of the most aggressive proposed cuts to the health care industry, in order to keep those groups from using their lobbying power to block the bill's passage. This included a decision to drop the public option, which not just insurers but also hospitals and doctors opposed because it would pay them less money.\n\nPolitically, the strategy worked as intended. Most of the health care industry supported the bill, or at least didn't fight it. But it meant that their prices wouldn't be coming down much, keeping insurance prices high.\n\nThe proposals getting attention today address these problems directly. Some call for making subsidies available to all people buying coverage on their own, so that nobody has to pay more than a fixed portion of their income. (In Warren's bill, the cap is 8.5 percent of income.) Other proposals envision new twists on the public option, like opening up Medicaid to people who can't find private coverage that fits their budgets.\n\nSome plans envision government setting prices directly, not just for drug and device makers but for doctors and hospitals too. This is what most developed countries do, and it's the main reason health care in those countries is so much less expensive than it is in the U.S.\n\nThe most ambitious of the schemes circulating now are the single-payer proposals. They include all of the elements Democrats are discussing: more generous financial assistance, federally administered insurance and government-set prices. If fully implemented, they would create a health care system that strongly resembles some of the universal systems abroad.\n\nA key question for Democrats is whether the different approaches they are discussing have to be mutually exclusive. In principle, once the more incremental changes are in place, they can provide a platform for creating something more comprehensive. If the federal government is already setting drug prices, for instance, it's less of a leap -- as politics and as policy -- to have it set prices for doctors and hospitals too.\n\nStill, if Democrats get a chance to start legislating, they will have to make choices about emphasis and political strategy. Do they insist on single-payer or something close to it, negotiating back from that? Or continue to push hard for more incremental measures?\n\nAt some point, Democrats will also have to confront divisions within their own ranks. Some conservative Democrats cannot accept a system in which government provides everybody, or even most people, with insurance. Some liberal Democrats cannot accept a system in which for-profit insurers still have a significant role. Those two views are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nNor is the conversation about health care reform ultimately one Democrats can have on their own. Every idea now popular among Democrats has real potential to make medical care more accessible and more affordable. But every idea also comes with its own trade-offs.\n\nMore generous subsidies would mean more federal spending. Dramatically cutting revenues for any health care industry group would cause closures and job losses, potentially making it harder for patients to get care. Pushing everybody into public insurance would force some to give up private insurance they like.\n\nPromoters of these new policies rarely acknowledge these trade-offs. It's an open question whether most have thought through the consequences of what they propose, or formulated arguments to rebut serious criticism. That's why the conversation now underway is so important. If Democrats want to legislate someday, they need to be ready.",

Couples are coming in and it's \"She spends too much!\" and \"He's a tightwad!\" -- whatever. I help them actually have the conversation they should have had early on in their relationship: So, what was it like for you growing up around money? What socioeconomic class were you in? What was that experience like for you? What three things did your parents teach you about money? What's your biggest financial fear? What are your biggest financial goals? It's incredibly therapeutic. They're getting so much insight. Their partner can then go, \"Wow. So you're not just trying to be controlling. You have a desperate fear of going back into poverty.\" It gives context to these little money battles. And it just really opens up a wider menu of possible negotiated solutions.",

                "body": "The Parkland shooting survivor wrote an essay for Teen Vogue ahead of the March for Our Lives protest.\n\nEmma Gonzalez is not budging in her fight against gun violence.\n\nGonzalez, 18, has become one of America's most prominent advocates for gun control since a shooter opened fire in her high school in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine's Day, killing 17 people. This Friday, a day before the scheduled March for Our Lives protest for stronger gun laws, Gonzalez published a powerful essay at Teen Vogue laying out what needs to happen for U.S. gun violence to end.\n\n\"Any way you cut it, one of the biggest threats to life as a teen in the U.S. today is being shot,\" Gonzalez wrote. \"People have been shot to death en masse in grocery stores, movie theaters, nightclubs, and libraries, on school campuses and front porches, and at concerts -- anywhere and everywhere, regardless of socioeconomic background, skin color, age, ethnicity, religion, gender, geographical location.\"\n\nGonzalez is right. Guns are the third leading cause of child deaths in the U.S., according to a June 2017 analysis published in Pediatrics, a medical journal. Every day, an average of 19 children are treated in emergency rooms or die from gunshot wounds around the country. Gun violence affects boys more heavily than girls, teens more heavily than younger children, and black children more heavily than children of any other race.\n\nIn her essay for Teen Vogue, Gonzalez notes that school shootings have happened regularly all her life -- the Columbine High School shooting in April 1999 was only a few months before she was born. Cameron Kasky, another Parkland survivor turned student activist, recently described himself and his fellow teens as \"the mass shooting generation.\"\n\n\"After all of this pain and all of this death caused by gun violence, it seems as if the kids are the only ones who still have the energy to make this change,\" Gonzalez wrote. \"Fed up with the apathy pervading this country, we realized that we don't need to wait around to have our voices heard or for someone else to make a change -- we have to be the change we need to see.\"\n\nGonzalez broke down what needs to happen if our country is to combat gun violence: More companies need to cut ties with the National Rifle Association, gun sale records need to be digitized to make them more accessible, universal background checks need to be implemented, and high-capacity magazines need to be outlawed.\n\nShe also cast a skeptical eye on President Donald Trump's claims that arming teachers would prevent future school shootings.\n\n\"This doesn't make any rational or logical sense,\" Gonzalez wrote. \"How would arming teachers work, logistically?\"\n\nShe went on:\n\nWould they have to buy their own guns, or would there be armories in schools? Would students be able to break into armories?\n\nWhile teaching, would a teacher keep their weapon on their person or in a lock box?\n\nIf it was in a lock box on the other side of the room when a threatening person walked in, would the teacher be able to get to their gun in time?\n\nIf the threat and the teacher were in close proximity, would the threat not be able to disarm the teacher and turn the pistol on them and in turn the students?\n\n... And since there was a resource or police officer on campus to help protect students and teachers, why didn't that stop 17 people from getting killed and 15 from getting injured on February 14?\n\nGonzalez is one of several Marjory Stoneman Douglas students who have been pushing for gun law reform since the massacre. Their social media campaign, #NeverAgain, has galvanized a movement and garnered support from public figures like Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and George Clooney.",

The American Civil Liberties Union is suing him over the Secure And Fair Elections Act, or SAFE Act. The civil rights group says that it is needlessly restrictive and has impacted 35,000 voters. To uphold the Kansas statute, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told Kobach he had to show that noncitizen voter registration was a widespread issue and that nothing short of Kansas' proof of citizenship law could stop the problem.",

                "title": "Opinion | Exploiting America's Tribal Warfare Is Trump's Survival Strategy",
                "body": "There is no good time for Donald Trump to be president of the United States. But 2018 is among the worst.\n\nTrue, we are not at this moment engaged in all-consuming war. But what is so dangerous today is our civil war of the soul: By virtually every measure, Americans are more alienated from each other than ever before.\n\nFor someone who displays amoral, narcissist tendencies like Trump, our grave societal fissure is an irresistible opportunity -- and a tool of survival. In great measure, the president's hope of thwarting the Russia investigation depends on igniting a cataclysmic civic rupture, turning his followers against the rule of law itself.\n\nHere lies fertile ground. Instead of sharing a common vision, Americans are forming into opposing tribes based on culture and demographics. Under stress, their estrangement could tear us apart.\n\nHowever malignant his motives, Trump is the ultimate accelerant of this potentially lethal chasm -- not its cause. Over time, we have sorted ourselves into communities separated by geography, ethnicity, education, economic status and sources of information. And so demography breeds demagoguery -- in this case, invoked by a president to govern outside the law.\n\nThe election of 2016 was an X-ray of the divisions Trump manipulates. Hillary Clinton's 3 million-vote edge came from only 16 percent of U.S. counties. Yet those same counties generate 65 percent of our gross national product, and their median home price was 60 percent higher than it was in counties carried by Trump.\n\nThese ascendant counties, largely urban, are geographically isolated: islands of the relatively privileged and diverse surrounded by what is, to many of them, an uncharted sea in which people they don't know often dog paddle to survive -- in turn resentful of those who they, too, will never meet.\n\nNo longer do partisans view their political opponents as simply wrong or misguided, but as enemies of all they hold dear.\n\nThus our two major parties increasingly represent two very different Americas. And this divide cuts through education, race and gender.\n\nAs the demographer and researcher Paul Taylor writes in The Next America, the GOP \"skews older, whiter, more religious and more conservative, with a base that is struggling to come to grips with the new racial tapestries, gender norms and family constellations,\" whereas Democrats tend to be \"younger, more nonwhite, more liberal, more secular, and more immigrant- and LGBT-friendly.\"\n\nThese opposing groups have become hostile forces living in gated communities of the mind, ripe for exploitation by an unprincipled president. According to a Pew Research survey taken after the 2016 election, Fox News was the primary source of campaign reportage for 40 percent of Republicans -- but only 3 percent of Democrats who, though in lesser numbers, preferred CNN and MSNBC. And so mutual estrangement metastasizes unchecked.\n\nThe result, Taylor explains, is that \"90 percent of Republicans are to the right of the median Democrat in their core social, economic and political views, while 94 percent of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican.\" Moreover, he adds, \"two thirds of consistent conservatives and half of consistent liberals say most of their close friends share their political views.\"\n\nThis divide permeates our attitude toward basic institutions. More Republicans than Democrats distrust government. Twice as many Democrats as Republicans favor labor unions. Most Americans distrust the media, but Republicans distrust it more. Most Democrats, but only a minority of Republicans, believe that colleges and universities have a positive effect on our society.\n\nThanks to Trump, this schism inflames our most visceral issues.\n\nTake race and ethnicity. In 2016, nearly 75 percent of Clinton supporters said our growing diversity made America better; fewer than half of Trump supporters agreed.\n\nOr immigration. More than 80 percent of Democrats view it positively; the 42 percent of Republicans who agree are slightly outnumbered by those who feel immigrants -- legal or otherwise -- burden America.\n\nOr feminism and gender. Recent polls inspired by the Me Too movement show that a strong majority of Democrats consider sexual harassment a serious problem, but fewer than half of Republicans agree.\n\nOr guns. Far more Republicans than Democrats consider gun ownership to be an essential element of freedom. Of all our societal debates, none breeds more anger, fear and paranoia.\n\nAll these fault lines fuel political trench warfare, stifling compromise and preventing us from resolving our most pressing problems. But equally pernicious is how this mass failure of empathy and imagination poisons our attitudes toward each other -- and serves Trump.\n\nNo longer do partisans view their political opponents as simply wrong or misguided, but as enemies of all they hold dear. As Taylor notes, ever more Republicans and Democrats deny each other's facts, disapprove of each other's lifestyles, avoid each other's neighborhoods, impugn each other's motives, doubt each other's patriotism, deplore each other's news sources, detest each other's party and, indeed, despise and dehumanize who they imagine each other to be.\n\nRelentlessly, Trump stokes this. And so his enthusiasts feel beset by hostile forces that only Trump can repel.\n\nThis, above all, is what makes the Trump presidency such an unrelenting tragedy and, at worst, our undoing. If Vladimir Putin had designed a \"Siberian candidate\" to weaken and degrade us, he could have done no better than Trump. The presidency has not transformed him; he has transformed the office. His sickness worsens ours.\n\nNow, quite obviously, Trump is preparing to subject our country to a constitutional crisis - to save himself.\n\nTrump's countless lies erode communal understanding. He attacks our courts and slanders any governmental body that can call him to account. He exploits the bully pulpit to sow discord and shift blame. He nourishes the racial, ethnic and religious hatreds that most divide us.\n\nRelentlessly, he undermines respect for democracy and civil liberties. He rejects the responsibility of a president to respect our institutions and administer our laws. He discredits any source of information that threatens his alternate reality -- striving to obliterate our collective belief in the existence of objective fact.\n\nIn sum, Trump makes no distinction between his office and himself. He governs only to serve his warped psychology and infinite self-absorption.\n\nBut his ultimate damage may be yet to come.\n\nThe Russia investigation looms ever larger. Before the rise of Trump, the issue presented would have been unthinkable: whether a major-party presidential candidate, subsequently victorious, bartered America's interests in exchange for electoral or financial assistance from our leading foreign adversary. But beneath that lies an even more fundamental -- indeed, existential -- question: whether our democracy and the rule of law can withstand assault from a president to whom they are inimical.\n\nTrump has repeatedly attacked the credibility of the Russia investigation, and all those seeking to conduct it, inflaming his adherents. A Reuters poll in February showed that 73 percent of Republicans believe the Justice Department and FBI are \"working to delegitimize Trump through politically motivated investigations.\" Indeed, another poll found that 77 percent of Republicans believed that senior officials \"knowingly coordinated to frame the president with allegations of Russian collusion.\"\n\nNow, quite obviously, Trump is preparing to subject our country to a constitutional crisis -- to save himself.\n\nHis public bullying of Andrew McCabe, culminating in a spiteful firing timed to inflict economic damage, is yet another effort to intimidate those who would uphold the rule of law. He has attacked deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and special counsel Robert Mueller, and conscripted Republicans in the House, to serve a single purpose -- to undermine lawful efforts to investigate the role of his campaign in Russia's attack on our election, and persuade his fervent followers that reckoning his responsibility subverts their will.\n\nHe has every reason to hope. His party's spineless leaders murmur their misgivings -- but take no legislative steps to protect Mueller and his investigation. Fox News and the right-wing media inflame his adamant adherents. His shabby chorus of legal and political enablers shout that conspirators within the government are victimizing Trump. All this feeds the president's all-consuming psychic urge: to bury the truth by firing Mueller -- confident that his strategy of divide and diminish will save him from impeachment.\n\nShould he succeed, our descent into tribalism will become authoritarianism. Our salvation lies in citizens -- and leaders -- who insist on a common commitment to what has defined America at its best: an idea of country, and ourselves, that transcends the hatred and alienation that -- as history illustrates so vividly -- enable demagogues to destroy democracy itself.\n\nOur defining moment is at hand.\n\nRichard North Patterson is a New York Times best-selling author of 22 novels, a former chairman of Common Cause, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.",

The chain, unable to compete with the likes of Amazon and Walmart, announced last week it would begin liquidating U.S. outlets. (The toy store's founder died Thursday at age 94, to make the situation even sadder.)\n\nBut the old \"Simpson's\" episode does seem to foreshadow the depressing events a bit, no?\n\n\"The Simpsons\" has built its future-seeing rep in part for conceiving of Donald Trump as president 16 years before he was actually elected, featuring Lady Gaga in a performance eerily similar to her Super Bowl concert five years later, and prophesying that the U.S. would win gold in curling at the Winter Olympics.\n\nNow we await the next vision from \"The Simpsons\" oracle.",

According to Daryl Hannah, who plays Angelica Turing on the show, viewers will be satisfied with how series creator Lana Wachowski wraps up the story.\n\n\"I think Lana did an incredible job writing this and does give some closure to some of the storylines and keeps the message and connectivity in there,\" Hannah told HuffPost.\n\nThe short-lived sci-fi series, praised for its inclusiveness, follows a group of psychically linked characters from around the world who are being hunted by a mysterious and well-funded multi-government research group.\n\nWhen Netflix said over the summer that \"Sense8\" would not be getting another season, fans spoke up all over social media. Shortly afterward, Wachowski announced that \"Sense8\" would return in the form a finale.\n\n\"The passionate letters, the petitions, the collective voice that rose up like the fist of Sun to fight for this show was beyond what anyone was expecting,\" she wrote on Twitter, adding, \"Improbably, unforeseeably, your love has brought 'Sense8' back to life.\"\n\nDeath doesn't let you say goodbye. 2 hour finale episode in the works. Tell your cluster. pic.twitter.com/GHZgGuHwS0 -- Sense8 (@sense8)\n\nJune 29, 2017\n\nHannah said she's glad to see \"Sense8\" returning, even if it's just for a one-off finale. That said, feelings on the set have definitely been mixed, she said.\n\n\"I think it's disappointing to everybody, even to us, because the cast and the crew were so tight and just loved each other and the whole experience so much. It was a huge, huge undertaking for Lana and for Netflix,\" Hannah said. \"We had to shoot in 16 different cities ... and countries -- Africa, India, everywhere all over the world. I think it was a great experience and it would have been great if would have gone on longer. But it had its moment.\"",

And this is also why our society is so fucked up,\" Rose continued. \"We allow him to be himself. He can listen to whatever music he likes, he can like whatever color he wants and we let him be passionate about whatever his little heart desires.\"\n\nRose's strong words came after she posted two videos on Tuesday of Sebastian opening a personalized gift from the musician, which included VIP tickets to an upcoming concert.\n\n\"This is going to be so exciting,\" the little boy says in one of the videos.\n\nThe videos garnered thousands of responses, including some from people who seemed troubled by the kid's Taylor Swift fandom. Rose, host of the podcast \"Loveline With Amber Rose,\" decided enough was enough.\n\nShe explained that she and ex-husband Wiz Khalifa, Sebastian's father, \"don't make our son live by society norms that's why he's so special,\" and that \"liking a certain type of music will not make you 'pick' your sexuality.\"\n\nShe added: \"P.S. my son just got accepted into the most prestigious private school in Los Angeles because he's smart as fuck and creative as fuck like his parents.\n\n\"He also has more money in his bank account than any of you trolls could ever imagine Lol.\"\n\nRose implored fans to \"do better for the next generation\" and \"teach ur kids to love and not hate.\"\n\nShe ended the rant with this: \"Regardless if he's gay or straight when he gets older he will be around the most amazing loving people that will support him no matter what.\"\n\nA study of 760 teens by Violence Prevention Works found that 78 percent disapproved of anti-gay teasing or bullying. Those most likely to be bullied are \"kids who are gay or thought to be gay,\" the study found.\n\nThe organization notes that bullying and harassment have damaging effects on LGBTQ students, including \"extreme anxiety, depression, relationship problems, low self-esteem, substance abuse, and thoughts of suicide.\"",

As of late, we've seen brands like Loft and Draper James take a step towards more inclusive fashion, but there is still a ways to go in terms of making every body price point, part of the conversation.\n\nThat's why we can appreciate when a convenient brand like Target takes a step in the that direction.\n\nWith an expanded assortment of more than 1,700 styles that's full of bright, tropical colors and globally inspired textures, including an expanded assortment of swimwear for all sizes, Target Swim is providing options for many guests. Sizes range from XL to 26W, and range in price from $14.99 - $49.99, with most items under $24.99.\n\nTarget wanted to add some more depth to the conversation and will not airbrush or reshape any of their bathing suit styles.\n\nWe saw Aerie take the lead in 'no-photoshop' a few years back, and now Target has followed. Instead of contributing to the culture that is \"gearing up for swim season,\" they're \"celebrating women and encouraging them to embrace the beauty of their own bodies.\"\n\nGet inspired to finally try on that two-piece or statement one-piece with Target Swim. The full collection is available now at Target.\n\nCheck out some of our favorites from the line below:\n\nHuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.",

Washington imposed new sanctions on 19 Russians and five groups, including Moscow's intelligence services, for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other cyber attacks.\n\nThe Obama administration in 2016 indicted seven Iranians for distributed-denial-of-service attacks on dozens of U.S. banks and for trying to shut down a New York dam. Those hackers were also accused of working on behalf of Iran's government.\n\nOn Friday, the Treasury department named the Iran-based Mabna Institute and Behzad Mesri, also known as \"Skote Vahshat,\" who was charged in 2017 with hacking cable TV network HBO.",

                "body": "One Million Moms, an advocacy group that has largely focused its efforts on condemning progressive ideology in the entertainment industry, on Wednesday aimed its sights on Scholastic, one of the world's largest publishers of children's books.\n\nIn a post on its website, One Million Moms took particular issue with one book, George, a chapter book intended for kids in grades 3 to 7. Written by the queer activist and author Alex Gino, George tells the story of a transgender fourth grader. The 10-year-old hopes that by playing Charlotte in her school's upcoming production of Charlotte's Web, she'll finally get her parents and teacher to look past the gender that was assigned to her at birth and accept her as a girl.",

I recently read a tweet about a teen who saw the film with her mom, who apparently wasn't very understanding of her daughter's sexual identity, and it changed her mom's opinion and helped her to be more accepting. My own experience and the experience of others like this teen prove that \"Love, Simon\" doesn't just have the power to change lives. It is changing lives, and I hope people understand that when they go to see it. I never would have pictured myself where I am today without this movie or book, and I'm entirely grateful for the gift it's given me. It's also made me realize that we need more films like \"Love, Simon\" that portray the LGBTQ+ community in a positive way. This kind of representation matters, and it really can be absolutely transformational for people who are looking for examples of themselves or people like themselves in the media.",

She'd interviewed detectives and survivors, visited crime scenes and wrangled with \"the cold brutal facts,\" Oswalt told People magazine.\n\nSadly, McNamara did not live to see her dream come to fruition. The 46-year-old mother of one child died suddenly in her sleep on April 21, 2016.\n\nHowever, in the months after her death, Oswalt told media outlets that her dream did not die with her and that he would see to it her book got published. That promise has been kept, and I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer will be published by HarperCollins on Feb. 27.\n\n\"It's an intense, fascinating read,\" Oswalt wrote on Facebook.\n\nOswalt, who married actress Meredith Salenger in July 2017, told his Facebook followers that he hopes the book will help crack the case.\n\n\"I can't help feeling that somewhere, in her final pages, she left enough clues for someone to finish the job she couldn't -- to put California's worst serial killer behind bars,\" he wrote.\n\nThe New Yorker published an excerpt from the book this week. It's titled \"Letter to the Golden State Killer.\" The excerpt reads, in part:\n\n\"You were what you left behind: a four-inch vertical cut in the window screen at the ranch house on Montclair, in San Ramon. A green-handled hatchet on the hedges. A piece of cord hanging in a birch tree. Foam on an empty Schlitz Malt Liquor bottle in the back yard. Smears of unidentifiable blue paint.

                "title": "Here's How To Find Out If There's Teflon In Your Beauty Products",
                "body": "When you're thinking of beauty products, ingredients like hyaluronic acid and retinol probably come to mind. Teflon, on the other hand? Not so much.\n\nHowever, a recent study conducted by the Environmental Working Group found that a number of beauty and skin care products contain Teflon, the brand name for a chemical called polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE, and/or other fluorinated chemicals known as per- and polyfluoralkyl substances (PFASs).\n\nAs the study notes, \"Teflon (or PTFT) [is] one of thousands of PFASs -- some of which have been linked to serious health effects including cancer, thyroid disease and reduced effectiveness of childhood vaccines.\"\n\nTo find out which products contain Teflon and other chemicals in the same class, EWG searched through its Skin Deep database, which contains the ingredient lists for over 74,000 products.\n\nThe EWG scientists were able to identify 13 different PFAS chemicals in almost 200 products, including makeup, shampoo and sunscreen, from 28 brands. Of those nearly 200 products, 66 products from 15 brands (including CoverGirl and L'Oreal) contained Teflon.\n\nEWG senior scientist David Andrews told HuffPost that PFAS chemicals are added to cosmetics for a number of reasons, including oil and water repellency. Waterproof mascaras and eyeliners, for example, are common makeup items that may use PFAS chemicals.\n\nPFASs can also give products a different feel or \"slipperiness,\" Andrews said, noting that they are sometimes used in frizz-fighting hair products.\n\nEWG called PFASs \"among the most worrisome\" of chemicals used in products that come into regular contact with our skin and our bodies. PFAS chemicals have been found in everything from fast-food wrappers to Scotchgard fabric protector, and \"have polluted people, animals, drinking water and the environment worldwide,\" the study notes.\n\nThe study also states they're allowed to be in cosmetics and skin care products only because of outdated federal regulations regarding the safety of cosmetics.\n\nSome PFAS chemicals have been linked to the health concerns mentioned above, but Andrews acknowledged there is some uncertainty as to how dangerous they are in cosmetics.\n\n\"At the same time, we think there's enough information about these types of chemicals and this class of chemistry to not have them in cosmetics, especially in places where there seems to be alternatives,\" Andrews said.\n\nThe good news? \"The vast majority of products were not using these types of ingredients,\" he added. \"So we really think these chemicals shouldn't be in cosmetics.\"\n\nOne simple way to identify these potentially harmful ingredients is to look at your product labels for the term \"fluoro,\" which may appear in a longer name, such as perfluorononyl dimethicone or perfluorodecalin, Andrews explained. You should also look for PTFE.\n\nIf you do notice any of these ingredients, don't panic just yet. The study notes, \"Absorption of these chemicals through skin is not expected to be a significant route of exposure.\"\n\nHowever, it also says that the absorption may increase if applied around the eye area, where the skin is a little thinner, and depending on the type of PFASs in products, the absorption may vary.\n\nAt present, EWG says not enough is known about the potentially harmful effects of PFAS chemicals in cosmetics, but recommends staying away from products that include them.\n\nOf course, there is plenty more research to be done. But, as Andrews said, \"This is just highlighting that our exposure to these chemicals may be coming from a wide variety of sources, not just contaminated drinking water.\"\n\n\"We don't know very much about how much we're being exposed through cosmetics or what impacts they may be having,\" he added. \"But, it's significantly concerning that they are so widespread and being used by many of the top brands.\"\n\nTo read the full study, head to the EWG website, where you can also see a full list of PFAS ingredients and find out which products contain them.",

                "body": "The mummified remains are just 6 inches long, yet have the bone structure of a 6-year-old.\n\nThe mystery of a tiny skeletal mummy that has captured the public's imagination and baffled scientists for years may have finally been solved.\n\nThe body is just 6 inches long and likely a fetus; however, it has a skeletal structure that appears to be that of a 6-year-old child. Since the mummy had 10 pairs of ribs instead of 12 and an elongated head, some believed it could be an alien.\n\nBut DNA tests confirmed that the skeleton, nicknamed \"Ata\" as it was discovered in Chile's Atacama Desert in 2003, was human.\n\n\"I had heard about this specimen through a friend of mine, and I managed to get a picture of it,\" Garry Nolan, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, said in a news release. \"You can't look at this specimen and not think it's interesting; it's quite dramatic.\"\n\nThe analysis by Nolan and a team of other researchers confirmed that the skeleton was not an alien, nor a primate as some had speculated. It was the fetus of a girl who had suffered from a host of severe genetic mutations. Some of those mutations had never been linked to bone or developmental problems.\n\nNolan told the Guardian that Ata was either a stillborn or died right after birth.\n\n\"She was so badly malformed as to be unable to feed,\" he said. \"In her condition, she would have ended up in the neonatal ICU, but given where the specimen was found, such things were simply not available.\"\n\nThe tests also showed that the remains weren't ancient, as some had theorized, but only about 40 years old.\n\nNolan said:\n\n\"While this started as a story about aliens, and went international, it's really a story of a human tragedy. A woman had a malformed baby, it was preserved in a manner and then 'hocked' or sold as a strange artefact. It turns out to be human, with a fascinating genetic story from which we might learn something important to help others. May she rest in peace.\"\n\n\"DNA differences like this are useful to help us diagnose children and adults with 'undiagnosed' disorders,\" Atul Butte, director of the Institute for Computational Health Sciences at the University of California-San Francisco, told CBS news.\n\n\"More and more children's hospitals are able to study patients and better understand what differences in their DNA might be leading to their conditions or disorders,\" Butte added. \"And the ones we learned here can get added to the catalogs for future reference.\"",

                "body": "She suffered a severe allergic reaction, slipped into a coma and died from multi-organ failure.\n\nA woman in Spain has reportedly died after being stung by a bee during an unusual kind of acupuncture treatment.\n\nApitherapy, or \"bee therapy,\" is the medicinal use of products made by honeybees, including bee venom, to treat ailments from arthritis to burns to muscle aches. It's been touted as a beauty treatment by actress Gwyneth Paltrow and holistic health practitioners.\n\nOne type of apitherapy -- live bee acupuncture -- was administered to a 55-year-old woman as a treatment for stress and muscle contractions. The procedure involved placing live bees on the patient's body so could be stung and injected with bee venom.\n\nThe woman was treated with live bee stings on a monthly basis for two years and suffered no ill effects, researchers wrote in a case study that was published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology. However, during her last treatment, she suffered a severe allergic reaction, slipped into a coma and died from multi-organ failure several weeks later.\n\nPrevious tolerance to bee stings does not mean people are safe. In fact, the researchers noted that \"repeated exposure to the allergen was found to carry a greater risk of severe allergic reactions.\"\n\nThe study's authors said they believe this was the first reported case of death by bee venom apitherapy \"due to complications of severe anaphylaxis.\" The study did not reveal when the woman's death occurred.\n\nA 2015 study of apitherapy that was published in PLoS One found that nearly 30 percent of patients experienced some kind of negative reaction. Although the researchers issued warnings against the treatment, they also suggested better training for practitioners and better emergency care.\n\n\"The risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable,\" the authors concluded.\n\nIn 2016, Paltrow told The New York Times that she found live bee acupuncture \"pretty incredible,\" adding: \"But man it's painful.\"\n\nLast year, actor Gerard Butler revealed that he went into anaphylactic shock after being injected with the venom of 23 bees during treatment for muscle problems. His apitherapy didn't involve the use of live bees.",

                "body": "Black Lives Matter activists linked arms and blocked the Golden 1 Center while chanting: \"Stephon Clark!\"\n\nOutraged over the latest police shooting of an unarmed black man, hundreds of protesters flooded the streets of Sacramento, California, on Thursday, even forcing an events center into lockdown minutes before an NBA game.\n\nThe daylong demonstration was held in response to Sacramento police officers killing 22-year-old Stephon Clark in his grandparents' backyard on Sunday night while responding to reports of car break-ins. The Sacramento Police Department said officers believed Clark had advanced toward them while holding a gun, though police only found a cellphone on him after an exhaustive search.\n\nDemonstrators on Thursday first stormed the buildings of Sacramento City Hall before moving out to the streets and marching down Interstate 5, the Sacramento Bee reported. They also gathered in front of the Golden 1 Center and, with linked arms, blocked ticket holders from entering the arena for a game between the Sacramento Kings and the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nProtesters carried signs that demanded justice and criticized police officers for shootings of unarmed people, especially black men.\n\nSome in the crowd carried signs that read, \"Stop killing us\" and \"Black lives matter,\" along with other messages demanding justice.\n\nAt City Hall, protesters chanted, \"It's a phone, not a gun,\" according to Ezra David Romero of Sacramento's Capital Public Radio News.\n\nProtesters also chanted, \"Say his name. Stephon Clark!\"\n\nPolice on Wednesday released footage showing the moments before and after officers shot and killed Clark while responding to reports of car break-ins. The videos were filmed from a sheriff's helicopter and several body cameras.\n\nWhile following Clark's movements, deputies in the helicopter said they witnessed Clark shattering a sliding glass door before he encountered police, according to a department press release.\n\nIn aerial footage of the incident, thermal images show Clark running through a yard and hopping a fence. He stops at the home he shares with his two young children and grandparents. It is there that he's confronted by two police officers.\n\nThe body camera footage shows officers running into Clark's grandparents' backyard. From around a corner, one officer yells at Clark to show them his hands. Then an officer can be heard yelling \"gun,\" prompting both officers to open fire.\n\nThe officers, who fired 10 rounds each at Clark, said they believed he was holding a gun. The police department also said officers thought Clark was carrying a toolbar used to smash windows.\n\nThe only thing officers found on Clark was a cellphone.\n\nA birds-eye view of the protest for #StephonClark outside the @Golden1Center. Fans have been told the game is delayed but many think it wil be canceled. pic.twitter.com/KSFOOECZmZ -- Frances Wang (@FrancesWangTV)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nAfter protesters blocked the entrance to Golden 1 Center, the Sacramento Kings were forced to keep the arena's doors closed to ticket holders.\n\nThe game started after a delay, with many seats remaining empty in the arena.\n\n\"Due to law enforcement being unable to ensure ticketed fans could safely enter the arena, the arena remains closed and we ask fans outside to travel home,\" the Kings said in an official statement. \"We will issue further information soon regarding a refund.\"\n\nOutside of the Golden 1 Center, some protesters told ABC 10's Frances Wang that they weren't sorry for the ticket holders who weren't able to enter the Kings game, \"because as black people, they have been inconvenienced their whole lives,\" Wang tweeted.\n\nStephon's brother Stevante Clark spoke to the crowds outside of the Kings' game, saying that the police \"killed and murdered\" his brother.\n\n\"They think we're animals,\" he said. \"They're killing us like animals.\"\n\nStevante Clark encouraged the activists to focus on their community while calling for justice. He also hugged Stephon Clark's girlfriend and mother of his two children while asking the crowd to chant Stephon's name.\n\nStephon Clark's brother is at the protest at Golden 1 Center... speaking to the protestors. #StephonClark https://t.co/oQe9qKYnzo -- Frances Wang (@FrancesWangTV)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nAccording to The Sacramento Bee, protesters repeated a chant that is becoming all too familiar in the ongoing fight against police brutality: \"Hands up! Don't shoot!\"\n\nIn the first three months of 2018, police in the U.S. have killed at least seven unarmed people, according to The Washington Post's database. In 2017, they killed 68 unarmed individuals.\n\nView photos of Sacramento's protests over Stephon Clark's killing below.",

                "body": "\"Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake,\" Trump said in February 2016.\n\n\"We should have never been in Iraq,\" he added. \"They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none, and they knew that there were none.\"\n\nWith the exception of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), none of the other Republican candidates were talking like that. They acknowledged mistakes were made, but none was willing to go after the presidency of George W. Bush so directly.\n\nBut on Thursday, Trump threw his skepticism out the window and chose one of the loudest cheerleaders for the 2003 Iraq invasion to be his new national security adviser.\n\nI am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nBolton is a notorious warmonger, calling for the United States to go to war with both Iran and North Korea.\n\nIn the run-up to the Iraq War, Bolton was the Bush administration's top diplomat on arms control, and he pushed the line -- which the country now knows to have been a lie -- that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\"We are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction and production facilities in Iraq,\" Bolton said in 2002.\n\nAnd even though the primary justification for the war was bogus, Bolton has stood firm that he believes the invasion was the right choice.\n\n\"I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,\" he said in 2015. \"I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces.\"\n\nTrump gained momentum in part because of his opposition to Iraq. It wasn't the primary issue in the race, but it was an important one. After all, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was widely considered to be the front-runner for the nomination. He stumbled early in the campaign, however, when he was unable to give a straight answer about whether he thought his brother's war in Iraq was a mistake.\n\nTrump capitalized on the war issue. He claimed, over and over, that he was against the war all along -- including before the invasion. It was a way that this real estate developer tried to show that he was better on foreign policy than his rivals were.\n\nBut there is zero publicly available evidence that Trump opposed the invasion. Instead, there was a 2002 interview with Howard Stern in which Trump tepidly supported the invasion. Trump's dislike of the endeavor, at least publicly, came well after the war was underway.\n\nTrump saw an opening -- dissatisfaction with the war and the Bush foreign policy legacy -- and seized on it, even if he did so disingenuously.\n\nLike other recent hires by Trump, Bolton is a frequent presence on cable news.\n\nBolton does not need Senate confirmation. But Paul recently wrote an opinion article counseling the president not to choose Bolton, saying it would be an abandonment of his campaign promises.\n\n\"Mr. President, you had it right in your campaign that our foreign policy has been a disaster,\" Paul wrote. \"Arming the neocons with massive power will only pave the way for more of the same.\"",

It was the students who made all the news, and that noise started, and then the movement wouldn't stop. I think, maybe, this noise that those students in Florida are making ... will do something of the same nature,\" Murray wrote.\n\n\"The thing that's so powerful about students is that, when you haven't had your idealism broken yet, you're able to speak from a place that has no confusion, where there is a clear set of values.\"\n\nBut kids aren't the only ones with idealism, he notes.\n\n\"There are idealists left over the age of 18, I'm sure of it. Idealism is a voice that's inside of you; it's your conscience. [It] can really deteriorate along the way ... and it can become almost dysfunctional, but it's there. Everyone has it. Sometimes it's just a whisper, but in some people, it's a shout.\"\n\nA letter earlier this month from Barack and Michelle Obama to the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a mass shooter killed 17 people last month, also hailed the teenagers' activism. \"Not only have you supported and comforted each other, but you've helped awaken the conscience of the nation, and challenged decision-makers to make the safety of our children the country's top priority,\" they wrote.\n\nThe students are headed to Washington, D.C., for Saturday's March for Our Lives protest for stricter gun control. They're expected to be joined by hundreds of thousands of other students and supporters for a march down Pennsylvania Avenue. There are over 800 affiliated marches planned in the U.S. and abroad.",

                "body": "The shake-up also comes just two weeks after Trump accepted an invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's appointment of John Bolton as national security adviser has left North Korea policy experts deeply troubled and confused just weeks after many expressed optimism about an upcoming summit with dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nTrump announced Thursday that Bolton would replace his outgoing adviser, H.R. McMaster, early next month. Bolton is seen as one of the most controversial and dangerous figures in U.S. diplomacy and is a fierce war hawk who has long advocated for a preemptive military strike against North Korea and the dismantling of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\"This news is hard to process,\" Van Jackson, a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, said in an email. \"What I can say at the moment is that Bolton isn't just a run-of-the-mill hawk; he's a kind of warmonger. He's never seen a foreign policy problem that couldn't be solved by bombing.\"\n\nThe news of Bolton's appointment comes just days after Trump replaced Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Together, Bolton and Pompeo will make up one of the most hawkish U.S. foreign policy teams in recent memory, according to The New York Times.\n\nBetween Pompeo and Bolton, you're looking at a neocon foreign policy jacked up on steroids. Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation\n\nThe shake-up also comes just two weeks after South Korean officials said Trump had accepted an invitation to meet with Kim sometime over the next few months in what would be the first meeting ever between the Kim regime and a sitting U.S. president.\n\nIt's unclear how Bolton's appointment will affect the planned meeting, the details of which have yet to be announced, and he refrained from commenting on the prospects of the summit in an interview with Fox News on Thursday.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation program at the Middlebury Institute, described Bolton's approach to national security as \"border fetishism\" that would jeopardize any future deal by the U.S.\n\nBolton is \"someone who has an absurdly narrow conception of American national security, based on an extremist definition of sovereignty,\" he told HuffPost. \"This is a man who looks at any international agreement not as countries working together but as a loss of American sovereignty and power.\"\n\nWith regard to the future of the Iran nuclear deal, Lewis said simply: \"This is bad.\"\n\n\"Bolton undertook a dedicated campaign to destroy the U.S. nuclear deal with North Korea, which he's been very clear about -- he doesn't even hide it. So my guess is that Bolton will undertake precisely the same campaign [with the Iran deal], and, in this case, he will reinforce all of the president's worst tendencies,\" he said. \"It's a good deal, and Bolton's probably going to do a lot of damage to it.\"\n\nThe U.S. signed an \"Agreed Framework\" with North Korea in 1994 to freeze Pyongyang's nuclear power plant program. After Washington received intelligence that North Korea's nuclear program was advancing more rapidly than expected, Bolton wrote: \"This was the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework\" in his memoir, Surrender Is Not an Option.\n\nAlexandra Bell, the senior policy director at The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said the timing of the Bolton announcement may give credence to skeptics who felt the acceptance of a meeting with Kim was merely a stunt meant to beef up support for military intervention.\n\n\"A week and a half ago, people were concerned that this was simply a box-checking exercise that would enable the Trump administration to say: 'We tried and it didn't work,'\" Bell said. \"I am concerned that those people may have had a point.\"\n\n\"Between Pompeo and Bolton, you're looking at a neocon foreign policy jacked up on steroids.\"\n\nThe news of Bolton's appointment will likely do little to persuade the North Koreans to abandon their nuclear weapon program, analysts warn.\n\nHe's never met a country he hasn't wanted to destroy. Vipin Narang, a professor of international relations at MIT.\n\nJust last month, Bolton wrote a highly controversial editorial in The Wall Street Journal in which he laid out the case for a preemptive strike against the North, a position he has long touted.\n\n\"His op-ed last month advocating for, and justifying, a preemptive strike against North Korea says it all,\" Vipin Narang, a professor of international relations at MIT, told HuffPost. \"How do you convince Kim Jong Un to even freeze testing -- let alone countenance any disarmament -- when this is America's national security adviser?\"\n\n\"He's never met a country he hasn't wanted to destroy,\" Narang continued.\n\nStephen Schwartz, an independent nuclear policy consultant, expressed particular concern over Bolton's \"track record\" of consistent support for military action over diplomacy.\n\n\"We've got an apparent summit in the works, but we don't really have anybody to plan it because all the experts have basically fled or been forced out of the State Department, and now you've got somebody coming in who has no interest in diplomacy,\" Schwartz said. \"If you pair that attitude with a president who's willfully ignorant and lacks impulse control, it becomes a very dangerous situation with regard to Iran and North Korea.\"\n\nOne thing is clear, experts say: When Bolton takes up his post on April 9, the White House will be home to one of the most polarizing diplomatic picks in history, even by Trump administration standards.\n\n\"The problem with this president is that he won't accept 'No' for an answer,\" Schwartz continued. \"Now, with John Bolton as the national security advisor, if the summit fails and [Trump] comes back and says, 'We tried that, now what do we do?' Bolton will say, 'I know! We should attack North Korea!'\"",

                "body": "More guns would better protect \"mothers, children and families,\" Trump's national security pick said in the 2013 video.\n\nIn the latest chilling confluence of Russia and the U.S. government, a startling 2013 Russian video has emerged featuring Donald Trump's pick to become national security adviser, John Bolton, promoting Russian gun rights for a Kremlin-connected banker who is reportedly being investigated by the FBI.\n\nThe Bolton video was distributed by a gun rights group co-founded by Russian citizen Alexander Torshin, according to National Public Radio, which unearthed the video. Torshin is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia.\n\nTorshin, who also served in the Russian government, is the focus of an investigation by the FBI to determine if he illegally funneled Russian funds to Trump's campaign through the NRA, McClatchy has reported. It's illegal to use foreign funds to influence federal elections.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Election Commission launched a similar probe to determine if the NRA was acting as a conduit for illegal Trump campaign funds, Politico reported.\n\nTorshin, who served as the deputy speaker of Russia's Parliament for more than a decade and was on Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee, reached out to members of the Trump campaign through the NRA, according to McClatchy. He also hosted dinners for NRA executives during their trip to Moscow in 2015.\n\nThe NRA spent a record amount on 2016 elections, including $21 million to back Trump and $14 million to attack his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nTorshin helped create the NRA's Russian equivalent, The Right to Bear Arms, which sponsored the Bolton video. The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations urged the Russian government to change its constitution to allow gun rights similar to those in America.\n\nA source close to Bolton told NPR that he was originally asked to record the video by then-NRA President David Keene. At the time, Bolton was a member of the NRA's international affairs subcommittee, according to NPR.\n\nOn the video, Bolton praises a \"new era of freedom\" in Russia on the 20th anniversary of the adoption of its constitution.\n\n\"Were the Russian national government to grant a broader right to bear arms to its people, it would be creating a partnership with its citizens that would better allow for the protection of mothers, children and families without in any way compromising the integrity of the Russian state,\" Bolton says on the video. \"That is my wish and my advice to your great people.\"\n\nBolton appeared in the video shortly after a Right to Bear Arms conference was held in Moscow. Alan Gottlieb, the founder of the U.S.-based Second Amendment Foundation, who attended the conference, told NPR that he assumed the event was supported by the Russian government -- otherwise it would not have taken place.\n\nKeene spoke at the conference of his close ties with Torshin, who regularly tweeted about his visits with Keene over the years, according to NPR.\n\nThe NRA recently revealed that it has been responding to questions from the FEC about campaign contributions as part of the FEC investigation but has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn response to a letter from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) concerning his fears of illegal campaign contributions being funneled through the NRA, the gun lobbying organization responded that, as a \"longstanding policy to conform with federal election law, the NRA [does] not accept funds from foreign persons or entities in connection with United States elections.\"",

                "title": "Here Are 6 Of John Bolton's Most Belligerent Op-Eds In Recent Years",
                "body": "President Donald Trump named John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and one of the most controversial figures in foreign policy, as his new national security adviser.\n\nIn a tweet on Thursday, the president said Bolton would replace Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster starting on April 9.\n\nBolton was the U.N. ambassador under former President George W. Bush. He also served in the State Department under presidents George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis return to the White House marks a polarizing move for the administration, even by Trump's standards. In interviews and statements over the years, Bolton has expressed a hawkish approach to foreign policy and a penchant for the most aggressive tactics. He is also a prolific writer, detailing his strong views in dozens of books and op-eds over the years.\n\nHere are excerpts from six op-eds that put Bolton's hawkishness on display and provide a taste of what may be to come in his role as national security adviser.\n\n\"The Legal Case For Striking North Korea First,\" The Wall Street Journal, 2018\n\nPre-emption opponents argue that action is not justified because Pyongyang does not constitute an \"imminent threat.\" They are wrong. The threat is imminent, and the case against pre-emption rests on the misinterpretation of a standard that derives from prenuclear, pre-ballistic-missile times. Given the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute. That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation. [...]\n\nIn contemporary times, Israel has already twice struck nuclear-weapons programs in hostile states: destroying the Osirak reactor outside Baghdad in 1981 and a Syrian reactor being built by North Koreans in 2007.\n\nThis is how we should think today about the threat of nuclear warheads delivered by ballistic missiles. In 1837 Britain unleashed pre-emptive \"fire and fury\" against a wooden steamboat. It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \"necessity\" posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first.\n\n\"To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran,\" The New York Times, 2015\n\nThe inescapable conclusion is that Iran will not negotiate away its nuclear program. Nor will sanctions block its building a broad and deep weapons infrastructure. The inconvenient truth is that only military action like Israel's 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein's Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor, designed and built by North Korea, can accomplish what is required. Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.\n\nRendering inoperable the Natanz and Fordow uranium-enrichment installations and the Arak heavy-water production facility and reactor would be priorities. So, too, would be the little-noticed but critical uranium-conversion facility at Isfahan. An attack need not destroy all of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, but by breaking key links in the nuclear-fuel cycle, it could set back its program by three to five years. The United States could do a thorough job of destruction, but Israel alone can do what's necessary. Such action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran's opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran.\n\n\"A 'Three-State Solution' For Middle East Peace,\" The Washington Times, 2014\n\nFor more than two decades, U.S. policymakers have generally acceded to Palestinian insistence that a new state be created for them, stitching together the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. These territories have no particular history either of national identity or of economic interdependence. They are simply bits and pieces of the collapsed Ottoman Empire and the failed League of Nations' post-World War I mandate system.\n\nThe only logic underlying the demand for a Palestinian state is the political imperative of Israel's opponents to weaken and encircle the Jewish state, thereby minimizing its potential to establish secure and defensible borders. The cruelest irony is that by using the Palestinian people as the tip of the spear against Israel, their supposed advocates have caused the Palestinians extensive suffering. Their economic well-being, their potential for development and the prospect of living under a noncorrupt, representative government have been lost in the shuffle of challenging Israel's very right to exist.\n\n\"Paris Attacks: Four Important Lessons World Must Learn From French Tragedy,\" Fox News, 2015\n\nThis is not a matter for the criminal law, as many American political and academic leaders, including the President, have insisted, even after the September 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThis is a war, as President Hollande has forthrightly called it, not a slightly enhanced version of thieves knocking over the corner grocery store within an ordered civil society. And the mechanism of response must be to destroy the source of the threat, not prosecute it, not contain it, not hope that we will \"ultimately\" destroy it. \"Ultimately\" is too far away. [...]\n\nKnee-jerk, uninformed and often wildly inaccurate criticisms of programs (such as several authorized in the wake of 9/11 in the Patriot Act) have created a widespread misimpression in the American public about what exactly our intelligence agencies have been doing and whether there was a \"threat\" to civil liberties. Now is the time to correct these misimpressions, and to rebut the unfounded criticisms that have in too many cases become the conventional wisdom.\n\n\"Migrant Crisis Isn't Just Europe's Problem, It's Our Problem, Too,\" Fox News, 2015\n\nPhotos of immigrants trying to storm the Eurostar train's \"chunnel\" entrance in France to cross under the English Channel to Britain compete with videos of the recent terrorist attack on the Thalys high-speed train between Amsterdam and Paris. How many boat people and others who seem to be economically motivated are actually terrorists, perhaps trained by the Islamic State in Syria or Iraq, seeking to conceal themselves among economic migrants to gain access to Europe? This is the same issue America faces on the Mexican border. [...]\n\nCompounding the problem, tens of thousands of legitimate Middle Eastern refugees are fleeing religious genocide in their home countries, and several EU states, mostly in East and Central Europe, have moved quickly to grant them asylum. These refugees are primarily Christians from Syria and Iraq threatened by the Islamic State or other radical jihadis, but non-Christian sects like the Yazidis are also properly and successfully seeking asylum.\n\nHard though it may be for some to acknowledge it explicitly, the receiving European governments feel that their humanitarian decision to provide refuge to Christians and others fleeing radical Islamicists is far safer than accepting undifferentiated populations that may contain terrorists using the true refugees as cover. This is hardly farfetched. In 1980, Fidel Castro deliberately and cynically emptied Cuban prisons of true criminals and allowed them to escape to American in the Mariel boatlift, along with over 100,000 legitimate refugees. The Europeans are well to be cautious.\n\n\"The Only Mistake Of The Iraq War Was That We Didn't Get Rid Of Saddam Hussein Sooner,\" The Telegraph, 2016\n\nWe should not have invaded Iraq in 2003. Instead, we should have finished the job in 1991 after ridding Kuwait of Iraqi aggressors. We were told then that Arab coalition members, especially Syria's Assad dictatorship, would object to overthrowing Saddam. Perhaps they were seriously worried they were next. Too bad they weren't. And there would have been no question of any Iraqi WMD after 1991. [...]\n\nThe war's opponents point to today's chaos in the region and ascribe it to Saddam's overthrow. That conveniently ignores the tidal wave of radical Islamic ideology that was already rising in the twentieth century's last decades, and now continues unabated, Saddam or no Saddam. It also misses the West's devastating failure to stop Iran pursuing nuclear weapons. Bumbling diplomacy has legitimised terrorism's bankers in Tehran, affording them a clear path to deliverable nuclear warheads on their own timetable.\n\nIraq today suffers not from the 2003 invasion, but from the 2011 withdrawal of all US combat forces. What strengthened Iran's hand in Iraq was not the absence of Saddam, but the absence of coalition troops with a writ to crush efforts by the ayatollahs to support and arm Shi'ite militias. When US forces left, the last possibility of Iraq succeeding as a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional state left with them. Don't blame Tony Blair and George W Bush for that failure. Blame their successors.",

Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary this September. The news thrilled the award-winning actress's fans, many of whom continue to associate her with her iconic \"Sex and the City\" character, Miranda Hobbes.\n\nCattrall, who played Samantha Jones on the long-running TV series, was asked about her co-star's campaign on Twitter. She responded dutifully, though it would be a stretch to call her remarks an endorsement.\n\nI support & respect any former colleague's right to make their own career choices. https://t.co/zae7nJ6VFi -- Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nCattrall's response seemed especially blunt when compared to those of two other \"SATC\" stars.\n\nOn Monday, Kristin Davis, who played Charlotte York Goldenblatt in the HBO show, said she was \"so proud\" of Nixon, pointing to her co-star's work on behalf on public education.\n\nI am so proud of @CynthiaNixon , no one cares more than she does about EVERY person getting a fair change and a good education. I know that she would be an excellent Governor ! https://t.co/xEAyRxFBb8 -- Kristin Davis (@KristinDavis)\n\nMarch 19, 2018\n\nWillie Garson, who played the character Stanford Blatch, followed suit on Instagram.\n\n\"Together we can turn things around with candidates such as her,\" he wrote.\n\nAll eyes have been on the \"Sex and the City\" cast in the four days since Nixon announced her gubernatorial campaign.\n\nCattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie Bradshaw, have been engaged in a war of words since last fall. After Parker confirmed that plans for a third \"Sex and the City\" film had officially been scrapped, many believed that Cattrall's \"diva demands\" were to blame.\n\nThough Cattrall denied the reports, she was critical of Parker in an October interview with Piers Morgan and eventually clapped back at her co-star in a blistering Instagram post last month.\n\nNixon, meanwhile, has downplayed the suggestion that the demise of \"Sex and the City 3\" pushed her to run for governor.\n\n\"This is a decision that has been a long time coming,\" she told Entertainment Tonight. \"People have actually been asking me to do this for nine years.\"",

                "body": "\"Parkland, it was a tragedy. But we have the same situation going on in our hood every day. And we don't get the same response.\"\n\nAt a Thursday event on gun violence in Atlanta, young students of color spoke out about how often the issue affects their communities -- and how little the country pays attention.\n\n\"Parkland, it was a tragedy,\" 18-year-old Shatony Rivers, a senior at Miami Norland Senior High School in Miami's Liberty City neighborhood, said at the Urban Gun Violence Town Hall. \"But we have the same situation going on in our hood every day. And we don't get the same response from media, officials or government.\"\n\nThe town hall, which was held at Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church and live-streamed on Facebook, was organized by anti-gun violence groups from across the country as part of a new National Black and Brown Gun Violence Prevention Consortium. Held two days before the March for Our Lives -- a protest organized by student survivors of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, last month -- it was meant to \"center children of color in gun violence post-Parkland,\" according to a release.\n\nOver 100 attendees came from as far New York, California, Illinois and Minnesota, an organizer told HuffPost. A panel of young gun violence activists and students, from communities affected by gun violence in Miami and Chicago, spoke. The teens from Miami had arrived on buses as they headed to the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., which will be Saturday.\n\n\"I live right down the street from the hood. I hear police sirens every day,\" said Rivers. \"We don't have the same response from political leaders.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland -- and the wave of student-led activism that has followed -- some have remarked on the comparatively little attention paid to routine gun homicides in the U.S, which disproportionately affect communities of color, specifically black communities.\n\n\"Every day we have enough of our loved ones dying in our communities to equal a mass shooting,\" Rev. Michael McBride, director of Live Free, said at the event. \"It's because our communities have been disinvested from. It's because we'd rather spend more money on police, prisons and jails, rather than schools, jobs and housing.\"\n\nActivists and public figures have also noted the overwhelmingly positive public response to the student activists from Parkland -- who attended school in a largely white, relatively affluent Florida suburb -- compared to the frequent vilification of young black activists protesting gun violence.\n\n\"Nobody comes to Liberty City unless they want sirens -- that's not the Miami you see on websites,\" 15-year-old Janai Altenor, a student at Miami Norland Senior High School, said at the town hall. \"The children who make it out every day, those are our real heroes. Y'all just have to give us the pedestal.\"\n\n\"We got a voice,\" she added. \"We could really change the world.\"\n\nGeorgia state Rep. Erica Thomas (D-Austell) echoed what the students expressed.\n\n\"When they're talking about gun violence, at the end of the day, the most important thing you can say is, 'If I am old enough to get shot at, then I am old enough to speak out against being shot at,'\" Thomas said at the town hall. \"Your voice is more important than the voices down at Congress.\"\n\nStudent activists from Parkland have recently spoken out about the disparity in treatment given to white victims of mass shootings compared with black victims of gun homicides.\n\n\"If this happened in a place of a lower socioeconomic status or ... a black community, no matter how well those people spoke, I don't think the media would cover it the same,\" Parkland survivor and activist David Hogg said in a Twitter Q&A earlier this week.\n\n\"We have to use our white privilege now to make sure that all of the people that have died as a result of [gun violence] and haven't been covered the same can now be heard,\" Hogg added.\n\nSeveral of the speakers at Thursday's event noted how communities of color often lack the investment and resources from policymakers to help prevent gun violence in the first place.\n\n\"Chicago had a campaign to put down the guns -- but [they] didn't talk about what you're going to pick up,\" said Ronnie Mosley, founder of Chicago-based \"youth think tank\" Millennials Movement. \"You put down a gun, but you can't pick up a job, you can't pick up a book at your school.\"\n\n\"Parkland students have this right: The people in office now, their time is up,\" he added. \"And the people we have to replace them with: It's us.\"",

No, we're not talking about a wig reveal, or a jaw-dropping runway segment, or a great challenge, though those are all important, too. We're talking about the perfectly crafted, wit-first, signature RuPun.\n\nYou know the puns we're talking about. When the \"Drag Race\" queens are assembled on-stage, and RuPaul is delivering her decisions, she summarizes the judges feedback -- and does it all with a joke. \"Impersonating Beyoncé is not your destiny, child.\" \"You gave us 'Fifty Shades of Grey' Gardens.\" They're so ubiquitous that Trixie Mattel has made a minor cottage industry off making up her own.\n\nIn honor of the season 10 premiere, we've compiled every RuPun that the host has ever said across 12 seasons of the show and All Stars.

                "title": "Last Nun In Property Dispute With Katy Perry Pledges To Continue The Fight",
                "body": "\"Katy Perry is used to getting all she wants,\" the defiant Sister Rita Callanan said.\n\nSister Rita Callanan is the last surviving member of a group of nuns who've been entangled in a property dispute with pop star Katy Perry for years.\n\nBut even after Callanan's sole remaining sister in the fight died during a court hearing earlier this month, and despite the fact that a judge has already ruled against her, she has pledged to continue her battle against the celebrity singer.\n\n\"I'm not going to give up,\" the 79-year-old nun told The Daily Beast on Thursday about her mission to assert rights over her former California convent, a hilltop property in the Los Feliz neighborhood with spectacular views of downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\"I just feel that Katy Perry is used to getting all she wants, and to her money means everything, and to her, whatever Katy wants, Katy gets,\" she added.\n\nCallanan is a member of the Sisters of the Most Holy And Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The nuns claimed they bought the estate in 1971, pooling together income they had earned as teachers in Los Angeles parochial schools.\n\nBut since 2015, the nuns have been involved in a heated dispute with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles over who has the right to sell the property. The archdiocese struck a deal with Perry to sell the 8-acre property for $14.5 million. Perry has reportedly said she wants to live on the property with her mother and grandmother.\n\nThe Los Angeles Archdiocese claims the property was no longer suitable for the elderly women. The nuns moved out of the convent in 2011.\n\n\"There are a lot of stairs, and it's a really big space as well,\" Adrian Alarcon, a senior spokesperson for the archdiocese, told The Daily Beast. \"A lot of the sisters now live in assisted living homes or retirement homes where they can get the proper care they need.\"\n\nCallanan and fellow sister Catherine Rose Holzman attempted to sell the property to a local restaurateur, Dana Hollister, for $15.5 million, according to the Los Angeles Times. Hollister reportedly wanted to turn the property into a hotel.\n\nA Los Angeles County superior court judge ruled that the nuns' sale was invalid in March 2017.\n\nCanon law dictates that the sale of any property for more than $7.5 million requires the Vatican's approval. The judge found that nuns did not receive permission from the pope, the Holy See or their local archbishop for the sale, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nIn November, a jury decided that Hollister had intentionally interfered with the sale. The jury awarded the archdiocese $3.47 million in lawyer's fees, while Perry's company, Bird Nest LLC, was awarded $1.57 million in fees.\n\n\"I am thrilled with the outcome,\" Perry's manager, Steve Jensen, told the Los Angeles Times in November. \"It just proves that we have been right all the way along.\"\n\nOn March 9, Holzman collapsed and died during a post-judgment hearing related to the dispute. She was 89 years old.\n\nHolzman spoke to Los Angeles station KTTV about the fight with Perry hours before her death. It would end up being her final interview.\n\n\"To Katy Perry, please stop. It's not doing anyone any good except hurting a lot of people,\" Holzman told the station.\n\nCallanan started a GoFundMe page in October 2017 to help raise money for the legal fight. She's raised over $38,000 so far.\n\nThe nun mourned the loss of her \"cherished partner\" Holzman in an update she posted to the page on March 10.\n\n\"It is now more important than ever to continue this fight and for our cause to prevail,\" the nun wrote.",

The 23-year-old reportedly had another plan to kill himself that involved detonating a bomb inside a crowded McDonald's, ending his own life and as many others as possible.\n\nHe also described himself as a \"psychopath\" in the 28-minute recording, which was made Tuesday evening, and thought of himself as disturbed from an early age.\n\nFederal, state and local authorities are still searching for a motive in the bombings that killed two people and left five injured. Of the six total blasts, five occurred in Austin and one in the San Antonio area.\n\nPolice believe Conditt's laptop, which was destroyed in the blast inside his car, might have contained other recordings that are now likely lost. In the cellphone recording, he reportedly blamed himself for allowing security cameras in and around a FedEx store to record his face and license plate number, according to the American-Statesman.\n\nConditt lived in Pflugerville, an Austin suburb, where he was home-schooled along with his younger siblings. His family issued a statement Wednesday afternoon saying they felt \"devastated and broken.\"\n\nOther details about Conditt's life and perspective are scant. As part of his homework for an Austin Community College government class, he kept a blog for a few months in early 2012 in which he detailed conservative views on topics including same-sex marriage (he was against making it legal) and terrorism (he was against cutting deals with al Qaeda operatives).\n\nA BuzzFeed report revealed that Conditt had been active in a Bible study group called Righteous Invasion of Truth (RIOT) that focused on outdoor survival skills, including how to shoot guns and use knives.\n\nAuthorities have warned that he may have planted or mailed other bombs before to his death and have asked residents to stay vigilant.",

                "body": "The Trump administration plans to approve a $1 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, the State Department announced during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to the United States this week.\n\nThe White House has signaled its support for the sale, which would include around 6,700 anti-tank missiles and $300 million in parts for the Saudis' helicopters and tanks, the department said Thursday.\n\nThe Defense Department confirmed the deal in its own release. \"This proposed sale will support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives by improving the security of a friendly country which has been, and continues to be, an important force for political stability and economic growth in the Middle East,\" the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.\n\n\"This potential sale is consistent with U.S. initiatives to provide key partners in the region with modern systems that will enhance interoperability with U.S. forces and increase stability.\"\n\nHowever, the deal is likely to cause controversy due to the Saudis' role in Yemen. Saudi Arabia -- the largest foreign buyer of American-made arms -- is a major belligerent in the Yemeni civil war, and since March of 2015 has carried out a deadly airstrike campaign against the Houthi rebel group that opposes the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.\n\nThe Saudi-led intervention has killed thousands of civilians and contributed to one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters. Millions in Yemen lack basic access to food and medical care, while Saudi airstrikes have devastated the country's infrastructure and prevented aid shipments from reaching those in need.\n\nHuman rights groups routinely criticize Western governments, including the U.S. and United Kingdom, for profiting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia. They point to how these bombs are sometimes dropped on residential areas where they have killed young children and families.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis defended the sale when a reporter asked about the civilian deaths in Yemen, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\"We believe that Saudi Arabia is part of the solution,\" Mattis said. \"They have stood by the United Nations-recognized government, and we are going to end this war. That is the bottom line. And we are going to end it on positive terms for the people of Yemen, but also security for the nations in the peninsula.\"\n\nThe AP notes that lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sale after the State Department approves it.",

But I got the greatest publicity,\" he said during a White House forum with millennials called Generation Next. \"I was getting such great -- until I ran for office.\"\n\nHe continued, lavishing praise on himself for \"exposing fake news\" to the public.\n\n\"But people get it. People really do get it,\" he said. \"There is a lot of fake news out there. Nobody had any idea. You know, I'm actually proud of the fact that I exposed it to a large extent, because we exposed it. It's an achievement.\"\n\nTrump's response wasn't the only headline-making comment of the forum. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who is overseeing the administration's response to the opioid crisis, issued a warning against taking fentanyl -- a synthetic drug that's largely replaced heroin -- by urging millennials to \"eat the ice cream, have the french fry, but don't buy the street drug.\"",

Most stories about this supposed drug trend have been based exclusively on self-reporting and thinly sourced claims by law enforcement without any confirmation.

                "body": "Tennessee awarded a man $1 million after he spent nearly 32 years in prison for a crime that DNA evidence cleared him of.\n\nLawrence McKinney, 61, was imprisoned in 1978 for rape and burglary before freed in 2009. The Tennessee Board of Claims granted him the compensation on Wednesday.\n\nNashville Attorney David Raybin, who has represented McKinney for the last six years, described the outcome as \"bittersweet\" for McKinney who was only formally exonerated from the crimes within the last three months.\n\n\"I've been a criminal defense attorney for 40 years, this is probably one of the most moving events I've ever experienced,\" he told HuffPost on Thursday. \"To have someone in prison that long and to fight for years, for six years to get him some justice, it has just been an enormous undertaking.\"\n\nThe payment is divided into one $353,000 upfront payment, which is to cover attorneys fees, debts and the cost of a vehicle, followed by $3,350 monthly payments for a minimum of 10 years. If he should die before those 10 years, either his wife or his estate will be eligible to collect the following monthly payments, the Tennessean reported.\n\nThe $1 million compensation is the highest permitted by the state, as well as the highest it has ever granted due to the length of time McKinney served. That's not to say that everyone is calling the amount sufficient.\n\n\"The board of claims at the hearing said that they thought it was an inadequate award,\" Raybin said.\n\nHe pointed out that the $1 million maximum was set about 10 years ago and doesn't consider adjustments for rising costs of living.\n\nStill, if you ask McKinney, he might say that the closure of this chapter of his life is a blessing enough, Raybin said.\n\nThe board of claims at the hearing said that they thought it was an inadequate award.\"\n\nAfter being released from prison nine years ago, he endured a yearslong legal battle for both monetary compensation and exoneration.\n\nThe parole board twice refused to formally exonerate him, even though the Shelby County Criminal Court and district attorney general found that DNA evidence failed to link McKinney to the crime he was convicted of. Former Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) also declined to clear his name when given the chance, Raybin said.\n\nIt wasn't until December 2017 that current Gov. Bill Haslam (R) completed the task for McKinney, an act that then made him eligible to seek compensation from the state.\n\n\"In the eyes of the judicial system, Mr. McKinney is innocent,\" Haslam said in a statement at the time. \"While I appreciate the hard work and recommendations of the Board of Parole, in this case, I defer to the finding of the court charged with determining Mr. McKinney's guilt or innocence.\"\n\nRaybin shared McKinney's gratitude to the board and the governor.\n\n\"He was obviously very moved by all of this,\" Raybin said of McKinney's reactions, saying he expected the exoneration would come sooner or later. \"He has infinite patience, and he is also a very religious person and has extreme faith in God.\"\n\nAs for that $1 million maximum, Raybin said some of the board members told him that they will revisit the cap next year.\n\n\"Many other states have much higher amounts,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit legal organization that fights to exonerate those who have been found wrongly convicted through DNA evidence, 18 states do not have laws that would grant compensation to individuals incarcerated for a crime they did not commit\n\nThose states are Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Wyoming.\n\nThe Innocence Project stresses the need for adequate compensation to those who are wrongfully convicted. Recently released individuals often find themselves without family, friends, housing, transportation, insurance and retirement money.\n\nIn the case of those who are proven to have been wrongfully convicted through DNA, those individuals on average spend more than 14 years behind bars before their release, the organization's website states.",

Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in September.\n\nIn a tweet, the company announced Lazarus' death, saying there had been \"many sad moments\" recently but none more upsetting than the death of its founder.\n\nThere have been many sad moments for Toys\"R\"Us in recent weeks, and none more heartbreaking than today's news about the passing of our beloved founder, Charles Lazarus. Our thoughts and prayers are with Charles' family and loved ones. -- ToysRUs (@ToysRUs)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nLazarus founded Toys R Us in June 1957, nine years after he opened his first baby furniture and toy store in Washington, D.C., called Children's Bargain Town. After nearly a decade running Children's Bargain Town, Lazarus restructured his business, decided to focus solely on toys and reformatted the store to take after a supermarket, so customers could see open shelves of toys and place desired items in shopping carts.\n\nIn the '80s, Toys R Us went international, opening locations all over the world. During the company's closing announcement last week, administrators for the retailer said it planned to close all 75 stores in the U.K. The widespread shutdowns will affect roughly 3,000 employees in the U.K., and about 31,000 in the U.S. There are 791 remaining Toys R Us locations in America.\n\nThe company had about $5 billion in long-term debt when it filed for bankruptcy in September. When Toys R Us first entered Chapter 11, it had an ambitious plan to restructure and reemerge a healthy business. But after a weak holiday season performance coupled with intense competition from rivals including Amazon, Target and Walmart seemed to do the company in, according to USA Today.\n\nLazarus had no stake in Toys R Us at the time of his death, CNN reported, but the toy industry titan served as CEO of the business until 1994.\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, a Toys R Us spokesperson reiterated the sadness the company felt after Lazarus' death, adding, \"He visited us in New Jersey just last year and we will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere.\"",

                "title": "Former Mormon Missionary Center Leader Accused Of Sexual Assault",
                "body": "A 55-year-old woman claims she was assaulted at a missionary training center in 1984.\n\nYears-old sexual abuse allegations against a former Mormon missionary leader were published on a whistleblowing website this week, prompting a public pledge from the Utah-based church that it would discipline the alleged perpetrator if the claims were found to be true.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement Tuesday that it is looking into \"deeply disturbing\" allegations against Joseph Bishop, who served as president of a Mormon missionary training center in Provo, Utah, in the 1980s.\n\nA 55-year-old woman has accused Bishop of sexually assaulting her in 1984 while she was training to be a missionary. The woman claims Bishop raped her at the center, according to a Brigham Young University police report obtained by HuffPost. The woman's name has not been disclosed in the press or in the police report.\n\nBishop was the president at the Missionary Training Center (MTC) in Provo from 1983 to 1986. An MTC is where the LDS church trains thousands of young men and women before they are sent out as missionaries to countries across the world.\n\n\"If the allegations of sexual assault are true, it would be a tragic betrayal of our standards and would result in action by the Church to formally discipline any member who was guilty of such behavior, especially someone in a position of trust,\" the church said in its statement.\n\nThe church's statement came days after a taped conversation between Bishop and the woman was posted to MormonLeaks, a website started by ex-Mormons seeking to increase transparency within the LDS church.\n\nLast December, the woman posed as a reporter and secretly recorded an interview she had with Bishop in Arizona. During the wide-ranging conversation, she asked Bishop questions about the alleged assault and about other women he may have harassed. The Mormon leader, who is now 85 years old, can be heard saying he doesn't remember assaulting the woman and muses that maybe it's \"because my mind doesn't want me to remember that.\"\n\nAt one point in the interview, the woman asked if Bishop molested another Mormon woman at the MTC. He admits that he gave one woman a back rub that got too \"frisky.\"\n\nHe apologizes repeatedly in the recording and says that for years he has struggled with a \"sexual addiction.\"\n\n\"I am very, very sorry and I am so sorry. I don't know if I can even be forgiven on your side,\" Bishop tells the woman in the recording.\n\nThe woman also contacted Brigham Young University police in November to report her alleged assault. According to that police report, Bishop denied the rape allegations but told detectives that he'd gone with the woman to a small \"preparation room\" and while talking with her \"asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.\"\n\nBYU police relayed the facts of the case to the Utah County attorney's office. Deputy attorney David Sturgill replied that he could not pursue criminal charges against Bishop because the statute of limitations had expired four years after the alleged assault.\n\n\"I have no reason to doubt the victim's disclosure, and would have likely prosecuted Mr. Bishop, but for the expiration of the statute of limitations,\" Sturgill informed BYU police, according to the police report.\n\nBYU police closed their investigation into the assault on Dec. 23.\n\nThe woman told the LDS church-owned Deseret News that she first reported the assault to church officials around 1988. The church's official statement on Tuesday claimed officials became aware of the alleged assault in 2010, when the woman informed leaders of a Mormon congregation in Pleasant Grove, Utah, where she was living.\n\nThe LDS church claims the leaders \"listened carefully to the claims being made\" and then relayed them to the Pleasant Grove Police Department. The church claims it received no further communication from the police about the matter. Church leaders also contacted Bishop, who denied the allegations. Unable to verify the woman's claims, the church said it decided not to discipline Bishop at the time.\n\nAccording to The Salt Lake Tribune, the woman made a threat about killing Bishop in 2010. Pleasant Grove police interviewed the woman and decided not to make an arrest.\n\nIn January, the woman's lawyer forwarded the recorded conversation to the LDS church. The church claims both the woman and Bishop were then interviewed about the allegations. Both parties reaffirmed their positions and appeared to have \"dramatically\" different recollections of what happened in 1984.\n\nBishop's family claims that the woman who made the accusations is untrustworthy and has falsely accused other men of sexual assault. His son, Greg Bishop, said his father was confused during the woman's interview, since he was recovering from a heart surgery that took place two days earlier.\n\nThe son added that when his father admitted to having a \"sexual addiction,\" he was referring to a lifelong battle with \"controlling\" his \"sexual thoughts.\"\n\n\"Those people who know dad don't put much credence in these allegations,\" Greg Bishop told the AP.\n\nThe church cautioned in its statement that it does not have the \"investigative tools\" available to law enforcement agencies to conduct a thorough review of the matter, but pledged to keep Bishop accountable for any misconduct.\n\n\"The Church is continuing its investigation of this individual's claims and will act consistent with its long-standing policy of no tolerance for abuse.\"",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- John Bolton, who President Donald Trump said on Thursday will replace H.R. McMaster as his national security adviser on April 9, is a polarizing pick, even by Trump administration standards.\n\nBolton is a notoriously hawkish former United Nations ambassador whose views don't even align with the isolationist foreign policy platform on which Trump campaigned -- although it is difficult to tell what the president actually believes.\n\nBolton has had Trump's ear, both as an informal adviser and as a commentator on Fox News, for a while. As a presidential candidate, Trump called Bolton \"a tough cookie [who] knows what he's talking about\" (although the president apparently is not a fan of his mustache).\n\nHere is a brief history of the new national security adviser's career in foreign policy:\n\nBolton fiercely advocated for the Iraq War and promoted the false justification for it.\n\nWhile serving as a top State Department official under President George W. Bush, Bolton was a chief promulgator of the administration's justification for the Iraq War: that U.S. intelligence showed evidence of Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. Famously, this claim later turned out to be false.\n\nBut Bolton continued to insist that he was right in calling for war, even years later.\n\n\"I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam [Hussein] was correct,\" he told the Washington Examiner in 2015. \"I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces. The people who say, 'Oh, things would have been much better if you didn't overthrow Saddam,' miss the point that today's Middle East does not flow totally and unchangeably from the decision to overthrow Saddam alone.\"\n\n\"You can't assume if he had stayed in power, sweetness and light would prevail in the Middle East today,\" he added.\n\nHe has called for bombing Iran and North Korea.\n\nThis does not bode well for diplomatic efforts, such as Trump's apparent plan to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In fact, Bolton said on Fox News earlier this month that he predicts the meeting will fail -- which he suggested would likely lead to military action.\n\nBolton also intensely opposes the Iranian nuclear deal.\n\nHe damaged the United States' foreign policy reputation while serving as the ambassador to the U.N.\n\nBolton has a history of speaking about international organizations with derision. While at the U.N., Bolton criticized it as \"a twilight zone.\" His extreme views and brash manner alienated many U.S. allies.\n\nHe has aligned himself with anti-Muslim hate groups.\n\nBetween his work at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, commentating on Fox News, and writing op-ed columns for right-leaning publications, Bolton has promoted Islamophobic conspiracy theories and supported anti-Islam organizations that have appeared on the Southern Poverty Law Center's list of hate groups.\n\nHe joked that former President Barack Obama was a Muslim.\n\nWhile speaking at an event for one such hate group, Bolton joked about Obama being Muslim. Luckily for him, his new boss launched his political career by spearheading the birther movement.",

Bush administration. Tillerson was rumored to have expressed concerns over working with Bolton, whose tactics New York magazine once labeled \"very undiplomatic.\"\n\nMcMaster's tenure in the Trump administration was marked by conflict as he repeatedly found himself at odds with the president. After special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians in February, McMaster said there was \"incontrovertible\" evidence that Russia had moved to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump himself has long pushed back against allegations of Russian interference in the election, but recently attempted to blame former President Barack Obama for not doing enough to counter Russian meddling.",

The eight worst wildfire seasons on record have all occurred in the past 15 years, according to the National Wildlife Federation.\n\nThe provision creates a contingency account through 2027 that can only be tapped by officials once funds from the usual firefighting accounts have been drained, according to The Associated Press.\n\nSens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeff Merkley (D-Idaho), Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), along with Reps. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) and Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), played key roles in securing the funding in the spending bill, which is awaiting Senate approval.\n\n\"This long-overdue, bipartisan solution to the madness of 'fire borrowing' will at last treat these infernos like the natural disasters they are, with the benefit that millions of dollars will now be liberated each year for essential wildfire prevention,\" Wyden said in a statement Thursday.\n\nEnvironmental groups praised the additional wildfire disaster funding as a major step for conservation efforts.\n\n\"The comprehensive solution to the wildfire funding problem included in the bill is a tremendous victory,\" Lynn Scarlett, co-chief external affairs officer for the Nature Conservancy, said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"It would mean we will no longer have to pay to fight increasing wildfire disasters out of the very same budgets that could have instead gone toward making forests healthier and less prone to these extreme wildfires in the first place.\"",

                "title": "Opinion | Joe Biden's Recent Comments Show He Doesn't Understand Rape Culture",
                "body": "Former Vice President Joe Biden gave an impassioned speech on Tuesday, saying he would have \"beat the hell out\" of President Donald Trump in high school for bragging about groping women.\n\nBiden has long raised awareness about sexual violence, chairing the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. He has worked to break down our society's problematic ideas that normalize sexual assault, such as victim-blaming and slut-shaming.\n\nBiden's work is aimed at ending rape culture, but this latest response could actually make it worse.\n\nThe Me Too movement has revealed how rampant sexual assault, domestic violence and sexual harassment are across the world and in every industry. It's only natural for people to be angry about these injustices. But channeling that anger into violence against perpetrators, like Biden suggests, is based more in vengeance than feminism.\n\nWho truly benefits from these aggressive actions? In truth, no one.\n\nBy suggesting that a sexual assault perpetrator, or even someone making chauvinist comments, should be \"beaten up,\" Biden is attempting to send a strong message that sexism is wrong. But the message that actually gets across is that physical dominance determines who is morally right.\n\nThis reinforces the same toxic masculinity that Biden means to condemn, insinuating that the only way for men to express themselves is to exert dominance through physical force.\n\nAnd this was just one of the problematic statements in Biden's address.\n\n\"I've been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life,\" he said while speaking at a rally for It's On Us, the anti-sexual violence campaign he founded with former President Barack Obama. \"I'm a pretty damn good athlete. Any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest SOB in the room.\"\n\nWith this, Biden generalizes about the perpetrators of rape culture: He suggests that traditionally attractive men are less likely to commit violence against women. He should know better.\n\nVictim-blaming aside, Biden shows that he hasn't informed himself about how rape culture really affects college students.\n\nBiden also urged women to stand up for each other.\n\n\"It's on you women, as well, on campus,\" he said. \"All the studies show that 95 percent of young women who are abused -- the first person they tell is their roommate, their friend, someone on campus. You've got to inform yourself as to what facilities are available, what help is available, not just empathize, hug and say, 'I'm so sorry.' You have an obligation to be informed.\"\n\nVictim-blaming aside, Biden shows that he hasn't informed himself about how rape culture really affects college students. Most of Biden's work to combat campus sexual violence has framed the issue as one of men abusing women, ignoring violence in LGBTQ communities and male victims of sexual assault and abuse. Calling out men as perpetrators ignores many victims and reinforces the gender stereotypes that contribute to rape culture.\n\nBiden's statements reflect an antiquated notion of what sexual violence is and how to solve it. It is one that assumes there is a single type of perpetrator -- a straight male -- and that we can detect him based on his appearance. It is one that assumes the only way to teach people that sexist remarks are wrong is by physically exerting power over them.\n\nInstead of dismantling rape culture, Biden's speech tells men, once again, that physical supremacy determines who is best, who is correct and who is powerful. In that regard, he and the president seem to agree.\n\nCrazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nMarch 22, 2018",

                "body": "When will Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg agree to answer questions before Congress?\n\nIf it were up to Zuckerberg, the answer may be never.\n\nUnfortunately for him, it isn't entirely his decision: The House Energy and Commerce Committee just invited him to testify about a political research firm's secret use of at least 50 million Facebook users' personal information, and he may well be forced to accept it because optics compel him to do so.\n\nYet as Zuckerberg's language in recent interviews made clear, he'll need plenty of convincing.\n\nFaced with the dual crisis of a precipitous falloff in public trust and sinking stock prices, Facebook provided Zuckerberg for a series of interviews Wednesday. Among other things, he was asked repeatedly if he'd voluntarily testify in front of Congress.\n\nAnd his answer, repeatedly, was designed to sound like \"yes\" when he really seems to be saying \"no.\"\n\n\"If it is ever the case that I am the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that,\" Zuckerberg told Wired.\n\nThis isn't a \"yes.\" At best, it's a highly qualified \"maybe, but...\" -- the semantic equivalent of a massive loophole.\n\nZuckerberg's willingness to answer questions before Congress if he's \"the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify\" gives him cover to never testify. There will always be some employee Facebook can trot out and present as more informed on a particular topic and therefore better positioned to answer politicians' pointed questions.\n\nHe proceeded to tell Wired that if lawmakers actually care about substance (presumably over the spectacle of him personally being held accountable), he doesn't foresee a need for him to testify at all.\n\n\"So as long as it's a substantive testimony where what folks are trying to get is as much content as possible, I'm not sure when I'll be the right person,\" Zuckerberg said [emphasis added]. \"But I would be happy to if I were.\"\n\nThe founder of Facebook just said he isn't sure he'll ever be able to add anything of substance to a conversation about Facebook and its role in the world.\n\nThat's one hell of a statement to make for a CEO whose company influences the thoughts, feelings and actions of more than 2 billion people, and lately has demonstrated it's either incapable of -- or unwilling -- to do so responsibly.",

They accused it -- baselessly -- of engineering a campaign of mass voter fraud and thus rigging the 2008 election in favor of then-candidate Barack Obama. Republicans hated ACORN so much that they effectively killed it all the way back in 2009 by blocking federal funding to the organization, which helped poor people register to vote and advocated for social services like affordable housing. Many Democrats also voted in favor of the original ban.",

The former vice president, who launched It's On Us with President Barack Obama in 2014, has long advocated for women's rights, including drafting the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.\n\nHe has, however, been widely criticized for how he handled professor Anita Hill's accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas during the latter's 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Many people believe that Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, didn't do enough to ensure those allegations were given full consideration. More recently, Biden has taken on the good old \"Uncle Joe\" persona, during which time he has been caught on camera being creepy and borderline inappropriate toward women.",

They are also entering the human food chain through fish and water -- impacting both tap water and bottled water. While the health implications aren't fully understood, studies suggest that consuming microplastics could introduce toxic chemicals into the body.",
