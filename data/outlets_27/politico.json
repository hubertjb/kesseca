                "body": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will lead a delegation of Democrats to the Middle East beginning Saturday with stops in Israel and Jordan.\n\nTen House Democrats will accompany Pelosi on the trip, which will focus on \"global and regional security and cooperation issues,\" according to her office.\n\n\"Our delegation is pleased to be able to extend the congratulations of the American people to the people of Israel as we celebrate the 70th anniversary of Jewish state this spring,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe overseas visit comes as Congress kicks off a two-week Easter and Passover recess after passing a $1.3 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September. Overseas congressional trips, known as \"CODELs,\" are common when lawmakers have a lengthy break.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, will accompany Pelosi, as will Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), another member of the panel. Other members on the trip include Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Katherine Clark (D-Mass.).\n\nFreshmen Reps. Donald McEachin (D-Va.), Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) will also take part. No Republicans are joining.\n\nTensions between the U.S. and Jordan have been inflamed in recent months after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and announced plans to relocate the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv.\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II called the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital \"a complication\" to the Middle East peace process in an interview on CNN in early February. But the U.S. and Jordan signed an agreement later in February boosting annual U.S. aid to the country.\n\n\"In Jordan, our delegation travels at a vital time in the U.S. relationship with this key ally,\" Pelosi said. \"Members are particularly interested in reviewing the Syrian refugee and humanitarian challenges as well as addressing other critical challenges facing the region.\"",

                "title": "Inspired by Stoneman Douglas students, marchers rally across Fla. to demand tougher gun laws",
                "body": "FORT LAUDERDALE -- Tens of thousands of people hit the streets Saturday afternoon across Florida, joining hundreds of thousands of others in Washington and cities around the country, in calling for tougher gun laws in a nationwide rally and march inspired by Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students who have sought to turn a terrible tragedy into a massive movement.\n\nStoneman Douglas senior Emma González, who along with several classmates have become the face of the fight to end gun violence, was in Washington for Saturday's \"March for Our Lives\" rally, which was expected to draw 500,000 people. She was joined by some 250 people, mostly fellow students from Stoneman Douglas, who embarked on buses Friday for the sojourn to the nation's capital.\n\n\"In just a few weeks' time, we, the youth of the United States, have built a new movement to denounce gun violence and call for safety in all of our communities. And this is only the beginning,\" she wrote.\n\nIn Florida, more than 50 marches dotted the state, from Pensacola and Fort Walton Beach in the Panhandle to Jacksonville and St. Augustine in north Florida. And from Tampa and Orlando in central Florida to Miami and Key West in South Florida. Tens of thousands marched and rallied against gun violence and demanded stricter gun control laws.\n\nThe march planned near Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., was held at a nearby park with speeches preceding the march. As many as 20,000 were to march from the park to the high school, where 17 people, including 14 students, were gunned down on Valentine's Day by a lone gunman carrying an AR-15 weapon.\n\nIn Parkland, Sari Kauffman, a sophomore at Stoneman Douglas, urged the crowd to go beyond marches and protests -- and vote in the mid-term elections and every election.\n\n\"We can continue to say whatever we want and trash all these politicians,\" she said. \"However, this does not do anything and all the politicians know this. They don't feel threatened or scared because they think we are all talk and no action.\"\n\nKauffman then encouraged the thousands crammed into the park to visit voter registration booths set up at the rally to register or pr-register to vote. And she raised her cellphone in the air in telling everyone to join her and other Stoneman Douglas students in letting their voices be heard by texting the word \"march\" to 50409.\n\nElsewhere, Democratic gubernatorial candidates were all over the state with marchers.\n\n\"Together we'll make sure the movement doesn't stop once the marches end,\" he tweeted Saturday morning,\" Andrew Gillum tweeted from Tallahassee, where he is the city's mayor.\n\nFormer Miami Beach Philip Levine, who has been running television ads promoting his campaign, spoke at a rally at Miami Beach High School.\n\n\"Today we're marching for the 17 in Parkland. We're marching for the 49 at Pulse. We're marching for our lives and our children's lives, and in honor of every life lost to senseless gun violence. It's time we turn our #OutrageToAction! #MarchForOurLive,\" tweeted the former Miami Beach mayor.\n\nIn Orlando, where 49 people were slaughtered at the Pulse nightclub on June 12, 2016, thousands marched in the city's downtown area.\n\nOrganizers honored the 17 Stoneman Douglas victims and the 49 Pulse nightclub victims, along with all victims of gun violence, said Trevor Wild, an organizer with \"Never Again UCF,\" a group representing University of Central Florida students led by alumni of Stoneman Douglas.\n\nThe group is pushing for \"common sense gun control reforms at a state and national level.\" Wild is an alumni of Stoneman Douglas.\n\nAmong the speakers in Orlando: Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) and Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.). Others included Democratic gubernatorial candidates Gwen Graham and Chris King.\n\nKing has called for a ban on all assault weapons \"once and for all,\" while Graham has outlined a gun safety plan that includes banning assault weapons and putting place universal background checks.\n\nAnna Eskamani, a well-known community activist in Orlando, said she was encouraged to see the \"energy\" from young people wanting to see a change in gun laws, noting it's far different from the aftermath of the Pulse shooting.\n\n\"Despite sit-ins and protests, nothing happened after the Pulse massacre but this time -- it's different,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"I have been organizing in our community and holding politicians accountable for the last ten year of my life,\" she added. \"Never have I ever seen this type of energy and resistance grow from our young people.\"\n\nMurphy, a freshman lawmaker facing a tough re-election battle in a swing congressional district, applauded the movement led by the Stoneman Douglas students.\n\n\"Young people have long been at the forefront of the movement to stop this needless loss of life, and the recent activism after the tragedy in Parkland represents a historic new chapter in that fight,\" she said. \"I'm humbled and grateful to be lending my voice to the March for Our Lives here in Orlando, where we still ache for the loss of 49 beautiful souls at Pulse Nightclub.\"\n\nActivists in West Palm Beach wanted to send a message to President Donald Trump, who left Washington on Friday to spend the weekend at his Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach County. The president plans to spend the weekend with First Lady Melania Trump and their son, Baron, at what's been called the \"Winter White House.\"\n\nFlorida Democrats pounced on the president's visit to South Florida, saying Trump was escaping Washington to avoid marchers at the national rally.\n\n\"It's no surprise that Donald Trump is choosing to flee Washington rather than face the hundreds of thousands of students who are preparing to March on Washington to protest his inaction on gun violence,\" Terrie Rizzo, the Florida Democratic Party's chairwoman, said in a statement..\n\n\"You can run from the students in Washington, Donald Trump, but you can't hide from us in Florida,\" she said.\n\nAlthough the mass shootings, like the one Stoneman Douglas, are rare, The Washington Post reported Friday that more than 187,000 students attending at least 193 primary or secondary schools have experienced a shooting on campus during school hours since the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999, according to a year-long analysis by the newspaper.\n\nOverall, more 7,000 U.S. children and adolescents suffer firearm-related injuries each year and gun-related violence is the third leading cause of death among children and adolescents. The deaths of as many as 1,200 youth are linked to gun violence, according to academic researchers.\n\nWhether Saturday's march will sway public opinion on the contentious subject of gun control remains to be seen.\n\nA majority of U.S. residents, about 52 percent, think the marches will make no difference in ending gun violence, while about one-third, or 36 percent, say the march will help in the national effort, according to the latest Marist University poll published Friday.\n\nBut a majority of those surveyed, about 54 percent, said it's \"more important to control gun violence in the nation than to protect gun rights.\" That includes about 34 percent of gun owners. Those figures mirror results of a similar Marist poll released in December.\n\nRep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), who hosted a town hall on gun policies at Valencia College on Friday night, blasted her congressional colleagues for inaction on gun violence.\n\n\"It has been more than one month since the Parkland shooting, and Congress has done nothing,\" she said in a statement. \"Members of Congress lack the courage to act, and think more about their next election than the right of our children to go to school in safety.\"\n\n\"Americans across the political spectrum want the same thing: fewer senseless deaths and injuries from guns,\" she said. \"We may disagree on how to get there, but everyone agrees that something needs to be done.\"",

It does far less for Trump's stated priorities ...

Trump wanted to slash the Energy Department's renewables budget 65 percent; instead, Congress boosted it 14 percent.

                "title": "Huge crowd converges on D.C. for gun control rally",
                "body": "Police presence was heavy early Saturday ahead of a demonstration expected to draw hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people from across the country are descending on Washington Saturday to demand action from Congress on gun control in a mass demonstration that could rival the annual women's marches sparked by President Donald Trump's election.\n\nSpurred by the school shooting in Parkland, Florida last month, the \"March for Our Lives\" has the backing of well-funded gun control groups like Everytown for Gun Safety. They are organizing youth voter registration drives and running crash courses on activism and public policy.\n\nMore than 800 \"sibling\" marches are planned across the globe on Saturday.\n\nSaturday's demonstration is the culmination of years of inaction by lawmakers as mass shootings have continued unabated in America. Left-leaning activists, feeling stymied by the National Rifle Association's lobbying, are wielding one of the few tools they have left: taking to the streets to demand change.\n\nMore than two hours before the start of the noon march, the crowd began chanting, \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\n\n\"The conversation died down after Sandy Hook, the conversation died down after Aurora,\" Justin Frybergh, 19, a 2016 alumnus of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, said this week. \"For young people, the conversation is not going to die down now.\"\n\n\"And,\" he added, \"they're going to be voting in the next election cycle.\"\n\nPeople began streaming toward Pennsylvania Avenue early. Police were everywhere, stationed at Metro stations and every few feet along the route. Signs were posted along the route notifying marchers that firearms aren't allowed in the area, even with a license to carry.\n\nAt 9 a.m., the area in front of the stage, erected near the base of the U.S. Capitol, had already filled up. A number of signs knocked the Trump administration's support for training and arming school personnel.\n\n\"This future teacher will never carry a gun,\" one sign read. \"My job is to teach, not return fire,\" another said.\n\nThe demonstration comes days after a shooting at Great Mills High School in southern Maryland, which killed two students, one of whom was taken off life support on Thursday.\n\n\"What better place to demand that Congress take action than their home?\" said Anna Sophie Tinneny, a 17-year old senior at Pennridge High School, 30 miles north of Philadelphia.\n\nTinneny said this week that she and a dozen or more of her peers planned to leave for Washington before dawn on Saturday. Tinneny recently made headlines when she and her classmates received detention for participating in a nationwide school walkout calling for gun control. They protested during detention, sitting in a circle on the floor and wearing the names of the Parkland victims on their shirts.\n\n\"The Parkland kids aren't going away,\" she said. \"They're inspiring so many kids in Generation Z,\" the demographic cohort after Millennials.\n\nSeventeen speakers -- to honor the number of people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas -- are expected to speak. Several celebrities, like Jennifer Hudson, Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato, are expected to perform.\n\nThe route for the march stretches down Pennsylvania Avenue, past the Trump International Hotel and stopping short of the White House. The march will be followed by mass school walkouts across the country on April 20.\n\nPreparation was in full swing on Thursday and Friday, with D.C. officials erecting barricades, portable toilets and temporary cell phone towers. Temporary cement barriers stood in front of the Trump International Hotel on Friday, in addition to two layers of metal barricades. Inside, bartenders nervously chit-chatted with guests about the impending crush of protesters.\n\nOn Saturday, military trucks blocked off downtown streets nearly the Trump hotel as demonstrators flooded onto Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThe city's public transportation system was bracing for long lines and crowds. Restaurants offered discounted meals to marchers and the ride-sharing app Lyft offered free rides to the march. Local families have been offering up their homes to students with nowhere to stay.\n\nThe marches in Washington and across the country will be accompanied by what's expected to be an extensive youth voter registration push. Organizers have been pushing state-specific voter registration toolkits, and the Parkland students have talked up the importance of voting in media appearances. The Parkland students and teenagers nationwide, many of whom just turned 18 or are about to turn 18, have vowed to remove from office state and federal lawmakers who refuse to act on gun control.\n\n\"Get out and vote!\" urged David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland shooting, on Thursday. He and several other students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School participated in a rally at Thurgood Marshall Academy, a public charter school in D.C.'s Anacostia neighborhood.\n\nHogg and his classmates, who've rocketed into the spotlight with their demand for gun control, just wrapped up a media blitz to promote the march. They visited with D.C. students and held press conferences on Capitol Hill, joined by Democrats like Sens. Dianne Feinstein, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal.\n\n\"If we don't make our voices heard, then they won't take action!\" Hogg said, eliciting cheers and applause from Thurgood Marshall students, most of whom raised their hands when asked if they had been affected by gun violence. The school has lost two students to gun violence in less than a year -- Paris Brown, 19, and Zaire Kelly, 16.\n\nOrganizers of the marches are also pushing a petition that calls on Congress to ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and background checks for the purchases of all guns -- a nearly impossible political ask.\n\nCongress has only mustered support for modest measures since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Mass shootings that killed 26 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 and 58 in Las Vegas last year yielded nothing.\n\nA $1.3 trillion government spending bill signed by Trump on Friday includes measures to improve records and information-sharing in the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System and federal grants to improve school safety. The White House has also launched a new commission, led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to consider school safety measures.\n\nTrump also tweeted Saturday morning about his administration's move to ban bump stocks, the devices that are used to turn semi-automatic weapons into machines guns.\n\nThe National Rifle Association did not respond to a request for comment. But the gun advocacy organization's media arm, \"NRATV,\" went after Hogg in a tweet on Friday.\n\n\"Will the [mainstream media] ask @davidhogg111 about his #NRA-target, profanity-laden tirade? No.\"\n\nAn NRATV video plays a clip of Hogg saying, \"What sick f---ers are out there that want to continue to sell more guns, murder more children and honestly just get reelected? What type of person are you when you want to see more f---ing money than children's lives? What type of sh---y person does that?\"\n\nJennifer Bouchard arrived in D.C. early Saturday morning after traveling overnight from Boston.\n\nWhen it comes to arming school personnel, she said, \"It's crazy that our teachers would need to take that on. And it teaches our kids that guns are necessary.\"\n\nBouchard, who said she would like to see a ban on assault weapons, said this moment feels ripe for change because \"the kids are taking control.\"",

                "title": "Week 44: Does Trump Want to Talk to Mueller or Fire Him?",
                "body": "The Russia scandal erupted on multiple fronts this week, but the bombshell question persists.\n\nSpreading like the blast from a high-yield nuclear device, the Trump Tower scandal has fireballed its way into every outpost of power and influence in American civilization. It has set the intelligence community against the president and prompted aggrieved members of Congress to call for a reheating of the Cold War. A special counsel and two congressional committees have quizzed hundreds of witnesses and collected millions of pages of supporting documents in a stab at unmasking Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe blast's shock waves have decapitated the FBI, knocking out its director and its deputy director. The president's men, his relatives and allies have been exposed as Russian dupes at best or agents of influence at worst. Some have tendered guilty pleas for lying. Another has confessed to money-laundering connected to his Eastern European influence peddling. Foreign policy initiatives -- official and otherwise -- designed to roll back the Russian sanctions have been examined. The president's company finances, subpoenaed and dusted for Russian fingerprints, are probably resting in the special counsel's vault, awaiting his audit. Our media can't get enough of the story, nor can its consumers. The press has discovered a criminal underground populated by Russian thugs and demi-oligarchs. A book about the scandal, Russian Roulette, hit the stands as the No. 1 New York Times bestseller, with many similar volumes sure to follow. Facebook and other social media outposts have gotten sucked into the scandal's stream for running the Russia-sponsored ads and content. Meanwhile, the data research outfit Cambridge Analytica, co-founded by Trump campaign executive Steve Bannon, which gorged itself on Facebook data, is being grilled about its connections with the Russian oil company Lukoil. (More Cambridge Analytica trouble ahead: A company executive boasts that it ran major parts of the Trump campaign, which might violate campaign-finance law and incoming national security adviser John Bolton ran a Super PAC that used compromised Facebook data.)\n\nThe scandal's radioactive dust refuses to settle as old stories find new life. This week, the Daily Beast laid the smoldering mess directly at the front door of the Russian military intelligence directorate (GRU). The Beast story claims proof that Guccifer 2.0, the chatty hacker who took credit for delivering emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks, was not a Romanian hacktivist as some alleged but actually a GRU officer working from the agency's headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. The FBI agents who IDed the officer now work for the special counsel, says the Beast. The Daily Beast's findings have snared former Trump campaign executive Roger Stone by the ankle and lifted him to the sky for our inspection, primarily because of his boasts of having made contact with the hacker via Twitter DMs.\n\nDid Stone, who has always styled himself as the deftest of Washington operatives, stumble into a Guccifer Gulch? \"Then and since, Stone has consistently denied that Guccifer was connected to the Kremlin,\" the Daily Beast's Spencer Ackerman and Kevin Poulsen report. If Mueller has the goods on the GRU, Stone's extended explanation of his position that he never interacted with a Russian agent or intermediary will make good listening. Stone and WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange spoke on the phone in early 2016, according the Washington Post. Assange has consistently claimed that neither Russians nor their associates gave him the DNC emails. \"Our source is not a state party. So the answer -- for our interactions -- is no,\" Assange said in 2017. Assange's extended explanation of how Guccifer 2.0's trove ended on his servers would seem to command a close listen, too.\n\nThe question of whether the president will sack the special counsel or not has been an evergreen story ever since Mueller's appointment. But this week, the evergreen blossomed alongside the Tidal Basin cherry trees as the president gave a series of mixed signals. \"The White House says Trump isn't thinking about firing Mueller but when the president tweets about 'conflict of interest' he is citing a cause that can be used to fire Mueller,\" New York Times reporter Peter Baker tweeted early in the week. The likelihood of Mueller's sacking rose when his attorney John Dowd told CNN the special counsel's investigation should end. Then, Dowd resigned, reportedly over Trump's insistence that he wanted to sit for an interview with Mueller, indicating that the special counsel's position was secure. Some even speculated this increased Trump's odds of speaking directly with Mueller's team. \"I would like to,\" Trump said Thursday. Trump reignited the original speculation of a Mueller takedown by embracing former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova as a potential addition to his personal legal team, perhaps as his public champion. DiGenova has been advancing a theory that Trump was framed by FBI agents who hoped to prevent him from becoming president, which is enough to make cautious gamblers bet that firing Mueller is about as likely as Duke making the Final Four. We anticipate with relish diGenova's future cable show appearance, where he will surely provide extended explanations of his FBI theories.\n\nTrudging through the scandal's random ash and debris, we keep our senses alert for the descent of the next bomb, sure to kick up more of the same. That instrument, which will have Mueller's signature on it, will add 10-fold, maybe 100-fold to the rubble. Will Mueller be obliterated before he can vanquish Trump? Or can we anticipate mutually assured destruction?",

                "title": "The Lessons of a School Shooting-in 1853",
                "body": "How a now-forgotten classroom murder inflamed the national gun argument.\n\nThis weekend, thousands of people are expected to gather in cities and towns across America for the \"March for Our Lives,\" a national response to the horrifying school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Will it change policy? Skeptics doubt it, having watched time and again how previous shootings vanish from the headlines with no change to our national debate over guns. But there's actually precedent, deep in American history, for school shootings to shift the gun debate.\n\nThough little remembered now, the first high-profile school shooting in the U.S. was more than 150 years ago, in Louisville, Kentucky. The 1853 murder of William Butler by Matthews F. Ward was a news sensation, prompting national outrage over the slave South's libertarian gun rights vision and its deadly consequences. At a time when there wasn't yet a national media, this case prompted a legal conversation that might be worth resurrecting today.\n\nThe deadly encounter between the two men was triggered by a trivial matter: eating a bunch of chestnuts during class. William Butler was a 28-year-old teacher, a Yankee immigrant to Kentucky who had helped found the Louisville School, an institution that attracted students from some of the best families in town. One of those was William Ward, the son of a prominent cotton merchant. Butler, a stern teacher, confronted the young Ward about eating in the classroom. Ward denied it. His teacher called him a liar and administered a whipping. This was a severe form of punishment, but not unusual in the mid-19th century, an age when corporal punishment in schools was the norm in many places.\n\nThe punishment did not go over well in the Ward household. The next day the boy's older brother, Matthews Ward, purchased two small pistols and returned to the school with William and another brother, Bob. Butler had no inkling that his actions had incensed the elder Ward brother, and he greeted all three brothers cordially. Matthews confronted the teacher, calling him a \"damned scoundrel\" and a \"coward.\" Matthews and William Butler scuffled, and in the course of the altercation, Ward pulled out his pistol and shot his opponent. The Ward boys fled the building; students rushed to Butler's aid, carrying him to his house, where a doctor attended him. But to no avail. Butler died within days of the incident.\n\nWard was arrested and charged with murder. The trial was a news sensation, garnering headlines in papers across the nation. As today, the public was horrified at the thought of deadly violence in a school, a protected place of learning, and the very embodiment of civilization and order. And the idea of a student killing his brother's teacher was almost an unthinkable violation of the social order.\n\nBut there was something else, too. The shooting took place at a time in American history when the nation was growing increasingly frustrated with gun violence, and in which opposition was growing to an aggressive new conception of the right to bear arms was generating opposition. The case became a kind of lightning rod for the ways that views on gun were splitting the country.\n\nAt the time of the Second Amendment's ratification, gun ownership rates in America were high, but the guns in greatest demand at this time weren't handguns or military weapons: Most Americans wanted to own lighter hunting muskets or fowling pieces, guns better suited to shooting birds and dealing with critters attacking crops. Many Americans considered owning a military-quality musket a burden -- so much so that states and the federal government were forced to require white men to purchase military-quality muskets at their own expense for public defense. Importantly, also, guns at that time were not the preferred method for homicide: Edged weapons and blunt instruments were more readily at hand and far more effective at close range.\n\nBut by the time of the Ward trial, things had changed. The tightly knit communities that nurtured the Minuteman ideal of the American Revolution had given way to a more urban society, and one that was far more democratic, individualistic, materialistic, and violent. The practice of carrying easily concealed weapons, such as the pair of pocket pistols that Ward had procured for himself when he confronted William Butler, had become common in many regions of the nation, especially the South. To facilitate this increasingly common practice, the burgeoning market revolution made a wide assortment of easily concealable weapons available, including a variety of handguns and a host of fearsome edged weapons. This was the era of the Colt Revolver and the Bowie Knife.\n\nDuring the colonial era, Americans lived under a gun regulation regime inherited from English common law. That tradition held that individuals were obligated to retreat from armed conflicts, not stand your ground. English common law also prohibited traveling armed in populated areas, unless one were assisting in the preservation of the peace. After the American Revolution, however, this common English legal legacy fractured, producing radically different legal regimes for regulating firearms in the slave-owning South and elsewhere. Outside of the South, many states emulated Massachusetts's broad prohibition on public carry. But in the South, things were different. Kentucky judges, in particular, had adopted a more libertarian reading of the Constitution that rejected most forms of regulation as a violation of the right to bear arms.\n\nUnder Kentucky law, the defense's strategy was simple and straightforward. At the time of his trial Ward's right to travel armed was considered by Kentucky judges to be constitutionally protected. The fact that Ward had actively gone to confront his brother's teacher was irrelevant. The only legally pertinent fact was that at the moment that he drew his pistol, Ward had a reasonable fear that his life was in danger which justified his use of deadly force. The jury acquitted Matthews Ward.\n\nNews of his exoneration prompted protests and denunciations across the United States. Condemnation of the verdict was especially severe outside of the South. Abolitionists in particular were outraged by the trial's outcome, and used it to underscore their belief that the inherently violent nature of the slaveholding South meant that its laws were dominated by \"the pistol and the lash.\" As one newspaper wrote, \"An Act that would have hung him in Massachusetts, is justified in Kentucky.\"\n\nOne of the most interesting features of the response to the Ward verdict -- and one worth remembering for gun-control advocates today -- was the way critics attacked Kentucky's broad interpretation of the right to bear arms in self-defense. Legal critics of the trial argued that Kentucky law had veered too far from mainstream American constitutional thought, which had always balanced the right of self-defense against other rights, such as the right to enjoy peace. According to this way of thinking, Ward's actions were not a vindication of American ideas of liberty, but a distortion of them, encouraging anarchy rather than true liberty.\n\nAlthough advocates for the modern gun rights movement claim to be champions of the Founders' vision of the Constitution, they have actually taken their cues from this later, libertarian vision of gun rights -- one that was developed by slave-owning judges in antebellum America. In fact, the majority opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller -- the 2008 case that struck down the District of Columbia's gun-control law and established an individual right to bear arms unconnected to the militia for the first time under federal law -- approvingly cited these Southern precedents as the foundation for his reading of the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Ward shooting, and the popular outcry it generated, reminds us that there's another possible way to view the hierarchy of American rights -- one in which the right not to get shot is on par with, and may even outweigh, the right to freely carry a gun and use it. The notion that the Second Amendment overrides these rights and prohibits sensible gun laws has never been the dominant position in American law. Most Americans in the 18th century and many in the 19th recognized this basic fact as fundamental to our Constitutional tradition. It is surely time to restore those other esteemed American rights to their rightful place in our contemporary constitutional debates over the role of guns in America.",

                "body": "National organizations say they have seen their membership and mailing lists skyrocket by double-digit percentages since the shooting.\n\nA small group of teenagers from Parkland, Florida, with no organizing experience or money has single-handedly energized the national movement for gun control after the Valentine's Day mass shooting at their high school. Now long-established anti-gun groups with funds and influence are planning to harness that momentum in the months leading up to the midterm elections.\n\nNational organizations such as Everytown for Gun Safety, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence say they have seen their membership and mailing lists skyrocket by double-digit percentages since the shooting.\n\nSaturday, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to demonstrate in Washington and around the country in support of their cause, the groups are planning to seize the moment by registering participants to vote and encouraging them to elect like-minded lawmakers in November.\n\n\"This is about developing a grass-roots army and once these people train their sights on you, you're in trouble,\" said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\n\nSo far this year, the number of people who've participated in protests against gun violence is already double what it was for all of last year, according to data from protest tracker Count Love. The student-led National School Walkout on March 14, for example, drew at least 19,000 participants.\n\nThat's spilling over into support for established groups, which have documented soaring support for their cause.\n\nEverytown, a nonprofit backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that is co-sponsoring the march, has seen a nearly 30 percent increase in its mailing list in just the past month, even though the organization has been building that list for more than a decade, according to Shannon Watts, the founder of affiliated group Moms Demand Action.\n\n\"We've had nearly 200,000 new volunteers join us since Parkland,\" Watts said. \"We have had over 1.5 million new members join our mailing list, bringing the total to 4.5 million.\"\n\nThe Brady Campaign, whose goal is to reduce \"gun deaths in half by 2025,\" also saw membership growth, according to co-president Avery Gardiner. She said the group had to add \"21 chapters,\" bringing it to 94 nationwide, a roughly 29 percent increase.\n\nThe organization threw a sign-making party and other events in support of Saturday's March for Our Lives, and will be on hand to greet marchers, she said.\n\n\"We have a permit for gathering a spot near the march where we'll be meeting supporters from D.C. and busloads from outside D.C. -- we'll be providing them with signs and getting them psyched up for the events that are happening,\" she said.\n\nEverytown -- which spends tens of millions each year pushing for limits on guns -- offered a $2.5 million grant program earlier this month to fund the nearly 700 marches happening simultaneously Saturday outside Washington, as well as logistics for permits and volunteers to help the March for Our Lives organizers.\n\nHorwitz, of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said the Parkland students have forced gun violence prevention into the political realm in a new way.\n\n\"Let's just put it this way: There's not a minute that went by in my office over the last month where someone hasn't been calling to get some information about the issue or how to volunteer or how to go to the march,\" Horwitz said. \"So the voices of the Parkland students supercharges that movement, and it brings gun violence prevention to the front of every political discussion in America right now.\"\n\nHis organization and groups such as the Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence are looking to train young activists on gun control policies, as well as encouraging them to vote, so they can put more pressure on politicians to promote and stand by gun law reform.\n\nThe Florida group, in fact, is offering free memberships to students and registering the young protesters. \"There's almost 1.8 million in Florida between ages 18 to 24, and the majority of them aren't registered to vote,\" co-chairwoman Patti Brigham said. \"We're working hard on getting an amendment on the ballot this year, and we want the power of these young people's voices at the ballot box.\"\n\nThe organizations aren't expecting an immediate change in current lawmakers' attitudes on guns. Instead, they're focusing on changing the makeup of Congress.\n\n\"As far as the makeup of Congress, yeah, you've seen some Republicans jump in front of some bills and say, 'We really need to do something,' but I don't think that's enough to sort of change the entire institution,\" Horwitz said. \"I think you need new members to change that institution, and I think that's what people are focused on. People are sick of waiting, and they're sick of empty gestures of thoughts and prayers without action.\"",

                "title": "How Stormy Daniels' Lawyer Is Outfoxing Trump",
                "body": "LOS ANGELES -- On the day this week that he released a photograph of Stormy Daniels, his porn-star client, taking a polygraph, Michael Avenatti was pressed on CNN to explain the significance of a test that typically is inadmissible in court. \"Does it help your legal case, actually?\" Anderson Cooper asked.\n\nAvenatti, a racecar-driving lawyer from California, met the question with a shrug. While it was unclear to Cooper, the audience in Stormy Daniels v. Donald J. Trump is sometimes not a judge or jury, but viewers at home.\n\n\"Well, I don't know that it helps our legal case,\" Avenatti said, appearing on a split screen beside the grainy, years-old image of Daniels. \"But we want the public to have as many facts as possible at their disposal.\"\n\nEver since Daniels sued President Donald Trump this month -- claiming she had an intimate affair with him in 2006 and 2007 and that a nondisclosure agreement created before the 2016 election is invalid -- Avenatti has tormented the administration with a steady drip of half-revelations about Daniels' relationship with the president, usually with an appeal to tune in for his client's 60 Minutes interview on Sunday to hear more. Late Thursday night, he tweeted an image of a DVD and hinted that it contained information damaging to the president. He wrote, \"If 'a picture is worth a thousand words,' how many words is this worth?????\" The first hashtag: #60minutes.\n\nElaborating on CNN the next day, Avenatti called the tweet a \"warning shot,\" telling Wolf Blitzer the disc contained \"evidence substantiating the relationship.\" He added, \"If people think I'm bluffing, they should ask the opponents in countless cases I've had over the last 15 years if I'm generally a guy that bluffs.\"\n\nAvenatti is as much as Daniels' pitchman as her lawyer. And in the public relations war that he is waging, he has, in many ways, already won. In less than three weeks, Avenatti has transformed Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, from a tabloid curiosity into a sympathetic figure and cause célèbre. Her interview on 60 Minutes is so highly anticipated that a movie theater in Oakland proposed charging admission to a screening.\n\n\"He's played a pretty good hand in terms of cat-and-mouse,\" says John Burris, the civil rights attorney. \"He's put his client in a high-visibility position, and himself as well.\"\n\nAvenatti says Daniels came to him for representation, though he won't say how. And he won't say how he is being paid. In a telephone call, he rejected mundane questions about his personal life before volunteering, spontaneously, that he's single.\n\n\"It seems to be a common question I'm getting these days,\" he said. \"It's been very flattering.\"\n\nLawyers who have opposed Avenatti describe him as a talented litigator who is aggressive, prickly and confrontational. In 2014, he reached an $80.5 million settlement with a Los Angeles cemetery over claims the company dumped human remains, including those of a baby, to make room for new burials. Last year, he capitalized on the Ebola scare to win a $454 million jury verdict against Kimberly-Clark Corp. -- maker of Huggies diapers and Scott toilet paper -- after raising questions about the safety of the company's surgical gowns. It was the largest verdict in California last year.\n\nThose cases were turned into 60 Minutes features, too. But it took Daniels to catapult him into stardom. On the day in March when he filed her lawsuit, Avenatti had about 500 Twitter followers, he says. Now he's pushing 100,000. Earlier this week, Sports Illustrated took a special interest in his racing career. Avenatti has competed at Le Mans, a 24-hour endurance event in France where his teammates included Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud.\n\nBut he's a better lawyer than driver. \"The last person you want to pick a fight with in court is an adrenaline junkie,\" says George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who knew Avenatti as a student and keeps in touch. \"He does his best work under pressure. That's always a dangerous type of opponent to have.\"\n\nNow 47, Avenatti attended high school in St. Louis and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, the first person in his family to earn a college degree. During college and at George Washington Law School, where he graduated at the top of his class in 2003, Avenatti worked at an opposition research group run by Rahm Emanuel, who would later become President Barack Obama's chief of staff and is now mayor of Chicago. In recent days, Republicans have seized on the affiliation to suggest a political motive.\n\n\"We ended up doing work not just for Democrats but also for Republicans\" at the firm, Avenatti says, adding that the last time he saw Emanuel was January 3, 2007. He says he's sure of the date because he checked his passport. They ran into each other at a Buenos Aires airport.\n\nAvenatti said he is registered to vote as an independent. He last donated to a political candidate in 2007, when he gave $1,000 to former Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat.\n\n\"I'm not a Trump hater,\" Avenatti says. \"Some of the things he's done, such as rolling back some regulations, have been helpful to the economy and job creation. I agree with some of his tax policies.\"\n\nOn the Daniels case, Avenatti has proved unrelenting. He accused Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, of \"thuggish behavior\" on CNN this week, then pulled out an enormous picture of Cohen and appeared to challenge him to a Crossfire-style TV debate. \"Where is this guy?\" Avenatti said.\n\nDavid Schwartz, a friend and representative of Cohen, scolded Avenatti, saying, \"You're gonna go down in flames.\" Avenatti wagged his finger at Schwartz and asked, about Daniels, \"Why not just let her talk? ... Why is it so important to your friend and the president of the United States to keep this woman under wraps, to keep her under the thumb, to shut her up?\"\n\nBaiting the Trump administration to engage publicly in the controversy, Avenatti said on MSNBC this week, \"To the extent that Mr. Cohen or the president have a counter-narrative or a different version of the facts, they should go on a show, have a press conference, they could have a White House briefing, they could do any number of things, and explain their version of events.\"\n\n\"This is all about Mr. Avenatti. It's not about his client. It's about him and getting himself out there,\" Schwartz says. \"His court is not the court of law. It's the court of public opinion. This is all about trying to use this against the president.\"\n\nUntil last week, Avenatti's main opposition in the Daniels case was Cohen, the president's personal fix-it man who might have made Avenatti's job easier by talking about the $130,000 payment he has said he made to Daniels from his personal funds as part of the nondisclosure agreement. But on March 16, Trump brought in a more formidable lawyer, Charles Harder, whose clients include Melania Trump and Hulk Hogan. Harder won a $140 million judgment that forced Gawker Media into bankruptcy for publishing a story that included a clip from a sex tape starring the professional wrestler.\n\n\"A face-off between Avenatti and Harder may be an example of the unstoppable force meeting the immovable object,\" Turley says. \"These are two very good attorneys who are known to be very aggressive.\"\n\nHarder and Cohen did not respond to requests for comment. Avenatti appeared unflappable.\n\n\"It is very rare that I draw an opponent who is not at the very top of the legal profession,\" he said. \"I would prefer to litigate against high-quality lawyers as opposed to low-quality lawyers.\"\n\nAsked if Cohen is a low-quality lawyer, the line fell silent. Ten seconds ticked by. Fifteen.",

                "body": "'I wasn't male or female. I wasn't anything. I was just a SEAL,' said Kristin Beck, who is transgender.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump took to Twitter last week to announce a militarywide ban on transgender personnel, one former Navy SEAL lobbed a warning at the White House.\n\n\"You just smacked the hornet's nest with a baseball bat, and there's going to be a lot of people who are going to start to come out of the woodwork,\" Kristin Beck, a transgender war veteran and Purple Heart recipient, said in the latest episode of \"Women Rule.\"\n\nBeck, whose past deployments included tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, expressed deeper disappointment in Trump, saying that his ban showed \"hate\" and \"bigotry\" toward those serving in the armed forces.\n\n\"They're a soldier, they're serving their country. Treat them with dignity and respect just like you would want to be treated yourself,\" she said. \"It's not very difficult.\"\n\nDespite Trump's tweets, the Defense Department has yet to act on the ban. And just last week, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, told top military officers that there would be \"no modifications\" to the military's transgender policy.\n\nStill, Beck sees it as a potential flashpoint in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\"If this goes through and these people -- all of my friends, brothers and sisters -- if they end up getting kicked out or it turns into something of the worst-case scenarios, it's going to be a fight,\" she said.\n\nIn the wide-ranging \"Women Rule\" interview, Beck also relayed stories of her more than 20 years as a Navy SEAL -- and how she hid her transgender identity until after her retirement from combat.\n\n\"I wasn't male or female. I wasn't anything,\" the veteran told POLITICO's Luiza Savage about her time in the armed forces. \"I was just a SEAL.\"\n\nRead below for highlights of the podcast:\n\n3:40 Beck tells the story of how she found out about Trump's tweet banning transgender individuals from serving in the armed forces.\n\n\"This was just out of the blue,\" Beck tells \"Women Rule.\" \"I was just so disappointed in the leadership -- at any leader that would just come out like that and just slam and close that door to so many people.\"\n\n7:24 The war veteran discusses the transgender community's response to the ban and what it could mean for the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\"If we can achieve this one goal for open service for the military, this would be huge for the entire community. And I think, really, for all marginalized Americans,\" Beck says. \"This is the fight.\"\n\nShe also weighs in on the health care costs of transgender officers and lays out the \"worst-case scenarios\" of what will happen to those military members.\n\n14:32 Beck discusses her motivations for being in the Navy SEALs and what being a SEAL had to do with her transgender identity.\n\n\"If I'm in a uniform and my hair is cut ... and I'm marching and I'm doing all this stuff, I'm able to put aside any feelings about myself,\" she says. \"I was a SEAL, that's all. So, everything else went away. I wasn't male or female. I wasn't anything. I was just a SEAL.\"\n\n17:37 A former SEAL Team 6 member, Beck talks about feeling vulnerable walking down the street after she transitioned.\n\n\"You automatically are afraid something's going to happen because there is a strange aggression,\" she says. \"I know that I was treated differently from Day One, and especially because -- I mean, I was looking like a dude in a dress.\"\n\nShe also relays how her fellow SEALs reacted to her transgender identity.\n\n23:22 Beck weighs in on women serving in combat roles.\n\n\"I'm in favor of the door to the military to be wide open,\" she says. \"Come in and sign up. We're going to give you the tests. We're going to test you physically and mentally, and then that door is wide open and you pass the tests, come on in.\"\n\n29:15 The war veteran responds to one common refrain in defense of Trump's ban -- the assertion that \"the military shouldn't be the place for doing social experiments.\"\n\n\"If you take a room and it's a room this size,\" she says, \"and grab a guy from New York, a guy from Texas, somebody from California -- somebody from all over the country, all different walks of life, different races, different religions -- and stick them in that one room and they can live there with their hair buzzed off and get along and do these jobs, isn't that a little bit of a social experiment?\"\n\n32:15 Beck explains how she came out publicly as transgender in 2013 -- while she was working as a contract employee at the Pentagon.\n\n\"It was like a breaking point,\" she says, \"where I was just like, 'I'm retired, and I fought for happiness, I fought for liberty, and I don't live it.'\"",

It appears that they are legally distinct from the original source of the funds, but it's possible that naming the trust and trustee could effectively identify the donor.\n\nJackson, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said in her 23-page decision that the FEC was not legally barred from disclosing the identities of the trust and trustee. However, she also held that the agency was not legally obligated to release the information under a statute that the agency's lawyers cited.\n\nUnder those circumstances, the FEC's decision to disclose the information was reasonable, the judge wrote.\n\n\"The public has an interest in the agency's decision to terminate this proceeding involving Government Integrity without enforcing its own subpoenas and following the money back to its source,\" Jackson found. \"The agency's salutary interest in exposing its decision making to public scrutiny outweighs plaintiffs' insubstantial privacy concerns.\"\n\nThe judge also said those who brought the suit -- named in public court papers as John Doe 1 and 2 -- hadn't shown any impact on their right to make political donations.\n\n\"Even if one concludes that at least one plaintiff has asserted an interest in preventing the chilling of future speech in the form of donations, the only right that is implicated by the agency's actions in this case is the right to contribute anonymously, not the right to contribute at all,\" Jackson wrote.\n\nThere is no right to make anonymous political donations in most situations, she concluded, citing the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling.\n\nAn attorney for the anonymous trust and trustee who brought the suit, William Taylor, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nWhile the litigation was pending, the FEC released a variety of documents related to the case, but withheld the identities of the individual and the trust who filed suit.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which brought the original complaint against the Super PAC, filed its own suit against the FEC in December, charging that the agency's violated its legal duties when it failed to take action in the case.",

                "title": "Trump's governing strategy: Overpromise, underdeliver",
                "body": "The president's spotty track record of bold promises has created a credibility gap - but his supporters don't seem to mind.\n\n\"The final key to the way I promote is bravado,\" Donald Trump wrote in his 1987 book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" \"I play to people's fantasies.\"\n\nWhat was true of Trump the flamboyant Manhattan real estate magnate is now true of Trump the president of the United States. From big, beautiful border walls to \"total and complete\" Muslim bans, Trump has made a habit of sweeping promises that net headlines, only to deliver more modest results.\n\nSometimes, it's because Trump's rhetoric meets the reality of policymaking or the courts. Other times, it's because Trump is making a grand opening bid in negotiations. And often he just loses interest. But Trump's habit of overpromising and underdelivering has created a credibility gap unknown to the presidency in the modern era.\n\nTrump, for example, promised a \"big, beautiful wall\" on the campaign trail, to be financed by Mexico. But a massive spending bill that Trump signed on Friday provides $1.6 billion for just 110 miles of wall along the nearly 2000-mile long border. And the money is being provided by Congress, not the Mexican government as Trump had promised.\n\nThere was also the Muslim ban, with candidate Trump calling for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" In practice, Trump implemented a travel ban targeting seven Muslim-majority countries, was severely rebuked by the courts, and has since implemented a less stringent ban on six countries.\n\nOther times, Trump makes big pronouncements in the moment, such as when he seemed open during a televised meeting with lawmakers to sweeping gun control measures, only to backtrack within hours.\n\n\"He likes to play to television viewers by making big grandiose announcements,\" said one person close to the White House. \"When the issue starts to fade out in the American consciousness, he may not follow through.\"\n\nHe also made a big splash on Friday morning by threatening to veto the $1.3 trillion spending package -- briefly raising the risk of the third government shutdown this year -- before again reversing himself. The episode seemed to crystallize much about Trump: a surprise announcement, hours of suspense and then the resolution that was expected all along.\n\nAnd while he has long delivered tough talk on trade, his controversial announcement of steep steel tariffs has been drastically scaled back with Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and the European Union -- together accounting for more than half of U.S. steel imports -- scoring temporary relief.\n\n\"People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do,\" Trump added in the \"Art of the Deal\" passage. \"That's why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration, and a very effective form of promotion.\"\n\nExaggeration appears to be as omnipresent in Trump's White House as controversy and staff turnover, a newly accepted part of Washington's day-to-day. For longtime Trump-watchers, the habit is hardly surprising.\n\n\"He is this unique amalgam of being an egomaniac and being wildly insecure all at once,\" said Tim O'Brien, who wrote the 2005 Trump biography \"TrumpNation.\" \"And he has this need, I think, in front of people to win them over almost regardless of who they are, and in that moment he's quite happy to do that.\"\n\n\"He doesn't really do anything meaningful to try to follow up because he's not patient and he's not tactical,\" O'Brien added. \"It's just Trump being Trump.\"\n\nAnd Trump has at times delivered on his braggadocious talk. For months, he promised a massive tax package, and while the economic impact of the \"big, beautiful\" tax cut is yet to be seen, it was still the most significant piece of tax legislation in more than 30 years.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump's verve for fantastical promises is seen as a potent political tool by his opponents.\n\n\"You need something that cuts against the grain or that you follow out to its natural logical extension even if the extension invites controversy,\" said Brian Fallon, Hillary Clinton's press secretary during the 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump understood that almost intuitively, Fallon said, and with positions like the Muslim ban, he made it so that no other Republican could outflank him on the right. Such outlandish ideas, he said, \"inspired controversy, inspired chatter ... and washed over the national audience just by the sheer strength of its own message.\"\n\nTrump has continued the grandiose pledges from the West Wing, adding to a chaotic atmosphere in which priorities can shift and policies can change on a dime, as soon as Trump makes a pronouncement, expected or not. It is seen as one reason staff turnover has been so high -- but it might not matter, as far as his base is concerned.\n\n\"It clearly wears down his White House staff and his family, and it's taken a toll on his marriages,\" O'Brien said. \"People who have to deal with it personally on a daily basis become unwound by it. But his base isn't really dealing with him on a daily basis.\"\n\n\"They believe that Washington's the problem, I don't think they blame the president,\" said the person close to the White House. \"They blame the gridlock in Washington that he's trying to overcome.\"",

The union said in a statement that \"the impact of individual country exemptions or product exclusions needs to be carefully examined,\" adding that \"it would be a tragedy if the initial optimism of our members about the [tariffs'] impact on their livelihoods was undermined by unwise and overly broad exemptions and exclusions.\"\n\n-- Lloyd O'Carroll, an independent analyst of the steel and aluminum industry, said none of the recently exempted countries are major aluminum suppliers to the U.S. But he noted that Brazil and South Korea are major steel producers and that the exemptions do \"weaken the impact of the tariffs.\" American steel companies \"should at least be irritated,\" he said.\n\nWHAT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA DID FOR BOLTON'S SUPER PAC: The New York Times' Matt Rosenberg got his hands on a copy of the contract of between Cambridge Analytica and the super PAC started by President Donald Trump's new national security adviser, John Bolton (the uncreatively named John Bolton Super PAC). \"The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as 'behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging.'\"\n\n-- \"To do that work, Cambridge used Facebook data, according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work.

                "body": "President Donald Trump said Friday his administration was \"very close\" to finalizing trade talks with South Korea -- suggesting that his broader concerns over the free trade agreement between the two countries could also be resolved soon.\n\n\"We're going to have a wonderful deal with a wonderful ally. We're getting very close to it,\" Trump said. \"It was a deal that was causing a lot of problems for our country in terms of employment and in terms of lots of other things.\"\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly blasted the trade agreement between the U.S. and its Asian ally, made the comment at a press conference to mark his signing of a $1.3 trillion spending bill averting a government shutdown.\n\nDisagreements over the trade pact have undermined the relationship between Seoul and Washington at a time when North Korea's nuclear weapons tests have threatened to destabilize the region.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who also spoke at the event, said the administration was nearing a \"pretty comprehensive resolution\" with South Korea. He said the agreement would encompass Trump's new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as well as \"broader trade talks.\"\n\n\"We hope by some time next week to be able to have a real announcement,\" Ross added.\n\nThe White House on Thursday night temporarily exempted South Korea from the new steel and aluminum tariffs, which were imposed under a rarely used trade law that allows the president to take trade action to protect national security interests. That exemption is pending a successful conclusion of talks to amend the 2007 free trade agreement between the U.S. and South Korea, which took effect six years ago, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier this week.\n\nLighthizer initiated a process last July under the U.S.-South Korea trade deal to negotiate changes to the pact to address market access issues and the trade imbalance between the two countries -- one of Trump's chief complaints about the deal.",

                "body": "President Donald Trump on Friday called for reinstating the line-item veto, a practice ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1998.\n\nTrump's call for a line-item veto, by which he would be able to reject specific portions of a measure without vetoing a piece of legislation entirely, came amid afternoon remarks at the White House Friday in which he excoriated Congress, especially Democrats, for sending him an omnibus bill that met his demand for a dramatic increase in military spending but nonetheless included funding for \"things that are really a wasted sum of money.\"\n\n\"To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills, and the Senate must end -- they must end the filibuster rule and get down to work,\" the president said. \"We have to get a lot of great legislation approved, and without the filibuster rule, it'll happen just like magic.\"\n\nTrump said he had signed the omnibus bill, which he had threatened earlier Friday to veto, but declared he would never again sign such a bill, which, he complained, contained too much spending and had been presented to him with insufficient time to read its 2,200-plus pages.\n\nPast presidents from both parties have called on Congress to give them a line-item veto, a power that the governors of more than 40 states possess. Lawmakers passed legislation to give the president a line-item veto in 1996, but that law was overturned in 1998 by the Supreme Court by a 6-3 vote.\n\nTrump's demand that the Senate do away with its legislative filibuster, which requires most legislation to clear a 60-vote threshold to pass the chamber, is a repeat of a position he has long staked out. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who last year removed the filibuster hurdle for judicial nominations in order to secure the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, has said he will never eliminate the legislative filibuster for as long as he is majority leader.",

                "body": "The president's unpredictable behavior has West Wing staffers worried about their own credibility.\n\nForget senior White House staffers, outside advisers, friends and others \"close\" to the president. There's only one person who truly knows what Donald Trump is thinking at any given moment: Donald Trump.\n\nThe president's surprise Friday morning tweet threatening to veto a $1.3 trillion government funding bill -- and subsequent reversal in a matter of hours -- capped another week in which Trump's impulsive decisions undermined his exasperated staff.\n\nTensions were running high in the White House on Friday, especially on the communications team, as staff scrambled to figure out whether the president really intended to veto the bill or was just blustering. There is growing concern in the West Wing that the president's unpredictable behavior is undercutting staffers' credibility, according to two people who have spoken to White House officials in recent days.\n\n\"The press and comms team, more than others, are at their wits' end,\" a former White House official told POLITICO. \"I don't blame them for being frustrated, because they're on the front lines of this and are directly responsible for dealing with the blowback of the president's un-planned tweets.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLess than 24 hours before Trump threatened to blow up the deal to keep the government open, the White House sent two senior staffers -- Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short -- to brief reporters about Trump's support for the spending bill.\n\n\"Let's cut right to the chase. Is the president going to sign the bill? Yes. Why? Because it funds his priorities,\" Mulvaney told reporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence touted the legislation during a Thursday speech in New Hampshire, telling Trump's supporters it includes a crucial down payment toward building a massive wall along the Mexico border. And, despite Trump's misgivings, the White House itself circulated statements saying the administration supports the bill and casting the legislation as a \"win for the American people.\"\n\nTrump's Friday tweet unleashed a wave confusion in the White House, with aides and even senior officials such as Defense Secretary James Mattis rushing to convince the president that he should accept the bill.\n\nUltimately, Trump signed the bill on Friday with Mattis by his side, saying the move was \"a matter of national security.\"\n\nHe also made sure to knock the spending package, calling it a \"ridiculous situation\" and pledging, \"I will never sign another bill like this again.\"\n\nBut in the run-up to Trump's announcement, White House aides privately acknowledged it wasn't outside the realm of possibility that the president would double-down on his opposition to the legislation, plunging Washington into chaos.\n\nAsked earlier Friday whether Trump was serious about vetoing the bill, one White House official said simply, \"Who knows.\"\n\nWhite House officials had long been aware that the president was unhappy with the legislation, but they believed they had convinced him to support it.\n\nFriday's tweet again raised questions about whether the president's senior advisers are capable of following the president's ever-evolving stances on crucial issues of national importance.\n\n\"This is a reminder that if you're working in this White House, you either need to spend the time with the president on the front end to know exactly what his thinking is or you need to be in constant communication with him,\" said Jason Miller, Trump's former campaign spokesman. \"If you're just responding to what some other staffer sent you on email, then of course you're going to be disconnected.\"\n\n\"That falls on the staffer,\" Miller added. \"It doesn't fall on the president.\"\n\nWhite House aides counter that they're not misinformed; Trump, they argue, is just prone to changing his mind, leaving a trail of contrary statements in his wake.\n\nAfter the Washington Post reported last week that Trump had decided to remove H.R. McMaster as national security adviser, Trump insisted on issuing a statement raising doubts about the story -- even though many in the White House knew the president wanted to eventually replace McMaster.\n\n\"Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster - contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted in response to the story.\n\nWhite House officials believed that Trump wouldn't actually pull the trigger on replacing McMaster for several weeks. But Trump apparently had different plans. One week after Sanders' tweet, Trump decided to replace McMaster with former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.\n\nThe same scenario has played out across the administration, with agency officials sometimes delivering policy statements that are later contradicted by the president. Hours before the White House announced plans to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters, \"we're a long ways from negotiations.\"\n\nPeople who regularly speak to Trump say he hates seeing his next moves previewed in the press and he delights in keeping people guessing. When The New York Times reported earlier this month that the president was poised to shake up his legal team, Trump denied it on Twitter, saying he was \"VERY happy\" with his lawyers. John Dowd, one of Trump's top lawyers, resigned this week.\n\nSometimes regular contact with Trump isn't enough to anticipate his next move. White House officials say they've left meetings believing an issue is settled only to see the president publicly re-litigate the issue after speaking to an outside ally on the phone or seeing an alternative take on cable news.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is when staff think they've talked him out of something he initially supported only for it to resurface, sometimes publicly, at a later date,\" another former White House official said.\n\nTrump's aides often try to account for the possibility that the president's positions will shift, telling reporters asking about anything from trade to personnel that \"nothing is final until it's announced.\" For the press, the phrase has come to symbolize a simple reality in this White House: nobody knows what's going to happen until it happens.",

Scott Taylor (R-Va.), the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia announced Friday.\n\nAccording to court documents, Wallace Grove Godwin, 69, visited Taylor's office on Thursday and threatened to shoot him and two staffers at a Saturday event. The dispute arose, according to the District Attorney's office, over a discussion about marijuana policy.\n\n\"Scott is having an event this Saturday. I am going to get my shotgun and do something about this. I will just handle this myself,\" Godwin allegedly said to a Taylor staffer. He then pointed to two staffers in the room and said, \"You two are next,\" authorities said.\n\nGowdin is expected to appear in a federal courthouse in Norfolk, Va. on Friday afternoon. The maximum penalty for threatening a member of Congress is 10 years in prison.\n\nLawmakers have clamored for more funding for personal security over the last year amid increased hostility at local events -- and especially after last year's baseball practice shooting that left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) gravely wounded.\n\nAccording to the Capitol Police officer who handled the arrest, Godwin -- who holds a legal concealed carry permit -- had a previous run-in with Taylor at Taylor's private residence. According to the officer, in 2017 Godwin \"blocked the Congressman's vehicle with his own vehicle, and waited for the Congressman to come outside.\"\n\n\"The Congressman left his residence and told GODWIN to move his vehicle. GODWIN then exited the vehicle to speak to the Congressman about marijuana policy,\" according to the officer's affidavit. \"The Congressman told GODWIN to leave and GODWIN left the residence without further incident.\"\n\nGowdin was also reported to the Capitol Police in March 2017 after visiting Taylor's Virginia Beach office and berating staff.\n\nFederal court records show that Godwin last year sued the federal government for \"non-enforcement\" of marijuana laws.\n\nTaylor, a former Navy SEAL, served in Iraq as a sniper in Iraq in 2005. He has also been stationed in the United States and Latin America.",

Al Franken resurfaced Friday to lash out at Jeff Sessions, his sparring partner for much of the Trump administration's first year, over the attorney general's decision to fire a longtime FBI official over a \"lack of candor.\"\n\nFranken has accused Sessions of misleading the Senate Judiciary Committee in sworn testimony. And the departed Minnesota senator called the dismissal of Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe \"hypocrisy at its worst.\"\n\nSessions fired former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe late last week, hours before McCabe was to retire from the bureau with full benefits. In a statement, Sessions said that McCabe had been found by an internal watchdog to have leaked information to the media without authorization and that he \"lacked candor -- including under oath -- on multiple occasions.\"\n\nOpponents of the Trump administration have accused Sessions of carrying out political retribution on behalf of the president, who had excoriated McCabe repeatedly on Twitter.\n\n\"That the attorney general would fire the man who was tasked with investigating him raises serious questions about whether retaliation or retribution motivated his decision. It also raises serious questions about his supposed recusal from all matters stemming from the 2016 campaign,\" wrote Franken, who resigned earlier this year amid allegations that he touched multiple women inappropriately. \"But the fact that Attorney General Sessions would claim that a 'lack of candor' justified Mr. McCabe's termination is hypocrisy at its worst.\"\n\nThe former Minnesota senator recalled that Sessions, who has recused himself from all Department of Justice investigations related to the 2016 election, only did so in the wake of media reports detailing his multiple meetings with then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak during the campaign. Sessions had testified, under questioning from Franken, during his confirmation hearing that he \"did not have communications with the Russians\" during the campaign.\n\nThat Sessions would fire McCabe for a lack of candor, Franken wrote on Facebook, was \"ironic, because, as you may recall, Jeff Sessions has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of candor -- under oath -- about his own interactions with Russians.\"",

                "title": "Here's What's in the Budget Bill Nobody's Bothered to Read",
                "body": "No wonder Trump is threatening a veto -- Democrats are getting most of what they wanted.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's budget proposals have taken a hatchet to President Barack Obama's top priorities. They've called for deep cuts in renewable energy, medical research and nonmilitary spending in general. They've eliminated TIGER, a grant program for innovative transportation projects created by Obama's stimulus bill; ARPA-E, an energy research agency launched by the stimulus; and CDBG, a community development program many Republicans consider an urban slush fund.\n\nNow the Republicans who control Congress have passed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, and it not only protects Obama's priorities, it expands them. It does far less for Trump's stated priorities, and while his administration endorsed the bill Thursday, he tweeted a veto threat and expressed some apparent buyer's remorse Friday after it passed.\n\nThe omnibus -- Capitol Hill jargon for a single spending bill that funds most government functions -- does not kill any of the programs or agencies Trump's budget proposed to kill; it triples funding for TIGER, nearly doubles CDBG, and boosts ARPA-E's budget by 16 percent. Trump wanted to slash the Energy Department's renewables budget 65 percent; instead, Congress boosted it 14 percent. Trump proposed to keep nonmilitary spending $54 billion below the congressional budget cap; the omnibus spends right up to the cap, a $63 billion increase from last year.\n\nThis is why the conservative National Review denounced the omnibus as \"the sort of legislation that would have been right at home in the Obama administration,\" while Democratic congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer gloated in a statement that its \"job-creating, life-saving investments stand in sharp contrast to the Trump budget.\" It basically extends the fiscal status quo that has prevailed since the start of Obama's second term -- plus a sizable chunk of new deficit spending -- even though Republicans now control the legislative and executive branches.\n\n\"Throughout the Obama presidency, the Republican Party at least gave lip service to the need to restore fiscal sanity in Washington,\" says Michael Needham, head of the conservative policy group Heritage Action. \"It is now clear just how many in the GOP are willing to engage in profligate spending when they control the levels of power.\"\n\nRepublicans are pleased that the omnibus hikes defense spending 10 percent, even more than Trump requested, including a 2.6 percent military pay raise Trump has already bragged about on Twitter. The White House also got $1.6 billion for border security, although the bill specifies it cannot be spent on the concrete wall the president wants. There's a 6 percent cut in foreign aid and other State Department programs, less than the 25 percent cut in the Trump budget written by Office of Management and Budget chief Mick Mulvaney but still a significant rollback. And the omnibus did not include a specific line item for the Gateway rail tunnel project in New York City that Trump had called a deal-breaker, although Democrats are confident that Gateway will still get plenty of cash from the bill.\n\nStill, given the power of Republicans in Congress and their usual deference to the president, it's fairly remarkable how many of Trump's budget priorities failed to hitch a ride on the omnibus. Not only won't it build his wall -- much less get Mexico to pay for it -- it won't cut funding for \"sanctuary cities\" or add new detention beds for undocumented immigrants. It won't eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities or the Legal Services Corporation, and actually provided modest funding increases for all three agencies. It won't fund Trump administration proposals to expand school choice or replace food stamps with home-delivered boxes of food.\n\nMulvaney's budget blueprint called for a dramatic shift in Washington's fiscal trajectory, shrinking just about every domestic program that didn't involve the military, veterans or the border. But it has been clear throughout the Trump era that the Republican leaders who clamored for austerity in the Obama era no longer care so passionately about shrinkage. The omnibus did not adopt Trump's proposed cuts to Pell Grants for low-income students, Head Start for low-income children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Institutes of Health, which all got more money than they got last year. The Environmental Protection Agency, which would have lost nearly a third of its budget if Trump had his way, was level-funded.\n\nThose are presumably the kind of priorities Trump was grumbling about when he tweeted that he \"had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.\" Trump has periodically threatened to shut down the government if Democrats wouldn't meet his demands, but Republican leaders were clearly desperate for the Democratic votes they needed to keep the government open. The omnibus doesn't even cut off funding to Planned Parenthood, a GOP priority that inspired a government shutdown under Obama.\n\nPelosi and Schumer's gloating aside, Democrats did not get everything they wanted. The omnibus did not include the new protections they are seeking for undocumented Dreamers who came to America as kids, or new funding they want for stabilizing the Obamacare exchanges. But considering the balance of power in Congress, they got quite a lot they wanted that Trump didn't want -- including full funding for the 2020 census, money for states to bolster their election security and the FBI to fight Russian cyberattacks, and language blocking a proposed Trump administration rule that would have allowed employers to pocket tips earned by their workers. They insisted on expanding a tax credit for low-income housing development in exchange for allowing Republicans to fix a technical glitch in the recent tax bill. And they won a modest strengthening of gun background checks and a rollback of a ban on gun violence research by the CDC without having to accept a provision requiring states to honor concealed carry permits; conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus claimed GOP leaders had promised that provision would be part of the deal.\n\nPresidential budgets are always dead on arrival on Capitol Hill, but the omnibus feels more like a product of Obama-era divided government than Trump-era Republican monopoly. Trump's budgets floated the deepest cuts in research and other innovation investments that any administration has ever proposed. On Thursday, an analysis by Matt Hourihan of the American Association for the Advancement of Science concluded the omnibus would provide the largest increase in innovation funding since Obama's 2009 stimulus, boosting America's research budget 12.8 percent to its highest inflation-adjusted level ever. \"Typically, when discretionary spending is increased, research funding moves along with it, and this year's omnibus proves no exception,\" Hourihan wrote.\n\nThe bill was crafted behind closed doors by congressional leaders -- most back-benchers had less than a day to read its 2,232 pages -- so it's hard to say how much of it reflects genuine Republican enthusiasm for big government and how much reflects a political decision to cave to Democrats to avoid a shutdown on Trump's watch. For years, limited-government conservatives have been frustrated by the compromises GOP leaders have made to avoid budgetary train wrecks, and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows complained that \"this omnibus doesn't just forget the promises we made to voters -- it flatly rejects them.\"\n\nAt the very least, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided the omnibus wasn't the ideal vehicle to push federal policy to the right. For example, rank-and-file Republicans tried to stuff it with scores of provisions rolling back environmental protections like the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, but the only major one that seems to have survived had significant bipartisan support, an amendment declaring that electricity produced by burning trees and other biomass is carbon-neutral. And even that scientifically dubious effort to resolve a controversy over climate policy by legislative fiat was scaled back; the original version would have made the change permanent, but the final version lasts only a year, and environmentalists vowed to fight the forestry industry to get rid of it in 2019.\n\n\"It remains a terrible precedent for Congress to codify fake science in the budget, but at least the language is not set in stone,\" says Laura Haight, a senior policy adviser for the Partnership for Policy Integrity.\n\nThe inability of GOP leaders to undo environmental protections in a budget bill does not necessarily mean they've lost interest in undoing environmental protections. But given the additional $143 billion the omnibus will add to the federal deficit over the next six months -- plus the $1.5 trillion the Republican tax bill will put on the national credit card over the next decade -- it's fair to say they've lost interest in reducing red ink. The federal deficit actually declined by two thirds on Obama's watch after ballooning due to the Great Recession -- partly because of his tax increases, partly because of the economic recovery, and partly because of Republican demands to hold the line on spending -- but it is rising again under Trump, and could hit $1 trillion next year. Republicans still attack Democrats as big spenders, but the Tea Party rallies where they clamored for Washington to live within its means feel like vestiges of a bygone age.\n\nThe omnibus doesn't really seem to have an ideological theme, other than more -- more for defense, more for opioid treatment, more for infrastructure, more for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers that Mulvaney has denounced as a waste of money, and more goodies buried in the fine print. Section 731 of the bill's Division A tweaks the Department of Agriculture's Tree Assistance program to make sure that producers of pecans can get reimbursed for disaster losses in 2017 even if they didn't lose 15 percent of their trees, the usual standard under the program. The top pecan-producing states are Texas and Georgia, which got hit last year by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma; House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway is from Texas, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is from Georgia.\n\n\"Somebody got inconvenienced, so now the government's on the hook,\" says Joshua Sewell, a senior policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense. \"It's easy to put something like that into a bill nobody's going to read before they vote.\"",

Trump also demanded a line-item veto to allow him to axe specific provisions of bills he dislikes, even though the Supreme Court ruled that line-item vetoes are unconstitutional.\n\n\"I will never sign another bill like this again,\" he said, calling the 2,200 page plan a \"ridiculous situation.\" \"I'm not going to do it again.\"",

The group also cracked into 176 foreign universities, DOJ said.\n\nBeyond universities, the Iranians hit five U.S. government agencies, including the state governments in Hawaii and Indiana, as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the energy industry, and the Department of Labor.\n\nThe group also infiltrated the United Nations and the United Nations Children's Fund, DOJ said.\n\nIn total, prosecutors indicted nine Iranians for participating in the scheme, which continued until at least December 2017, according to a release.\n\nOver those years, the indicted Mabna hackers breached the email accounts of roughly 8,000 professors.\n\nThe hackers conducted \"many\" of the intrusions \"on behalf of\" Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, \"as well as other Iranian government and university clients,\" according to DOJ.\n\n\"The hackers targeted innovations and intellectual property from our country's greatest minds,\" Berman said.\n\nThe Treasury Department also slapped sanctions on the Mabna Institute and the nine charged individuals.\n\nWhile none of the charged hackers have been detained, Berman said the indictments would restrict their lives.\n\n\"The only way they will see the outside world is through their computer screens, but stripped of their greatest asset -- anonymity,\" he said.",

                "body": "With Liz Crampton, Catherine Boudreau, Adam Behsudi, Doug Palmer and Helena Bottemiller Evich\n\nCHINA TARGETS U.S. PORK, FRUIT AND WINE IN RETALIATORY TRADE STRIKE: China rolled out a plan on Thursday night to fire back against President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum -- just as many in the agriculture industry had feared. Beijing is considering reciprocal duties on $3 billion worth of U.S. exports of fruit, wine, pork, steel, aluminum and other products. The news came hours after Trump unveiled new tariffs aimed at some $50 billion in Chinese exports in a bid to get Beijing to change its intellectual property practices. China's retaliation was directed specifically at the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which took effect early this morning, Pro Trade's Adam Behsudi reports.\n\nWhat's on the list? China is targeting 128 products split among two groups. The first group, worth nearly $1 billion, includes 120 potential tariffs on products such as fresh fruit, dried fruits and nuts, wine, modified ethanol and American ginseng. Those products will face a 15 percent tariff. China will impose a 25 percent tariff on a second group of products, valued at nearly $2 billion, that includes pork.\n\nPork producers weigh in: Jim Heimerl, president of National Pork Producers Council, emphasized on Thursday that China's proposed tariffs would be felt throughout rural America. \"We sell a lot of pork to China, so higher tariffs on our exports going there will harm our producers and undermine the rural economy,\" Heimerl said in a statement. \"No one wins in these tit-for-tat trade disputes, least of all the farmers and the consumers.\" U.S. producers sent $1.1 billion worth of pork to China last year.\n\nWhat's next? The U.S. argues the steel and aluminum tariffs are necessary for national security, but China said that it views the U.S. tariffs as a safeguard measure, which could allow Beijing to move ahead with retaliatory tariffs under the World Trade Organization's safeguards agreement. The U.S. and China will have to undergo a 30-day period of consultations at the WTO before the first set of tariffs can be imposed.\n\nCommodity farmers fear what's to come: Agricultural groups have worried for months that tariffs levied against U.S. trading partners would lead to retaliatory actions against crops like soybeans, corn and wheat. After Trump's move on Thursday to escalate trade tensions with China, there was a feeling that the hit to agriculture was coming -- even before Beijing made its play, your host reports.\n\n\"If there was any question about the likelihood of retaliation by China after previous actions by the administration to protect domestic manufacturers, that doubt was erased today,\" said John Heisdorffer, president of the American Soybean Association.\n\nU.S. soybean growers have been most vocal in objecting to a trade crackdown against China because they ship almost a third of all production to Beijing. China buys upward of $14 billion in U.S. soybeans each year.\n\nAnd still to come is how Beijing will respond to the even bigger and China-focused action to force it to reconsider its intellectual property practices. The Chinese government called the administration's actions \"self-defeating\" because they would harm U.S. consumers, companies and financial markets.\n\n\"We urge the U.S. to cease and desist, make cautious decisions, and avoid placing China-U.S. trade relations in danger with the purpose of hurting others that eventually end up hurting itself,\" the Chinese Embassy said in a two-page statement.\n\nThe farm bill effect: Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts aired his frustration with Trump's trade policy to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday morning, explaining that the threat of retaliation only further complicates the farm bill process.\n\n\"We're at a dire fix. We're trying to write a farm bill here, and it's with a backdrop of severe budget limitations,\" Roberts said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Trump's trade agenda. \"We know we have to do that, but if we have to go down the road with a special payment with regards to retaliation -- that just adds another dustup right before the farm bill.\"\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY, MARCH 23!

Trump said the legislation does not address DACA recipients and does not fully fund his proposed border wall.\n\nThe White House had previously reassured lawmakers that Trump would sign the omnibus measure, which must pass to avoid a government shutdown that would start on Saturday. Capitol Hill was unprepared for the threat, as members of the House and Senate were scattering across the country as Congress heads into a two-week recess.\n\nPETERSON DASHES HOPES FOR RESTART TO FARM BILL TALKS: House Agriculture ranking member Collin Peterson was blunt on Thursday when asked about whether there is anything that would bring Democrats back to the farm bill negotiating table with Chairman Mike Conaway: \"I don't see how,\" he responded. \"I think [Conaway] has got himself backed into a corner.\"\n\nPeterson halted the talks last week under pressure from committee Democrats, who demanded Conaway show them the text of the nutrition title, due to concerns about the potential for it to feature proposals to tighten eligibility and work requirements in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The impasse has pushed the release of the House farm bill back to sometime after April 9, when Congress returns from recess.\n\nConaway feeling 'hurt': Prior to Peterson's statement to reporters on Thursday, Conaway said he intends to move the farm bill to the House floor with or without Democrats, but would welcome them back into negotiations \"with open arms,\" Pro Ag's Catherine Boudreau and Liz Crampton reported. \"I'm deeply disappointed and hurt, quite frankly, that Collin led his team to the sidelines,\" Conaway said.\n\nThe Texas Republican added that once the SNAP proposal is out in the open, he thinks people will understand that it is focused not on cutting spending but instead on creating opportunities for people to move off of food stamps.\n\nParty pressure? Both Conaway and Peterson have alluded to facing pressure from their respective party leaders -- that Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is stalling things with the expectation that Democrats will regain a majority in the House in the midterm elections, and that House Speaker Paul Ryan views the farm bill as a way to push his welfare reform agenda. Both have also denied, however, that their respective conference leaders are calling the shots.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi has no idea what is going on,\" Peterson said Thursday. \"The idea that we're taking orders from her is ridiculous.\"\n\nConaway said the proposed changes to SNAP are based on more than 20 hearings the Agriculture Committee has held over three years, though he admitted that details have been \"vetted\" by leadership. He said he has not talked with Ryan about them, but their staffs have worked together.\n\nDetails trickle out: Conaway's still got the nutrition title under wraps, but he shared some broad details on changes it will propose to SNAP eligibility, including eliminating broad-based categorical eligibility but maintaining traditional and narrow eligibility standards. The bill also would update financial asset-test levels for things like savings accounts and cars to reflect modern living expenses. States would have a two-year window to develop a new education and training system to help SNAP recipients move off the program.\n\nHarvest Box-ed out: The House farm bill won't include the White House's proposal to provide millions of low-income families with boxes of nonperishable food in place of a large share of their SNAP benefits. Conaway said Thursday he couldn't find support for the idea, known as \"America's Harvest Box,\" which anti-hunger groups have argued would be impractical.\n\nMCKINNEY OPTIMISTIC AMID TRADE TURMOIL: Ted McKinney may be at the center of brewing trade tensions, but he's giving off a zen vibe. McKinney, USDA's first undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, made a point of telling the audience at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs' Global Food Security Symposium on Thursday that he didn't know when he agreed to speak at the event that Trump would be announcing new tariffs the same day, but he showed up nonetheless.\n\nAfter delivering remarks at the event, McKinney was asked how optimistic he is right now about trade prospects, on a scale of one to ten. \"It's 11,\" he said. \"It's 11, even though we're going through some trials and tribulations on trade.\"\n\n'Right-size' it: \"I think we're right-sizing, so we can get to both free trade with fair trade,\" McKinney said. \"That's what's behind that.\"\n\nNew deals coming soon? The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative will begin consulting with the Trump administration and Congress as soon as next week to determine which countries the U.S. should pursue new free trade agreements with, Lighthizer said on Thursday.\n\n\"If I have my way, it's not going to be a five-year negotiation,\" Lighthizer told Senate Finance lawmakers. \"It's going to be a focused negotiation, where we get something very quickly for agriculture as well as other parts of the U.S. economy and increase exports.\"\n\nHEAT OVER FOREST SERVICE FUNDING FIX: Provisions in the omnibus spending deal that fundamentally alter how the federal government pays to fight forest fires landed with a thud with House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop. \"I'm extremely disappointed in what was in there and it does not solve the problem,\" the Utah Republican told Pro Energy's Anthony Adragna.\n\nMany important reforms were left out of the final package due to objections from East Coast Senate Democrats, Bishop said. \"I don't blame Western Democrat senators. [Senate Energy ranking member Maria] Cantwell tried but was not heard,\" Bishop said. \"We need a forest fire in [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's] damn tunnel in New Jersey so he understands what his issue is.\"\n\nThat criticism comes despite the praise of conservation and forestry groups, as well as a number of Western lawmakers. \"Common sense has finally prevailed when it comes to how the Forest Service pays to fight record-breaking forest fires that devastate homes and communities in Oregon and the West,\" Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement.\n\nThe deal creates a new fund for wildfire mitigation beginning in 2020 that would grow through 2027, while also allowing the U.S. Forest Service some additional flexibility to manage areas at risk of fires.\n\nROW CROPS:\n\n-- Omnibus removes reporting requirement for conservation programs: The $1.3 trillion spending bill includes a provision that would exempt farmers from certain reporting requirements when enrolling in USDA cost-share conservation programs. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue celebrated the change, saying it \"clears away red tape for participants in conservation programs by exempting them from having to obtain\" SAM registration and DUNS numbers. Liz has more.\n\n-- GOP lawmakers see sweet spot for EPA funding: After years of pressing for sharp budget cuts to the EPA, some Republicans were unwilling to heed the Trump administration's calls to slash the agency's fiscal 2018 budget by nearly a third, Anthony Adragna and Emily Holden report for Pro Energy. Instead, lawmakers voted to keep EPA spending levels about the same as fiscal 2017, while also funding many of the climate and clean energy research activities the White House had sought to eliminate. The bill also increased sustainable agriculture research dollars.\n\n-- CFTC officials blast Congress over agency funding: Officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday criticized members of Congress for cutting the agency's budget in the fiscal 2018 spending bill at a time when it needs more resources to adapt to rapidly changing markets. The U.S. derivatives regulator's budget would drop to $249 million, a decrease of $1 million from the prior year's level. Pro Financial Services' Patrick Temple-West has more.\n\n-- Trump exempts EU, 4 other allies from steel, aluminum tariffs: The Trump administration said Thursday it would exempt the European Union and four other allies -- Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea -- from the steel and aluminum tariffs, your truly reports. Trump made it official late Thursday night by issuing a proclamation saying the tariffs would be delayed for those allies until May 1 to give Lighthizer time to negotiate agreements with each trading partner to address U.S. national security concerns. The proclamation also covers Mexico and Canada, which Trump previously said would be temporarily exempt.\n\n-- Ohio concedes western part of Lake Erie is polluted: The state backed down on Thursday in its year-and-a-half-long feud with Michigan, agreeing to declare its portion of Lake Erie waters polluted. Environmental groups sued Ohio over its previous refusal to make such a declaration, which they believe will attract greater attention to the pollution problem. The Ohio Farm Bureau opposed the listing. Pro Energy's Annie Snider has more.\n\n-- Trump administration moving away from RIN price cap? Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) told reporters on Thursday that the Trump administration appears to be backing away from any plan to place a price cap on Renewable Identification Numbers in the long-running squabble over reforming the Renewable Fuel Standard, DTN/The Progressive Farmer reports.\n\n-- Center for Food Safety sues USDA over organic livestock welfare rule: The Center for Food Safety and three other public interest groups sued USDA this week over its move to withdraw the regulation, which would have improved minimum requirements for care of animals on certified organic farms. George Kimbrell, CFS legal director, called the decision \"an existential threat to the future of organic as a meaningful label that Americans can rely on.\"\n\n-- New leader on the hurricane watch: Kenneth Graham will become the next director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center, starting April 1 in Miami. He had been meteorologist-in-charge of the National Weather Service's New Orleans office since 2008.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MA! See you again soon!

Our farmers and ranchers exported more than $129 billion worth of products in 2016, accounting for 20% of all farm revenue in the U.S. Agricultural exports also support more than one million American jobs - most of them in the nonfarm sector. These jobs provide stability for rural families and communities. Free trade is essential to maintaining the strength of our agriculture economy. But some in Washington now support policies that would restrict trade. That would be devastating to family farms across the country, and would cause higher prices for consumers. President Trump and Congress should protect free trade to keep our agriculture economy strong. Learn more here. **",

                "title": "Omnibus Easter egg hunt",
                "body": "With help from Stephanie Beasley, Tanya Snyder and Brianna Gurciullo\n\nEASTER EGG HUNT: Your Pro Transportation team has been combing through the fiscal 2018 omnibus, H.R. 1625 (115), since it dropped late Wednesday, and we've got some Easter eggs to share on everything from policy riders to obscure set-asides. Here's a sampling:\n\n-- Just a week after livestock haulers got a 90-day exemption from the requirement to equip trucks with electronic logging devices, the omnibus would make their exemption permanent.\n\n-- Larger, heavier trucks would be allowed to operate on interstates in New Hampshire and North Dakota -- up to 99,000 pounds and 129,000 pounds, respectively.\n\nRail/transit\n\n-- Of the $1.3 billion for Amtrak's national network, at least $50 million would be set aside for positive train control implementation along state-supported routes where the technology isn't required by law or regulation.\n\n-- More than $35 million in consolidated rail infrastructure and safety improvement grants would go toward projects \"that contribute to the initiation or restoration of intercity passenger rail service,\" even those that still have \"a lack of agreement among the funding recipients, operator, and host railroad regarding access to and use of the host railroad facilities.\" That means Amtrak and state partners could use the funds to restore service along the Gulf Coast. (Remember that?) Proponents can also tap into $20 million the bill provides for rail restoration and enhancement grants.\n\n-- The total amount for CRISI grants is about $593 million. While Gateway could theoretically be eligible for some of that money, nearly half of it is earmarked for PTC implementation. Plus, a wide swath of projects could qualify.\n\n-- WMATA got its ninth $150 million capital grant installment; lawmakers say one more year remains on the authorization, while the administration has reportedly argued to staff that it expires in fiscal 2018.\n\nDriverless cars\n\n-- R&D for autonomous vehicles would get a $100 million windfall, with at least $60 million of it directed toward demonstration grants.\n\nFAA extension\n\n-- A \"fix\" to current TRACON hiring rules would allow for local preference for new hires in specific areas (they don't specifically call out New York and New Jersey in the bill, but that's what it's designed for).\n\nSecurity\n\n-- Lawmakers want to set aside $100 million for FEMA's transit security grant program, which is $12 million above the current funding level.\n\n-- Language in the bill also would require TSA to keep staffing airport exit lanes.\n\nYAY FOR FRIDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO's Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

The string of aviation and security bills included measures that would require TSA to share more information with surface transportation hubs as well as issue a report on its efforts to prevent vehicle-ramming attacks. Our Stephanie Beasley has more details here.\n\n** A message from the Partnership for Open and Fair Skies: The UAE and Qatar have funneled billions of dollars in government subsidies to their state-owned airline carriers, threatening 1.2 million American jobs and our entire aviation industry. More than 310 members of Congress agree that it's time to enforce our agreements and protect American jobs. http://www.openandfairskies.com/ **\n\nDRINKING THE GATE-ER-ADE: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer contended Thursday that the omnibus \"provided a reliable pathway\" for Gateway, making New Yorkers \"very happy.\" Democrats say that because of the bill, the project will be able to access $540 million during fiscal 2018 without a stamp of approval from DOT -- a claim the department has strongly pushed back against. \"Amtrak regards the No. 1 capital improvement as the Gateway project,\" Schumer said at a press conference, referring to the Northeast Corridor. \"We've worked with them closely all along on this.\"\n\nPutting it on ice: Amtrak, however, took a more measured tone. President and CEO Richard Anderson said in a statement Thursday that \"increased [Northeast Corridor] capital funding will allow us to address many important needs along the Corridor and we look forward to working closely with the Department of Transportation on investing these funds to advance the most critical projects.\" Remember that Amtrak's capital spending plans need DOT sign-off, and the department notes that the railroad's board of directors is presidentially appointed. Plus, there are no mentions of Gateway in the legislation, despite a push from the regional delegation and some House GOP appropriators.\n\nVictory lap: DOT circulated more rebuttal Thursday of the Democratic talking points on Gateway, highlighting many of the points your host just noted. The big takeaway from the department? Gateway gets no special references or treatment, and the bill \"will assure that deserving projects from all sources can be considered on their individual merits and our entire country's infrastructure can be improved.\"\n\nFuture's so bright? Schumer said he expects the administration will change its tone once the states start spending money on Gateway-related items. \"Now, obviously we have to apply for things like [the Capital Investment Grant program], but I would bet now that the president sees that Gateway is happening, that they're not gonna stand in the way if the New York-New Jersey area wants to use some of those monies for Gateway as well,\" Schumer said. While the Portal North Bridge and Hudson Tunnel projects are in the CIG pipeline, both have \"medium-low\" ratings that as of now make them ineligible for funding.\n\nDashboard confessional: A reminder from your host that, on the administration's permitting dashboard, the Hudson Tunnel is still listed with a March 30 target date for DOT completing its environmental impact statement. But Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) at a March 1 hearing she couldn't make any promises on that.\n\nLET'S FAA-LY: With lawmakers getting an extra two months -- until Sept. 30 -- to work out a long-term FAA deal, some might be concerned the extended timeframe takes too much pressure off Congress as campaign season heats up. But Washington Rep. Rick Larsen, the top Democrat on House T&I's aviation panel, said he's not there -- at least not yet. \"I still think the differences between the House and Senate are fairly small and not insurmountable, so it's more time than I would have wished, but it's still -- we can use all that time or not,\" he said. Larsen added that the White House should \"weigh in\" and push members to get a bill done quickly \"because they can use it as a down payment on their infrastructure package.\"\n\nSLICE OF PI: From our friends at POLITICO Influence: The U.S. Travel Association had its fly-in this week to meet with lawmakers on issues like infrastructure and ways to boost international tourism.

McMaster with John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, marking the latest high-level shake up in a White House that has seen unprecedented levels of turnover in Trump's first 14 months in office.\n\n\"'I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor,\" the president tweeted on Thursday evening. \"I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.' ...\n\n\"Also in a statement from the White House, McMaster, a three-star Army general, announced that he would retire from the military in the coming months.\"\n\n-- BOLTON UNDERSCORES TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY CONFUSION, write POLITICO's Michael Crowley and Bryan Bender: \"For the Donald Trump who preaches an \"America First\" foreign policy with little patience for international treaties and organizations, John Bolton is a logical choice for national security adviser. The former United Nations ambassador has said the United Nations could lose 10 stories without anyone noticing and calls for ripping up the seven-nation Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\"For the Donald Trump who as a 2016 candidate savaged supporters of the Iraq War and other Middle East military actions, Bolton is a major head-scratcher. He was a champion of George W.

Then Jim Risch's. But finally at 12:39 a.m. on Friday, the Senate passed a bill H.R. 1625 (115) funding the government through September and went home after a chaotic 12 hours of drama.\n\n\"The chamber voted 65-32 to pass the $1.3 trillion spending package and send it to President Donald Trump. But it was a tricky road to avoid a government shutdown, requiring Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to privately telephone Paul and let him vent about the Senate rules, then satisfy Risch's objections to a wilderness area being named after a dead Idaho governor.\"\n\n-- THE HOUSE DOES ITS PART, report POLITICO's John Bresnahan, Heather Caygle, Rachael Bade and Burgess Everett: \"The final House vote was 256-167. A majority of members in both parties ended up backing the 2,200 page bill, despite objections that lawmakers had not had a chance to review the final measure, which was only publicly posted after 8 p.m. on Wednesday. ...\n\n\"Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) declared passage of the omnibus package was vital for 'rebuilding' the Pentagon, which Republicans and President Donald Trump claim was neglected during the Obama era. Ryan has been pushing the military funding issue hard throughout the budget fight.\"\n\n-- HASC MEMBERS FALL IN LINE: House Armed Services Committee members from both parties overwhelmingly supported the omnibus, which was backed by Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas). But there were some notable exceptions, including Ranking Democrat Adam Smith of Washington state.\n\nIn opposing the spending package, Smith told Morning D he was swayed by the absence of funding to stabilize Obamacare markets as well as the legislation's impact on the deficit after Congress approved massive tax cuts last year.\n\n\"I am worried about our national security not just now, but two, three, four five, 10 years from now,\" Smith said. \"Where's it going to be if we don't have any sort of fiscal responsibility in our approach to budgeting?\"\n\nIn all, eight HASC members from each party voted against the spending package.\n\nThe final House vote tally is here.\n\nRep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.), who chairs the HASC Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, hit the omnibus for shipbuilding \"sleight of hand,\" though he voted for it, via our colleague Connor O'Brien: \"Speaking at a Capitol Hill forum sponsored by the Aircraft Carrier Industrial Base Coalition, Wittman noted the funding package... allocates $23.8 billion for shipbuilding. While an increase from the administration's request, it's still below the $26.2 billion in the National Defense Authorization Act and House-passed defense appropriations.\n\n\"'The information that came out yesterday in ... the omnibus appropriations bill, a lot of areas, is good,' Wittman said. 'But we've still got to get with the program.'\" He supported the omnibus on the floor.\n\n** A message from the Schar School of Policy and Government, GMU: \"The Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University provided me a huge leg up on issues of operations, strategy, national security, and counter-terrorism that will make me much more competitive in my field\" - Paul Helfgott, Student, Master's in Public Policy.

                "body": "The omnibus passed, but the push for ACA stabilization died again in Congress, and a late-night attempt to pass right-to-try failed in the Senate.\n\nBut first: a look at the news coming out of the Hubert H. Humphrey building.\n\nSEEMA VERMA PREVIEWS MEDICARE AGENDA -- The CMS administrator on Thursday offered a high-level preview of upcoming Medicare payment regulations, with an eye toward ensuring \"sustainability of the program,\" Verma told POLITICO's Rachana Pradhan and other reporters.\n\n-- CMS wants to \"double down\" on price transparency, with a goal of helping enrollees understand their costs. \"You're going to see us just get started on that with the payment rules but there's a lot more coming around that,\" Verma said. \"When we look at the Medicare system, we all know that if you go to one place it might be cheaper than another place.\"\n\n-- The agency intends to reduce burden on providers, partly by shrinking their reporting measures and changing the conditions they must meet to participate in the Medicare program. Verma also suggested that the agency is pursuing changes related to Stark laws, which govern physician self-referral for Medicare and Medicaid patients. \"We've heard that that's a big barrier for providers when they're trying to do value-based payment arrangements,\" she said.\n\n-- Verma also plans to build on interoperability of electronic health records through the MyHealthEData initiative, which aims to help patients have better access to their own health records, that she announced last month. \"You will see the actual actions that we are taking around interoperability this year,\" she said.\n\n-- When to watch: Annual rules affecting Medicare payment rates for hospital inpatient services, nursing homes and rehab facilities typically are proposed in April, and ones affecting physicians and outpatient settings are released by June or July.\n\nMORE GUIDANCE FROM VERMA -- The CMS chief weighed in on multiple issues, including:\n\n-- She's weighing more exemptions to the ACA individual mandate. \"That is something that we're giving a lot of consideration to,\" Verma told reporters, declining to specify when the Trump administration could decide on changes to the individual mandate. More for Pros.\n\n-- There could be Medicaid work requirements in non-ACA expansion states. Some non-expansion states have sought work requirements for low-income parents and caretakers, who tend to be poorer than the newly eligible adults who obtained coverage under the health law.\n\nMeanwhile, POLITICO scooped details on high-profile changes in HHS' senior ranks:\n\nCOMING: NEW ADVISER TO AZAR ON DRUG PRICING -- CVS Caremark Vice President Daniel Best has been hired to head up the department's effort to lower drug prices, a source with knowledge of the hire told POLITICO's Adam Cancryn. Best is also in HHS' publicly available staff directory as a senior adviser to Azar.\n\nWhile CVS confirmed the hire, an HHS spokesperson told POLITICO that Best is not currently an HHS employee. \"While we do not generally comment on personnel matters, there are several individuals being considered for senior roles in the department,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\n-- Why he's coming on board: Best, who has led industry relations for CVS' Medicare Part D business, will take charge of HHS' day-to-day work on initiatives aimed at cutting pharmaceutical costs -- a goal that Azar has made a top priority amid President Donald Trump's vows to rein in the drug industry.\n\n-- More hires to come: Best is one of four senior staffers that Azar is expected to name in the coming weeks, each of whom will be serve as a point person for one of the department's major priorities, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. More for Pros.\n\nLEAVING: HHS OFFICIAL WHO APPROVED TOM PRICE's FLIGHTS RESIGNS -- John Bardis, the assistant secretary of administration, is resigning effective April 6, HHS confirmed to POLITICO on Thursday.\n\n\"I am deeply grateful to President Trump, Secretary Azar, Secretary Price, and Deputy Secretary Hargan for the opportunity to work on the American people's behalf at HHS,\" Bardis said in a statement, calling his year-plus in government \"the privilege of a lifetime.\" An entrepreneur who founded MedAssets, Bardis signaled that he's returning to the private sector. More for Pros.\n\n-- Eric Hargan sings his praises. \"John Bardis is a truly transformative leader, and HHS has benefited greatly from his dedicated work over the past year,\" the deputy secretary said in a statement.\n\n-- One big question: What will the OIG say about Bardis? His office has been the focus of a probe about whether Price's use of charter-jet flights for routine domestic travel -- which cost more than $400,000 -- complied with federal regulations. As ASA, Bardis signed off on those flights with the office of general counsel.\n\nThe HHS inspector general, which is conducting an internal probe of Price's travel, told POLITICO that its final report is expected this spring.\n\n-- The other big question: Who takes over Bardis' portfolio? It's unclear whether it will be Jon Cordova, Bardis' deputy, who returned to HHS this month after being placed on leave for spreading conspiracy theories.\n\n-- Flashback: Bardis warns HHS staffers not to leak. He was the narrator of a video that all employees were required to watch last fall. The video suggested that the leaking of sensitive information could lead to terrorist attacks.\n\nTHANK GOODNESS IT'S FRIDAY PULSE -- Where, speaking of Tom Price, we hope you got this $1,000 clue on Jeopardy correct last night.\n\n(PULSE missed the episode; he was joining his colleagues to wish POLITICO's Brett Norman a happy birthday. Luckily there wasn't any breaking science news that Brett had to run out and cover last night.)\n\n** A message from PhRMA: Analysis finds commercially insured patients at 340B hospitals are prescribed more medicines and/or more expensive medicines.

Patty Murray on Thursday afternoon halted a last-ditch bid to add Republicans' Obamacare stabilization package to the omnibus spending bill.\n\nMurray objected to Sen. Susan Collins' attempt to add the bill as an amendment, calling it a \"last-minute partisan proposal\" and urging lawmakers to instead resume work toward a bipartisan agreement on shoring up the health law. She then offered a competing stabilization amendment. That was quickly shot down by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n-- What it means: The back-and-forth ensured that Congress won't fund any efforts to stabilize Obamacare as part of its massive spending bill, H.R. 1625 (115), POLITICO's Adam Cancryn writes. More for Pros.\n\nRon Johnson fails to pass House version of right-to-try by unanimous consent. After the omnibus passed in the middle of the night, the Wisconsin Republican pitched a vote on the bill -- which was quickly halted after an objection from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"I am disappointed the Senate would not pass the House version of right to try, but now the path is clear,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"I call on my colleagues in the House to take up and pass S. 204 (115), which passed the Senate unanimously last year,\" he added, touting his own version of the bill.\n\nCalls for MACRA reform fall on deaf ears on Capitol Hill. A recommendation two years in the making to eliminate a new quality payment scheme for doctors landed with a giant thud on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, POLITICO's David Pittman reports.\n\nMembers of Congress who spent close to a decade working to repeal Medicare's sustainable growth rate formula barely acknowledged the call from the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee to nix the new Merit-based Incentive Payment System, which replaced it. Instead, policymakers have focused on tweaking the program.\n\n-- What lawmakers are saying: \"We just provided some significant flexibility,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), referring to last month's changes to the 2015 MACRA law . Like other members of Congress who clearly can't contemplate another major payment reform effort, Pallone appeared puzzled by MedPAC's position, David writes. More for Pros.\n\nICYMI: Health department leaders go on opioid road show. The president's Monday speech to lay out his opioid plan kicked off an ambitious travel schedule for HHS political leaders, who have hit the road this week to stump on key opioid issues.\n\nAmong the stops:\n\n-- Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan went to Illinois and Wisconsin to talk about local opioids response. More.\n\n-- SAMHSA's Elinore F. McCance-Katz visited West Virginia to announce a $330,000 grant. More.\n\n-- NIH Director Francis Collins was in Ohio to celebrate innovative projects and products to treat opioid misuse. More.\n\n-- Surgeon General Jerome Adams was in Michigan to discuss the epidemic with students. More.\n\nMaine governor resists ballot measure expanding Medicaid. Back in November, Maine voters ordered Gov. Paul LePage to expand the state's Medicaid program through a first-of-its-kind ballot initiative. But months later, the brash tea party Republican still hasn't done it, underscoring the potential pitfalls of the ballot strategy health care advocates are pushing in red states this year, POLITICO's Rachana Pradhan writes.\n\n-- LePage had vetoed Medicaid expansion bills on five previous occasions. And this time, he's resisted implementing the optional Obamacare program until lawmakers meet his demands on how to fund it. Expansion supporters in Maine say LePage has a legal obligation to expand the program -- and is inviting a lawsuit if he blows through a key deadline less than two weeks away.

The committee is wading into the Texas runoffs by backing Colin Allred and Gina Ortiz Jones, two candidates that must face Democratic opponents in May.

Uihlein's stable of Senate candidates has expanded in the days since: a super PAC heavily funded by Uihlein has now booked advertising time in favor of Republican Matt Rosendale in Montana, POLITICO's Kevin Robillard reports. The super PAC, called Restoration PAC, \"has purchased over $230,000 worth of television time to air an ad boosting Rosendale and attacking Sen.

The 30-second ad features a male narrator praising Rosendale over b-roll of the Republican meeting with voters: 'Matt Rosendale is the real deal.

And unlike Tester, Matt believes it's wrong to hand over $1 million to the number one state sponsor or terror.'\" Full story.\n\nTHE DOGHOUSE -- \"Ethics panel reproves two Illinois Democrats for House rules violations,\" By POLITICO's John Bresnahan: \"The House Ethics Committee found that two Illinois Democrats violated chamber rules and must personally repay thousands of dollars for their actions. Yet in the case of Rep. Bobby Rush, the Ethics Committee will allow him to be repaid by his campaign committee for any personal cost, so the end result is that Rush won't be out of pocket at all. Rush and Rep. Luis Gutiérrez were formally reproved by the Ethics panel for the violations, findings that were announced on Thursday by Reps.

                "body": "OMNICYBER -- The reaction to the omnibus spending bill deal, H.R. 1625 (115), that included $380 million for voting machine upgrades has been widely positive, even if some observe that the job isn't finished. National Association of Secretaries of State President Connie Lawson, also Indiana's secretary of state, said states will be \"investing those dollars in system upgrades, voting protections, and voter education.\" Top House Homeland Security Democrat Bennie Thompson, who helped lead a House Democrat task force on election security, praised the inclusion but added that the money is \"just a down payment towards securing our elections.\" Other Democrats involved in overseeing election security offered similar sentiments. A senior Democratic aide mentioned the $380 million as a \"Democratic win\" in the bill, although at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing this week, lawmakers noted that Republican Chairman Richard Burr fought hard for the money, too.\n\nMC hit some of the highlights of the bill Thursday morning, but there are other cyber provisions. The same senior Democratic aide heralded a $307 million increase beyond what President Donald Trump requested for the FBI's counterintelligence efforts to fight Russian cyberattacks. The legislation would also bar State Department and foreign aid funding from going to any country found to assist North Korean cyberattacks. It also prohibits Commerce, Justice, NASA or the National Science Foundation from purchasing any major information systems without first conducting reviews of the security of its suppliers.\n\nAdditionally, it orders a report on Pentagon plans for a multibillion-dollar cloud computing contract. And it includes the CLOUD Act, S. 2383, which establishes standards for governments to request data in other countries -- in a way that deeply worries privacy advocates.\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

McMaster as his national security adviser, could bring a vastly different approach on Russia's election meddling to the White House,\" Cory reports. \"In their public comments, McMaster and Bolton have presented a stark contrast in their views on Moscow's involvement in the hacks and online trolling that roiled the 2016 presidential election. While McMaster has taken a hard-line stance in blaming Moscow for orchestrating the digital disruption campaign, Bolton has made headlines by casting doubt on Russia's role.\" After initially suggesting the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was a \"false flag\" operation, though, he later appeared to endorse the notion that Russia was behind the 2016 digital meddling.\n\nSENATORS MAKE PLAY ON ELECTION SECURITY -- Congress is the closest it's been since Election Day 2016 to actually moving legislation that would protect future contests from outside interference. A bipartisan group of Senate lawmakers on Thursday introduced a revised version of an election security bill, with new backing from the leaders of the influential Senate Intelligence Committee, that would establish an election security grant program to give states money to implement voluntary recommendations. The legislation, known as the Secure Elections Act, \"helps the states to prepare our election infrastructure for the possibility of interference from not just Russia, but possibly another adversary like Iran or North Korea or a hacktivist group,\" Sen. James Lankford, one of four ideologically diverse Republicans backing the bill, said in a statement.\n\nThe overhauled bill -- which also has four Democratic co-sponsors -- shifts control of grant funding from the Homeland Security Department to the Election Assistance Commission, an agency House Republicans have tried to eliminate in the past. It also scraps a proposed voluntary \"Hack the Election\" program that would have given rewards to ethical hackers who unearthed digital flaws in election systems.\n\nThe measure's rollout was the latest in a series of steps the upper chamber has taken on election security this week, starting with the Intelligence Committee releasing its own election security ideas as part of the panel's probe into Russia's 2016 election meddling and possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign. The panel held a hearing to discuss its suggestions where it became clear that a consensus was forming around the revised bill dropped Thursday.\n\nAnd despite the inclusion of $380 million for election security grants in the omnibus spending deal, the bill's backers argued more action is required. \"It's not enough,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in a statement. \"There are 227 days until the next federal election and primaries have already begun. Congress should pass the bipartisan Secure Elections Act immediately.\"\n\n** A message from OWI: KNOW Identity Conference 2018 offers a unique & immersive event that convenes the world's smartest minds to shape the future of identity and security.

The report was made public after the Intelligence Committee voted along party lines to end the panel's probe and issue their conclusions. Democrats did not participate in the final report, arguing the panel had failed to conduct a serious investigation.\n\nRegardless, the finished product included some bipartisan ideas, including the recommendation that Congress \"encourage\" states to adopt cybersecurity standards developed by the technical standards agency NIST, which are already followed by the Election Assistance Commission. Lawmakers should also \"consider a one-time grant to state and local election agencies to conduct a [cyber] risk assessment\" of their systems, the report suggested.\n\nAdditionally, the House report called for additional NIST funding for the agency to boost outreach to state and local officials, along with \"strengthening\" the 2002 Help America Vote Act, which provided over $3 billion in grants to help states purchase new voting equipment. Meanwhile, the findings faulted the FBI for not notifying election hacking victims swiftly and the government's intelligence agencies for not sharing enough technical data on online disruptors with state election officials.\n\nYEAH, ABOUT THAT -- In the same report, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee argued that they saw no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. But a liberal watchdog group said they didn't look very hard. \"There were at least 70 known contacts between Trump's team and Russia-linked operatives during the campaign and transition, including 22 meetings,\" the Moscow Project said in a blog post prior to the release of the GOP findings. \"In 81 percent of these cases, the House Intel committee obtained either no or partial information from the relevant Trump representative.\"\n\nThe Intelligence panel \"failed to interview the Trump representative involved\" in 60 percent of known Trump-Russia contacts, according to the Moscow Project. And in more than a fifth of cases, the group said, Democrats asked their GOP counterparts to schedule follow-up interviews with witnesses who either lied, \"invoked a nonexistent privilege to avoid answering questions\" or were subsequently described in media reports that raised further questions. The panel \"clearly hasn't done their job,\" the group said, \"so don't fall for any 'conclusions' they might be pushing today.\" Rep. Adam Schiff, the Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, tweeted, \"The lack of a serious investigation by the GOP is an invitation to the Russians to do it again.\"\n\nTHIS WILL NOT STAND -- The Trump administration on Thursday slammed China for hacking American companies to steal their intellectual property as Trump authorized $60 billion in annual tariffs punishing Beijing. \"Experts have acknowledged that China's cyber activities represent a grave threat to U.S. competitiveness and the U.S. economy,\" the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in a report about its investigation of China's trade practices. \"Evidence from U.S. law enforcement and private sources indicates that the Chinese government has used cyber intrusions to serve its strategic economic objectives.\"\n\nIn 2015, facing the threat of major U.S. sanctions, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised not to use his hacker army to benefit Chinese businesses. Thursday's report is the Trump administration's first major assertion that the 2015 deal has not halted Chinese intellectual property theft. \"The evidence indicates that China continues its policy and practice, spanning more than a decade, of using cyber intrusions to target U.S. firms to access their sensitive commercial information and trade secrets,\" the USTR said in its report, which chronicled years of Chinese government intrusions into American firms.\n\nATLIENS -- The city of Atlanta on Thursday suffered a ransomware attack that led to outages for a number of services, including those that customers use to access court information or pay bills. At a news conference, city officials said they didn't yet know the full extent of the damage, but emphasized that water, airport and public safety agencies are \"operating without incident,\" according to Richard Cox, chief operating officer. Atlanta has been collaborating with the Homeland Security Department, FBI, Microsoft and Cisco. \"We've been working diligently all day long to come to some type of resolution,\" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms. Officials wouldn't predict when the situation might come to an end, and whether the city would ultimately pay the ransom.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY -- \"A voting technology vendor is pushing back against an effort by members of a government advisory group to restrict wireless capabilities in future voting systems in light of recent Senate recommendations.\" ...

                "body": "A daily download of technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley\n\nWith help from Margaret Harding McGill, John Hendel, Steven Overly and Ashley Gold\n\nINSIDE THE FACEBOOK HILL BRIEFINGS -- Facebook's Cambridge Analytica briefings on the Hill have centered heavily on content that's already been shared in the company's public blog posts, leaving many questions about the scope of the problem unanswered, according to Congressional aides familiar with the meetings. Facebook this week sent staff including Associate General Counsel Molly Cutler and Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman to huddle with representatives from the Intelligence, Judiciary and Commerce committees in both chambers as it faces a firestorm over revelations that Trump-linked Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained information on some 50 million users of the site.\n\n-- Reply hazy, try again later: One aide noted that Facebook didn't have much to add when pressed about whether the researcher who allegedly sold data to Cambridge Analytica could have shared it with other parties. Aides also said that information about previous audits Facebook has done on its data practices seemed hazy, even as the company made promises to parse through how its apps have gathered information.\n\n-- About that consent decree: In its briefing with the Senate Commerce Committee, Cutler argued that Facebook did not violate a 2011 consent decree with the FTC, according to a source in the meeting. Under its 2011 settlement with the agency, Facebook agreed to get express permission and notify users before sharing their data with third parties. The FTC is now looking into whether Facebook has adhered to this agreement in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who attended the briefing, also raised a question about the company's timeline for notifying users who may have been affected by Cambridge Analytica's collection of data. Sherman said he couldn't provide specifics yet, adding that it was a technical challenge the company was still working through. Offices on both sides of the aisle seemed keen to hold a hearing on the recent revelations, the source said.\n\n-- Speaking of hearings, the jockeying for Zuck has begun: House Energy and Commerce leaders on Thursday announced their plans to formally invite Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in front of the panel, potentially kicking off a debate about which Congressional panel should have jurisdiction over such a hearing. Lawmakers across the Judiciary, Commerce and Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate have expressed an interest in a hearing that will put Zuckerberg in the hot seat, leading MT to wonder how the committees will duke it out. (House Intel Republicans on Thursday did vote, however, to shoot down a Democratic proposal for such a panel.)\n\n-- \"There's always jurisdictional debate, there's no committee that's invested as much time and effort into what's happening,\" Senate Intel's top Democrat Mark Warner told Ashley. Blumenthal, a member of the Senate's Commerce and Judiciary committees, has said he thinks both of those panels could provide the ideal forums for such testimony. Of course, the general counsels from Facebook, Twitter and Google did end up making the rounds at multiple committees when they hit the Hill last fall, so it's possible that Zuckerberg could potentially go that route if he committed to making an appearance.\n\n-- Facebook's take on the briefings: \"While our internal and external reviews are still ongoing, we appreciated the opportunity to explain what we know as well as to outline both the steps we have already taken and those we will take to address these challenges,\" a spokesman from the company said in a statement.\n\nOMNIBUS SPEEDS AHEAD -- The Senate in the wee hours of the morning passed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, H.R. 1625, that will keep the government funded through September 30, sending it to the president's desk. The omnibus contains several measures for techies to watch, including $600 million in dedicated spending for a rural broadband pilot program, FCC reauthorization and a bill that would govern law enforcement access of data that's stored overseas, called the CLOUD Act (S. 2383 (115)).\n\nCOFFMAN EYES APRIL FOR FINALIZING OPEN INTERNET BILL -- Don't take recent silence from Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) to mean inactivity. He told John on Thursday that his office remains at work drafting a bill to enshrine strong net neutrality protections, which he says should include a ban on paid prioritization. \"The goal is certainly to preserve the principles of net neutrality but to modernize it by creating a separate title, a new title for broadband,\" said Coffman, who bucked his fellow Republicans by opposing the FCC's December repeal of the Obama-era rules. He initially hoped to release a bill tentatively titled the 21st Century Internet Act by end of February and still predicts the introduction would be \"fairly soon,\" with a goal of releasing it next month after Congress' two-week recess.\n\n-- Internet service providers are at the table, Coffman added: \"We're listening to their concerns. Obviously they prefer simply the fact that it's been repealed. They'd rather have the status quo but the fact is, they're participating and listening to our concerns as well. I appreciate that. Whether we come to any kind of agreement, I can't speak to that.\"\n\nOSTP DIRECTOR LIMBO -- Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) are pressing the White House to nominate a director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a key advisory role that's remained vacant for more than a year. \"We believe it is critical to appoint a well-qualified individual, with a background in science or engineering, to this role as soon as possible,\" the lawmakers wrote in a letter on Thursday, adding that the OSTP director serves as a vital partner for Congress. A spokesman for OSTP told MT there were no updates on the position at this time. Recall that MT previously reported that White House Deputy CTO Michael Kratsios is currently the highest-ranking political appointee at the policy shop and helping run its operations on a day-to-day basis.\n\nGOOD FRIDAY MORNING and welcome to Morning Tech, where our brackets are just barely hanging on.

Suzanne Fenwick, vice president of content acquisition for Cox Communications, was called upon by the Justice Department to explain how the proposed merger would give Time Warner greater leverage in television licensing negotiations. Fenwick told the court Time Warner could offer a \"horribly ugly deal\" and shut off its programs if Cox doesn't consent. That could drive Cox customers to rival DirecTV, which AT&T owns, and subsequently drive Cox out of business, she warned. \"We are very concerned for what that will mean for us in our next negotiation,\" Fenwick said.\n\n-- Then, Daniel Petrocelli, the litigator representing the companies, was unleashed. In a series of rapid questions, Petrocelli asked Fenwick what \"homework\" she had done to substantiate her fears -- projections of subscribers who would walk or calculations of money her company would lose. Fenwick had none. \"You think you can just come in here and give your opinion\" without hard evidence to back it up, Petrocelli asked.\n\n-- The proceedings continue Monday with testimony from Warren Schlichting, group president of Dish Network-owned SlingTV, and John Martin, the chief executive and chairman of Turner.\n\nROSENWORCEL TAKES ON FCC SECURITY -- FCC security officials had surrounded a woman in the audience of the agency's meeting Thursday and were removing chairs from around her when Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel stopped her statement opposing the 5G infrastructure order to intervene. Rosenworcel asked security why they were removing someone who was behaving, and said, \"I would just ask that we not remove people from the room who are quietly listening.\" The woman had previously applauded during Commissioner Mignon Clyburn's dissent on the order, which excludes small cell wireless antennas from federal environmental and historic reviews. A man who voiced concerns about cell phone radiation was removed by security shortly afterward.\n\n-- The man was removed because he disrupted the vote by speaking loudly, an FCC spokesman said. The woman was told by security she wasn't allowed to stand up and block the view of other audience members, and she was approached by security again because she stood up repeatedly, he said.\n\nMATSUI PREPARING 'SPECTRUM NOW ACT' -- Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) is putting together legislation to ensure federal agencies can use cash from the 14-year-old Spectrum Relocation Fund to properly research what government-held spectrum might be freed up or shared with commercial entities. \"Current law limits how much of existing SRF funds can be used for this research and related activities,\" Matsui, co-chair of the Congressional Spectrum Caucus, said Thursday during an unrelated legislative hearing. \"This has created an unintended situation that could prevent agencies from accessing existing SRF funds and potentially prevent more spectrum entering the commercial marketplace.\" She said she's crafting legislation to address the problem. The Competitive Carriers Association backs the effort, Senior VP Tim Donovan told her during the hearing: \"That research is money well spent.\"\n\nCCIA ADDS LEGAL VOICE TO NET NEUTRALITY BATTLE -- The tech trade association, which counts Google and eBay among its members, filed a motion Thursday to intervene in support of the lawsuit challenging the FCC's repeal of its net neutrality regulations. Consumer groups, state attorneys general and tech companies including Etsy have filed suit against the repeal, with the Internet Association also seeking to support the challenge this week. \"CCIA looks forward to offering strong, substantive legal arguments about the importance of an open internet for the digital economy and America's global competitiveness,\" CCIA President Ed Black said in a statement. Industry trade groups NCTA, CTIA, and USTelecom are backing up the FCC in the legal battle.\n\nROBOCALLED OUT -- The FTC and FCC are huddling this morning for a policy forum aimed at addressing illegal robocalls, an issue that both agencies receive a high number of complaints about every year.

Watch the livestream beginning at 9:30 a.m., here.\n\nCARDENAS HAS CONCERNS ABOUT SINCLAIR-TRIBUNE -- Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), co-chair of the Multicultural Media Caucus, is voicing concerns about the Sinclair-Tribune merger, in a letter to DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim that's been signed by over 35 lawmakers including Reps. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) and Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.). \"We believe the merger should be rejected outright,\" they write. \"If the merger is approved, it will have substantial negative competitive consequences nationwide, resulting in higher consumer prices and lower quality and less local content.\" The lawmakers also question whether the divestiture of television stations is being handled properly, citing examples of potential Sinclair influence over stations even after they've been purportedly divested.\n\nSILICON VALLEY MUST-READS\n\n-- How IBM perpetuated age bias: \"As it scrambled to compete in the internet world, the once-dominant tech company cut thousands of U.S. workers, hitting its most senior employees hardest and flouting rules against age bias,\" ProPublica reports.\n\n-- Dropbox's opening day: \"Dropbox raised $750 million ahead of an opening day of trading on Friday in an IPO that will be closely watched across Silicon Valley to gauge the health of the tech economy,\" Recode reports.\n\n-- Huawei takes another hit: \"Best Buy Co. plans to stop selling phones in the U.S. made by Huawei Technologies Co., according to a person familiar with the matter, the latest blow for the Chinese wireless-equipment giant in the U.S.,\" The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nTRANSITIONS -- Parita Shah, previously chief of staff at the Millennium Challenge Corporation during the Obama Administration, heads to Pandora as its new head of public affairs on the government relations and public policy team.\n\nQUICK DOWNLOADS\n\nGoogle's EU privacy plans: \"Alphabet Inc.'s Google will ask web publishers to obtain consent on its behalf to gather personal information on European users and target ads at them using Google's systems, according to people familiar with the matter, part of a plan to keep up with data-privacy rules in Europe,\" The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nInstagram updates feed: \"Instagram isn't quite bringing back the chronological feed, but it will show more new posts and stop suddenly bumping you to the top of the feed while you're scrolling,\" TechCrunch reports.\n\nExperts react to self-driving accident: \"Video of the first self-driving car crash that killed a pedestrian suggests a 'catastrophic failure' by Uber's technology, according to experts in the field, who said the footage showed the autonomous system erring on one of its most basic functions,\" The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nTips, comments, suggestions?

                "body": "HEALTH IT GROUPS MOSTLY HAPPY WITH THE OMNIBUS: Experts tell POLITICO that the spending deal the Senate passed late last night is favorable for federal health IT groups, though funding for ONC and OCR remains flat.\n\nCongress rejected a White House budget proposal that slashed ONC's budget to $38 million for fiscal 2018, and instead allotted about $60 million to the agency. The White House had requested $33 million for OCR; the omnibus keeps it at its current level, $38.7 million.\n\nDespite discrepancies in actual dollar amounts, the omnibus mirrors the White House's recent commitments to health data and making patient records more easily accessible, HIMSS vice president for government relations Tom Leary tells POLITICO.\n\nCongressional staffers told him they were \"made aware\" of that effort when working on the bill, Leary said. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and CMS Administrator Seema Verma made an ambitious but detail-scarce promise to revamp health IT at HIMSS earlier this month.\n\nOnce Trump signs the budget, Leary said, HIMSS will make a push to tell lawmakers how important ONC is in coordinating standards and fulfilling the 21st Century Cures Act.\n\nMORE REACTIONS TO THE BILL:\n\n-- The Medical Informatics Association supports the full funding of ONC, CDC, AHRQ and the FDA, as well as the $3 billion boost to the NIH, according to a statement from the group. \"While there continues to be a tug-of-war between White House and Congressional funding and policy priorities, this budget will give HHS agencies and offices a few months of consistency,\" they said.\n\n-- Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) was especially encouraged by a $100 million boost for community behavioral health clinics, she said in a statement. Matsui recently unveiled an amendment to the Ryan Haight Act that would authorize mental health clinics to coordinate video consultations with remote providers so they can prescribe controlled substances to their patients.\n\n-- Research!America president and CEO Mary Woolley said the boost for NIH funding could lead to solutions to the opioid epidemic. Additional funding for AHRQ represents a \"sound investment to achieve higher quality, lower cost health care,\" she said.\n\n-- Rep. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., scored a victory with the inclusion of \"Jessie's Law,\" which would ensure that care providers have knowledge of patients' opioid abuse history if the patient decides to share that data.

Verma also suggested that the agency is pursuing changes related to Stark laws, which govern physician self-referral for Medicare and Medicaid patients. \"We've heard that that's a big barrier for providers when they're trying to do value-based payment arrangements,\" she said.\n\n-- Verma also plans to build on interoperability of electronic health records through the MyHealthEData initiative, which aims to help patients have better access to their own health records, that she announced last month. \"You will see the actual actions that we are taking around interoperability this year,\" she said.\n\nCALL FOR MACRA REFORM FALLS ON DEAF EARS: Policymakers have largely ignored calls from the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee to eliminate the new Merit-based Incentive Payment System and have instead focused on tweaking it, our colleague David Pittman reports.\n\nIn last month's two-year budget deal, lawmakers \"provided some significant flexibility\" in the program, according to Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J.\n\n\"Anytime MedPAC makes a recommendation, I think we should look at it seriously,\" Pallone, who is the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told David. \"But whether or not we follow up on it, at this point, I couldn't say.\"\n\n-- Dr. Tom Frieden @DrFrieden Encouraged to see Congress believes @CDC should continue their global health security work by providing $50M in FY18 with three-year spending authority.

The app doesn't have everything, though -- mobile users won't be able to access approval letters, for instance, unless they go to the web page. The app represents FDA's effort to \"bring information to consumers in more accessible formats,\" Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a release.\n\nCOMMENTS ON PRICE TRANSPARENCY EFFORT DUE TODAY: A bipartisan group of Senators has been gathering information from patients, providers and insurers about ways to increase price transparency, and comments are due today.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy has established a working group on price transparency that includes Sens. Todd Young, Chuck Grassley, Michael Bennet, Tom Carper and Claire McCaskill. The goal is to craft legislation that would make pricing data widely available.\n\nThe group has posed several tough questions to stakeholders, including who should be responsible for making health data available, and how to ensure that reporting requirements don't place an unnecessary burden on providers and payers.",

                "body": "BEAT DOWN: It's one of the most complex parts of the Republican tax overhaul -- the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, or BEAT. Our Brian Faler unpacks the provision this morning and finds that it's become \"a four-letter word\" for many in the tax world. \"Corporate tax departments, Wall Street, K Street, law school professors and others are now grappling with, and sometimes cursing, what some say is a brutally complicated new tax,\" Brian writes.\n\nIn a nutshell, the BEAT is intended to keep U.S. companies from fleeing to greener pastures now that we have a territorial tax system, which generally won't tax what multinationals earn abroad. The BEAT is a form of minimum tax that requires companies to pay at least 5 percent this year and 10 percent on taxable income next year. Companies must do multiple calculations to arrive at how much they owe, if anything. (See Brian's story for more details.)\n\n\"It is the most consequential and poorly thought out of all the major business tax provisions\" in the new tax law, Ed Kleinbard, former head of the Joint Committee on Taxation, told Brian. \"Any multinational is at risk of having a large BEAT liability because of its unpredictability.\"\n\nCorporations and tax experts hoping that the Treasury Department will clarify things with regulations will have quite a wait. \"International experts there have been focused on developing regulations regarding the law's one-time tax holiday on companies' overseas earnings because that has a more immediate effect on their taxes. Details on how the BEAT will be implemented are not expected until later this year.\"\n\nWELCOME TO THE (ALMOST) WEEKEND. I'm pinch hitting for Bernie today as he kicks back for a few days.

Not surprisingly, the happiest folks in town (and beyond the Beltway) are the companies that will be able to compete on a more level field with farm co-ops now that the \"grain glitch\" is fixed, and low-income housing advocates, who won a provision to make housing tax credits more attractive under the new tax law.\n\nBut some people are happy with what was left out. The Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, which advocates the separation of church and state, said it and likeminded groups \"can breathe a sigh of relief\" since the legislation didn't abolish the \"Johnson Amendment,\" which prohibits politicking by tax-exempt churches and other religious groups. President Donald Trump, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, many other Republican lawmakers and some other churches have been pushing to get rid of the amendment, named for Lyndon B. Johnson when he pushed it through as a senator. \"Some hoped they could slip a bad policy change into must-pass legislation, but advocates for keeping nonprofits nonpartisan spoke up and prevailed,\" Amanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee, said in a statement.\n\nSPEAKING OF WHICH: The Joint Committee on Taxation has tallied up the costs of the tax provisions in the omnibus, Brian reports. Grand total: $2.7 billion over 10 years. The low-income housing credit sweetener would cost $2.8 billion. But fixing the grain glitch would generate $108 million.\n\nNEW!

As if on cue, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) introduced legislation to put the brakes on the practice. Our Aaron Lorenzo reports: \"Baldwin's bill, titled the Reward Work Act, includes provisions that would prevent corporations from buying back their stock on the open market and would repeal a 1982 rule from the SEC that helps corporations avoid manipulation charges in open-market repurchases. Corporations would still be able to buy back their stock through tender offers under the legislation, but it would also subject a third of corporate boards to direct election by a company's employees.\"\n\nNow, that bill is going nowhere in a Republican Congress. But it's one more arrow in the Democrats' quiver to fire at the tax law in the run-up to the midterm elections, and another preview of what they would try to do to the tax law if they take over Congress.\n\nSPEAKING OF THE STOCK MARKET: Trump's decision to slap $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports rattled Wall Street, with the big three market indexes plunging Thursday. Brady and other GOP lawmakers were tempered in their response. In a statement, Brady said Trump was right to \"take a hardline against China's dishonest trade practices\" but added: \"Tariffs are taxes, so the next 30 days of input are crucial to make sure we don't punish American workers and families for China's misbehavior.\"\n\nAt the same time, the administration exempted the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea from steel and aluminum tariffs that take effect today.\n\nNO REST FOR THE WICKED: Less than a month to go for the tax filing season, and fraudsters are working overtime. The IRS says taxpayer info is being pilfered from the office computers of tax practitioners at a growing rate. Aaron reports that \"75 tax practitioner firms reported data thefts in January and February, a nearly 60 percent increase compared to the same type of crime over the same period last year.\" Watch out for the \"New Client\" scam, where impostors try to insert malware on computers by posing as customers in emails that include infected attachments.\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nTHAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG: Congress' top tax writers are not amused by the European Union's newly introduced tax on digital revenues, which would hit some 150 companies, half of them American. \"It's a revenue grab, pure and simple,\" Brady told Aaron. Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch chimed in: \"Countries eager to raise more revenue ought to pursue the taxation of items or services that have a clear and concise definition within today's global economy,\" he said. \"To attempt to tax items with a so-called 'digital presence' or another questionable definition is counterproductive and should be further vetted before it is seriously pursued.\"\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nOPPORTUNITY KNOCKS: Local officials are bullish on the new Opportunity Zones included in the GOP tax law, which will use tax incentives to lure investments to low-income urban and rural areas. This week, governors selected the census tracts that they want to be part of the zones in their states. There are plenty of skeptics who say that the zones will end up doing no more to help struggling areas than similar programs have in the past. But the Urban Institute's Brett Theodos thinks the initiative \"could become the nation's largest economic development 'program'\" if done right. Theodos writes in Urban Wire that the group has prepared a \"dataset\" ranking eligible tracts based on commercial, multifamily, single-family and small business lending, along with a gauge of whether they've had a lot of socioeconomic change. \"Decisionmakers can use our data to determine which areas are undergoing natural change or gentrification (where Opportunity Zone distinctions would likely be unnecessary), as opposed to areas in more need of a tax incentive to boost investment,\" Theodos writes.\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker gives Trump two Pinocchios for his claim that California has the nation's highest taxes.\n\nNederland, Colo., hosts an annual Frozen Dead Guy Days festival to honor Bredo Morstøl, a 110-plus-year-old cryogenically frozen resident of the town.

                "body": "With help from Benjamin Wermund, Caitlin Emma and Mel Leonor\n\nBREAKING ON THE HILL: The Senate early Friday on a 65-32 vote cleared a sweeping $1.3 trillion fiscal 2018 spending bill, averting a government shutdown. The legislation, H.R. 1625 (115), comes more than six months into the current fiscal year, and extends funding through Sept. 30. President Donald Trump has said he will sign it into law.\n\nOMNIBUS INCLUDES COMPROMISE 'FIX' FOR PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS: Student loan borrowers working in public service jobs who may lose out on federal loan forgiveness because they selected the wrong repayment plan will get a second chance to get their debt canceled under the omnibus government spending bill. The funding measure includes a provision creating a limited, one-time-only expansion of the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\n-- The problem: Federal law requires borrowers to make 10 years' of monthly payments under a qualified repayment plan before having the remaining balance of their debt forgiven. But several reports surfaced over the past year of borrowers unknowingly selecting a non-qualifying repayment plan and being rejected for loan forgiveness as a result. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year issued a report blaming \"student loan servicing practices\" in some cases for putting borrowers in a repayment plan that didn't count toward forgiveness.\n\n-- The omnibus creates a new one-time $350 million fund that's meant to make it easier for borrowers to access loan forgiveness under the program. The fund will cover the government's cost of canceling the loans of borrowers who otherwise would qualify for public service loan forgiveness had they not selected a non-qualifying repayment plan.\n\n-- But the new program comes with some limitations: First, the loan forgiveness will be offered on a first-come, first-serve basis until the fund runs out. And some borrowers who selected the \"wrong\" repayment plan to qualify for loan forgiveness still wouldn't be eligible. The Education Department, under the bill, would compare a borrower's most recent monthly payment (and the monthly payment one year prior) to what they would have paid under the \"correct\" plan. Borrowers that would have been required to pay more won't qualify for the loan forgiveness.\n\n-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who along with other Democrats had pushed for a more sweeping expansion of eligibility for the program, on Thursday praised the limited reprieve in the omnibus. \"I'm very glad that, for the first time, we got some money to help public servants unfairly trapped under a mountain of debt -- but this fight isn't over,\" Warren said in a statement. \"We need a permanent fix that ensures every single teacher, nurse, police officer, and firefighter gets the student loan forgiveness that we promised them and that they earned.\"\n\n-- The limited expansion of public service loan forgiveness in the bipartisan bill comes even as some Republicans have sought to kill the program, arguing that it isn't well-targeted or an effective use of taxpayer dollars. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating the program entirely, as does the House GOP bill rewriting the Higher Education Act.\n\n-- But Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would now be forced to take steps to publicize the program under the omnibus appropriations bill. The legislation sets aside $2.3 million for the Education Department \"to conduct outreach to borrowers\" about the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. It includes a requirement that the secretary \"shall\" tell all federal student loan borrowers about the requirements of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and make it easier for all borrowers to enroll in it.\n\nGOOD FRIDAY MORNING AND WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION.

An explanatory document accompanying the omnibus says, \"There is concern that seclusion and restraint issues continue to be chronically underreported.\" The omnibus instructs the Government Accountability Office to look at how schools can improve their data collection and avoid restraint and seclusion, which advocates say can cause trauma and physical harm and should only be used if a child truly poses physical harm to themselves or others.\n\n-- Advocates for students with disabilities are praising the study. \"Anything we can do to illuminate the extent these dangerous practices are imposed on students in our schools is welcome and much needed,\" said Denise Marshall, executive director of the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates.\n\nD.C. AREA UNIVERSITIES BACK MARCH AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE: The leaders of D.C.'s 14 area universities signed a letter supporting this weekend's march and ran it as an ad in today's Washington Post. \"No student, regardless of race, income, or zip code, should live in fear of gun violence. We call for our elected leaders to act now,\" the letter says. \"We recognize that the young people who are marching this weekend may be further developing their talents at our institutions in the coming years. We wish you a safe, productive visit to our region, we stand with you, and thank you for making your voices heard.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE DISCUSSES CAMPUS 'CRISES': According to Kellyanne Conway, college campuses currently face two crises: Opioids and free speech. The counselor to the president moderated a panel with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and a Department of Justice spokeswoman about the two subjects at a White House millennials event Thursday. Conway referred to them as \"crises -- plural -- on campuses.\"\n\n-- But the point was undercut by the president himself, who spoke just before the panel and seemed to downplay any crisis of speech on college campuses that conservatives often lament. \"I think it's highly overblown,\" Trump said when asked for advice for young conservatives on campuses who feel like they're being silenced by administrators.\n\n-- Trump's full response: \"I think the numbers are actually much different than people think. I think we have a lot of support. If they have one campus or two campuses -- that we know what they are -- it gets all the publicity. We have campuses where you have the vast majority of people that are perhaps like many of the people in this room -- you could call it conservative, you call it whatever you want, but they're people that want free speech. If you look at what's going on with free speech with the super left, with antifa with all of these characters -- I tell you what, they get a lot of publicity, but you go to the real campuses and you go all over the country, you go out to the Middle West, you go out even to the coast in many cases, we have tremendous support. I would say we have majority support. I think it's highly overblown, highly overblown.\"\n\n-- The president's comments seem to counter his administration's stance that too many colleges are suppressing speech. Trump himself said as much on the campaign trail and seemed to threaten the University of California-Berkeley on Twitter last year. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said \"we have too much suppression of free and open speech on college campuses today\" and his Justice Department has sided in court with conservative student groups in free speech cases. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has urged lawmakers to use the \"bully pulpit\" to protect free speech on campus, saying \"we have seen, in far too many cases, an intolerance toward listening to and at least hearing from others who have different perspectives than ours.\"\n\n-- Of note: A recent survey of college students by Gallup and the Knight Foundation found that 61 percent of students believe that their campus environment prevents people from speaking their mind, compared with 54 percent of students last year. Nearly 70 percent of students, however, believe that conservatives are able to openly and freely express their views, while 92 percent believe that liberals and other campus groups are able to do so, the survey found.\n\n-- As for opioids, Azar said \"the millennial generation is getting hit very hard\" and noted that \"among ages 25 to 34, drug overdose is the No. 1 cause of death from injury.\" He warned against getting hooked on prescription medication: \"If you get a 90-count prescription for your wisdom teeth and you use two of them, don't keep 88 of them for a rainy day.\" And he said \"the country has not yet waken up to this scourge of fentanyl as the superpower opioid that it is,\" warning that marijuana and other drugs can be laced with it.\n\n-- Are those really the top crises facing college students? Some were skeptical. \"Opioids? Free speech? Kellyanne has no clue,\" Trinity Washington University President Pat McGuire wrote on Twitter. \"I just was with a group of students and their main concerns are debt load, food security, housing, transportation, child care....\"\n\nALSO FROM THE WHITE HOUSE'S MILLENNIAL EVENT: Trump took another swipe at community colleges, saying again that he prefers the term \"vocational\": \"We need vocational schools. Now they call them a lot of times community colleges - I don't think it's an accurate definition.\" It's becoming a recurring talking point for the president, who last month said that \"Vocational is a much better word in a lot of cases than community college.\"\n\n-- Ivanka Trump praised a funding boost for an early education grant program included in the omnibus. She called the proposed doubling of funding for Child Care and Development Block grants a \"vast expansion\" that would help ensure young children receive care in an enriching environment. The grant program awards funding to states to expand child care programs. \"We spend so much as a country trying to remediate, and trying to get a student on the right track when they've fallen behind ... and we don't focus nearly enough on that really critical period between ages 0 to 5.\" Congress also gave a $610 million boost to Head Start and preserved funding for the Preschool Development Grants program, which the Trump administration proposed to ax in its budget request.\n\n-- Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta touted the administration's push to boost apprenticeships and said four-year colleges need to do a better job of preparing students for the workforce. \"Here's the question: Are universities teaching the skills that are being demanded by the current workforce? Are universities serving the students well?\" he said. \"Unfortunately that emphasis on preparing individuals for family sustaining jobs is not out there.\"\n\n-- Acosta also talked about \"excessive\" occupational licensing, arguing that state-to-state licensing requirements make it difficult for teachers to move. \"We talk about, 'We need more teachers.' So why are we making it so difficult for teachers to move?\" Acosta said. \"We've gotta reform this.\"\n\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\n-- The advocacy organizations Rights4Girls and the Georgetown Juvenile Justice Initiative are out with a new report detailing the overrepresentation of African American girls in D.C.'s juvenile justice system.\n\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS\n\n-- Brigid Ahern has been tapped as president and CEO of the nonprofit Turnaround for Children, effective in June.\n\nSYLLABUS\n\n-- Kansas lawmakers advance first part of school funding fix: The Associated Press.\n\n-- Michigan House OKs bill allowing districts to describe charter schools as \"public schools\" on ballots: The Associated Press.\n\n-- Student shot at Maryland school will be taken off life support, family says: The New York Times.",

                "body": "With help from Alex Guillén, Emily Holden and Annie Snider\n\nOMNI-SURE-DONE: Shortly after midnight, the Senate cleared by a 65 to 32 vote a massive $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill largely devoid of environmental policy riders and that rejected the deep cuts for energy programs sought by the Trump administration. A plot twist emerged late Thursday when it emerged an irate Sen. Jim Risch was holding up the bill over a provision renaming the White Clouds Wilderness in Idaho after a political rival, former governor and Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus. Turns out Rep. Mike Simpson slipped the language changing the name of wilderness area into the omnibus. Senate leadership eventually passed language addressing Risch's issue, though the House isn't expected to act on it before the bill becomes law. More on the Senate hiccups here.\n\nOne thing that does appear clear is that after relentlessly demanding deep cuts to EPA's staffing and funding over the past decade, Republicans seem increasingly concerned that further hacks at the agency could hit popular grants or cleanup programs, your ME host and Emily Holden report. The omnibus H.R. 1625 (115) keeps EPA spending levels about the same as fiscal 2017, while resisting the White House's calls to trim the agency by around a third. \"It suggests we know that they have a role to do and, as long as they are performing that job with the people they have, then that probably starts justifying the size,\" senior Energy and Commerce Republican John Shimkus told ME. Jeff Holmstead, who was assistant administrator of EPA's air office under George W. Bush, said both Republicans and Democrats understand that while some of EPA's work is controversial, \"a lot of it is just basic good government\" services.\n\nIt's not a universal position among GOPers. \"Whether it's a sweet spot or not, I don't know,\" Rep. Mike Simpson, a senior EPA Appropriator, told ME. Rep. Ken Calvert, who oversees the agency funding on the Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers have worked with Administrator Scott Pruitt to give him the resources to run the agency. \"He's been making efficiencies within the department,\" Calvert said. \"I think there's still some efficiencies to create.\"\n\nDemocrats spin things differently. Some see it as recognition that Republicans don't want to gut the agency. \"Underneath a lot of the invective, there's a lot of recognition by Republican colleagues that the work EPA and our science community do is very valuable and they would like to continue to support it,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told ME. Others said it was Democrats using their leverage against a divided Republican party. \"The Republican caucus is not able to pass a spending bill with their own votes so they need Democratic votes. And when they need Democratic votes we get to ask for things like protecting EPA funding,\" Rep. Ted Lieu said.\n\nKey stat: EPA's workforce has dropped to 14,056, down 1,400 from when President Donald Trump took office and well below 17,417 at the beginning of the decade, according to the agency.\n\nSpeaking of staffing, Pruitt took to Portland-based KXL radio Thursday to boast EPA staffing has fallen to Reagan-era levels. He said coverage of his international first-class flights has been \"very gratuitous with respect to certain media,\" and claimed some outlets don't like that EPA is rolling back regulations and shrinking its footprint. \"We're getting more done with less,\" he said. He also said he will issue a memo \"pretty soon\" to require any scientific studies the agency uses must disclose all their data, following up on his announcement of the new policy earlier this week.\n\nIS THIS THING ON?

While the exact timing of floor consideration remains unclear, the move likely tees up a vote on Wheeler's selection in the coming weeks.\n\nSTRIKING BACK: China plans to hit back on Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs with 15 percent duties on products including U.S. exports of modified ethanol and seamless steel pipes, Pro Trade's Adam Behsudi reports, citing a Chinese Ministry of Commerce release. The first stage of tariffs would include a 15 percent tariff on steel oil and gas pipeline and drill pipe coming from the U.S., according to an informal translation of the document. China is the third-largest market of U.S. pipe steel, according to a December 2017 report from the International Trade Administration. The plan splits tariffs on 128 products in two groups, 120 of which would see the 15 percent duty.\n\nPERRY DEFENDS SAUDI NUCLEAR TALKS: Failure by the U.S. to engage in talks with Saudi Arabia about providing them with nuclear reactors means the job will likely go to countries without requirements the technology not be used to build nuclear weapons, Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Thursday. \"Either Russia or China is going to be a partner in building civil nuclear capability in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, or the United States [is],\" Perry said at the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"I think it's important for us to negotiate in a really good and a powerful way, but recognizing that the alternative of who they're going to be doing business with is of great concern to me.\" That came after Sen. Jack Reed, ranking member of the panel, warned he would oppose any agreement without nonproliferation guarantees \"and I think many others would to.\"\n\nAgrees Russian cyber attacks an 'act of war': Perry agreed under questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal that repeated Russian efforts to penetrate the electric grid constituted \"an act of war.\" He declined to say publicly what efforts the U.S. had done in response but said he had taken \"every effort to protect the electrical grid from those kinds of attacks.\"\n\n** A message from Chevron: Chevron and local partners are helping to provide DOERS with the hands-on technical training needed for today's jobs in the manufacturing and energy industries.

Her nomination had been held by Senate EPW Chairman John Barrasso over DOE's practice of selling excess government-controlled uranium onto the market, which the Wyoming Republican said was hurting the domestic uranium sector.\n\nMARKET MOVER: PJM Interconnect CEO Andy Ott isn't concerned about the recent attacks on markets -- such as Perry's rebuffed NOPR -- and he thinks markets like his can easily integrate energy storage. After all, PJM, which keeps the lights on in the nation's capital and 13 Mid-Atlantic and Rust Belt states, already has demand response built into its market. \"It's the same stuff. Folks out West haven't seen demand response because they don't have organized markets. I'm trying to change that, of course, but the point is the phenomena we've already seen happen, it's just [about] what technology is the best, most competitive way to do it.\"\n\nGo West. Mr. Ott: PJM is working with western reliability manager Peak Reliabiity to explore a partnership in the Western states. He said he was approached by western utilities and Peak and he thinks there's a \"niche\" for PJM. \"Frankly the California governance issue where the [Energy Imbalance Market] is viewed by many of the neighboring regions as [being designed] and built to benefit California consumers as opposed to everybody. And what we're saying is we can have a broad stakeholder process to say let's develop a slate of rules that work for all the customers and neighboring regions.\" Read Pro's Eric Wolff's interview with Ott here.\n\nRENEWABLES FEAR A BEAT-DOWN: A new levy on multinational corporations included in the GOP's tax revamp -- known as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, or BEAT -- is giving much of the tax world fits, including those who fund renewable energy projects and who aren't sure if they'll get hit by it, Pro Tax's Brian Faler reports. Companies must do some complicated calculations to see if they'll get hit by the BEAT and there's widespread confusion about how the specifics will work. \"The BEAT is a disaster,\" Charles MacFarlane, head of Chevron's tax department said at a tax conference last month.\n\nHAPPENING TODAY: Pruitt joins Vice President Mike Pence for an event promoting the recently enacted tax package with the pro-Trump outside group America First Policies today at 3:30 p.m. in Atlanta.

Pruitt appointed 11 new members on Thursday to the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals, joining the 18 members appointed in January 2017 who provide independent advice on chemicals' risk and approaches to regulation. Among the new appointees: a scientist from Noble Energy, Inc., the Army's top toxicologist and a researcher from the Silent Spring Institute that focuses on links between chemicals and breast cancer. The agency said it was adding the new members \"to be consistent with statutory requirements\" that require the committee have representatives who offer diverse perspectives.\n\nTHEY WANT TO BREAK FREE: With Sen. Dean Heller scoring a victory by keeping Yucca Mountain nuclear repository funding out of the omnibus, Rep. Shimkus is urging the Nevada Republican to drop his hold on GOP Nuclear Regulatory Commission nominee Annie Caputo. \"In all reality, Dean Heller has got a win and that should be enough to help him start moving these nominees,\" Shimkus said. \"We got to have an operating NRC. We can't not have that.\"\n\nSPEAKING OF FIRE: House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop isn't thrilled with omnibus provisions fundamentally altering how the federal government funds fighting forest fires. \"I'm extremely disappointed in what was in there and it does not solve the problem,\" he told ME. Bishop argued many important reforms were left out of the final package due to objections from East Coast Senate Democrats. \"I don't blame Western Democrat senators. [Senate Energy ranking member Maria] Cantwell tried but was not heard,\" Bishop said. \"We need a forest fire in [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's] damn tunnel in New Jersey so he understands what this issue is.\"\n\nThat criticism comes despite the praise of conservation and forestry groups, as well as a number of Western lawmakers. \"Common sense has finally prevailed when it comes to how the Forest Service pays to fight record-breaking forest fires that devastate homes and communities in Oregon and the West,\" Sen. Ron Wyden said in a statement.\n\nJUDGES TO WEIGH FEDERAL COAL LEASING PROGRAM'S CLIMATE IMPACT: The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals this morning will take up an environmentalist lawsuit seeking to force the Interior Department to re-do the environmental analysis for its decades-old coal leasing program to consider climate change. Not updating the \"stale\" 1979 review that guides Interior's broad process in order to incorporate greenhouse gas emissions violates the National Environmental Policy Act, the green groups argue. Interior, echoing a lower court's favorable ruling from 2015, says the leasing program's NEPA review is not a new and final agency action that can be challenged in court. Each individual leasing decision is subject to NEPA on its own anyway, including climate impacts, the agency added. The hearing is 9:30 a.m. at the Prettyman Courthouse, before Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Sri Srinivasan and Harry T. Edwards.\n\nCORTEZ MASTO PRESSES PRUITT ON VEGAS LAB CLOSURE: Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto wants Pruitt to explain EPA's recent move to completely shut down operations at its Las Vegas laboratory. The move sent dozens of EPA workers and contractors, some of whom are adjuncts at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, scrambling, she wrote in a letter on Thursday. \"As you are well aware, several of my constituents now have many life-changing decisions to make in a short timeframe that not only effects them, but their families, other professional commitments, as well as the outcome of their ongoing research efforts,\" Cortez Masto wrote.\n\nLAWSUIT WATCH -- WAR OF ROSE (BOWL): Public Citizen, on behalf of an investigative journalist, filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act on Thursday seeking records of Pruitt's travel and attendance at the 2018 Rose Bowl.

                "body": "OIG: EMANUEL VIOLATED ETHICS PLEDGE: NLRB member William Emanuel violated President Donald Trump's ethics pledge when he participated in a December case involving a client of his former law firm, according to an Office of Inspector General report obtained by POLITICO. The 11-page report by IG David Berry chastised Emanuel for carelessness but acquitted the former management-side attorney of the most serious charge: lying to Congress or the OIG about whether he was aware of a possible conflict of interest.\n\nThe case at issue, December's Hy-Brand Industrial Contractors, narrowed the circumstances under which businesses can be held liable for violations committed by franchisees and contractors. Emanuel, appointed by Trump, was a key vote in the case, which overturned Browning-Ferris, an Obama-era decision that broadened the definition of \"joint employment,\" making it easier to sue. In response to a written set of questions prior to his confirmation, Emanuel noted that his former law firm had been involved in Browning-Ferris. But in January, in response to questions from Democratic members of Congress, Emanuel said he didn't know that the firm had been involved in Browning-Ferris.\n\nIn reviewing Emanuel's email traffic, the IG concluded that Emanuel demonstrated a \"genuine lack of recall\" about his firm's connection to Browning-Ferris, even though he'd earlier informed Congress of it. Even so, the IG found that Emanuel clearly violated Trump's ethics pledge, which requires a two-year cooling off period for administration appointees. \"The pledge obligates the subject to commit himself to not participate in particular matters involving the parties that are represented by Littler Mendelson,\" the report says. \"Because of that commitment, the subject is not afforded the privilege to ignore or forget in what cases Littler Mendelson represents parties.\" An earlier IG report concluded that Emanuel should have recused himself from the decision to overturn Browning-Ferris and found \"a serious and flagrant problem and/or deficiency\" in the way the board handled conflicts of interest.\n\nIn response to the findings, House Education and the Workforce ranking member Bobby Scott (D-Va.) re-upped a call for hearing on the matter, saying in a statement late Thursday that Emanuel \"has undermined the public's confidence in the Board's ability to protect workers' rights in an impartial manner.\" Read the full report here, and an earlier article by ProPublica on Emanuel here.\n\nGOOD MORNING!

Follow us on Twitter at @tedhesson, @AndrewBHanna, @IanKullgren and @TimothyNoah1.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT FOR 'DREAMERS'?: The Senate approved a $1.3 trillion spending bill early this morning, H.R. 1625 (115), that devotes $1.6 billion to border security, including 95 miles of new and replacement fence and barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. In addition, the legislation increases DHS funding levels by 13 percent compared with the enacted levels a year earlier, with similar spikes at the enforcement agencies.\n\nWhat's not in the bill is any sort of codification of the DACA program, which offers work permits to young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. Both parties say they want to write DACA into law, but one (the GOP) demands steep concessions in return while the other (the Democrats) has grown weary of haggling.\n\n\"Trump himself made a last-minute push for a DACA deal in recent days,\" writes Seung Min Kim in the Washington Post. \"The White House pitched $25 billion in border wall funding and three years of protections for current DACA permit holders, an estimated 690,000 young immigrants who had enrolled in the nearly six-year-old program. But Democrats rebuffed the offer, declining to agree to any temporary extension of DACA permits for only the current program enrollees. Democratic leadership countered with a plan to pair the $25 billion in border wall cash and a pathway to citizenship for a broader dreamer population of about 1.8 million immigrants. The administration rejected that approach, too. Trump was willing to accept a pathway to citizenship for the expansive pool of dreamers if he secured other significant immigration changes, not solely for the wall, one senior White House official said.\" More from the Post's Kim here.\n\nWhen President Trump announced in September that he would phase out the program, he carved out a six-month window to find a legislative solution. A 9th Circuit ruling in January largely mooted the March 5 deadline by ordering the Trump administration to restart DACA renewals, but there was still some lingering hope that Congress would codify DACA in the omnibus spending bill sent to Trump's desk early Friday morning -- likely the last piece of major legislation Trump will sign before the midterm elections. Now that hope is dashed, leaving DACA's fate in the hands of the courts. Oral arguments in the 9th Circuit case will take place in May. Separately, a Brooklyn-based judge also blocked the DACA rescission in February, prompting an administration appeal to the 2nd Circuit.\n\n\"There's just a lot of different permutations about how the litigation efforts could unfold,\" says Marshall Fitz, managing director at the Emerson Collective. If the appeals courts allowed DACA termination to move forward, that could \"create a new sense of urgency,\" he said. But would the Trump administration dare terminate DACA? That's hard to calculate without knowing how DACA will play in the midterms. DACA could play a role in House districts with a significant number of immigrant and Latino voters. But Senate Democrats in Trump Country may be wary of embracing undocumented immigrants of any kind. \"I think it's going to be very localized and contextualized,\" Fitz said. Even so, Trump's September decision to terminate the program, Fitz said, could be used to mobilize progressive voters by fleshing out the theme that Trump \"has systematically gone after and attempted to marginalize immigrants and refugees.\" Read more about the Senate omnibus vote from POLITICO here.\n\nNLRB MOVES TO CLOSE HEALTH UNIT: The NLRB will dismantle its internal health service for employees in an effort to cut costs, the agency's union told Morning Shift. The health unit, housed at the national headquarters in Washington, D.C., is set to close at the end of March pending ongoing negotiations. The union representing NLRB employees called it an \"unlawful, unilateral and premature\" move. \"Our nurse has saved lives by diagnosing people and sending them by ambulance to the hospital when they wouldn't otherwise have gone,\" said NLRB Professional Association President Karen Cook. The agency did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nUNIONS PRAISE CHINA TARIFFS: The AFL-CIO lauded Trump's threat to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, a global shakeup that led the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall more than 700 points on Thursday. The president said the tariffs were a response to China's improper efforts to obtain U.S. technology and would \"make us a much stronger, much richer nation.\"\n\nTrump found an ally in AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who said \"[the] tariffs will put needed pressure on China to play fair.\" Teamsters President James Hoffa also applauded the move and urged the president to \"fulfill his campaign promise\" to label China a currency manipulator. Read more about the tariffs from POLITICO's Adam Behsudi here and the stock market reaction here.\n\nBIDEN SIDES WITH ACOSTA AND IVANKA TRUMP: Occupational licensing reform inspired some rare bipartisan talk Thursday, with former Vice President Joe Biden, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, and first daughter Ivanka Trump all offering their thoughts at separate events. Biden -- speaking at a workforce development event at the Newseum -- criticized the \"impediments we put in place\" with too much licensing, especially for veterans trying to reenter the workforce. A little further up Pennsylvania Avenue, Acosta told a gathering at the White House that over-licensing stifles innovation. He used the example of a town that began licensing dog walkers in response to a new smartphone app. \"Every time you see a new idea, there is a barrier to change,\" he said. Ivanka Trump backed up Acosta at the White House event. \"It really is remarkable how insane it's become,\" she said. \"It is disproportionately hurting those who can least afford it an pretty much put a ceiling on upward mobility.\" Ivanka also talked about the burden of licensing on military spouses (more than 90 percent of whom are women) if they need to move from place to place.\n\nDon't get too excited, though. The Obama administration made no secret of its opposition to occupational licensing that it deemed excessive. And since occupational licenses are regulated at the state and local level, there's not much opportunity for meaningful bipartisan legislation on the problem.\n\nDOES BLS NEED A RAISE?: Near-flat funding levels at the Bureau of Labor Statistics over the past decade have put the agency \"on the path to irrelevance and operational failure,\" Erica Groshen, a former commissioner during the Obama administration, told Morning Shift. The omnibus spending bill would increase BLS funding by $4 million, but Groshen said that's far from sufficient. \"If you had adjusted the 2009 budget for inflation... in 2019, you'd be getting something like $715 million,\" she said. Instead, the omnibus bill designates only $612 million.\n\nThe federal government relies on BLS for employment data, IRS calculations, and the inflation index. \"If BLS makes one tenth of a percentage point mistake in the [Consumer Price Index], the federal government is going to overpay or underpay beneficiaries by a billion dollars,\" Groshen said. The bureau has cut programs and left vacancies open longer to economize, but weak funding puts the future of the agency in jeopardy, Groshen said, delaying IT modernization and other initiatives.\n\nREPORT: IBM TARGETED OLDER WORKERS: IBM \"eliminated more than 20,000 American employees ages 40 and over\" in the past five years, according to an estimate from ProPublica's Peter Gosselin and Ariana Tobin -- \"about 60 percent of its estimated total U.S. job cuts during those years.\" Gosselin's and Tobin's investigation probes IBM's strategy to \"correct seniority mix\" to better compete with other tech companies.\n\n\"In making these cuts, IBM has flouted or outflanked U.S. laws and regulations intended to protect later-career workers from age discrimination, according to a ProPublica review of internal company documents, legal filings and public records, as well as information provided via interviews and questionnaires filled out by more than 1,000 former IBM employees,\" the outlet reports. One finding: Big Blue \"encouraged employees targeted for layoff to apply for other IBM positions, while quietly advising managers not to hire them and requiring many of the workers to train their replacements.\" More here.\n\nTRUMP GOLF COURSE SEEKS GUEST WORKERS: \"The Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, New York, is once again seeking permission to bring in foreign workers to serve as waiters, waitresses and cooks,\" BuzzFeed News reports, citing petitions posted on the Labor Department website this week. The club wants to hire 10 waiters and four cooks through the H-2B visa program, which is available to businesses seeking seasonal, non-agricultural workers.\n\n\"The fancy private club is located just 35 miles from New York City and its vast labor market,\" BuzzFeed News writes. \"The petition to the Labor department effectively attests that there are no qualified American workers who want the jobs. The cooking jobs pay $14.36 an hour. The serving jobs pay $15.20 an hour. Both jobs are eligible for overtime.\"\n\nTrump-owned or -branded businesses have hired more than 400 guest workers since he started his presidential campaign, according to BuzzFeed. The H-2B visa program typically offers 66,000 visas annually, but the spending bill approved by the Senate this morning would renew a provision that allows the DHS secretary to approximately double the number of available visas this fiscal year. Read more from BuzzFeed here.\n\nEOIR GETS A BUMP: The spending bill would increase funding for the federal immigration courts by 15 percent over enacted levels the previous year -- a nod to the Trump administration's attempt to reduce a massive case backlog. The money would pay for 100 new immigration judge \"teams,\" but it's not clear how many judges are in that tally (the administration asked for 75 judges and associated positions in its fiscal year 2018 budget request). The immigration court backlog stands at nearly 668,000 cases, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The Senate Appropriations Committee summarized the spending bill's funding for the Executive Office for Immigration Review here.\n\nCALLS FOR INVESTIGATION OVER ICE RESIGNATION: A dozen Senate Democrats sent a letter Thursday to the DHS Office of Inspector General that requests an investigation into the resignation of James Schwab, a spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in California. Schwab told the San Francisco Chronicle that he quit earlier this month because he \"didn't want to perpetuate misleading facts.\" In particular, he said he was frustrated that administration officials said roughly 800 undocumented immigrants escaped arrest because Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf publicized an ICE operation before it could take place.\n\nSens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) spearheaded the call for a DHS watchdog investigation. \"We have serious concerns that Trump administration officials are misrepresenting the facts and statistics surrounding this enforcement action for political purposes,\" they wrote. Read the letter here.\n\nDEATH BY A THOUSAND EMAILS: A new book by Stanford professor Jeffrey Pfeffer argues that workplace stress is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, and also increases healthcare costs. The book, \"Dying for a Paycheck,\" centers on \"a 2015 paper that said more than 120,000 deaths a year and roughly 5 to 8 percent of annual health care costs may be attributable to how U.S. companies manage their workforces,\" Jena McGregor writes in the Washington Post.\n\n\"A core argument: Instead of adding wellness programs or yoga classes,\" the Post reports, \"companies need to focus more on the management practices that lead to substantial health issues, such as layoffs, job insecurity, toxic cultures and long hours -- not only for their own bottom lines but so they don't offload those costs to broader society.\" Read more from the Post here and find the book here.\n\nMICHAELS ON DUPONT INCIDENT: David Michaels, Obama's OSHA administrator, published an article earlier this week in Harvard Business Review in which he recalled the failure of DuPont to make its facilities safer. \"I watched with concern as the company, under pressure from activist shareholders to increase profits, cut costs and let its safety program deteriorate,\" he writes. \"Needed repairs and upgrades were delayed, worker training postponed, and risk assessments overlooked. The culmination was an incident at an insecticide plant in LaPorte, Texas, where, as a result of a basic process safety management failure, an extremely toxic chemical -- methyl mercaptan -- was released and two workers were overcome. With inadequate equipment, others rushed in to save their colleagues. In all, four workers were killed.\" More here.\n\nUSCIS TESTS NEW WEBPAGE: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Thursday launched a redesigned webpage to track processing times for various forms. The reworked tool \"displays the data for all forms in an easier-to-read format and also tests a new way of collecting data and calculating the processing times for some forms,\" according to USCIS.

                "body": "With help from Adam Behsudi and Sabrina Rodriguez\n\nCHINA PUTS U.S. STEEL, PORK AND WINE IN THE CROSSHAIRS: Beijing is firing back against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs by considering raising duties on $3 billion worth of U.S. exports ranging from steel to pork. The action against 128 types of U.S. products is just the first response from the Asian economic giant. Still to come is how Beijing responds to the even bigger and China-focused Section 301 action under which the Trump administration is expected to slap tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\nThe U.S. imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in the name of protecting national security. China says it doesn't buy that argument and is treating the U.S. tariffs as a safeguard action. That gives Beijing the leeway to follow a process sanctioned by World Trade Organization rules that allows a country, after a period of consultation, to seek compensation for another country's trade restrictions. It also gives China the ability to claim it is staying within the bounds of international rules.\n\nChina's \"compensation\" list includes 128 products split among two groups. The first group of exports, worth nearly $1 billion, includes 120 tariff lines covering fresh fruit, dried fruits and nuts, wine, modified ethanol, American ginseng and seamless steel pipes, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a media release. Those products will face a 15 percent tariff.\n\nChina is considering a 25 percent tariff on a second group of eight different product categories, valued at nearly $2 billion total, covering pork, recycled aluminum and other items, according to an informal translation of the ministry's statement.\n\nThe National Pork Producers Council was quick to raise the alarm after the news broke. \"We sell a lot of pork to China, so higher tariffs on our exports going there will harm our producers and undermine the rural economy,\" NPPC President Jim Heimerl said in a statement. More from Pro Trade's Adam Behsudi here.\n\nIT'S FRIDAY, MARCH 23! Welcome to Morning Trade. Guess what Sen. Orrin Hatch got for his birthday yesterday? Tariffs on Chinese technology goods! Not really, but his Senate Finance Committee colleagues did take time out from yesterday's hearing to sing \"Happy Birthday,\" much to Hatch's embarrassment. The Utah Republican explained he doesn't really celebrate birthdays. \"It's a crazy psychological thing,\" he said. Hey, we can relate. Any trade news?

With farm incomes declining, exports help keep farms and rural communities afloat. But some in Washington support restrictive trade policies that would be devastating. President Trump and Congress should protect free trade.

Trump said the legislation does not address DACA recipients and does not fully fund his proposed border wall.\n\nThe White House had previously reassured lawmakers that Trump would sign the omnibus measure, which must pass to avoid a government shutdown that would start on Saturday. Capitol Hill was unprepared for the threat, as members of the House and Senate were scattering across the country as Congress heads into a two-week recess.\n\nCHINA READY TO GO TO THE MATTRESSES: If the rhetoric indeed meets reality, the U.S.-China trading relationship could be looking at an even wilder ride after Trump announced Thursday that he would hit Beijing with tariffs and investment restrictions in response to China forcing U.S. companies to give up technology and other intellectual property. As expected, China didn't shy from a strong response.\n\n\"China does not want a trade war with anyone,\" the Chinese Embassy said in a two-page statement. \"But China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war. China is confident and capable of facing any challenge. If a trade war were initiated by the U.S., China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.\"\n\nThe Chinese government also called the administration's actions \"self-defeating\" because they would harm U.S. consumers, companies and financial markets.\n\n\"We urge the U.S. to cease and desist, make cautious decisions, and avoid placing China-U.S. trade relations in danger with the purpose of hurting others that eventually end up hurting itself,\" the embassy said.\n\nA 301 ACTION TIMELINE: The proclamation signed by Trump sets in motion a number of timelines for the U.S. Trade Representative's Office and the Treasury Department to act on the three-pronged attack against China. The actions are in response to the findings of a 200-page USTR report that found evidence of China coercing U.S. companies to hand over valuable technology.\n\nTariffs: The administration has already calculated that annual damage to U.S. companies as a result of forced technology tops $50 billion. The White House said it will impose a 25 percent tariff on an equivalent value of Chinese imports. Within 15 days of Trump's announcement, USTR will release a proposed product list, which will be subject to a 30-day notice and comment period. Still unclear is how long USTR will take to finalize the list once it concludes the public process.\n\nInvestment restrictions: The Treasury Department is already hard at work trying to figure out how exactly it will restrict Chinese investment. The memorandum directs Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to report back to Trump on that process 60 days after Thursday.\n\nWTO case: USTR will also start the process of launching a WTO case challenging China's allegedly discriminatory licensing practices. Lighthizer will be required to report progress on the case 60 days after Thursday.\n\nICYMI, read the story on Thursday's China actions here.\n\nBUSINESS ROUNDTABLE CRITICIZES TRUMP'S CHINA TACTICS: Trump's decision to threaten to impose tariffs on at least $50 billion worth of Chinese goods could backfire badly on the United States without solving any of the underlying problems that prompted the move, Joshua Bolten, president and CEO of the Business Roundtable, told Morning Trade.\n\n\"Pressure from the U.S. alone is unlikely to succeed, said Bolten, who served as White House chief of staff to President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2009. \"It's most likely to result in punishment of U.S. companies to the benefit of our European, Japanese, and other competitors.\" The Trump administration is right that Chinese intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer and related concerns are serious problems, but they don't appear to have a \"coherent strategy\" to get China to change, he said.\n\n\"What you need to do is put together the list of specific actions you want the Chinese to take, in what time frame, with what consequence will occur if they do not. Line up your allies for support in that and then sit down with the Chinese and have a serious negotiation. It is frustrating, very hard work, but that is the work of trade diplomacy that needs to be done. It does not do any good to just shoot first and hope the other guys understand what they need to do,\" he said.\n\nU.S. BUSINESSES WITH CHINA STAKES STRIKE CAUTIOUS TONE: As the administration considers what products to hit with tariffs, U.S. business groups that represent firms operating in China are urging caution.\n\n\"American business wants to see solutions to these problems, not just sanctions such as unilateral tariffs that may do more harm than good,\" U.S.-China Business Council President John Frisbie said in a statement. \"We urge the two governments to engage in results-oriented dialogue to bring about real, positive change.\"\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents U.S. companies that have major investments in China, encouraged \"an outcome that protects U.S. intellectual property in a manner that avoids a costly trade conflict.\"\n\nThe aerospace industry, which the administration is trying to protect through the tariffs, could also see blowback as China could retaliate by dropping its orders for hundreds of Boeing commercial aircraft. Boeing remained mum on Thursday's announcement but another industry titan, Lockheed Martin, was front and center as company CEO Marillyn Hewson accepted the pen Trump used to sign the memorandum.\n\nThe industry's trade group, the Aerospace Industries Association, highlighted state-sponsored cyber threats and IP theft as national security issues. \"We look forward to working with the administration to determine strategic and effective deterrents and countermeasures,\" an AIA spokesman told Morning Trade.\n\nLABOR GROUP RALLIES BEHIND TARIFFS: Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, welcomed Trump's latest actions, which he said would \"put needed pressure on China to play fair\" if the administration works in coordination with allies and is committed to comprehensive trade reforms. \"Discussions and strongly worded letters have not stopped the IP theft or unfair tactics. Tariffs, investment restrictions and a WTO case might. Tariffs aren't an end goal, but an important tool to end trade practices that kill American jobs and drive down American pay,\" Trumka said.\n\nSENATORS PLAN BEIJING SWING: The same day the White House ratcheted up a retaliation-inducing trade action against China, a group of Republican senators from farm states announced their plans to travel to China and South Korea.\n\nThe trip has been in the works for the past six months, but Trump's announcement could sharpen their focus on addressing China trade issues. The lawmakers who will make the trip include Sens. Chuck Grassley, Steve Daines, Ron Johnson, David Perdue and Ben Sasse.\n\n\"Today, the president announced a series of tariffs on China in response to concerns over the country's trade practices,\" the lawmakers said in a joint statement. \"Given this announcement, we look forward to engaging in strategic discussions about how best to ensure free and smart trade.\"\n\nThe senators said they would prioritize in discussions with Chinese leaders the four main concerns the administration raised in its Section 301 investigation. Those include forced technology transfers, discriminatory licensing restrictions, state-supported acquisition of advanced technologies and cyber intrusions aimed at stealing intellectual property.\n\nTRUMP TEMPORARILY EXEMPTS EU, 4 OTHER ALLIES FROM STEEL, ALUMINUM TARIFFS: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed on Thursday that the U.S. would temporarily exempt the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea from steel and aluminum tariffs that went into effect early today.\n\nThe president \"has decided to pause the imposition of the tariffs with respect to those countries,\" Lighthizer told lawmakers at a Senate Finance Committee hearing.\n\nTrump made it official late Thursday night by issuing a proclamation saying the tariffs would be delayed for those allies until May 1 to give Lighthizer time to negotiate agreements with each trading partner to address U.S. national security concerns in some manner. The proclamation also covers Mexico and Canada, which Trump previously said would be temporarily exempt. Duties on other steel and aluminum exporters, such as China, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates and Japan, took effect shortly after midnight.\n\nThe tariffs have infuriated long-standing allies, many of whom threatened harsh retaliatory measures against U.S. products. Trump initially announced that he would exempt Canada and Mexico, pending the outcome of the NAFTA renegotiation. The U.S. imports the majority of its steel from Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico.\n\nThe Business Roundtable's Bolten said that he was encouraged by the decision to exempt the allies, even if it's only temporary. \"By our calculation that means that two-thirds of steel and 54 percent of aluminum imports will not be affected by the tariffs,\" he said. The remaining tariffs are still \"a big mistake, but it's a smaller mistake than it was two weeks ago.\" Pro Trade's Sabrina Rodriguez has more.\n\nCHINA TARIFFS STRIKE FEAR IN AGRICULTURE: U.S. farmers and members of the administration fully expect that agricultural exports will bear the brunt of retaliatory measures now that Trump has announced his tariffs on Chinese goods. China's decision to slap tariffs on pork, fruit and wine in response to Trump's steel and aluminum duties only adds to farmers' fears that commodity crops like soybeans, corn and wheat could be next.\n\nRetaliation caused by Trump's China crackdown \"will cost many farmers their livelihoods,\" said John Heisdorffer, president of the American Soybean Association.\n\nThe Trump administration has previously acknowledged the negative effects that its tariff actions could have for agriculture, but has not specified how it will help combat retaliatory efforts. Ray Starling, special assistant to the president for agriculture, trade and food assistance, said on Wednesday that the White House would deal with any retaliatory measures against U.S. farmers on a \"case-by-case basis, as those threats materialize.\"\n\nAmerican farmers will have to concentrate on diversifying their markets to help support prices and minimize any damages that come from retaliation, said Tom Sleight, president of the U.S. Grains Council. \"We are well aware this work will be an uphill battle because our reputation as a reliable supplier has come into question,\" he said.\n\nROSS TRIES TO SOOTHE FEARS: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was also on Capitol Hill on Thursday, trying to reassure members of the House Ways and Means Committee that U.S. manufacturers and farmers wouldn't get more than a few minor bruises as a result of Trump's trade actions. \"I believe the actual outcome of all this will be far less severe than things that people are worried about,\" Ross told the largely skeptical panel.\n\nGOP Rep. Sam Johnson, a World War II veteran and one of the oldest members of Congress, told Ross that he thought the administration's premise for imposing the tariffs was completely bogus.\n\n\"There's simply nothing to suggest that these imports pose a risk to national security. Instead these tariffs pose a serious risk to our economy, they could trigger a trade war and they could damage our relations with key allies,\" the Texas lawmaker said. However, the growing list of country exemptions likely reduces some of those concerns.

Guajardo was accompanied by Mexico's chief NAFTA negotiator, Kenneth Smith Ramos, deputy chief negotiator Salvador Behar Lavalle and Mexican Ambassador Gerónimo Gutiérrez.\n\nUSTR and Mexico's Economy Ministry did not release details on the meeting. However, both trade leaders specified at the end of the seventh round of talks in Mexico City earlier this month that they would be speaking and meeting frequently over the next five weeks before the next round. The eighth round of talks is expected to be held in the second week of April in the Washington area, but officials have yet to publicly confirm those dates.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n-- The GOP's revamp of the tax code created a new levy on multinational corporations, known as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, or BEAT, that some critics say violates WTO agreements, POLITICO Pro reports.\n\n-- Ross says U.S. hopes steel, aluminum tariffs will spur global action on overcapacity, POLITICO Pro reports.\n\n-- Brady calls for steel, aluminum tariffs to sunset in 1 year, POLITICO Pro reports.\n\n-- Stocks tumble to worst day in six weeks after Trump tariff action, Reuters reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

Our farmers and ranchers exported more than $129 billion worth of products in 2016, accounting for 20% of all farm revenue in the U.S. Agricultural exports also support more than one million American jobs - most of them in the nonfarm sector. These jobs provide stability for rural families and communities. Free trade is essential to maintaining the strength of our agriculture economy. But some in Washington now support policies that would restrict trade. That would be devastating to family farms across the country, and would cause higher prices for consumers. President Trump and Congress should protect free trade to keep our agriculture economy strong. Learn more here. **",

                "title": "White House lawyer McGahn eager to exit",
                "body": "The departure would come amid a shakeup of Trump's legal team for the Russia probe.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's top White House lawyer, Don McGahn, is expected to step down later this year, though his resignation is contingent on the president finding a replacement and several other factors, according to four sources familiar with McGahn's thinking.\n\nMcGahn, according to two of the sources, has signaled interest in returning to the Jones Day law firm where he previously worked and reprising a role he had during the 2016 campaign by handling legal matters for Trump's re-election.\n\nBut the exact timing for McGahn to make any move remains in flux. He's told associates he'd like to leave the White House by the summer, but it could also be put on hold through the 2018 midterms.\n\nConcerned about the velocity of turnover inside his White House and beyond -- Trump personal lawyer John Dowd resigned on Thursday, and the president has made changes atop the State Department, CIA and the national security adviser slot -- sources said Trump wants to have a new White House counsel in place who he's comfortable with before clearing McGahn for the exits.\n\n\"I think it's all up in the air,\" said a source close to McGahn. \"I think he'd like to quit very much. The president doesn't want him to quit. The president wants him to stay. I don't think he knows who will replace him.\"\n\nMcGahn, a former Federal Election Commission member, was one of Trump's earliest political advisers, signing on even before the Republican announced his presidential campaign in the spring of 2015.\n\nAs White House counsel, McGahn has played a prominent but controversial role shepherding Trump's Cabinet picks through confirmation, as well as notching lifetime appointments for 29 federal judges, including Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch. McGahn has also been central to the reversal of myriad Obama-era policy regulations dealing with the environment and energy, health care, financial services and other industrial sectors.\n\n\"He can look at his first 14 to 16 months and say he's probably had a pretty good run,\" said a second McGahn associate.\n\nA third McGahn associate said his departure also may hinge on whether there's another opening for Trump to fill on the Supreme Court -- an impossible-to-predict scenario but one that could present a unique legacy opportunity for the White House counsel. \"I think if we had a possibility of getting another Supreme Court justice, I think he'd hang in,\" the source said.\n\nA White House spokesman declined comment. McGahn did not respond to requests for comment about his job plans or a potential return to Jones Day, where he was paid an annual salary of $2.4 million as a partner before joining government, according to a 2017 financial disclosure form filed with the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nMcGahn's departure would also free him from some of the daily turmoil associated with playing a prominent role in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nThe White House counsel told the president in January 2017 that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn had misled both the FBI and Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., which led to Flynn's firing.\n\nOn Trump's orders, McGahn tried without success last March to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the whole probe. McGahn also had a role in last May's firing of FBI Director James Comey. And Trump tried to get McGahn in June to press the Justice Department to examine potential grounds for firing Mueller.\n\nMcGahn ignored the president's requests, telling then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and then-senior strategist Steve Bannon that he'd resign if the president didn't stop asking him about the issue.\n\nThe Russia portfolio shifted out of McGahn's hands last summer with the arrival of Ty Cobb, whose daily responsibilities included White House document production and lining up current aides to meet with Mueller for interviews.\n\nBut Cobb and McGahn still clashed over whether Trump should be so cooperative with the special counsel. McGahn urged the president to assert executive privilege on some documents being sought, but Trump followed Cobb's counsel and did not block any document production, according to sources familiar with the president's legal strategy.\n\nMcGahn has met on at least two occasions for interviews with Mueller's prosecutors. During a recent visit he shared details about the president's reaction to a January New York Times story that described how McGahn had resisted his order to fire Mueller.\n\nTrump denied that he'd made any such request and asked then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter to get McGahn to issue a statement disputing the article. If McGahn refused, Trump told the aide that he could be fired.\n\nThe Trump and McGahn relationship is by many accounts a complicated one. Two sources said they speak infrequently. Another noted that McGahn remains close to White House chief of staff John Kelly and that Trump does indeed rely on his top counsel.\n\n\"It's hard to explain, but I think [Trump] values Don and his advice, and part of it isthat Don is probably one of the only people who's ever said 'no' to him,\" one of the McGahn associates said.\n\nA list of candidates to replace McGahn remains a work in progress.\n\nSeveral elite attorneys, including former George W. Bush solicitor general Ted Olson, Robert Giuffra Jr. and Reid Weingarten, declined job offers from Trump last spring to work on his Russia response. Former George W. Bush attorneys Bill Burck and Emmet Flood also rejected overtures for the position that Cobb accepted to work in the White House.\n\nFlood subsequently met with the president earlier this month at the White House, though it's unclear if that has led to a job offer. Another name mentioned this week by a source close to Trump: Jay Clayton, the current chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSaid one former senior White House lawyer, \"Coming in now, it would take a brave soul.\"",

                "title": "Trump threatens to veto spending bill, risking shutdown",
                "body": "President Donald Trump yanked the government back to the brink of a shutdown on Friday morning with a tweet threatening \"a VETO\" of a $1.3 trillion spending bill that Congress had cleared just hours earlier.\n\nTrump's declaration of a possible veto -- citing the spending bill's lack of full funding for his border wall and attention to undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers -- comes as many lawmakers who would have to override his rejection or pass a stopgap funding measure are already on the way out of Washington for a two-week recess. The president's top aides said Thursday he would sign the bill, but his threat was a reminder that only Trump truly knows what the White House is doing at any time.\n\nTrump's tweet caught many in the West Wing and on Capitol Hill by surprise, sending them scrambling to determine how serious he is about vetoing the bill, while White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders added a Friday afternoon briefing. Illustrating the degree to which Trump had upended his own staff once again, one West Wing official said on Friday morning that the likelihood of a shutdown is \"extremely high.\"\n\nThere remains hope in the White House that the defense community, including Secretary of Defense James Mattis -- who is slated to meet with Trump on Friday -- could convince Trump that whatever stopgap spending agreement results from a shutdown threat would not deliver the high level of defense spending provided by the omnibus.\n\nBut Trump's frustration is severe, the West Wing official said. The president has been concerned by conservative outcry on Fox News, about the amount provided for the border wall and interior enforcement and the way in which Amtrak funding is being framed as a victory for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\nIn fact, both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill had joined White House aides on Thursday in touting gains for both parties in the spending deal, which the Senate approved on a 65-32 vote after midnight on Friday morning.\n\n\"Ask Republicans. It's their problem,\" one senior Democratic aide said of the veto tweet. \"He's just trying to get a reaction from Democrats over something that's demonstrably false.\"\n\nBut fiscal conservatives in Congress who had opposed the spending package urged Trump to follow through with the veto threat, concerned over the bill's high price tag bloating the debt.\n\n\"Please do, Mr. President. I am just down the street and will bring you a pen. The spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children under the bus. Totally irresponsible,\" tweeted Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee.\n\nTrump's frustrations with the bill were well-known in the White House, but West Wing aides and members of Congress believed they had convinced the president to go along with the measure.\n\nThe White House released a statement Thursday saying the administration supports passage of the bill and it declared in a separate statement that the legislation is a \"win for the American people.\"\n\n\"Let's cut right to the chase. Is the president going to sign the bill? Yes. Why? Because it funds his priorities,\" White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Thursday, while acknowledging the final product was imperfect.",

I don't have any personnel announcements at this time,\" she told \"Fox & Friends\" in response to a question about talk that she might fill the soon-to-be-vacant communications director post. \"I will do whatever is best, whatever my best and highest use is here.\"\n\nThe position of White House communications director has been a particularly quickly revolving door since President Donald Trump took office last year. Trump has had four communications directors through his first 14 months in office, including former press secretary Sean Spicer, who held the job twice in his six months in the West Wing, and Anthony Scaramucci, who famously held the job for 11 days before resigning after an expletive-filled interview with The New Yorker.\n\nThe job of communications director was most recently filled by Hope Hicks, who held the position longer than any of her Trump administration predecessors. Hicks announced her resignation late last month, although the White House said at the time that her official departure date was yet to be determined but would be in the upcoming weeks.\n\nWhile Conway has officially served in a policy-facing role as counselor to the president, she has remained one of the most public-facing members of the Trump administration, doing regular interviews on \"Fox & Friends,\" where the president receives almost unflinchingly positive coverage, while also appearing on other TV networks, albeit less frequently.\n\nShe heaped praised Friday morning on the White House communications staff for its work and said that work on that team also requires the type of policy knowledge required by her current position.\n\n\"As counselor to the president, that takes on any number of different tasks and one has been in terms of policy. That's been my major portfolio here,\" she said. \"But I think to be effective communication directors, as we've seen, you also have to know policy, you have to be read-in.

                "body": "THE BUZZ: -- ON THE ROAD Twelve hours in a Honda Odyssey with \"The Former College Drop-out Who Would Be Dianne Feinstein,' by POLITICO's David Siders in Santa Ana:\n\n-- Fourteen people and three rescue cats were awaiting Kevin de León when he pulled up to a PetSmart and stepped inside through drizzling rain. In his briefing folder, an aide had included a note titled, \"Cat puns you can use, if you're feeling festive!\" De León hit nearly all of them. \"Meow is the time,\" he told the members of Kitty Devore Rescue, describing himself as an \"alley cat.\" Grateful for de León's attention, a woman beamed back at him, \"Someone knows our name!\"\n\n-- \"It had been two weeks since de León impressed a crowd on a more brightly lit stage. In a coup at the California Democratic Party's annual convention last month, de León -- until Wednesday the Democratic leader of California's state Senate -- deprived Dianne Feinstein of her own party's endorsement by outpolling the state's senior senator by 17 percentage points in the delegate vote. Although de León fell short of the 60 percent threshold necessary to claim the party's backing himself, he embarrassed Feinstein and put a California institution on her heels.\n\n-- \"For de León and his supporters, the convention marked a turning point not only in his quixotic campaign to unseat Feinstein, but also in a generational struggle among Democrats in the nation's most populous state. For decades, Feinstein and her centrist brand of politics have appeared as immovable as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and California's fourth-term governor, Jerry Brown. For once, a restless, more progressive class of Democrats had unsteadied the establishment. De León skewers Feinstein for her moderation and depicts her as unfit to battle President Donald Trump. He is also testing the muscle of the nation's newly emboldened left. Full story in POLITICO\n\nWhere's Jerry: No public schedule.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \"Help these folks. Help Chad ...

Some other key quotes:\n\n-- Asked if he agrees with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Amanda Renteria that Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom should resign due to an affair more than a decade ago, Chiang said; \"Character and trust are absolutely critical. ... Who do you look up to inspire and lead the state? It's important that if somebody abuses their power, I don't believe they should serve...\" But pressed on whether he believed Newsom abused power, Chiang refused to give his own view, saying that \"the voters will decide on that.\"\n\n-- Asked about the checks he signed for confidential sexual harassment settlements of some elected officials as state Controller, Chiang said the ultimate decisions on those were the responsibility of the then-Attorney General. \"If people want to question Kamala Harris\" with regard to how the AG handled settlements, they should take it up with her, Chiang said.\n\n-- REACTION FROM TEAM GAVIN, via spokesman Dan Newman: \"Blaming Kamala for the checks he signed without uttering a peep? Bold buck-passing and courageously creative excuse making.\"\n\n--- HERE COME THE LAWSUITS...FACEBOOK FACEOFF -- Release: \"SAN FRANCISCO, CA--- Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy today filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Facebook shareholder in the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, against several Facebook officers and directors, following the Company's recent admission that data from 50 million Facebook users was improperly shared with third parties.

Garcia's video doesn't disclose who funded it -- as required by campaign law -- but does star a parade of unidentified people praising her. Also included: a glowing opening quote from state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, and photos of her with Gov. Jerry Brown -- implying endorsements of her 2018 re-election campaign.\n\n--- THE VIDEO, which Garcia asks supporters to \"please share,\" features a shot of Garcia's inclusion in Time Magazine's \"Person of the Year\" cover story on \"The Silence Breakers\" reporting sexual harassment in the #MeToo movement. But it make no mention of Garcia's current troubles: She's on leave and under investigation following a POLITICO report of sexual harassment claims -- including that she groped a young former legislative staffer, Daniel Fierro, following a legislative softball game, and that an inebriated Garcia made a lewd sexual suggestion and attempted to grope a Sacramento lobbyist at a political fundraiser in March 2017. In addition, a former Garcia staffer, David John Kernick, charged Garcia asked staffers, after a night of drinking, to engage in a game of \"Spin the Bottle,'' POLITICO reported. Kernick's attorney says his personnel records were released to media after that complaint was made public. Garcia has denied the allegations.\n\n-- Asked about the use of the speaker's quote from a past news story in the video, Bill Wong, Rendon's campaign spokesman, said the Speaker \"does not have any say\" in Garcia's decision to use his words, but confirmed he did not object to their use in the video or asked they be removed. Evan Westrup, the governor's spokesman, told POLITICO that the governor was not consulted, nor did he give his permission for use of his photos in the campaign video -- and that he has not endorsed Garcia.\n\n-- \"Antonio Villaraigosa says he's not a 'partisan warrior,' but he's ready to fight,\" by CALmatters: \"In a conversation at CALmatters on a day when a new poll showed him dropping into third place, the former Los Angeles mayor talked education, health, fiscal policy -- and how his views depart from the Democratic Party orthodoxy because he's a 'small d' Democrat.\" Story\n\n-- \"Oakland officials want to raise more preschool funding through new parcel tax,\" by SFChronicle's Kimberly Veklerov: \"The proposed measure, called the Oakland Children's Initiative, would raise about $30 million annually for the next 30 years for early-childhood education and a 'cradle-to-college' program championed by Mayor Libby Schaaf that aims to increase university attendance and completion by city students.\" Story\n\nMIXTAPE:\n\n-- \"Northern California utility says it will start shutting power lines down when fire risk spikes,\" by SacBee's Dale Kasler: Story\n\n-- \"TRUE: California ranks 49th in per capita housing supply,\" by Politifact's Chris Nichols: Story\n\n-- \"Irvine could blow a gaping hole in O.C.'s emergency response system,\" by OCRegister's Teri Sforza and Tomoya Shimura: Story\n\n-- \"Inmate dead in cell for 2 or 3 days; staff blamed smell on sewer,\" by San Diego Union-Tribune's Teri Figueroa: Story\n\n-- \"Commentary: Politicos can't pick and choose on civil rights,\" by CALmatters' Dan Walters: Column\n\n-- \"Mental hospital patients bused from Las Vegas to SF, other cities to get day in court,\" by SFChronicle's Michelle Robertson: Story\n\nHOLLYWOODLAND:\n\n-- \"How and why Southern California's population grew so much in one year, \" by Southern California News Group's David Downey, Nikie Johnson, and Ian Wheeler: \"That's the estimated population increase between 2016 and 2017, according to data released Wednesday night, March 21, by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\"The biggest growth, not surprisingly, is in the Inland Empire, where housing is relatively cheaper and home construction is feverishly trying to keep up with demand.\" Story\n\nSILICON VALLEYLAND:\n\nTHE MICROSOFT EFFECT -- \"Facebook employees fear 'golden' years are over,\" by POLITICO's Nancy Scola: \"Facebook's response to its controversy over data privacy looks nearly as chaotic to its employees as it does from the outside, people inside the embattled social network say. The company's rank-and-file are grumbling about the way CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg kept silent about the Cambridge Analytica furor for six days - a vacuum that allowed minor-celebrity Facebook executives to make matters worse by issuing hair-splitting explanations on Twitter.\n\n\"Some Facebook staffers also see the company's leadership as perpetually naive about how bad actors might misuse its platform, said company sources drawing from conversations with co-workers and discussions on the company's internal communication forums. Others feel lingering guilt over the Russian election meddling that many employees believe helped propel Donald Trump into the presidency - and more prosaic worries that whatever changes Zuckerberg makes to address the crisis could upend months or even years of engineering work.\" Story.\n\n-- \"California has a plan to police Facebook,\" by Quartz's Chase Purdy: \"First introduced in February by assemblyman Marc Levine, the legislation seeks to establish a data protection authority that would be charged with regulating how big tech companies request and use Californians' personal data.

                "title": "Shutdown averted",
                "body": "SHUTDOWN AVERTED! -- While you were (hopefully) sleeping, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell convinced his Kentucky colleague Rand Paul to drop his threat to drag things out through Saturday (and cause a brief shutdown) and the Senate passed the $1.3 trillion spending package at 12:39 a.m. by a vote of 65-32.\n\nPOLITICO's Burgess Everett has the details of the mini-drama: \"[I]t was a tricky road to avoid a government shutdown, requiring ... McConnell to privately telephone Paul and let him vent about the Senate rules, then satisfy [GOP Sen.] James Risch's objections to a wilderness area being named after a dead Idaho governor.\n\n\"'This is ridiculous. This is juvenile,' fumed Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who asked McConnell for an explanation of why the chamber was in at midnight. 'What has occurred over the last 11 hours that keeps us here voting on a bill that we all know is going to pass?'\n\nTRUMP ROCKS MARKETS -- The era of Donald Trump's unusual approach to the presidency not spooking the stock market is over. Trump's announcement of $60 billion in new tariffs against China helped drive the Dow down over 700 points on Thursday.\n\nIt didn't help matters that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross went on CNBC immediately after the announcement and said, sure, China is likely to retaliate and that could hurt our farmers and airplane exporters and everyone else who exports to the world's second largest economy. But it probably won't destroy the global economy.\n\n\"I think there will be some ultimate retaliation. But I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth,\" Ross said. That comment sent free traders inside the Trump administration over the edge with one asking MM, \"Is that the new standard for U.S. policy? That it probably won't be the end of the world?\"\n\nThe Dow is now off 10 percent since hitting its high point of the Trump presidency, 26,616 on Jan. 26 just before the era of neo-mercantilism began with the announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs. The S&P is off around 8 percent over that period. The Nasdaq is off around 5 percent.\n\nIt's not just Trump, of course. Markets are also worried that a potentially more hawkish Fed, rising inflation and profit margin erosion. But this new generalized vulnerability means that markets' ability to shake off Trump's erratic nature and protectionist approach is largely gone.\n\n\"What I've noticed is that market reaction to news now is far more aggressive every day than it would have been a year ago. This same kind of news a year ago wouldn't have done much at all,\" Leuthold Group's Jim Paulsen told me. \"It's a situation where the market is more vulnerable, so interest rate news, or Trump news, or Facebook news is having much more impact.\"\n\nPaulsen's outlook? It could get scarier before it gets better: \"It could be that we get a very significant correction, and a scary one, and then we go back up and wind up mostly unchanged for the year. Or it could be that we just keep doing what we are doing since late January and just wind up going nowhere.\"\n\nFLASH BACK -- Here's what I wrote a couple weeks back for POLITICO Magazine in a piece about why Trump's unusual presidency had not freaked out Wall Street. Seems about where we are now: \"But there's another possibility: that Wall Street has it all wrong.\n\n\"If Trump really were the black swan he seemed on election night, it's possible that the kinds of risk he presents -- a constitutional crisis, a neomercantilist trade battle, even a nuclear war -- just aren't the kind of things that the markets can price in. And what I found is that some investors are wondering whether the market really is missing something, and that destabilizing moment might still be in our future.\" Read more.\n\nWHAT THE TARIFFS WILL HIT -- Pantheon's Ian Shepherdson: \"Yesterday's announcement that the administration plans to imposes tariffs worth about $60B per year -- that's 0.3% of GDP -- on an array of imports of consumer goods from China is a serious escalation. It's not quite a trade war, yet, but this is a much more serious engagement than the skirmishing over steel and aluminum.\n\n\"These tariffs, if fully implemented, will hit items as diverse as clothing, furniture, shoes, electronics and plastic products. People will notice, and the margins of importers, wholesalers and retailers will be squeezed. .. [M]aking U.S. consumers pay more for Chinese-made TVs, at a time when the U.S. is seeking help from China over North Korea, seems an unlikely mechanism for persuading China to change its behavior.\"\n\nSPEAKING OF CHINA -- AP/Beijing: BEIJING (AP) - \"China raises tariffs on U.S. pork, aluminum and other goods in response to Trump tariff hikes.\" This was about the aluminum and steel tariffs, not those aimed at China announced on Thursday.\n\nVia the Chinese Embassy in DC: \"China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war. China is confident and capable of facing any challenge. If a trade war were initiated by the U.S., China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.\"\n\nMARKETS KEEP DROPPING -- Bloomberg: \"Stocks tumbled round the world after ... Trump's slapped tariffs on China and Chinese policy makers took retaliatory steps of their own, sparking fears a trade war could hurt global growth. Treasuries extended gains and the dollar fell.\n\n\"Equity indexes from Tokyo to Shanghai tumbled well over 3 percent. U.S. stock futures also declined, signaling a further retreat for the S&P 500 Index after it closed down 2.5 percent, the most in six weeks. As investors dumped stocks, they rushed to the safety of Treasuries, where yields dipped below 2.8 percent, and the yen, which jumped past 105 per dollar for the first time since November 2016.\" Read more.\n\nREMEMBER THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS? -- One argument for not freaking out about the China tariffs is that Trump has now removed much of the steel and aluminum tariffs. As of Thursday, the administration has now exempted Canada, Mexico, the EU, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea. The biggest steel and aluminum exporters to the U.S. are Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, U.S. Steel has given up all of its stock market gain since news of the tariffs first began to circulate. It dropped 11 percent on Thursday. Nucor has also lost all its tariff-related gains.\n\nCITI TAKES ACTION ON GUNS -- POLITICO's Victoria Guida: \"Citigroup Thursday announced a new policy aimed at pushing its clients to place restrictions on the sale of firearms, becoming the nation's first large lender to take action on guns.\n\n\"The move by Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, comes two days before major nationwide rallies on gun control are scheduled to take place. The bank will require retail clients to only sell guns if the customer has passed a background check, to restrict sales to people under 21, and to refuse to sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines.\" Read more.\n\nGOOD FRIDAY MORNING -- Happy weekend everyone!

'This spending agreement brings that era of austerity to an unceremonious end and represents one of the most significant investments in the middle class in decades,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared on the floor.\" Read more.\n\nSHERYL SANDBERG SPEAKS -- Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg broke her silence and lamed in an interview with CNBC that she hadn't spoken out sooner on the data scandal roiling the social media giant: \"This was a huge breach of trust.

If I could live this past week again, I would have definitely had Mark and myself out speaking earlier, but we were trying to get to the bottom of this and make sure we could take strong action.\"\n\nMcMASTER OUT -- POLITICO's Cristiano Lima, Matthew Nussbaum and Andrew Restuccia: \"President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he would replace national security adviser H.R. McMaster with John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, marking the latest high-level shake up in a White House that has seen unprecedented levels of turnover in Trump's first 14 months in office.\n\n\"McMaster's exit brings an end to his uneven tenure as leader of the NSC, marked by internal clashes with the president and other top administration officials and months of swirling speculation about his looming departure He never quite meshed with the president, aides say, and at times clashed with him on foreign policy matters.\" Read more.\n\nWORLD'S WEALTHIEST LOSE $71B IN SELLOFF -- Bloomberg's Tom Metcalf and Jack Witzig: \"The fortunes of the world's 500 richest people tumbled $71 billion on Thursday as markets plunged on heightened prospects for a trade war. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman Warren Buffet led with a $3.02 billion decline, followed by $3.01 billion for Amazon.com Inc.'s Jeff Bezos.\n\nTencent Holdings Ltd.'s Ma Huateng lost $2.16 billion, the most among Asia's richest. Just 52 of the world's 500 richest people added to their net worth on the day, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 700 points, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The S&P 500 Index fell 2.5 percent, the most in six weeks.\" Read more.\n\nTRUMP SIGNS OFF ON TARIFFS -- WSJ's Bob Davis: \"The Trump administration will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, alongside restrictions on technology transfers and acquisitions by Beijing, moving to pressure China to curtail what the U.S. considers unfair trading and investment practices.\n\n\"On trade, 'We have one particular problem, and I view them as a friend. ... And that's China,' President Donald Trump said Thursday, adding that America has an 'out of control' trade deficit with the country. Mr. Trump made the announcement at the White House, where he signed a presidential memorandum that cites Section 301 of a 1974 U.S. trade law, a broad tool that allows unilateral actions against allegedly unfair trade policies abroad.\" Read more.\n\nAnd consumers could feel the impact -- AP's Christopher Rugaber: \"White House officials say they will try to minimize any price increases for American shoppers. Instead, they suggested Thursday that the tariffs would mostly target products that businesses, rather than consumers, buy: Computers, information technology products, industrial machinery and aircraft parts. 'If they had done it on clothing, footwear and iPhones, that would have more of an immediate impact,' Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.

In an annual proxy filing after the market close on Wednesday, the biggest U.S. bank by assets said that its chairman and CEO was paid $28.3m last year, or 364 times the median employee, who received $77,799, including firm-paid benefits.\n\n\"Mr. Dimon's pay ratio of 364 times the median worker puts him second in the list for the big banks, according to Autonomous Research, behind Citigroup chief Mike Corbat, whose pay of $17.8m last year was 369 times the median worker.

'We are concerned about a lot of the issues around manipulation, whether it's spoofing, or any other forms of market manipulation that are out there,' he said Thursday at an event in New York. 'Spoofing, front running, wash trading, pump-and-dump, insider trading -- there's a question of, how are they being watched out for?'\n\n\"Few cops are currently on the beat watching for rigging, in part because regulators are still trying to work out who's responsible for what and also because it's not clear they can do much until the exchanges register with them.

Just how much fintech firms are subject to federal oversight varies -- whether that's securities regulators, federal regulators, or even state regulators.\n\n\"This regulatory structure comes with its share of challenges, the GAO adds: \"With numerous regulators, fintech firms noted that identifying the applicable laws can how their activities will be regulated can be difficult.\" The agency made several recommendations to improve interagency coordination, including tackling \"competing concerns on financial account aggregation\" and whether it's possible (and beneficial) to consider alternative approaches from regulators outside of the U.S.\n\n** A message from FICO: FICO is the independent standard in credit scoring, trusted by lenders and securitization experts for decades. FICO supports a competitive review of credit scores in mortgage lending, but the only other score being considered is VantageScore, which is owned by the three credit bureaus. Allowing the credit bureaus to offer a score they own in a system where they are the single point of sale and distribution for both credit reports and scores would not increase competition or innovation, it would consolidate their power.

The House passed the bill on Thursday afternoon, and the Senate followed suit at 12:39 a.m. Friday. \"But it was a tricky road to avoid a government shutdown, requiring Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to privately telephone [Rand] Paul and let him vent about the Senate rules, then satisfy [Jim] Risch's objections to a wilderness area being named after a dead Idaho governor,\" Burgess reports.\n\nPaul (R-Ky.) had refused to rule out shutting down the government but relented Thursday night after a phone call with McConnell (R-Ky.). \"But once Paul was taken care of, the ornery Risch was next,\" Burgess adds. \"The Idaho Republican protested moving forward on the bill because it renamed an Idaho park after Cecil D. Andrus, a former Democratic governor and sometime political foe, who died last year, according to sources familiar with the matter. Risch was under the impression that the renaming would not be in the bill, according to a GOP senator.\"\n\nCongressional leaders unveiled the omnibus text Wednesday night, giving lawmakers roughly 48 hours to read through more than 2,200 pages and vote. \"And the massive bill's late unveiling contributed to the impasse with Risch, who was surprised to find Andrus' name in the spending bill,\" Burgess continues. \"Both Risch and Paul were empowered by Senate rules, which required all 100 senators to agree hold a vote before the Friday night shutdown deadline.\" The legislation now heads to the president's desk for his signature.

Risch fumed after finding the provision, which was buried on page 786. \"As to what, in an old political rivalry, could've led to such a visceral response by Risch, aides in both parties were still trying to figure out what had occurred,\" CNN's Phil Mattingly reports.

In some cases, they said the evidence undermined claims by the president's opponents that his campaign may have colluded with Moscow to win the 2016 election.\"\n\n\"The report comes amid a bitter split on the House Intelligence panel, as Democrats claim the committee's Republican members sought to protect the president by cutting off the investigation without interviewing key people, forcing recalcitrant witnesses to answer questions or subpoenaing documents,\" Kyle continues. \"Democrats fear the report could distract from the work of special counsel Robert Mueller.\" Much more: http://politi.co/2GhvPS4\n\nRelated Russia read: \"Goodlatte subpoenas DOJ over Clinton investigation, McCabe firing,\" by Kyle and Elana: http://politi.co/2HXyxcz\n\nHOUSE PANEL WILL SUMMON ZUCKERBERG TO TESTIFY -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee will call on Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify. \"We believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people,\" Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and ranking member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg to determine a date and time in the near future for a hearing before this committee.\" The invitation to testify comes after revelations that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained information on some 50 million Facebook users.

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) expressed confidence in Bolton's \"ability to advise the president on key threats and challenges.\"\n\nDemocrats, however, weren't as receptive to the latest shakeup.

                "body": "John Bolton, President Donald Trump's pick to replace H.R. McMaster as his national security adviser, could bring a vastly different approach on Russia's election meddling to the White House.\n\nIn their public comments, McMaster and Bolton have presented a stark contrast in their views on Moscow's involvement in the hacks and online trolling that roiled the 2016 presidential election. While McMaster has taken a hard-line stance in blaming Moscow for orchestrating the digital disruption campaign, Bolton has made headlines by casting doubt on Russia's role.\n\nIn fact, it was McMaster's remarks on the subject that caused his strained relationship with the president to spill into public view.\n\nSpeaking at a February conference in Munich, McMaster proclaimed that evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections was \"incontrovertible.\"\n\nTrump lashed out on Twitter in response: \"General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\"\n\nConversely, Bolton -- a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration -- has cast doubt on the evidence linking Russia to the Democratic National Committee hack, suggesting that the Obama administration was blaming the Kremlin for political purposes.\n\nIn December 2016, when Bolton was being floated as the possible deputy secretary of state, the former diplomat suggested that the digital footprints left behind at the DNC may have been a \"false flag.\"\n\n\"If you think the Russians did this, why did they leave fingerprints?\" he asked during a Fox News interview.\n\n\"We just don't know,\" Bolton said. \"But I believe that the intelligence community has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.\"\n\nBolton later clarified that he did not mean to imply that the Obama administration had planted fake evidence. And he has since changed his tune, acknowledging Moscow played a part.\n\nStill, his remarks echoed Trump's own approach to the intelligence community's conclusions. Trump has continued to equivocate on the topic and has rarely stated definitively that Russia was behind the digital intrusions at the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\n\"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\" Trump said at his first news conference as president. \"I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.\"\n\nThe president has also regularly accused intelligence agencies of using information to damage him politically.\n\nAnd just last November, after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said: \"Every time [Putin] sees me, he says, 'I didn't do that.' And I believe -- I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\"\n\nAfter that meeting, Bolton did say he thought Putin had \"looked Donald Trump directly in the eye and lied to him.\"\n\n\"Everyone who has looked at the classified information says there's no doubt the Russians tried to affect the election,\" Bolton said in a Fox News interview. \"That's something that should be unacceptable to all Americans.\"",

FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign & Russia. (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts,\" Trump wrote online just after 6 a.m. Friday morning.\n\nIn its findings, released Thursday after the committee's Republican majority voted to end the investigation, the committee criticized former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page for providing \"incomplete\" testimony about a 2016 trip to Moscow and called the contacts some Trump associates had with the website WikiLeaks, where the intelligence community says emails hacked by the Russian government were leaked to the public, were \"ill-advised.\" But none of it, the committee's report said, rose to the level of collusion.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee also said Obama-era Director of National Intelligence James Clapper provided \"inconsistent testimony\" regarding his interactions with the media.\n\nTrump has long complained that investigations into his campaign amount to a \"witch hunt\" invented by Democrats upset over Hillary Clinton's surprise 2016 loss. A Senate Intelligence Committee investigation remains underway, as does the Justice Department probe being conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nDemocrats on the House committee have been critical of the decision to end the investigation, accusing Republicans of shielding Trump by not subpoenaing certain documents, declining to interview certain witnesses and refusing to compel other witnesses to answer certain questions.\n\n\"It really is a fundamentally flawed document and there's not much that can rescue it,\" Rep.

The plan was to lay out why American troops are deployed in far-flung places across the globe, like Japan and South Korea. Mattis spoke first.\n\n\"'The postwar, rules-based international order is the greatest gift of the greatest generation,' Mattis told the president, according to two meeting attendees. The secretary of defense walked the president through the complex fabric of trade deals, military agreements and international alliances that make up the global system the victors established after World War II, touching off what one attendee described as a 'food fight' and a 'free for all' with the president and the rest of the group.\n\n\"Trump punctuated the session by loudly telling his secretaries of state and defense, at several points during the meeting, 'I don't agree!'

At the Federal Court House in Tallahassee, Sessions built on the Trump administration's recently-announced plan to battle the opioid epidemic by reducing prescriptions of the narcotic, targeting traffickers and committing $6 billion in federal dollars to prevention and treatment. As part of that plan, Sessions said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency would commit 250 federal agents and dozens of analysts to working with local law enforcement in areas hit hardest by overdoses to help put \"drug traffickers right where they belong: in the slammer.\" ... The plan would likely include Florida, where 5,725 people died in 2016 from opioid related deaths -- up 35 percent from 2015. More than 60,000 people died in 2016 nationwide. Sessions didn't specify whether the cases would be prosecuted at the state or federal level but highlighted how, under both Florida and federal law, drug traffickers can receive the death penalty.

But personal bitterness isn't a way to build a bright future for Chicago.\"\n\nAhhh, but don't forget about the $50k: Team McCarthy held up Trump's kind words toward Emanuel in 2011 and the ties between Emanuel's brother Ari and Trump. McCarthy's campaign also offered a reminder about Trump's $50,000 contribution that the mayor has refused to return. Emanuel has said that if he returned the money, it would only have put more money into Trump's pocket as he took on Hillary Clinton in 2016. In a statement, McCarthy said this on Trump: \"Let me be clear: I think Trump has had a disastrous, chaotic Presidency that has weakened America in significant ways.

The Republican governor slammed Democrat Michael Madigan during a campaign stop at Ace Sign. Co. in Springfield. He alleged the speaker has used his legislative post to help lower the property tax assessments for clients at his law firm. \"When a politician can raise taxes through the policies that he implements by controlling the General Assembly and ... then he can become a millionaire by having a property-tax appeal law firm on the side where he charges businesses to get their taxes reduced, that is basically in effect a mafia-protection racket,\" Rauner said.\" Story here\n\nRAUNER REBUILDING?\n\nIt's a long road ahead: From Republican Rep.

But for that to happen, you're going to have to check your ego at the door and accept the General Assembly as a co-equal branch of government and admit that we don't work for you.\n\nFor a guy who made a fortune analyzing numbers, you've done a lousy job of understanding the rule of 60-30. You've been in office for almost four years and still haven't figured out that the only way to get rid of Mike Madigan is for Republicans to pick up nine seats in November. The real action needs to happen in the House races, but can you set your ego aside long enough to let that happen? I'm afraid that what we're going to get is seven months of you chanting Madigan! Madigan! and more Madigan! with the hope that repeating it often enough will make him disappear.

Proft's chosen candidates, though, did win primaries in several districts where sitting lawmakers didn't run for re-election, and his political action committee scored a victory by defeating state Rep.

                "title": "Sam Nunberg Is Still Talking ",
                "body": "Crazy man or chessmaster? 4 hours with Donald Trump's wildest adviser.\n\nFirst, Sam Nunberg made plans to meet me for lunch, but canceled at the last minute. So now we've made plans for dinner at his favorite Vietnamese spot near his Upper East Side apartment, but when he arrives 20 minutes late, Nunberg says he has already eaten at the same restaurant earlier in the day, and that he is having dinner with his mother later, so no food for him, just one Thai iced coffee after another that he cuts with water from his water glass.\n\nWords tumble out of Nunberg in a torrent, not always cohering into sentences, and occasionally contradicting something he said a few minutes ago. At our nondinner, he apologies for his ADD as he keeps going outside to vape.\n\nSam Nunberg was a name known only to a small coterie of political journalists until March 5, when it suddenly became inescapable. In a media barrage that will forever be known as The Full Nunberg, the former Donald Trump campaign aide streaked across the media landscape like a falling satellite. First he told The Washington Post that he had been subpoenaed by special counsel Robert Mueller but wouldn't show up. He then phoned in live to MSNBC's Katy Tur, telling her that he thought it would be funny if Mueller arrested him for contempt of court and that \"Trump may very well have\" colluded with Russia during the election. Then he called CNN to assert that Trump didn't have anything to do with Russia, then CNN again and said that maybe Trump did, actually. He told POLITICO that Trump couldn't have colluded because he \"can't keep his fucking mouth shut.\" It didn't end there. He repeated variations of his claims on the local news station NY1, then on MSNBC again, where a fellow panelist seemingly convinced him live on air that he would be looking at serious jail time if he didn't comply with the subpoena, and finally CNN again where host Erin Burnett asked point-blank if Nunberg was drunk. In the meantime, there were interviews with New York, The Atlantic, Vox, The Associated Press and The New York Times.\n\nPolitical Twitter went nuts. In newsrooms across America, Nunberg vanished from one screen in the TV bank only to reappear on another. Friends feared they were watching a spectacular flame-out, someone having a nervous breakdown in public and determined to go out in a blaze of glory. To Nunberg -- or at least to hear him tell it now -- it was all carefully choreographed. He was perfectly in control, seizing the chance for time in the spotlight, an out-in-the-cold political consultant cleverly leveraging the media's hunger for any inside dope about Trump.\n\nOur dinner ended up lasting nearly four hours, and at the end I'm still not sure whether his accomplishment was a triumph or an embarrassment. And at a time when Trump is president -- a national spectacle that Nunberg himself helped engineer -- I'm also not sure it matters anymore. There's no question, however, it was a perfect moment for our political-media age: Someone willing to bungee jump without making sure that the knot was tight enough, and a world thirsty to know what he knew about a similarly reckless administration. Was he a crazy man, or a chessmaster?\n\n***\n\nEveryone who has encountered Sam Nunberg has a theory about him, and nobody is quite sure which theory is right, in part because Nunberg himself is as unreliable a narrator as you can find. He's known for making up stories to tell the press -- and then making up stories about those stories, so coverage turns into a hall of mirrors whose only occupant appears to be Nunberg, or (in better times) his political client.\n\nWhat drew Nunberg to politics, and to Trump, was Roy Cohn. The actual Cohn was a knife fighter of the legal world, a mentor to the young Trump who inspired the mogul's punch-back-harder, never-back-down political style. But Nunberg is talking about the Cohn of Angels in America, the one portrayed by Al Pacino, especially the part where he tells his young protege how he would have pulled the switch to execute Ethel Rosenberg himself if he could have -- how he leaned on the judge in her espionage case to put that \"sweet unpreposessing woman, two kids, boo-hoo-hoo, reminded us all of our little Jewish mamas\" to death.\n\n\"Was it legal? Fuck legal,\" Nunberg says, jabbing his finger in the air and slowing down for a second in his best Pacino impression. \"Am I a nice man? Fuck nice! They say terrible things about me in The Nation? Fuck The Nation! You want to be nice or you want to be effective?! You want to make the law, or be subject to it? Choose!\"\n\nNunberg pauses, and resumes his own cadence. \"Now, is that good, is that bad, I don't know, whatever,\" he says. \"To me that just showed hard grit, tough, you can tell Roy Cohn, obviously Jewish, you know, tough guy, fighter, doesn't fuck around, was trying to work the system for himself.\"\n\n\"The idea that that was depicted as being bad,\" he says, \"that to me was ironic, because by the way, that's the way the sauce is made. It was like almost Machiavellian to me. But it's an out-front Machiavelli. He was open about it. On the one hand, you don't want your enemy to see you coming, but sometimes you want people to think of you as a crazy man.\"\n\nThe person sitting across from me appears to be the opposite of the diminutive, tightly focused Cohn. There's something hard to pin down about Nunberg. On one hand, he looks older than his 36 years, dark circles under his eyes suggesting sleepless nights, but on the other he can seem a bit like a child inflated to adult size. Cohn was a ruthlessly successful lawyer who divided his time between New York, Washington and a country house in Connecticut. Nunberg just moved out of his parents' house. Cohn was a killer; Nunberg, as former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo put it, \"is not a backstabbing soulless climber in an arena where that is almost required.\" (One friend of Nunberg's described him more as \"a yenta,\" someone who thrives on political gossip, true or not, calling friends in the political world dozens of times a day to find out the latest.) Cohn was tanned and dandyish, an aficionado of the plastic surgeon's scalpel; Nunberg is dressed plainly, in blue jeans and a sweater, though he does plan to stop by the tanning salon before it closes.\n\n\"I like to say I am only bad to three people in my life,\" Nunberg says. \"People that are disloyal to me, people that hurt my friends. Well, OK, four people. People that are disloyal to me, people that hurt my friends, people that hurt my clients, people that my clients hire me to hurt, and myself occasionally, unfortunately.\"\n\nHe pauses for a moment\n\n\"OK, so that's five. Those are the five people I am bad to.\"\n\n***\n\nSam Nunberg first crossed paths with Donald Trump on April 2, 1989. It was WrestleMania V. Nunberg's father is an attorney, and worked with Gerald Schrager, Trump's longtime real estate attorney and adviser. They were sitting behind Donald and Ivana, and Donald moved the Nunbergs so he could get into a photo shot with some dignitary sitting on the other side of the ring. Nunberg was then a student at Ramaz, an elite private Jewish school on the Upper East Side that counts Michael Mukasey and Philippe Reines as alumni. His mother was a corporate attorney at the white-shoe law firm Wachtell, Lipton, and counted Bain Capital as one of her clients. They were Democrats until the Clinton era -- Nunberg interned with Upper West Side liberal lion Jerry Nadler -- when the household became, in Nunberg's words, \"Clinton-haters.\" He started listening to Mark Levin on the radio.\n\nAfter college, inspired he said, by the movie Men in Black, Nunberg enrolled in Touro Law School, a fourth-tier, $40,000-a-year law school on Long Island. There he restarted the law school's Federalist Society, using it to build up a network in conservative politics. When the 2008 campaign rolled around, even though his father had done legal work for members of the Rudy Giuliani administration when they left City Hall, Nunberg volunteered for his rival in the Republican primary, Mitt Romney.\n\n\"Mitt was the most conservative candidate in the race. Frankly, he looked the best out of everybody,\" Nunberg says. \"And going to Touro Law School, if I went to go work for the Rudy campaign, I would be licking envelopes for the students at NYU Law School. I hate to be, but you know what I mean.\"\n\nHe traveled to Iowa with the Romney campaign, where, he says, he and a couple of other campaign aides concocted a stunt: They would mail anonymous letters to Iowa pastors, warning them that the IRS would come after them if they endorsed Mike Huckabee. The letters were sent from Missouri to make them less traceable.\n\n\"It was the first time I made the Drudge Report!\" Nunberg says now with evident pride.\n\nIn Iowa, he met Jay Sekulow, who leads the American Center for Law and Justice, a nonprofit founded by Pat Robertson to advocate for Christian values. (Sekulow, a right-wing messianic Jew who also hosts a radio show, is now on Trump's personal legal team.) Sekulow hired him for the group's fledgling New York operation, and in 2010, when a Manhattan developer named Sharif El-Gamal attempted to build an Islamic community center in lower Manhattan, Nunberg got his first chance to kick up a dirt storm on the political scene.\n\nThe issue was the \"Ground Zero Mosque,\" a building that was neither at Ground Zero nor a mosque. Anti-Islamic firebrands like Pamela Geller seized on the issue, and tried to whip up public anger at the idea of an Islamic anything near the site of World Trade Center attacks. At ACLJ, there was some hesitancy about getting involved in the issue, and \"I was like, 'Are you kidding me? This is going to be a national fucking issue! It is going to be an international issue!'\" Nunberg says.\n\nAt a Landmarks Preservation Commission hearing, Nunberg represented a fireman who was opposed to the construction of the center, and he introduced testimony from his own uncle, who lived near the site. Building the center \"would be like removing the sunken ship in Pearl Harbor to erect a memorial to the Japanese kamikazes killed in the attack,\" Nunberg told me with a big laugh. He was quoting himself. \"It became an international soundbite!\" (This is true -- the soundbite landed Nunberg on NPR, was picked up by a number of newspapers and became part of the official talking points in opposition to the project.)\n\nThere was a Republican primary for governor going on in New York, and Nunberg decided to see who'd be willing to take it on as a campaign issue. He says he took the story to the front-runner, former Congressman Rick Lazio, but his campaign team was ambivalent about it. Then he took it to Carl Paladino, a Buffalo developer running a long-shot campaign, and someone who had promised to take a baseball bat to Albany's entrenched political class. Paladino seized on the issue immediately, promising to use eminent domain to prevent the building's construction. He won the primary by 24 points.\n\nAs Nunberg tells the story, he kept going, and took the issue national. He says he began calling the White House desks of news organizations like AP and Reuters from an undisclosed number, leaving harassing phone messages asking, \"You chicken shits, when are you going to ask [White House press secretary Robert] Gibbs about the ground zero mosque?\"\n\nEventually someone did, and Gibbs responded that the White House didn't want to get involved in local decision-making. But later, President Barack Obama did mention it. At a gathering at the White House the Friday evening before the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Obama said he believed \"Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan.\"\n\n\"It was at the Iftar dinner!\" Nunberg says. \"Are you fucking kidding me?! That was like manna from heaven.\"\n\nIt is hard to know how much of this account -- or the Huckabee letters, or meeting Trump at WrestleMania -- is, not to put too fine a point on it, bullshit. The checkable facts largely check out, but Nunberg is known as someone willing to traffic in untruths with reporters. \"He likes to spread lies,\" said one associate of Nunberg's. \"He loves to see some lie he told get into print. He thinks it's hilarious.\"\n\nMost famously, he made up a story about Chris Christie fetching cheeseburgers for Trump on the campaign -- an anecdote that made its way into The New Yorker and which he said was justified because \"I despise Chris Christie. So I kept going around telling every reporter watch that fat-ass go buy hamburgers for Trump like a good little bitch.\" (To try to track down the true story of the story is to enter that Nunberg hall of mirrors: He claims to have made up the story, but also, in his telling, it doesn't count as making it up since it turned out to be true. A Christie spokesman vociferously denied the account, and the reporter who first brought the story to light, Ryan Lizza, then with the The New Yorker, stands by it and has denied Nunberg was his source, and for that matter, so has Nunberg.)\n\nNunberg tells me his favorite book is Trust Me, I Am Lying by former American Apparel media stuntman Ryan Holiday. \"There is something about manipulating media that I love. It's like Katy Tur said: 'Who is Sam Nunberg? You gotta talk to him. Occasionally, he will give you something that is true, but usually you need to confirm it with three other people.'\"\n\nThe person who really connected Nunberg with Trump is the man who he cites as his mentor: Roger Stone, the legendary dirty trickster of Republican politics, with a massive tattoo of Richard Nixon's face across his back. Nunberg became enamored of Stone for appearing, at least, to have orchestrated the downfall of New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer. (Later, when Spitzer attempted a comeback run for New York City comptroller, Nunberg and Stone trolled him mercilessly, convincing a woman who claimed to operate a brothel that Spitzer frequented to run against him as a Libertarian, and bringing black socks -- which Spitzer was said to keep on during his liaisons -- to the victory night party of his opponent.) During the ground zero mosque controversy, he says, he met Stone at a bar during the New York state Republican convention. Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, was working for Paladino. That same summer, Trump offered to buy the site where the ground zero mosque was supposed to be built for $6 million, a move that was dismissed by the developer's attorneys as a \"cheap publicity stunt.\"\n\nNunberg says it was Stone who arranged for him to meet Trump for the first time. It was 2011, and Stone and Jonny Daniels, a PR agent who counts Benjamin Netanyahu as among his clients, wanted Trump to visit Israel in the run-up to another possible presidential campaign. Nunberg told him about their family connection and about meeting him at WrestleMania years before, and Trump hired him as a political jack-of-all trades, printing out news articles, keeping an eye out for political gossip, doing research and writing, handling the press and later mapping out a way that Trump could run as an independent in 2012.\n\nUntil he was broomed out four years later, Nunberg never left.\n\nTrump had been a clownish figure around New York for most of Nunberg's childhood, someone more famous for talking about sex with Howard Stern than trying to stir up populist anger against the Washington swamp. Most people in the elite Upper East Side world of private schools and corporate law firms -- the world Nunberg inhabited -- rolled their eyes at the thought of Trump, if they thought of him at all. Nunberg, though, was intrigued by the brashness and the airbrushed glamour.\n\nHe started dressing like Trump in flashy suits and ostentatious ties. He watched how would-be presidents and potentates came to kiss the ring at Trump Tower, and how Trump dealt with critics. Nunberg says he and Stone started dictating tweets to Trump's longtime assistant Rhona Graff, and Nunberg would map out on a spreadsheet a running tally of what Trump tweeted about to make sure his business and brands got enough airplay. When Jon Huntsman pointedly refused to supplicate himself before Trump like other rivals to the GOP nomination in 2012, Stone and Nunberg counseled Trump to go on the attack. \"@JonHuntsman has zero chance of getting the nomination,\" Trump tweeted. \"Whoever said I wanted to meet him? Time is money and I don't waste mine.\"\n\n\"It blew up!\" says Nunberg. \"It was on 'Entertainment Tonight,' it was in People Magazine. People were saying that Huntsman was Trump's new Rosie.\"\n\nWhen no one believed that Trump would actually run for president, let alone could win, Nunberg believed. \"To him, Donald Trump hung the moon,\" Caputo said\n\nCaputo, a veteran political adviser to Trump, looks at Nunberg with an almost older-brother like affection, and he gives Nunberg significant credit for helping lay out the themes and the approach to the campaign that would launch Trump to the White House. \"His DNA was all over the Trump campaign. Corey [Lewandowski] may have set him up to win, and [Paul] Manafort got him through the convention and Kellyanne [Conway] got him over the finish line, but none of that would have happened if it weren't for Sam.\"\n\nNunberg says the idea of a border wall with Mexico was his, inspired by watching how Paladino and Lazio approached the idea of the ground zero mosque. \"Well, I don't know, maybe we need to let some of these people in, maybe we put some of them in the back of the line, maybe we do this, maybe we do that,\" he said in his best impression of an immigration squish. \"No, fuck that! We are building a wall and we are deporting them all. Trump's a builder anyway. And you get Mexico to pay for it! It's like one of his licensing deals!\"\n\nAs it happened, Nunberg barely survived into the campaign. He lost his job with Trump in August 2015 when Business Insider published a series of racist Facebook posts Nunberg had written eight years before, including one in which he called Al Sharpton's daughter a \"n---!\" Nunberg admits to writing them, and knows it was a mistake. He blames their excavation on Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager who he said had it in for him from the beginning.\n\nAfterward, Nunberg fell into deep and lasting depression. He says he had trouble getting out of bed, and couldn't read or work. He credits Steve Bannon with helping him get back on his feet by giving him a bit of work, as well as the GOP operative Arthur Schwartz.\n\n\"That was bad. That a very hard experience. And I wasn't good to myself. I don't want to get into it but I wasn't. It took therapy, and it took help from other people,\" he says, \"and I will admit that. And there is nothing wrong with that. But I wasn't good to myself. I wasn't.\"\n\nNunberg watched from the sidelines as the political animal he helped feed made it all the way to the White House. As the Russia investigation intensified, he was cut off from old friends like Bannon and Stone. And as the White House whipped through personnel changes, Nunberg, whose life is political gossip, found himself less and less in the know. He would occasionally appear on the record or on background in stories about Trump when the perspective of a \"former campaign aide\" was needed, but even those calls had begun to dry up.\n\n***\n\nWhen Nunberg was subpoenaed by Robert Mueller in the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the campaign, \"It brought stuff back in. At the same time I was getting these calls [from bookers and reporters] and it is almost like I am manic.\"\n\n\"So imagine, holy shit, I was called a low-level part-time consultant and suddenly I am pulling of one of the greatest media days of all time.\"\n\nHe views March 5 as a form of therapy, and as an unqualified professional success\n\n\"This is a fact: When I did Ari Melber he won in total viewers and the demo. When I did Erin Burnett, she won in total viewers and the demo,\" he said, reiterating a point he brought up to me repeatedly. (He later texted me, unprompted, with a screen grab of the ratings on the date in question.) \"Did you notice there was one station I didn't go on that day? Fox. You know why? They are the only ones that never invited me on before. That day, I had like eight invitations from them to come on different shows, and I can show them to you.\"\n\nFriends were convinced Nunberg was drunk on air, and were emailing and texting television producers and hosts to get him off. Burnett asked him about it on air, telling him that she could smell alcohol on his breath. \"She says to me, 'Are you on something?' And you know what I wanted to say? 'Yeah, I am on something -- I am on your show, giving you ratings like you never had before.'\"\n\nThe affair set off a round of media finger-wagging, with some political journalists suggesting -- at the urging of Nunberg's friends -- that it was unethical to put him in front of all those television cameras. He was having some kind of psychotic break, he was drunk on the attention, or he was just plain drunk.\n\nNunberg isn't having any of it. He'd had a drink the day before, he says, and went to his favorite bar afterward, the preppy New York enclave Dorrian's Red Hand, but all he had that day was his antidepressant medication.\n\n\"People told me I was used and abused. I knew what I was doing. I could have stopped it any time if I wanted to,\" he said. \"I heard someone on TV say, 'Oh Sam, he's an unbelievable attention-seeker.' There you are, sitting on fucking TV and you are telling me I am the attention-seeker.\"\n\nNunberg thinks Trump probably appreciated his television tour -- the brashness of it, for one, and the fact that he was able to command so much media attention for one night.\n\nIt was he said, a way to communicate with Trump, too. To say, \"Why do I have to be drawn into your bullshit? I don't do anything to you. I want you to be successful. You know, I have a weird relationship with him. Maybe one day I can, maybe one day not. I like him. Why do I have to be drawn into his bullshit?\"\n\nWhen Trump fired him, as Nunberg recounts it, he told him it wasn't just the Facebook posts. He told Nunberg, \"Every few months there is something new with you.\"\n\n***\n\nIf Trump did indeed tell that to Nunberg, he was right. Even cast into the outer darkness of the Trumpian orbit, Nunberg sees himself as a political operative of the highest order, always hatching, or getting embroiled in, something new. \"There aren't that many people at my level, I can tell you that,\" he said when asked about which current political professionals he admires. Like Trump, and like Cohn for that matter, Nunberg never forgets. It's been 2½ years since he was fired, and he remains at war with anyone who he thinks slighted him, ever.\n\nWhen the Drudge Report published the news that Trump had named Brad Parscale his 2020 campaign manager, it was the same day that it was announced that Jared Kushner was losing his security clearance and that top Kushner aide Josh Raffel was leaving the White House. Nunberg, who considers Kushner a leftist who leaked to Drudge, sent an email to Drudge with the subject line, \"Sorry Asshole.\"\n\n\"Your little escapade failed,\" Nunberg wrote. \"The Parscale announcement doesn't outdo Raffel leaving and your crush losing his security access. Fuck you sellout bitch hypocrite. You useless aggregator. Go shoot yourself up with more drugs. Warm regards, Sam.\"\n\nAnd Nunberg continues to be at war with Lewandowski. He told me with evident pride that he orchestrated the story of Lewandowski and Hope Hicks' argument that landed on Page Six in New York Post. \"We are like high school mean girls. The whole Trump circle. We fight and we try to kill each other and then some of us make up in a week and some of us don't and some of us will always hate each other.\"\n\nTrump and Nunberg haven't talked since December 2015, Nunberg says. That's when Gawker published Trump's cellphone number, and Trump accused Nunberg of leaking it. (Nunberg thinks Lewandowski did it just to undermine him, so that Trump would be forced to abandon his cellphone and Nunberg would be unable to communicate with him.) He wrote Trump a letter after he was elected, telling him how proud he was of the president. Trump wrote a nice note back.\n\n\"I said a lot of bad things that day when I was stressed out [on television.] He did give me a lot of chances, and if it was up to him I would be on that campaign. He is not a bad guy. He is actually a sweet guy, frankly. He has a heart.\"\n\nCaputo says all of the people from the early of days of the Trump for president gambit are \"like an island of misfit toys. Sam is the jack-in-the-box.\n\n\"He left his heart in Trump Tower,\" Caputo said. \"I just hope he finds it someday.\"\n\nUnlike some others who fell out of Trump's orbit, Nunberg has nothing to fall back on -- no job on Wall Street, no Kennedy School post waiting for him. He can't, or won't, leverage his former access to the White House to get work. He has a small consulting business that has only three clients for now, all of whom he declined to name. Nunberg listens to Preet Bharara's podcast to find out what's going on in the Russia investigation -- and if he gets wrapped up in it further, it will cost him tens of thousands of dollars. Someone who just got back on his feet could easily find himself knocked off them again, and his star turn before the klieg lights doesn't appear to have helped matters much.\n\nThe lure of those lights, however, is not something he has been able to avoid. In fact, Nunberg's media tour has slowed down only slightly since that Monday. He was on Ari Melber the next day, and ABC radio, and CNN, and was fielding requests throughout our conversation. They get less and less attention though, just another talking head talking his way through the news of the day. After his star turn digging in against Mueller, he quickly reversed himself and said he would in fact cooperate with the special counsel.\n\nOur dinner, such as it was, ended sometime around 10 p.m. He kept checking the mirror, wondering if he needed to get to the tanning salon, if his face was too red for TV. His mother kept calling, and he kept on pushing back their dinner, eventually canceling it, saying he was being interviewed for a profile. \"Why don't you shut that stuff down?\" she wanted to know. Eventually he had to go. The tanning salon was about to close, and he needed one more turn under the lights.",

                "title": "How To Succeed in Trump's Cabinet Without Getting Fired",
                "body": "Defense Secretary James Mattis seems to know how to disagree with the president and get away with it.\n\nLast July, James Mattis and Rex Tillerson arranged a tutoring session at the Pentagon for President Donald Trump in the secure, windowless meeting room known as \"The Tank.\" The plan was to lay out why American troops are deployed in far-flung places across the globe, like Japan and South Korea. Mattis spoke first.\n\n\"The postwar, rules-based international order is the greatest gift of the greatest generation,\" Mattis told the president, according to two meeting attendees. The secretary of defense walked the president through the complex fabric of trade deals, military agreements and international alliances that make up the global system the victors established after World War II, touching off what one attendee described as a \"food fight\" and a \"free for all\" with the president and the rest of the group. Trump punctuated the session by loudly telling his secretaries of state and defense, at several points during the meeting, \"I don't agree!\" The meeting culminated with Tillerson, his now ousted secretary of state, fatefully complaining after the president left the room, that Trump was \"a fucking moron.\"\n\nTrump is said to divide the members of his Cabinet into first-tier \"killers\" and second-tier \"winners.\" Mattis is indisputably a killer, but he's also something rarer: a sometime loser -- of policy arguments, that is -- who manages to disagree with the president without squandering his clout or getting under Trump's skin. He opposed Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord, decertify the Iran deal, slap tariffs on steel and aluminum, and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He opposes the president's proposed ban on transgender service members and has reportedly ignored requests from the White House to see plans for a military strike against North Korea.\n\nYet Mattis has been able to present the president with views he doesn't like without bearing the brunt of his frustration. The departure of H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser, was announced Thursday amid rumors that the president is poised to fire beleaguered Cabinet secretaries like David Shulkin of Veterans Affairs and Ben Carson of Housing and Urban Development, and is agonizing over whether to dismiss John Kelly, his chief of staff. Mattis' name has been conspicuously absent. One senior administration official called him \"bulletproof.\"\n\nOf the Cabinet selections and staff picks cheered by Trump critics, including McMaster, Kelly and former chairman of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn, Mattis is the only one who seems to still have job security. Trump remains as enthused about Mattis, one of his first Cabinet picks, as he was when he tapped him for the job in December 2016, according to several White House aides.\n\nEven his detractors on the right are reluctant to criticize Mattis, a retired Marine general who fought in both Gulf wars and Afghanistan, on the record, either because they are looking to join the administration or because, despite their disagreements, they are happy he's there. Those critics say privately that Mattis is too cautious and conventional in his thinking, and that he doesn't sufficiently appreciate the political nature of his current job. But \"they regard him as better than the likely alternatives,\" one such critic told me, and consider him \"a restraining hand on an otherwise unpredictable and impulsive president.\"\n\nPeople close to the president sense that on a subset of important issues, he will defer to Mattis, who represents an institution, the military, that the president venerates, and whose status as a combat veteran has earned him Trump's respect. In contrast with, say, Cohn, who had to contend with the fact that Trump considers himself a business expert, Mattis benefits from serving a president who has never claimed to understand the military or international affairs. White House aides say Trump is cowed and intimidated by Mattis, who peppers his comments with aphorisms and historical arcana gleaned from his extraordinary personal library.\n\nJohn Bolton's arrival in April as the president's new national security adviser will give Mattis a more ardent and skillful adversary at the National Security Council. Mattis outranked McMaster in military terms and always considered him his junior, even though Mattis is retired. He likely won't view Bolton that way, and Bolton prizes his ability to corral the bureaucracy for his purposes.\n\nMattis, who was pushed out of the military by President Barack Obama because of his hawkish views on Iran, also sees eye to eye with Trump on plenty of policy matters, chief among them the importance of rebuilding the military. So the secretary of defense has, for example, stayed quiet about the president's request for a costly military parade, tentatively set for November, but has secured a 10 percent budget increase for the Pentagon. Both White House and Pentagon aides say Mattis has also been more discreet than some of his colleagues when he disagrees with the president, never undermining him publicly except in congressional testimony. \"He makes his recommendations, gives his advice, and it's up to the president to decide,\" says Dana White, Mattis' Pentagon spokeswoman.\n\nThe president goes gaga for the sort of tough talk Mattis dished out on the battlefield. \"There's nothing better than getting shot at and missed,\" Mattis has said. He doesn't run the Pentagon like \"Mad Dog\" the Marine, but White House aides say he has endeared himself to President Trump by continuing to play the part in front of him -- never showing weakness and maintaining the aura of invincibility with which he entered the job.\n\n\"Mattis has figured out how to play Trump perfectly. He keeps his head down and keeps his face out of the news,\" says Tom Ricks, a columnist for the military news site Task & Purpose and the author of several books on military affairs. Mattis, said Ricks, is a \"natural-born killer,\" and \"Trump, just like dogs smell fear, I think somebody like Trump who has very little natural courage, just smells it.\"\n\n***\n\nMattis has told friends he doesn't like the nickname he acquired as a battlefield commander, but the fact that he rose to prominence as \"Mad Dog\" made him a subject of immediate fascination for a president-elect whose concept of military valor was shaped largely by the movie \"Patton.\" (Some might say Mattis bears a passing resemblance to a younger George C. Scott, who played the hard-charging Gen. George Patton in the 1970 film, a Trump favorite.)\n\n\"The secretary of defense is not simply 'Mad Dog' Mattis the Marine; he's really a thoughtful guy,\" says Mark Perry, the author of \"The Pentagon's Wars.\" Perry says Mattis possesses a chameleon-like quality that allows him to be the Platonic ideal of a warrior at one turn, and a monkish scholar at another.\n\nAppearing on Face the Nation last May, Mattis played the warrior when CBS News' John Dickerson asked him, \"What keeps you awake at night?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Mattis told him. \"I keep other people awake at night.\" The response delighted the president, who told several White House aides how much he liked it. In private, Mattis talks with the president the same way. \"He's said similar things several times,\" said a former White House aide. \"Trump loves it.\"\n\nMattis channeled the same sentiment when he was asked, in early February, whether he had any misgivings about the president's plans for a military parade. \"I'm not paid for my feelings,\" he replied. \"I save those for my girlfriend.\"\n\nThe president talks about Mattis in public and behind closed doors like he is still a battlefield commander. Trump asked top-dollar Republican donors last September, for example, what they thought of Mattis and bragged, \"The guy never loses a battle, never loses. Winning record.\"\n\nThe irony of all of this is that, by all accounts, Mattis is deeply committed to protecting the military from politics. Some describe him as a conservative Democrat, but he has taken great care to keep his political views private and has been open about his belief that national security should be a bipartisan matter. That said, he has clashed behind the scenes not only with the president but also with some of his closest advisers, from McMaster and Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley to Jared Kushner and, before them, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and McMaster predecessor Michael Flynn.\n\nMattis worked from the outset to make diplomatic overtures to presidential aides, including Bannon and Kushner, but also Cohn, Flynn and Flynn's deputy, K.T. McFarland, all of who could have thwarted his personnel preferences and policy preferences. Mattis' senior adviser, Sally Donnelly, who left the Pentagon last month, led these diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe work began immediately, on December 7, on the plane to North Carolina, when Mattis formally accepted the president's nomination as secretary of defense. On the plane ride to the event, Mattis and Donnelly joined the president-elect -- along with Bannon, Kushner, and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer -- and they began a discussion about how Mattis would staff the Pentagon.\n\nDonnelly's first request was that they be allowed to retain a handful of senior Obama administration officials at the Pentagon, including Bob Work, the Defense Department's No. 2. The White House acceded. Mattis personally spoke with Bannon about his desire to bring on Michele Flournoy, who was the leading candidate to be Hillary Clinton's secretary of defense, as his deputy to replace Work -- a move that raised hackles among conservatives both in and out of government. Although Flournoy ultimately withdrew herself from consideration, it was not because of White House objections to her nomination. Likewise, Mattis' pick to run the Pentagon's policy shop, retired diplomat Anne Patterson, was pulled from consideration not over White House objections, but because Republicans on Capitol Hill threatened to veto her nomination.\n\n\"On all of the appointments, they were fully open in coming to me and saying, 'Hey, these are the guys we think are the best team,' and I said, 'Fine,'\" Bannon says. \"And Trump told me, 'Get the general the guys he thinks are the best team.' They played totally straight with that.\"\n\nVisiting Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, the second weekend after he was elected, Mattis and the president-elect discussed how to conduct a war against ISIS, which Mattis made clear would \"not be a war of attrition, it's going to be a war of annihilation,\" according to a source familiar with the discussion. \"Trump couldn't get enough of it,\" this person says.\n\nAt the same time, Mattis told Trump he disagreed with his views on torture -- Trump had said he was strongly in favor of it -- and, by the time the meeting ended, he seemed to have chastened the soon-to-be commander in chief.\n\n\"'He said, 'I've never found it to be useful,'\" Trump recounted after the meeting. He went on to say that Mattis told him he found it more useful to build trust with terror suspects. \"I was very impressed by that answer,\" Trump said.\n\nThe goodwill Mattis engendered with the White House has given him freedom not only to disagree with the president when he sees fit, but also to run the Pentagon without political interference from the White House -- much to the chagrin, at times, of the National Security Council and others close to the president.\n\nThe Trump administration and the president himself say they are decentralizing what was, in the Obama era, a defense policy run largely out of the West Wing. The president and his advisers have worked to devolve decision-making to Mattis and the combatant commanders who report to him. They have left the American military's war against ISIS, for example, largely in his hands. After making the decision to strike Syria in April 2017, Trump delegated to Mattis how and when carry out the strikes.\n\nWhen the White House does make requests, national security aides express frustration that their demands often go unanswered. According to two National Security Council officials, Mattis has ignored McMaster's requests for military options that would have allowed the U.S. to strike Eastern Gouta, in Syria, as well as requests to see plans on North Korea, and two requests for options to strike Iran -- one in response to a scenario in which the country sank an American ship in the Persian Gulf, another to the possibility that Iranian-funded Houthi missiles coming out of Yemen could strike the Riyadh airport in Saudi Arabia or the Saudi Aramco oil refinery.\n\n\"Mattis and Tillerson routinely ignored NSC requests on all sorts of things,\" says a second former White House official.\n\nThe Pentagon denies that Mattis has slow-walked any requests for military options. \"Secretary Mattis is committed to ensuring our diplomats always operate from a position of strength and options equal strength,\" White says.\n\n***\n\nWhatever tough talk Mattis dispenses to the president is measured and intentional. People close to him say he spends a lot of time thinking about how to communicate effectively, that he is always aware of his audience and that he often asks aides for a pithy quote to drive home a point. Friends and former colleagues say he was well aware of the position in which he entered the administration, uniquely admired by the news media. In contrast with his close friend and White House colleague John Kelly, he has been careful not to tarnish his reputation with inaccurate or ill-advised comments to the news media. He has steered clear of high-profile interviews and avoided making the sorts of off-the-record remarks that have, in some cases, cost his colleagues their jobs.\n\nAccording to a former senior White House official, the president once complained to Tillerson about his news coverage, asking him, \"How come you only get bad stories?\"\n\n\"Mattis only gets good stories,\" the former White House official says. \"The progressive media loves him, and it's one of the reasons Trump loves him.\"\n\nIt's a skill Mattis learned partly from watching his former colleague, then-Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, lose his job eight years ago after mocking President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in what he thought were off-the-record remarks to a Rolling Stone reporter. Before that, Mattis had his own unpleasant collision with the news media when he told a group of Marines at a 2005 event that it was, at times, \"a hell of a lot of fun\" to shoot people. Unbeknownst to him, cameras were rolling.\n\n\"You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil,\" Mattis said. \"You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\" The February 4, 2005, broadcast of NBC's \"Today\" show led with the video, with Katie Couric declaring: \"Fighting words. A decorated Marine Corps general raises eyebrows with these comments.\"\n\nThe Marine Corps brass at the time dismissed calls for Mattis' firing, and Mattis never formally apologized for the comment. But friends say the furor his remarks occasioned was enough to prompt some private reflection. For a Marine who likes to trade barbs, he learned that civilians have different sensitivities and that the news media will play up statements that have been made in jest. He began to choose his words more carefully.\n\nIn the Trump administration, where the president judges his Cabinet officials in large part based on the coverage they generate on television, Mattis has navigated the news media more deftly. He has appeared on just one Sunday morning news show during his time in office and rarely appears behind the lectern at the Pentagon. He seems to take pains never to overshadow the president.\n\nThose close to him dismiss the idea that Mattis has undertaken any sort of conscious strategy to enchant the president. Rather, they say, he is not a politician and simply isn't interested in publicity -- something, they note, that is hard for many Washingtonians to understand. He has fended off White House requests that he appear on Fox News, and his friends say that's not out of a concern for self-preservation but because he's just not interested in being on TV.\n\n\"Secretary Mattis doesn't change who he is for anyone, but he is a battle-hardened Marine, who can talk about Thucydides and Chesty Puller in the same breath,\" White says.\n\nReporters travel with Mattis as he jets from one foreign capital to another -- Tillerson generated a slew of negative headlines for abandoning this tradition at State -- but he is pointed in his refusal to answer questions that he considers \"out of his lane.\" That includes the events leading up to a potential meeting between the president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, about which Mattis told reporters, \"What I want you to understand is that right now every word is going to be nuanced and parsed apart across different cultures, at different times of the day, in different contexts, and right now I want a very straight line from those actually responsible, not from those of us in a supporting or background role.\"\n\nMcMaster, in contrast, said last month in Munich that the evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election was \"incontrovertible,\" prompting Trump to slap him down on Twitter.\n\nRunning Central Command under Obama, Mattis learned that presidents are particularly sensitive to what military leaders say about them. If watching McChrystal defenestrated didn't drive that home, his own experience did when, in 2013, he was ousted by the president for what the White House perceived as his outspoken hostility to the administration's diplomatic overtures to Iran. Mattis' frank remarks cost him access and, ultimately, his job.\n\n\"He was shut out of certain discussions at certain points,\" a former senior military commander said of Mattis' experience in the Obama administration. \"They sort of knew what they wanted to do, and they didn't want to hear what they didn't want to hear.\" The commander added, \"They told him, 'Thank you, we've heard your views on Iran, now go sit under a tree.'\"\n\nIt was useful preparation for his current role, working for a notoriously sensitive and temperamental commander in chief who has discarded advisers, including Tillerson, for disparaging him privately. Trump never forgave Tillerson for the NBC News report that the former secretary of state called him a moron.\n\n\"You won't ever hear Mattis quoted off the record saying Trump is dumb or an idiot -- he's careful,\" said Perry, the military historian.\n\nHis survival in the administration may depend on it.",

                "title": "'Oh my God...It's fake': Far right falls for hoax about Broward County sheriff",
                "body": "In the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre, the far-right fever swamps buzzed with false information and conspiracy theories about student \"crisis actors\" who were paid to lie about the mass shooting.\n\nBut ironically, conspiracy-minded conservatives fell for a political hoax involving a different kind of actor. The subject? Broward County's Democratic sheriff, Scott Israel.\n\nIsrael for the past month has been assailed as everything from a \"rapist\" to a philanderer to a crooked cop thanks to three old YouTube videos in which a mystery woman accused him of impregnating her when she was 17 and forcing her to get an abortion. The videos together have been viewed almost 130,000 times since the Feb. 14 shooting.\n\nBut all of it was a lie, the woman and her attorney, Yechezkel Rodal, now tell POLITICO, which found her by combing internet videos and social media.\n\n\"I was paid to say these things. I didn't even know what I was saying,\" said the woman, who spoke with POLITICO on condition of anonymity because she fears political retribution from Internet trolls or from the sheriff's office, which does not know her identity. \"I'm sorry ... It's fake.\"\n\nThe revelation comes amid growing concerns about the spate of conspiracy theories and \"false flag\" attacks surrounding recent mass shootings -- especially in Florida -- that are surfacing on right-wing and fringe media sites.\n\nThe videos were initially posted at the tail end of the bare-knuckle 2012 campaign when Israel defeated Republican incumbent Al Lamberti. Now living in New York, the woman said she was 17 at the time and didn't know Israel when an unknown person paid her $25 per video through the website www.fiverr.com, where she was hired by different companies to cut \"thousands\" of video testimonials for various products ranging from cell phone plans to diet programs. She expressed shock when informed Israel was sheriff and that the videos have become part of a smear campaign after the shooting.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" she said. \"How do I get this off YouTube?\"\n\nShe apparently can't. YouTube's parent company, Google, has refused her efforts and those of Israel to take them down -- an intransigence that illuminates how new media firms have become platforms for fake news and take little corporate responsibility to combat it.\n\nFlorida, in particular, has been fertile ground for school-shooting \"hoaxers.\" A Tampa-area woman was sentenced to six months in federal prison last year for threatening the Palm Beach County father of a 6-year-old murdered in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. In 2016, a professor was fired from Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton after alleging Sandy Hook was a hoax and that the parents were \"playing a role.\"\n\nAfter the Feb. 14 high school shooting that left 17 dead and 17 wounded in Parkland, Florida, students Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg were falsely called \"crisis actors\" as they criticized Republicans, President Trump and the National Rifle Association. Six days later, a Florida Republican state representative's aide was fired after telling the Tampa Bay Times that the two \"are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis [sic] when they happen.\"\n\nThe \"crisis actor\" myth was abetted the day before, according to the Washington Post, by the far-right website Gateway Pundit which ran a story headlined \"School Shooting Survivor Turned Activist David Hogg's Father in FBI, Appears To Have Been Coached On Anti-Trump Lines.\"\n\nThe website also initially disseminated a false story, later removed, that incorrectly said shooter Nikolas Cruz was a \"registered Democrat\" in a failed effort to discount media reports about his now-deleted social media profile that showed him with a \"Make America Great Again\" cap. Cruz had also been captured on video wearing that hat.\n\nSheriff Israel, who had also become a focus of conservative ire by then, was targeted in a Feb. 19 Gateway Pundit piece that promoted one of the phony videos in a story headlined \"Broward County Sheriff Accused of Having Affair With 17-Year-Old Girl, Forcing Her to Get Abortion.\"\n\nThe article, which referenced but didn't link to a rebuttal video from Israel's wife, explained that the \"video was unearthed as Sheriff Israel has began [sic] using his position to lobby for Democratic policies in the wake of last week's deadly school shooting.\"\n\nThe story linked to the phony videos was largely ignored by the mainstream news media. But it took off on Twitter. Nearly all of the videos' roughly 129,000 page views happened after the shooting. Of the 560 comments cumulatively attached to the three YouTube videos, only 12 were made before the shooting.\n\nAmy Rose, Israel's campaign manager in 2012 and 2016, said Israel and his staff were surprised at the return of the videos and the volume of vitriol in the comments on YouTube. She said they tried to have the videos removed in 2012, when they were pseudonymously posted by a \"Barry Israel\" in late October 2012.\n\n\"Now that these bogus, fake videos have been debunked we would ask that YouTube comply with our previous request (going back to 2012) and take them down!\" she said in a written statement to POLITICO. \"It's too bad that the young woman who was paid to repeat these lies can't identify the person who paid her to do so.\"\n\nAsked why it hasn't removed the videos, Google said in an email that \"YouTube has a built-in privacy complaint process, and we encourage people to let us know if videos or comments on the site violate their privacy. We may remove videos after receiving privacy complaints, which we review on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nThe statement added that company officials \"consider first person privacy requests\" and recommended the woman fill out a form \"so our teams have a record of this complaint.\"\n\nThe woman's attorney, Rodal, said she has also \"attempted to have the videos removed\" since POLITICO first contacted her this week, but to no avail. He said she wishes to \"remain anonymous to protect her reputation as well as to protect her safety in this volatile political climate.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office had been unable to find the woman or the person who hired her. A POLITICO reporter found her after posting Twitter messages linking to other videos the woman had made on other websites. A reader, recognizing the woman from a Florida college he attended with her, then contacted POLITICO with her identity. She spoke briefly with a POLITICO reporter and then referred questions to her attorney.\n\nRodal pointed out that she made the videos when she was 17 and didn't know any better. \"She has since moved on with her life and has begun a promising career in the health industry,\" he said in an email.\n\n\"She has never met Scott Israel. She had been hired by hundreds of other fiverr.com users and recorded hundreds of endorsement videos for many different products in the past,\" he said. \"She has not recorded any such videos in four years. She deeply regrets the videos and deeply regrets any harm that may have come to Scott Israel as a result.\"",

                "title": "John Bolton, the Anti-McMaster",
                "body": "Trump's new national security adviser is a unilateralist ideologue who has spent his career spitting in the face of global cooperation. Iran and North Korea are just the start.\n\nBy replacing the cautious H.R. McMaster with the fiery John Bolton as national security adviser, President Donald Trump is freeing himself of the last encumbrances on his increasingly strident unilateralism in world affairs. And the effects of this dramatic change are likely to go well beyond the renewed possibility of U.S. military attacks on both Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs, which Bolton has forcefully advocated. The blunt-spoken Bolton is a Yale-trained expert in international law who has spent a career seeking, ironically, to delegitimize the very idea of international law, and of multilateral action and organizations. Bolton can thus be expected to provide the president with just the intellectual gasoline he needs to ignite new hostilities on any number of global fronts, including an escalated trade war.\n\nDuring his decades in Washington, Bolton has earned a reputation as an uncompromising nationalist hawk. What is less understood is that Bolton arrived at these positions carefully, thoughtfully and consistently, as a militant libertarian thinker who has believed passionately that the United States has surrendered its sovereignty for far too long to multilateral treaties and organizations of all kinds, including the United Nations. In articles and speeches, he has gone so far to as to question whether \"globalism\" or international law have any legitimacy under the U.S. Constitution. In a 2000 essay in the Chicago Journal of International Law titled \"Should We Take Global Governance Seriously?\" Bolton cast the U.S. political debate as a clash between two \"parties\" -- what he called the \"Americanists\" versus the \"Globalists\" -- and that he, as a \"convinced Americanist,\" was engaged in a losing battle for America's very soul. \"Americanists find themselves surrounded by small armies of Globalists, each tightly clutching a favorite new treaty or multilateralist proposal,\" Bolton wrote.\n\nBolton then proceeded to attack nearly every major multilateral convention, including the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Global Warming, the Land Mines Convention in Ottawa and the International Criminal Court. Over the years, he also has taken on the Biological Weapons Convention and the World Trade Organization, among other multilateral treaties, and continues to do so. Trump's new unilateral trade tariffs against China will likely meet with his incoming national security adviser's approval.\n\nIn what has since become his mantra, Bolton wrote back then that globalism \"represents a kind of worldwide cartelization of governments and interest groups,\" and \"the costs to the United States -- reduced constitutional autonomy, impaired popular sovereignty, reduction of our international power, and limitations on our domestic and foreign policy options and solutions -- are far too great.\" This puts him at odds with the 70-odd year consensus that has guided U.S. foreign policy since World War II: that a world of rule-based cooperation rather than atavistic competition is ultimately in American interests, too.\n\nWhat lies behind Bolton's current stance against any deal with North Korea and the nuclear treaty with Iran is a long and embattled history of infighting that harks back to his unwavering determination to put his theoretical unilateralism into action. Because North Korea is an \"imminent threat,\" he wrote last month in a Wall Street Journal piece titled \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First,\" \"it is perfectly legitimate\" for the U.S. to strike without having to worry about any multilateral say-so. Similarly on Iran, Bolton wrote that the nuclear agreement negotiated by the Obama administration and approved by the U.N. Security Council was a \"diplomatic Waterloo.\"\n\nDuring his tenure as George W. Bush's under secretary of state for arms control, and later as a recess-appointed U.N. ambassador, Bolton often enraged U.S. allies with his recalcitrance to the point where both Secretary of State Colin Powell and his successor, Condoleezza Rice, sought to get rid of him. At a meeting in London in November 2003, Powell's counterpart, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, complained to the secretary of state that Bolton's belligerence was making it impossible to reach allied agreement on Iran's nuclear program. Powell turned to an aide and said, \"Get a different view,\" according to a government source at the time. Unbeknownst to Bolton, the aide then interviewed experts in Bolton's own Nonproliferation Bureau. The issue was resolved only after Powell adopted softer language recommended by these experts on how and when Iran might be referred to the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThat same year, British officials persuaded the White House to keep Bolton off the team negotiating with Libya to surrender its nuclear program. A crucial issue, according to sources involved in the affair, was the dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi's demand that if Libya abandoned its WMD program, the U.S. in turn would drop its goal of regime change. Bolton was unwilling to support this compromise, and the White House finally agreed to keep him \"out of the loop,\" as one source put it to my then-Newsweek colleague John Barry at the time. A deal was finally struck without him.\n\nIf nothing else, Bolton has proved unerringly true to his philosophical views. During his tension-filled career at the U.N. and State Department (he once told me in a 2002 interview that he felt surrounded by \"enemies\" at State), he consistently brooked no interference from allies and fulminated at interference from anyone, especially U.N. \"civil servants.\" Before he became U.N. ambassador -- in a recess appointment because even many Senate Republicans would not back him -- Bolton infamously proposed that if the U.N. Secretariat in New York \"lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\" When the No. 2 official at the U.N., Mark Malloch Brown, suggested that Americans were acting against their own interests when they bashed the world body, Bolton exploded. Malloch Brown, in a speech, warned Americans they could \"lose\" the organization if they continued \"the prevailing practice of seeking to use the U.N. almost by stealth as a diplomatic tool while failing to stand up for it against its domestic critics.\" In response, Bolton declared that Malloch Brown, as a mere \"international civil servant\" rather than a representative of an individual country, had no right to say such things. \"It's just illegitimate,\" Bolton said.\n\nArriving at a time when Trump appears to be giving voice more to his own anti-globalist and unilateralist instincts, Bolton will no doubt encourage these tendencies with a kind of career-vindicating glee. He will lend eager validation to the \"America First\" views that Trump has embraced since his presidential campaign: that the United States can and should act alone as it pleases. \"We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism,\" Trump said in his defining foreign-policy speech as a candidate in the spring of 2016. \"The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down.\" The language of Trump's in-your-face inaugural address echoed these views: \"From this moment on, it's going to be America First,\" he said.\n\nBolton's predecessor, H.R McMaster, an Army lieutenant general, was no soft-hearted globalist, but he was known to urge the president to be cautious in moving away from multilateral cooperation. Both McMaster and recently ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly were in favor of finding ways to maintain the Iran nuclear treaty, and both their policy views and their occasional differences in style were said to rankle the president. But in John Bolton -- and in the incoming secretary of state, the hawkish Mike Pompeo -- Donald Trump is likely getting a pair of full-throated cheerleaders.",

                "body": "'It is a very odd choice for someone who says he was against going to war in Iraq,' says one former Bush administration official. And that's not the only reason.\n\nFor the Donald Trump who preaches an \"America First\" foreign policy with little patience for international treaties and organizations, John Bolton is a logical choice for national security adviser. The former United Nations ambassador has said the U.N. could lose ten stories without anyone noticing and calls for ripping up the seven-nation Iran nuclear deal.\n\nFor the Donald Trump who as a 2016 candidate savaged supporters of the Iraq War and other Middle East military actions, Bolton is major a head-scratcher. He was a champion of George W. Bush's 2003 invasion of Iraq -- a decision he partially defends to this day -- and in recent years has also endorsed military action and regime change in Iran, Syria and Libya.\n\nForeign policy veterans of both parties familiar with the hawkish former diplomat, whom Trump picked Thursday to replace outgoing National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, say that Bolton's worldview is as much \"military first\" as it is \"America First.\"\n\nThe result is growing confusion about what Trump's foreign policy views really are -- and whether the president himself even knows what he thinks about the use of American military power.\n\n\"Trump says he wants a team that aligns with his views. How does the neocon of neocons -- of the most aggressive and ruthless persuasion -- align with a man who condemned our international overextension during his campaign?\" asked Loren DeJonge Schulman, who served as a senior aide to former President Barack Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice.\n\n\"It is a very odd choice for someone who says he was against going to war in Iraq,\" said Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, a center of Republican foreign policy scholarship who served as a senior adviser to the U.S. government in Iraq during the George W. Bush administration. \"It is a damn strange pick.\"\n\nAs recently as March 4, Trump called the invasion of Iraq \"the single worst decision ever made.\"\n\nAppearing on Fox News three days later, Bolton fended off host Tucker Carlson's critique of the Iraq War, saying: \"[L]ife is complicated in the Middle East. When you say the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a mistake, it's simplistic.\"\n\nAs a candidate in 2016, Trump vowed that the U.S. would \"stop racing to topple foreign regimes.\" Later that year, Bolton called regime change \"the only long-term solution\" to Iran's menacing behavior. (Bolton added that he was not calling for a military overthrow of the Iranian government.)\n\nEven as CNN reported Thursday night that Trump had told Bolton to promise him \"you won't start any wars,\" Democrats and foreign policy experts said they feared that Bolton might teach Trump to grow more comfortable with military action.\n\n\"I am concerned he and President Trump will make for a combustible combination,\" the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), said in a statement.\n\nTrump has already shown one unexpected flash of hawkishness, when he ordered cruise missile strikes against the Syria last April to punish the regime of Bashar Assad for using chemical weapons. But he has since shown no appetite for deeper involvement in the Syrian conflict.\n\nBolton's defenders say fears that he is a dangerous warmonger are overblown. His decades of government experience and what they call a rigorous intellect honed at Yale Law School make him well-suited to counsel an inexperienced president, they say.\n\n\"He's an excellent choice to take the baton from General McMaster,\" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, one of Trump's strongest supporters -- and one of his party's leading hawks -- said in a statement.\n\nAnd despite their major differences on Iraq and the wisdom of U.S. regime change policies, Trump and Bolton do relish defying Washington foreign policy orthodoxy on several key issues.\n\nIn one recent article, Bolton argued for why the United States has the legal authority to launch a preemptive strike on North Korea.\n\n\"Given the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute,\" he wrote for the conservative American Enterprise Institute, where he has been a researcher for years. \"That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation.\n\nTrump has warned North Korea he is prepared to \"totally destroy\" the country, and his advisers have studied the possibility of striking first to prevent it from developing an ICBM capable of hitting the U.S. with a nuclear warhead.\n\nIn another article, titled \"beyond the Iran deal,\" he laid out his reasoning for why the nuclear pact reached with Tehran in 2014 should no longer be respected. Trump has called that agreement \"the worst deal ever\" and chafed at efforts by McMaster and his departing secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, to convince him to preserve it.\n\nWhen it comes to perhaps the most sensitive issue of all for Trump -- Russia -- Bolton has echoed Trump's charges that Obama officials politicized intelligence to smear Trump as a tool of the Kremlin. In one late 2016 Fox News interview, Bolton even suggested that the hacking of Democratic emails may have been a \"false flag\" operation staged by the Obama administration. (He later clarified that he did not mean to imply that the Obama administration had planted the evidence.)\n\nBut while Trump has shown an eagerness to befriend with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Bolton has depicted the Russian leader as a menace who cannot be trusted. In one July 2017 op-ed, Bolton declared that Putin had lied to Trump in a face-to-face meeting when the Russian leader denied that his government had meddled in the U.S. election. Bolton called an action \"a true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate.\"\n\n\"For Trump, it should be a highly salutary lesson about the character of Russia's leadership to watch Putin lie to him,\" Bolton added, calling it a \"warning about the value Moscow places on honesty, whether regarding election interference, nuclear proliferation, arms control or the Middle East: negotiate with Russia at your peril.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump told reporters that he had called Putin to congratulate the his Kremlin counterpart on an election victory that was widely dismissed as anti-democratic. He added that he hopes to meet with Putin soon to discuss a range of issues -- including arms control and the Middle East.",

                "body": "Former Playboy model Karen McDougal says she kept notes on when she met with Donald Trump during what she says was an affair, in addition to details on the relationship.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview with CNN that aired on Thursday evening, McDougal shared her journal with the network and talked about how she discreetly kept track of the times she saw Trump.\n\n\"I either called him T or D.T., because if anybody found this I wouldn't want to expose myself or expose him,\" she said, as CNN displayed photos of her journal and highlighted where McDougal had written Trump's initials. \"I purposely kind of chicken-scratched a lot on there, because I know what I'm writing.\"\n\n\"Did I see him quite a few times? Quite a bit?\" she added. \"Absolutely. We spent a lot of time together.\"\n\nMcDougal, however, said she never kept any evidence of their relationship besides the journal.\n\n\"Let me just say this. If you're in a loving relationship, do you try to collect evidence?\" she said. \"The only thing that I have, really, is my journal that I keep. ... I wasn't out to get anybody or, gosh, get anyone in trouble, but those are my notes. Those are for me.\"\n\nMcDougal says she had a 10-month affair with Trump in 2006 that lasted into 2007, though the White House has also called accounts of any affair untrue. She is currently suing American Media Inc., parent company of the National Enquirer, to be released from an agreement about the rights to her story of the relationship. The company is reported to have paid her $150,000 but did not run the story, at the same time requiring her to keep silent.\n\nWhen asked by CNN about speaking out now despite claiming she couldn't share her story, McDougal said there could be a big lawsuit against her.\n\n\"There could be financial ruin, but that's why I have really good attorneys to make sure that doesn't happen,\" she said. \"Do I feel threatened? Absolutely. I feel I had to protect myself. I had to stand up for myself. I almost feel violated in the fact I didn't know what was going on behind the scenes. I'm quite mad at that. I'm angry. I feel taken advantage of, in a sense. I want the right to be made. I want it to be right.\"\n\nAmerican Media this week issued a statement to CNN in response to McDougal's lawsuit, saying that she \"has been free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship\" with Trump since 2016 and that it had not \"silenced\" her.\n\nIn the interview, McDougal also detailed the first time she met the future president, during filming on an episode of his \"Celebrity Apprentice\" reality show at the Playboy Mansion. She said that she was told by another Playmate that Trump looked as though he was interested in her and that they began chatting and exchanged numbers.\n\nShe said she was in contact with Trump and would speak him on the phone but did not meet with him again until around the time of his birthday, in June.\n\nThat night, McDougal said, she met with Trump in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel where they had dinner, talked and were \"intimate.\"\n\nShe also said that Trump tried to hand her money after the interaction.\n\n\"I just had this look, I just -- I don't even know how to describe the look on my face, it must have been so sad, because I never have been offered money like that before,\" McDougal said.\n\nShe added that she was hurt because she wondered whether Trump thought she was in it for the money.\n\n\"I looked at him and said, that's not me, I'm not that kind of girl. And he looked at me and said, 'Oh,' and he said, 'You're really special,'\" McDougal said. \"And I was, like, thank you. So I left, and I got into the car, Keith's (bodyguard) taking me home, and started crying. I was really sad. It really hurt me, but I went back.\n\n\"I was crying in the backseat of the car like I said, I got home to my apartment and I was crying a lot. I felt terrible about myself, let alone what he felt.\"\n\nThroughout their affair, McDougal said, she would meet up with Trump not only in Los Angeles, but also accompanied him to Lake Tahoe and even met up several times in New York, where she once visited his apartment in Trump Tower.\n\nShe noted that Melania had her own room, but said she did not want to speculate on whether they had marital issues.\n\nMcDougal said she eventually ended the relationship after feeling \"so guilty.\" She said she was in love with Trump and that he had told her that he loved her, too.\n\n\"I was just feeling so guilty. It was just digging inside me,\" she said, adding that knowing that Trump was married made it difficult to continue the relationship.\n\n\"Whether they get along or not, it's still a family,\" McDougal said. \"I just needed to get out of it. It was tearing me apart.\"",

                "title": "McMaster firing upends plan to oust other top Trump officials",
                "body": "Chief of staff John Kelly had been weighing a single announcement on the departure of Shulkin, McMaster and possibly other officials, including Carson.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to abruptly fire national security adviser H.R. McMaster surprised senior White House aides who had been preparing a single statement announcing the departure of multiple top Trump officials, according to two senior administration officials.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly and other top aides were waiting for inspector general reports that they believed would deliver devastating verdicts on Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who have both been accused of racking up extravagant expenses. They were also debating whether several senior White House aides, including McMaster, should go with them.\n\nIt's unclear which other West Wing officials were possibly set to depart with McMaster, but the two senior administration officials said they believed it would be easier to manage the optics if multiple firings were made public in a single statement instead of drawn out. The announcement, though, was not expected for at least another week.\n\nTrump, however, upended those plans late Thursday, firing McMaster and offering his job to former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton in a move that surprised not only his top advisers -- but also Bolton himself.\n\nThough the hawkish conservative has spoken with the president several times in recent weeks, those close to him say he had no indication the president would offer him the job when he went to the White House for a meeting on Thursday. Bolton also was passed over for a top State Department job last year, reportedly because Trump was turned off by his bristly, full mustache.\n\nAnd while McMaster has been the subject of multiple news reports in recent weeks predicting his imminent departure, Trump was said to be slow-walking the final decision, waiting for a strong replacement and appropriate landing spot for McMaster. White House aides, however, said the onslaught of news reports about McMaster's inevitable demise had made it difficult for him to continue in the job.\n\nA senior White House official said Thursday evening that Trump made clear earlier in the day that he had made the call to fire McMaster but did not indicate when. \"Trump upends whatever he wants to upend,\" a second White House official said.\n\nThe exact trigger for the timing of the ouster is unclear, but it comes on the heels of another damaging leak involving national security matters. The Washington Post late Tuesday revealed that briefing materials had instructed Trump \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE\" during his call with newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin -- guidance that Trump ignored.\n\nThe unexpectedly quick personnel change is the latest example of Trump's mercurial nature and his newfound confidence to follow his gut instincts. Earlier this month, Trump pulled the trigger on firing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson after flirting with the decision for months but being advised against the move by some of his senior aides.\n\nThe ouster of McMaster also throws into disarray the still-forming plans to oust multiple top officials in one swoop. Shulkin has long been viewed negatively by senior West Wing aides because he has repeatedly said he has been given the blessing of the White House to purge insolent VA staffers, even though he's been given no such approval, according to one administration official. Carson, meanwhile, has been seen as largely ineffective at running a large federal agency, but senior administration officials and others close to the White House say Trump aides harbor reservations about ousting him because he is the only black cabinet member.\n\nBoth have been accused of excessive spending, with Shulkin facing accusations of racking up extravagant travel expenses with his wife during government trips and Carson defending the decision to install a $31,000 dining room set in his office.\n\nRepresentatives for Shulkin and Carson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"Several people over there that did not want this to happen before they were ready to do the others,\" said a separate senior administration official. \"There was definitely a consensus view in the building that they were going to do all these at once.\"\n\nThough the timing was unexpected, Trump's decision to dismiss McMaster, a three-star Army general who has never meshed with the president personally, was not.\n\nMcMaster, who replaced Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, a little over a year ago, is an intensely focused intellectual whose detailed briefings, by all accounts, drove the president crazy. Trump took to mocking him openly in the Oval Office, asking other White House aides why McMaster was so serious.\n\n\"Everyone knew he'd be out eventually,\" said a second senior administration official.\n\nWhite House aides expressed mixed feelings about Bolton's impending arrival, which will take place as Trump negotiates a historic summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and as he weighs a decision, in early May, about whether to scuttle the Iran deal.\n\nTrump's decision to bring in Bolton comes after rumors of an administration post for him last year shook many in the Senate and foreign policy establishment. The former ambassador has riled up critics by arguing that the U.S. should bomb Iran to stop its nuclear program, dismissing the idea of a Palestinian state, and taking a proactive stance toward international military conflicts.\n\nMcMaster's tenure at the White House was an uphill battle virtually from the outset because he butted heads not only with the president, but also with Kelly and with Secretary of Defense James Mattis, both of who were also agitating for his ouster.\n\nMcMaster clashed frequently with Mattis and also with Tillerson on policy matters. Kelly, who, like Mattis, is a retired Marine general, served under Mattis in Iraq, and the two remain close friends, and White House aides say Mattis was able to openly relay his complaints about McMaster to the chief of staff.\n\nTrump and Kelly both seriously considered firing McMaster in November, when they also came close to dismissing Tillerson, but held back when the two could not agree on a successor.\n\nA White House official said Trump was ultimately drawn to Bolton in part because he was impressed by his many appearances on Fox News.\n\nLarry Kudlow, the economic analyst and CNBC contributor who was recently named as a replacement for former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, also appealed to Trump because of his appearances on cable news. Trump has also developed close personal friendships with both men, the latest indication that personality plays a central role in the president's personnel picks.",

                "title": "Mattis: Aerial photo request triggered firing of Gitmo tribunal overseer",
                "body": "Two officials overseeing the beleaguered military commission process were fired last month because of efforts they made to obtain an aerial photo of the area used to host the tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Pentagon officials said in a court filing released on Thursday.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis said he dismissed a veteran national security lawyer who served as the \"convening authority\" of the military commissions, Harvey Rishikof, because he asked military personnel to capture fresh images of the complex and then took his request to the U.S. Coast Guard when military officials turned him down.\n\n\"I was made aware that Mr. Rishikof failed to ensure the most basic coordination was conducted for his USCG aerial imagery request and that the appropriate officials at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, including security officials, were not informed,\" Mattis wrote in a sworn declaration dated March 16.\n\nThe Pentagon's top lawyer, acting General Counsel William Castle, said in a separate declaration that he sacked the top legal adviser in Rishikof's office, Gary Brown, in part because of the same aerial photo episode.\n\nCastle said that the military command involved gave Rishikof and Brown a picture from 2014, but that they insisted that was not recent enough.\n\nCastle, however, said his reasons for dismissing Brown went beyond that issue and included a failure to notify Castle's office about a reorganization proposal that Brown and Rishikof presented to Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan last December.\n\nCastle also said that lawyers in his office were of the view that Rishikof and Brown \"alternated between not coordinating administrative aspects of their jobs and coordinating in a needlessly disruptive and divisive manner.\"\n\nDefense lawyers for one of the alleged Qaeda operatives held at Guantanamo and charged in the military commission asked the military judge to inquire into the firings, which were not explained by the Pentagon at the time. Various Guantanamo defense attorneys said they suspected that Rishikof and Brown were fired because of dissatisfaction with how they responded to complaints about microphones found in attorney-client meeting spaces at Guantanamo, by their efforts to defuse a dispute over the refusal of the defense team's chief to testify in front of a military judge, or by the slow pace of litigation at the tribunals.\n\nIn a response ordered by the military judge, Mattis and Castle both said those issues did not affect their actions with regard to the firings. In addition, the defense secretary said he had nothing to do with Brown's dismissal.\n\nRishikof and Brown did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday evening.\n\nRishikof had no uniformed military experience before he was named by Mattis to the post overseeing the commissions last April. However, the attorney had practiced in the national security area for years, headed an American Bar Association committee on national security law and served in a top legal post at the FBI. His appointment was in the works before President Donald Trump took office, sources said.\n\nBrown is a retired Air Force colonel who served as the top legal counsel for U.S. Cyber Command at Fort Meade, Maryland, before taking the military commission-related job last April.",

                "body": "Even some staffers who respect Mark Zuckerberg as an inspirational figure are discouraged at how he has navigated the company's crises since the 2016 election.\n\nFacebook's response to its controversy over data privacy looks nearly as chaotic to its employees as it does from the outside, people inside the embattled social network say.\n\nThe company's rank-and-file are grumbling about the way CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg kept silent about the Cambridge Analytica furor for six days -- a vacuum that allowed minor-celebrity Facebook executives to make matters worse by issuing hair-splitting explanations on Twitter.\n\nSome Facebook staffers also see the company's leadership as perpetually naive about how bad actors might misuse its platform, said company sources drawing from conversations with co-workers and discussions on the company's internal communication forums. Others feel lingering guilt over the Russian election meddling that many employees believe helped propel Donald Trump into the presidency -- and more prosaic worries that whatever changes Zuckerberg makes to address the crisis could upend months or even years of engineering work.\n\nPeople inside Facebook say employees still see Zuckerberg as an inspirational figure who is growing into the role of CEO at the age of 33, and they broadly embrace his mission of connecting the world. At the same time, sources say, many feel that it had already been a very, very long year to a member of Facebook's 25,000-person workforce even before the Cambridge Analytica news broke.\n\n\"There are some who are discouraged and some who think that the criticism is wildly exaggerated,\" said one Facebook source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation inside the company. \"Facebook has always been the golden child,\" said the source, adding that employees are reeling from realizing those days are over.\n\nNow the company is facing burgeoning investigations from the Federal Trade Commission and at least two state attorneys general and regulators in Europe, as well as a possible appearance by Zuckerberg before Congress, with the House Energy and Commerce Committee saying Thursday it plans to take him up on his stated willingness to testify under the right circumstances. Zuckerberg has even opened the door to more government oversight of his company, telling CNN on Wednesday that \"I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated.\"\n\nFacebook's nine-member board, which includes both Zuckerberg and Sandberg as well as one-time Trump adviser Peter Thiel, acknowledged this week the dire stakes involved in the crisis -- sparked by revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked on Trump's election campaign, improperly obtained information on about 50 million Facebook users via an academic researcher.\n\nThe situation didn't come to light until last weekend, when The New York Times and The Observer of London reported the details and raised questions about whether Cambridge still possessed reams of the data.\n\n\"Mark and Sheryl know how serious this situation is and are working with the rest of Facebook leadership to build stronger user protections,\" Facebook director Susan Desmond-Hellmann said in a statement issued on behalf of the board late Wednesday.\n\nPart of the confusion at the company lately has come from mid-level executives jumping into the public debate via Twitter. Facebook officials have gotten into heated, tweet-fueled discussions on everything from whether the social network charged the Trump campaign less for ads than it did Hillary Clinton, to whether Cambridge Analytica's data access counts as a \"breach.\"\n\nAlex Stamos, the company's chief security officer who participated in the \"breach\" debate, later tried to pull back in some of what he wrote. \"I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in,\" he tweeted. (It has since been reported that Stamos is leaving the company.)\n\nThose executives are prominent figures in the tech industry circles in which they work -- online advertising, say, or computer security -- and are given a great deal of deference inside Facebook because of it. But their remarks, which have sometimes run counter to what's coming out of the company's public relations shop, have only muddied the waters.\n\nFacebook employees' disappointments and complaints matter, technology industry experts say. Silicon Valley worries more about worker sentiment than other industries do, partly because of the competitiveness of recruiting and keeping good engineers.\n\nThat's one reason that the company in June launched a blog called \"Hard Questions.\" The point was to have a forum to \"talk more openly about some complex subjects\" facing the company, vice president of public policy and communications Elliot Schrage wrote in an inaugural post. While the blog is public, a key audience is Facebook employees themselves, sources said.\n\nBut the blog was dormant for the first six days of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. It was updated only late Wednesday with a post that simply linked to Zuckerberg's statement that day calling the Cambridge situation a \"breach of trust\" with users and promising steps to prevent abuse of people's data, and to his subsequent media interviews.\n\nSandberg spoke publicly for the first time Thursday about the controversy, expressing regret about leadership's halting response.\n\n\"If I could live this past week again, I would definitely have had Mark and myself out speaking earlier,\" Sandberg said in a CNBC interview Thursday. \"But we were trying to get to the bottom of this and make sure we could take strong action.\n\n\"We know this is an issue of trust,\" she said. \"We know this is a critical moment for our company.\"",

                "title": "Democrats gang up on ex-Clinton Foundation head Shalala ",
                "body": "What might have been a smooth ride to Congress for Donna Shalala is instead turning into a demolition derby.\n\nIn an open congressional seat in Florida that represents one of the Democratic Party's best pickup chances in the nation, fellow Democrats are bashing the former Clinton administration Cabinet secretary, accusing her of collaborating with the enemy by contributing to Republican candidates.\n\nTwo of Shalala's seven primary opponents joined together Thursday to criticize her for personally contributing $21,500 to Florida Republicans running for state, local and federal offices over the past decade -- including GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who held the seat before announcing her retirement this year.\n\n\"It was so jarring and so disappointing to see the newest candidate in the Democratic primary, Donna Shalala, has donated to the Republican incumbent last cycle, has donated in the past to the current Republican running for congress in this very congressional seat, has donated over $20,000 to anti-choice, anti-LGBT, pro-NRA, Republican politicians, and has donated $20,000 to a corporate PAC that has given $125,000 to the NRCC -- an organization whose sole goal is to keep a Republican majority, and Paul Ryan as speaker,\" retired Circuit Judge Mary Barzee Flores and state Rep. David Richardson said in a joint statement from which each read consecutive passages during a conference call with reporters.\n\nRichardson and Barzee Flores pointed out that the PAC for the Shalala-affiliated company MEDNAX gave $4,875 to Sen. Marco Rubio in 2016. Also, Shalala had personally contributed $500 in 2009 to Rubio's friend, scandal-plagued former Rep. David Rivera, when he was in the state House, as well as another $500 in 2011 to former state Sen. Frank Artiles, who in 2017 resigned his seat after using racially charged language.\n\nThe two Democrats demanded that Shalala explain the donations to Republican and apologize to the Democrats who faced the Republican challengers to whom Shalala contributed, and said she needed to contribute an equivalent amount -- about $41,000, including the PAC money -- to the Miami-Dade Democratic Party.\n\nShalala's campaign said the PAC donations were bipartisan and that she makes no apologies for her contributions to Republicans, which are dwarfed by her Democratic giving.\n\n\"Donna Shalala's Democratic credentials are untouchable & unassailable,\" the campaign said in a written statement. \"The idea that one of the most iconic and celebrated members of the Democratic Party, who for decades has personally donated A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS to the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates, who not only gave tens of thousands of dollars to EMILY's List but is a founding member of the organization, a woman whose political contributions have gone to Democratic party candidates and causes at a rate of over 90% is somehow not enough of a Democrat, is simply absurd.\"\n\nSeparately, another Democratic candidate, Miami Beach City Commissioner Kristen Rosen-Gonzalez, took a shot at Shalala by releasing a jokey video on Twitter last week that criticized her as \"Donna Walmarta\" for selling a parcel of environmentally sensitive University of Miami land to developers who plan to build a Walmart.\n\nThe multi-directional incoming fire underscores Shalala's front-runner status in Florida's 27th Congressional District. Independently wealthy, Shalala has earned decades worth of name ID and Democratic chits as Bill Clinton's Health and Human Services secretary, president of the University of Miami and executive director of the Clinton Foundation.\n\nNo other Republican-held congressional seat in the nation voted for Hillary Clinton by such a wide margin over President Trump, 19.6 percentage points.\n\nRichardson and Barzee Flores aren't the only Democrats aggrieved over Shalala's past contributions. After Shalala's campaign reached out to Scott Fuhrman -- who ran unsuccessfully against Ros-Lehtinen -- for a contribution, he declined with the expletive acronym, \"GFY.\" His issue: Shalala failed to contribute to him after donating to Ros-Lehtinen in 2016.\n\nFuhrman then contacted two of his former consultants, Ben Pollara and Eric Johnson, who now work for Barzee Flores and Richardson, respectively. They got to work ganging up on Shalala.\n\nShalala's campaign said she's staying positive and began an earlier-than-usual ad buy this week to emphasize her experience.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter whether they ever contributed to Republicans, Richardson -- the first openly gay state House member -- said he recalled giving $250 to an LGBT Massachusetts Republican whose name he couldn't remember. Barzee Flores said she couldn't remember any, but state records show she gave $100 to Republican attorney general candidate Lock Burte in 2001.\n\n\"I can tell you one thing for sure,\" Barzee Flores said, \"I'm not going to be making campaign contributions to the likes of David Rivera and Frank Artiles.\"",

The National Gallery of Art gets $165.9 million, while the John F.

The omnibus not only rejected zeroing out the programs, but boosted them by $20 million to $1.2 billion.\n\nThe Trump budget also called for cutting the Federal Work-Study program in half -- the omnibus instead gave it a $140 million boost.\n\nThe bill would block key parts of the Education Department's effort to overhaul how it collects federal student loans.\n\nIt also boosts the funding for the Office of Civil Rights, which is in charge of investigating discrimination in schools. Appropriators said the money should be used for additional staff. The Trump administration has worked to shrink the office, which advocates complained was already understaffed.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nThe budget for the Environmental Protection Agency -- which the White House sought to slash by one-third -- escapes unscathed.\n\nHEALTH\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, instead of seeing its budget shrink by $5.8 billion, will get a $3 billion increase -- which lawmakers say is the largest ever.\n\nFunding for the health department's Title X grants program -- called \"America's family planning program\" -- remains stable despite Trump's proposal to eliminate it. (The administration is shifting the program's to emphasize so-called natural family planning rather than traditional contraception.)\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed a 95 percent cut to the Office of National Drug Control Policy was rejected in the omnibus.\n\nCongress keeps funding flat for the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT office. Trump had proposed to slice its budget from $60 million to $38 million.\n\nThe White House in February proposed to cut the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health -- CDC's office dedicated to workplace health -- by 41 percent and fold it into the National Institutes of Health. Congressional appropriators, meanwhile, trimmed the office's $338 million budget by $3 million, or a less than 1 percent cut.\n\nHOUSING\n\nCommunity Development Block Grants would get a 10 increase funding increase in the omnibus. The Trump administration proposed to completely zero out its budget.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nThe spending bill contains no major investment for a border wall with Mexico. There's also no crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities that harbor undocumented immigrants.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nInstead of eliminating a key grant program for transportation projects, the omnibus triples the funding to $1.5 billion.\n\nThe bill appropriates $2.6 billion for Capital Investment Grants for transit, which Trump's budget wanted to wind down.\n\nTrump wanted to cut the law enforcement reimbursement program for airports. The omnibus includes funding for that, too.",

                "title": "Ethics panel reproves two Illinois Democrats for House rules violations",
                "body": "The House Ethics Committee found that two Illinois Democrats violated chamber rules and must personally repay thousands of dollars for their actions.\n\nYet in the case of Rep. Bobby Rush, the Ethics Committee will allow him to be repaid by his campaign committee for any personal cost, so the end result is that Rush won't be out of pocket at all.\n\nRush and Rep. Luis Gutierrez were formally reproved by the Ethics panel for the violations, findings that were announced on Thursday by Reps. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.) and Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), the chairwoman and ranking member of the committee.\n\nBoth cases were initially investigated by the Office of Congressional Ethics, the independent ethics watchdog, which found \"substantial reason to believe\" that Rush and Gutierrez had violated House rules.\n\nRush's violation was tied to Chicago office space he has occupied for more than two decades without paying rent. Rush started renting the space when he was a Chicago alderman, but he failed to pay rent on it for more than 24 years, according to the Ethics Committee.\n\nThe panel ruled that Rush's action -- accepting the use of free office space -- was a violation of House gift rules. The Ethics Committee ruled that Rush must repay the rental company more than $14,600 out of his own pocket.\n\n\"In this case, Representative Rush should have known that he could not accept the use of office space, over a 24 year period, without making any effort to determine whether the Gift Rule allowed it,\" the Ethics Committee declared in its report on the case. \"The resulting violations were both foreseeable and entirely avoidable. Thus, consistent with its precedent, the Committee has decided to publicly reprove Representative Rush.\"\n\nYet because the space was only used for political purposes, Rush's campaign can repay him for the cost off the rent and the Illinois Democrat won't suffer a financial hit.\n\nThe Ethics Committee also found no violation by Rush tied to two donations by his campaign committee made to a church that employed Rush's son.\n\nRush -- who cooperated with the Ethics Committee's probe -- said he was satisfied with the panel's findings.\n\n\"I agree with the central analysis of the House Ethics Committee in that, when all is said and done, this was a relatively minor matter,\" Rush said in a statement. \"The rare use of the essentially abandoned office space was related to my role as a party official, but I accept the Ethics Committee's recommendation that I take personal responsibility for paying the U.S. Treasury.\"\n\nIn the Gutierrez matter, the Illinois Democrat paid a former staffer-turned-consultant, Doug Scofield, for a decade out of his official congressional account. Gutierrez will now have to personally repay the Treasury Dept. for $9,700 in improper payments to the ex-aide.\n\nAfter questions about the issue were raised in an article by USA Today, an OCE probe found \"substantial reason to believe\" that Scofield was providing \"services to [Gutierrez's] congressional office that more closely resembled those provided by an employee or consultant, rather than a contractor -- in violation of federal law and House rules.\"\n\nGutierrez apparently sought guidance from the Committee on House Administration for the Scofield contract before it was signed in 2003, according to the Ethics Committee's report, although there is no record on what, if any, instructions the Illinois Democrat received from that panel.\n\nAccording to Thursday's report, \"the [Ethics] Committee found that although an overwhelming majority of the work Mr. Scofield performed from 2003 to 2013 clearly accorded with the contract's terms, Mr. Scofield occasionally performed work for Representative Gutiérrez's office that was either 'legislative' in nature or otherwise exceeded the scope of work outlined in the contract. Representative Gutiérrez thus impermissibly used MRA funds to pay Mr. Scofield for some work that exceeded the scope of the Scofield Communications contract, and the limits of what a contractor retained to provide services to a Member's congressional office may do, as defined by the Committee on House Administration (CHA). The Committee also concluded that the resulting violations, though unintentional, were significant enough to warrant a reproval by the Committee.\"\n\nThe member representational allowance, or MRA, is the official money the House provides to lawmakers to run their congressional offices. There are extensive rules on how these funds can be used.\n\nGutierrez noted that he had sought guidance from the House Administration Committee before initiating the contract with Scofield.\n\n\"The Ethics Committee concluded, as I did, that any misuse of funds was 'inadvertent' and done with the approval of Committee on House Administration and the Office of House Finance,\" Gutierrez added. \"I am glad this review is resolved and that the Ethics Committee exonerated me of any willful or intentional wrongdoing. After five years the Ethics Committee came to the same conclusion I reached in 2013 when this was first brought to my attention.\"",

                "title": "Trump vs. Biden: Who Would Win?",
                "body": "In the left corner, weighing in at 180 pounds, standing at six feet tall, the winner of two vice-presidential belts, with one Iowa caucus loss and one presidential primary disqualification, the Scranton Stallion: Joooooe Biden!\n\nAnd in the right corner, at 239 pounds* and six feet, three inches*, with a 41-15 primary record, undefeated in the presidential general election, and the undisputed champion of the 2007 WWE Battle of the Billionaires, the King of Queens, the President of the United States: Dooon-aaaald Trump!\n\nSure, in recent days, several other Democratic presidential contenders have been trying to gin up some headlines. Sen. Bernie Sanders hosted an online town hall on inequality, which attracted nearly two million live viewers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren slammed fellow Democrats who joined Republicans to modify Dodd-Frank bank regulations, rolled out new health insurance legislation and joined Bernie's town hall. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand pressed her colleagues to support legislation that would put congresspeople, and not taxpayers, on the financial hook for settlements in sexual misconduct cases. Sens. Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar promoted paper ballots to repel Russian hacking of election systems, and helped secure funds in the omnibus spending bill to that end.\n\nBut none of that got nearly the same level of attention as Biden's recent trash talk: \"If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him,\" for Trump's attitude toward women. That's because Biden got under Trump's skin, prompting a presidential retort on Twitter that \"Crazy Joe Biden ... would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.\"\n\nThis is hardly the kind of debate for which many Democratic primary voters are hungering. It's not about economic inequality. It's not about health care. It's not about Russian interference. And it's only tangentially related to misogyny. But, with the memory of the juvenile free-for-all that was the 2016 presidential campaign fresh in their minds, there is one thing every Democratic voter wants to see in their eventual 2020 nominee: the ability to take Trump on. Not who can literally throw a punch, but who can rhetorically punch and counter-punch with the most vicious campaign brawler ever to occupy the Oval Office. And in this respect, Biden, with his playground put-down, has put himself at the front of the pack.\n\nDemocratic fear of being mauled on the campaign trail has never dissipated since George H.W. Bush's team pummeled 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis beyond recognition. In the documentary \"Feed\" about the 1992 New Hampshire primary, an elderly woman goes up to the nebbishy former Sen. Paul Tsongas and asks, \"Can you be nasty enough?\" He calmly responds, \"I can be nasty.\"\n\nMost Democrats were unconvinced. The movie also shows a Bill Clinton surrogate firing up the troops with, \"We're not going to lose to some man who wears a pocket protector!\" They didn't. Democratic voters opted for smooth Southerner over the Massachusetts nerd.\n\nSince then Democrats have cringed at how the wonkish Al Gore became a \"serial exaggerator\" and the patrician John Kerry got swiftboated despite being a decorated Vietnam vet. The memory of how Trump brazenly used misogynistic language to dispatch Hillary Clinton still burns. Only Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, both charismatic yet cunning, have successfully deflected the Republican attacks on their manhood in the era of Fox News.\n\nIn past elections, Democrats worried about fiendish operatives like Lee Atwater and Karl Rove. Today, they must worry about the candidate himself. Normally, facing an incumbent president perpetually stuck at around 40 percent approval would not induce much panic. But not only did Trump manage to win the first time without the popular vote, he also has a proven ability to verbally diminish his rivals and knock them off their game. Ask \"Low-energy\" Jeb Bush, \"Little Marco,\" \"Lyin' Ted\" Cruz and \"Crooked Hillary.\"\n\nBiden's retrograde machismo doesn't fit the progressive sensibilities of a Democratic Party that skews young and female. The Forward's Batya Ungar-Sargon posted on Twitter, \"1950 called. It wants Joe Biden and his toxic masculinity back.\" Keying off of that comment, the Washington Post's Eugene Scott surmised, \"Biden's words could cost him some votes from women who are tired of seeing stereotypical expressions of manhood offered as a solution to the very real problem of sexual assault of women.\" Biden already has a challenge of convincing Democrats to send yet another old white male to the White House, talking too \"old-school\" exacerbates the problem.\n\nHowever, no one could possibly think Biden would get discombobulated at Trump's juvenile nonsense. This is a man who dispensed with Rudy Giuliani - crowned Time Magazine's 2001 Person of Year - as a man with nothing to say but \"a noun, a verb, and 9/11.\" In 2012, When Biden faced off with Paul Ryan (perhaps the closest thing to a Republican Tsongas in terms of nerdiness) in the vice-presidential debate, the New York Times reported that Ryan \"seemed disconcerted by the sheer blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night,\" and The Guardian headlined, \"Joe Biden's alpha-male display leaves Paul Ryan overwhelmed.\" You cannot stop Biden from being Biden.\n\nBiden should not get an advantage for being male. But let's face it: A presidential candidate is more likely to win if she or he is an alpha, and especially so against Trump. However emotionally stunted or insecure he is on the inside, Trump plays the uber-alpha on TV. That energy is going to have be met. As the Daily Beast's Matt Lewis wrote in defense of Biden's bravado, borrowing from an old Bill Clinton saying, \"It's better to be strong and wrong\" than weak and right.\n\nIn the Bernie Sanders town hall the Vermont senator, along with agitprop filmmaker Michael Moore, lamented that the \"corporate media\" tries to distract viewers with sensationalistic stories about \"Russia\" and \"Stormy Daniels,\" instead of covering issues related to poverty and inequality. Certainly this Biden-Trump dust-up would qualify as a similar type of distraction. But complaining, even noble complaining, is not much of an alpha move. Biden probably isn't thrilled that his big mouth stepped on his rollout of a set of proposals designed to resuscitate the working-class, and his Thursday public forum the Biden Institute to discuss them. Yet I don't see him wringing his hands about it.\n\nThe political reality is that getting into a (rhetorical) fight with Trump gives Democratic voters a chance to assess your fight skills, and preview what a general election might look like. Last month, Warren pledged to respond to every one Trump's \"Pocahontas\" taunts by \"us[ing] it to lift up the story of [Native American] families and ... communities.\" In December, when Trump attacked Gillibrand as someone who would \"do anything\" to get a campaign donation from him, she shot back on Twitter, \"You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office.\"\n\nTheir moments of conflict got far more attention than their policy pronouncements. Is that fair? No. Should it mean that candidates shouldn't bother with policy? No. But the 2020 nominee will need to live in the real world. And in the real world, the incumbent president is an insult machine and voters hate-click on food fights more than they sift through policy papers.\n\nIn preparing to go toe-to-toe with Trump, Democrats will have to take some sparring practice, and not all punches are going to land. But to insist that candidates shouldn't treat the campaign like a schoolyard brawl is to deny the reality that one of the candidates is going to make sure that it is one.",

                "title": "John Bolton to replace H.R. McMaster as national security adviser",
                "body": "President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he would replace national security adviser H.R. McMaster with John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, marking the latest high-level shake up in a White House that has seen unprecedented levels of turnover in Trump's first 14 months in office.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor,\" the president tweeted on Thursday evening. \"I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.\"\n\nIn a subsequent statement issued by The White House, the president paid fuller tribute.\n\n\"H.R. McMaster has served his country with distinction for more than 30 years,\" Trump said in the statement. \"He has won many battles and his bravery and toughness are legendary. General McMaster's leadership of the National Security Council staff has helped my administration accomplish great things to bolster America's national security. He helped develop our America First National Security Strategy, revitalize our alliances in the Middle East, smash ISIS, bring North Korea to the table, and strengthen our nation's prosperity.\n\n\"This work and those achievements will ensure that America builds on its economic and military advantages. I thank General McMaster and his family for their service and wish them the very best.\"\n\nAlso in a statement from the White House, McMaster, a three-star Army general, announced that he would retire from the military in the coming months.\n\n\"After thirty-four years of service to our nation, I am requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer after which I will leave public service,\" he said. \"Throughout my career it has been my greatest privilege to serve alongside extraordinary servicemembers and dedicated civilians.\n\n\"I am thankful to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation as national security advisor. I am grateful for the friendship and support of the members of the National Security Council who worked together to provide the President with the best options to protect and advance our national interests.\"\n\nMcMaster's exit brings an end to his uneven tenure as leader of the NSC, marked by internal clashes with the president and other top administration officials and months of swirling speculation about his looming departure.\n\nHe never quite meshed with the president, aides say, and at times clashed with him on foreign policy matters.\n\n\"Everyone knew he'd be out eventually,\" one senior administration official said, but added that the process was smoother than Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's impromptu ouster last week, and that McMaster was afforded a higher level of courtesy than Tillerson, who was summarily fired via tweet.\n\nTrump made the decision to replace McMaster earlier this month, and accelerated the process in the wake of news reports about his impending departure, another administration official said. The reports were making it difficult for McMaster to continue to lead the National Security Council on a daily basis.\n\nTrump made the decision to bring in Bolton after an Oval Office meeting on Thursday and made the offer, which Bolton accepted, the official said. Trump then called McMaster to inform him of the decision.\n\nThough most of their disagreements took place in private, McMaster was the subject of a public rebuke from Trump in February when he stated during a conference in Munich that evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections was \"incontrovertible.\"\n\n\"General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems,\" Trump tweeted in response. \"Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\"\n\nThe jab was the first time Trump's criticisms of McMaster spilled into public view, despite the president's having seriously contemplated his ouster as early as November. Still, McMaster remained outspoken in his views, and as recently as last week said that the administration should be tougher on Russia over its actions in Syria.\n\nBolton is viewed with mixed feelings within the White House, and has been better known in recent years as a Fox News pundit than as a foreign policy professional. He is also known for a hawkish tenure in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nBut he is also viewed as a skilled bureaucrat who has told associates that Trump needs someone capable of chastening the bureaucracy. That message seemed to be underscored this week when the White House was embarrassed by leaked details about Trump's phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, in which he congratulated Putin on his re-election against the advice of aides.\n\nNews of McMaster's departure comes amid concerns over a larger West Wing shake-up, with several top administration officials reportedly under consideration for dismissal by Trump.\n\nThe speculation prompted chief of staff John Kelly to address White House staffers last week and offer reassurance that more upheaval was not on the way for officials, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters last Friday.\n\n\"The chief of staff actually spoke to a number of staff this morning, reassuring them that there were personnel changes -- no immediate personnel changes at this time -- and that people shouldn't be concerned,\" Sanders said at that day's press briefing.\n\nAccording to Sanders, Trump and McMaster were in meetings together last Friday, but the pair were \"not focused on the news stories\" regarding the national security adviser's status with the president.\n\nAfter The Washington Post reported last week that Trump had already made up his mind about parting ways with his national security adviser -- and was mulling timing of the announcement -- Sanders directly addressed McMaster's status in a late-night note.\n\n\"Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster -- contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC,\" Sanders tweeted.\n\nMcMaster stepped into the role of national security adviser in February 2017, replacing retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who resigned after it was reported that he lied about contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. Flynn was indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller and in December entered into a plea agreement for lying to the FBI.\n\nTrump's presidency has been marked by numerous prominent staffing changes. Trump abruptly announced in a tweet last week that Tillerson would be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, resigned amid a dispute with the president over his approach to trade tariffs. Late last month, White House communications director Hope Hicks, one of Trump's longest-serving aides, announced she would step down from her role.\n\nThe president has already cycled through a chief of staff, press secretary, multiple communications directors, chief strategist and deputy chief of staff.",

He said he had more than 2,000 pages of the 2,200-page bill left to get through before he'll decide how to proceed.\n\n\"I'm on page 56 right now, and so I've got a few more pages to read. I don't have any other comment,\" Paul said. A few hours later he tweeted that he was on page 207 of the \"monstrous\" bill.\n\nUnder Senate rules, all 100 senators must agree to hold a vote before the Friday night shutdown deadline. But as of now, they don't have it. The House cleared the massive spending measure on Thursday.\n\n\"It's just a question of if he delays the vote. It doesn't change anything,\" Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 Senate Republican, said of Paul. \"I don't think anybody knows and I don't think his staff knows [what he's going to do] ... it's his right and his prerogative if he wants to do it.\"\n\n\"It's fair to say that it's fine to make a statement,\" said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who dislikes the spending increases in the bill but is eager to vote on it. \"There's no benefit to waiting at this point. We should go ahead and get it done.\"\n\nThe will-he-or-won't-he cause a momentary shutdown is a familiar play from Paul. He loves using Senate rules to draw attention to his causes -- even if it means agitating the people he goes to work with every day.\n\nHe has filibustered nominees, briefly caused a surveillance program to lapse and, in February, refused to give GOP leaders consent to vote on a funding bill before the funding deadline. The latter protest, against a bipartisan spending deal that dramatically increased spending, caused a government shutdown for several hours.\n\nHe's also irked GOP leaders by opposing President Donald Trump's nominees to lead the State Department and CIA this spring. That stand could allow Democrats to block the president's picks.\n\nBeyond simply annoying other senators, another protest by Paul could disrupt trips some of them who are planning to take overseas as part of congressional delegations. There are multiple so-called \"CODELs\" scheduled to leave on Thursday night, and they are making contingency plans now in case Paul forces the Senate to stay in on Friday, according to a Republican senator.\n\n\"I would hope that he can vote against what he doesn't like. That's what I do,\" said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the soon-to-be Appropriations Committee chairman. \"I'm sure he sees a purpose, an outlier, a protest. But there are a lot of ways to manifest that.\"\n\nThere was no concerted effort at the Republican lunch Thursday to persuade Paul to back down, attendees said. Instead GOP senators concentrated on paying tribute to retiring Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.).\n\nSome Republicans hope reporters can shame Paul into giving in.\n\n\"We're leaving that to y'all,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters. \"Whatever rights he has, he will decide what's the best use of them. I know how the movie ends. No matter what he does we're going to pass this bill and the military is going to get a pay raise.\"\n\nSome senators believe that Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) also must be convinced to allow a quick vote. Kennedy is among a bloc of conservatives who loathe the closed process used to write the bill in leaders' offices, as well as the increase in spending that will increase the deficit.\n\nBut in an interview, he sounded less dug-in than Paul.\n\n\"I don't know. Probably not,\" Kennedy said, when asked whether he will hold up the bill. \"They probably have the votes [to pass it]. But I can tell you this: This is the best effort of Congress to borrow and spend us into prosperity. And I'm not going to be a part of it.\"\n\nGOP leaders are hoping that the looming recess -- and certainty that the bill will pass, it's just a matter of when -- will be enough to get Paul not to gum up the works again.\n\n\"There are some unhappy folks, understandably. And they should be, the way this stuff gets done,\" Thune said. \"But in the end you realize we've got to fund the government and it's kind of an inevitability.\"",

Absolutely not. Did we get a DACA fix? No,\" Mulvaney said Thursday during a briefing on the spending bill. \"Let's make it clear, the president wanted a DACA fix as part of this deal. He had offered a large package with a complete DACA fix in exchange for the entire [border] wall. He offered a small package -- three years' worth of a DACA fix in exchange for three years' worth of a wall.\"\n\nDespite last-ditch efforts to append a DACA plan to the spending deal and signs that the White House was open to some sort of compromise, Democrats and Republicans were unable to reach an agreement.\n\n\"The Democrats in the House and Senate have made it clear they think they're winning in the courts and they do not want to fix this legislatively,\" Mulvaney added. \"We've reached out to them again and again to try to fix DACA, and they refuse to engage on the topic.\"\n\nThe lack of DACA's inclusion in the spending deal leaves nearly 700,000 immigrants covered by the program in legal limbo, with no sign that a deal will be reached anytime soon.\n\nBut Mulvaney maintained that overall, the spending deal still bodes well for the administration's immigration priorities.\n\n\"There's some other things we asked for that we did not get,\" Mulvaney said. \"There's some limitations on [the Department of Homeland Security] that Congress put in the bill that we don't particularly care for. But, generally speaking, we think this is a really, really good immigration package.\"",

Bump stocks enable a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster.\n\nThe policy \"is not centered on an ideological mission to rid the world of firearms,\" Ed Skyler, Citi's head of global public affairs, said in a blog post. \"That is not what we seek. There are millions of Americans who use firearms for recreational and other legitimate purposes, and we respect their constitutional right to do so.\n\n\"But we want to do our part as a company to prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands,\" said Skyler, who served under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg in New York City for eight years. Bloomberg is a leading gun-control advocate.\n\nCiti says it will no longer do business with clients who decline to go along with the policy.\n\n\"We know our clients also care about these issues, and we have begun to engage with them in the hope that they will adopt these best practices over the coming months,\" Skyler said. \"If they opt not to, we will respect their decision and work with them to transition their business away from Citi.\"\n\nThe bank will apply these requirements across the firm, he said, including to small businesses, commercial and institutional clients, and credit card partners, Skyler said.\n\nThe First National Bank of Omaha announced last month that it would end its relationship with the National Rifle Association. It had issued NRA-branded cards as part of its business.",

We're all just human beings trying to do our part,\" Tillerson said.\n\n\"I'd like to ask that each of you undertake to ensure one act of kindness each day towards another person. This can be a very mean-spirited town,\" he added, as employees gathered in the State Department's lobby chuckled and applauded.\n\nEven some critics of Tillerson -- whom Trump fired earlier this month -- have argued that the former ExxonMobil CEO was treated shabbily and even humiliated by a president who reportedly ridiculed him in private and fired him with a tweet.\n\nAt the same time, the ousted diplomat will be remembered for allegedly calling the president a \"moron\" during a meeting of top administration officials last summer -- a claim Tillerson has never denied.\n\nBut friends say that Tillerson, a former national president of the Boy Scouts of America, places a high premium on personal values, a theme he stressed in his short remarks which he told State Department workers were meant \"to bid you a proper farewell.\"\n\n\"Never lose sight of your most valuable asset, the most valuable asset you possess: your personal integrity,\" Tillerson said. \"[G]uard it as the most precious thing you possess.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of his speech, Tillerson shook hands with State Department workers as he made his way to a waiting car outside. Tillerson has turned over his duties to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, and said earlier this month that he would officially depart government on March 31 -- although it was unclear Thursday whether he will return to the State Department.\n\nTillerson made no substantive remarks about policy. Nor did he address the uncomfortable relationship he had with his workforce, whose members generally resented his efforts to streamline the department and slash its budget and saw him as indifferent at best to their collective expertise.\n\nTillerson's tenure as the nation's chief diplomat was marred by his tenuous relationship with Trump, whose steadily deterioration was the subject of constant Washington gossip. Tillerson irritated Trump in both manner and vision and clashed with the president on issues ranging from North Korea diplomacy to the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nTrump has said that he and Tillerson got along well, but had \"a different mind set\" and \"a different thinking,\" including on the nuclear deal -- which Tillerson has worked to preserve but Trump wants to exit.\n\nTrump has named CIA Director Mike Pompeo to succeed Tillerson. His confirmation hearings are expected to begin next month.",

The demand is part of a civil lawsuit Daniels filed this month seeking to void an October 2016 nondisclosure agreement in which she was paid in return for her silence about an alleged affair she had with Trump nearly a decade earlier.\n\nDaniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, is one of three women suing Trump over his alleged sexual behavior. While the lawsuits are in their earliest stages, they threaten to embroil the president in years of litigation that could expose embarrassing details of his alleged sexual relationships, uncover evidence of possible hush-money payments and draw the scrutiny of federal campaign finance regulators. Ultimately, the president himself could be forced to testify or give depositions under oath.\n\nAvenatti said Thursday's letters are just the beginning.\n\n\"We intend on using all legal means at our disposal to uncover the truth about the cover-up and what happened,\" Avenatti said in an emailed statement. \"This is but one of many tools we will use. When we are done, the truth will be laid bare for the American people.\"\n\nA lawyer for the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesman for First Republic said the bank had no comment on the letter while a spokeswoman for City National Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWeeks before Election Day 2016, Michael Cohen, a former lawyer at the Trump Organization now serving as Trump's personal attorney, created a company, Essential Consultants LLC, which entered into a contract with Daniels just as Trump's campaign was reeling from the release of an \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women.\n\nThe agreement gave Daniels money in return for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. The contract included a signature line for Trump that was left blank. Cohen has said the president denies any having any relationship with the porn actress.\n\nCohen has said he made the $130,000 payment to Daniels himself without Trump's knowledge, drawing down on a home equity line of credit to get the cash.\n\nOn Oct. 26, 2016, Cohen used his Trump Organization email to facilitate the payment from First Republic Bank to City National Bank, into an account controlled by Daniels' former lawyer.",

Three Miller & Chevalier lawyers -- Homer Moyer, Richard Mojica and Welles Orr -- will \"provide legal advice and assistance\" with the tariffs, according to a Justice Department filing. It's a short-term contract that ends on March 31. \"For work done during this period, Miller & Chevalier's fees will not exceed $110,000,\" the contract states.\n\n-- Bahrain, an island nation off the coast of Saudi Arabia, may not come to mind as an industrial powerhouse. But Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, its Persian Gulf neighbor, are both major aluminum producers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Emirates are expected to fight for exemption from the tariffs, too. \"Everybody is going to be calling in their chits and trying to make their points about why their exemptions make sense, but not everyone will be successful,\" Danny E. Sebright, the president of the U.S.-U.A.E. Business Council, told The New York Times last week.\n\nMORE TARIFF LOBBYING: The Trump administration's new tariffs on China are spurring another lobbying effort by companies and trade groups to limit their effect on their industries. Senior White House officials say the tariffs are likely to affect \"a proposed list of 1,300 products as punishment for Beijing's intellectual property practices,\" POLITICO's Adam Behsudi reports.\n\n-- Warren Maruyama, a partner at Hogan Lovells and a former general counsel in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under former President George W. Bush, told PI that \"there's going to be a mad scramble by a lot of companies to try to get products off the list, particularly if it's going to do real damage to supply chains or sourcing,\" he said. But don't expect China to lobby on the tariffs. \"Even if they did lobby, it probably wouldn't do them any good,\" Maruyama said. \"What they are probably going to do is hit back, which is what they've always done after U.S. trade actions.\"\n\n-- The National Retail Federation helped put together a coalition of industry groups last week to protest against the tariffs, and retailers and trade associations have weighed in with letters to the White House. \"This trade tax has the potential to wipe out any gains the average American family received from tax reform,\" Hun Quach, the Retail Industry Leaders Association's vice president for international trade, said in a statement today. But it's unclear whether the administration will listen.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to PI. We live for your tips: mlevine@politico.com and tmeyer@politico.com.

Left out of the bill: \"bids to address other snafus in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; a plan to address online sales taxes before the Supreme Court has a chance to weigh in on the matter; and a variety of retirement provisions backed by Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch,\" POLITICO's Brian Faler reports.

After Mr. Trump's election last fall, the [pharmaceutical] industry began an intense lobbying effort to have the Department of Health and Human Services change the payment rule, according to federal lobbying reports and congressional aides.\"\n\n-- \"The Journal's analysis of those reports shows 16 drugmakers, industry trade groups and nonprofits lobbied Congress or federal agencies about biosimilar reimbursement in 2017. In April 2017, lobbyists from Amgen Inc., Pfizer and other companies met with officials from HHS and [the Office of Management and Budget] to discuss the policy, according to OMB filings. At the meeting, drugmakers distributed an 18-page handout stating that biosimilar makers 'may leave the marketplace entirely' if the payment rule wasn't changed, according to the filing.\" Full story.\n\nHOW THE TECH LOBBY LOST THE FIGHT AGAINST A SEX-TRAFFICKING BILL: POLITICO's Steven Overly and Ashley Gold have the inside story on how the tech lobby lost its fight against a sex-trafficking bill. \"Not only would the companies fail to convince the lawmakers to halt their plans, the legislation they opposed has now overwhelmingly passed both the House and Senate, and is on its way to the White House where President Donald Trump is expected to sign it.\" \"Tech companies have to understand that it's not the Wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility,\" said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Full story.\n\nIF YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS A TRADE GROUP FOR EVERYTHING ALREADY: Apparently there's room for one more trade group in Washington. Jonathan Linkous, the former chief executive of the American Telemedicine Association, \"has co-founded a new trade group dedicated to artificial intelligence and automation in health care,\" called the Partnership for Artificial Intelligence and Automation in Healthcare, POLITICO's Mohana Ravindranath reports. \"Members will include health systems, industry, payers, regulators and individual professionals.\" Full story.\n\nJOBS REPORT\n\n-- Two former White House aides will join Reince Priebus at Michael Best & Friedrich's Washington office.

Committee Republicans also acknowledged meetings between Donald Trump Jr. and Russia-linked figures -- including a meeting with a Russian government official at an NRA event in 2016.

                "title": "Carson's 'bottom line': No harm done on furniture",
                "body": "HUD Secretary Ben Carson defended his handling of the uproar surrounding the order of a $31,000 furniture set for his office suite on Thursday, telling senators \"the bottom line\" is the furniture was never ordered.\n\nCarson canceled the order after news of the purchase sparked a furious backlash. Asked repeatedly during hostile rounds of questioning by Democrats about the costly table set, Carson at one point appeared to downplay the cost itself.\n\n\"It's not a table -- it's 17 pieces of furniture that we were asked to replace,\" he said in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee\n\n\"The bottom line is that the table has not materialized and there is no cost to the American people -- not even a penalty cost for whoever ordered it,\" he added.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the panel's top Democrat, zeroed in on the shifting explanations Carson and HUD have offered for the order, saying the secretary was trying to deflect blame for the embarrassment.\n\nCarson on Tuesday told House appropriators he had \"left it to [his] wife\" to pick new furniture after staff told him the table had fallen into disrepair and needed to be replaced. Carson also said he could not \"be responsible for what anyone else said\" about his involvement, referring to statements by his spokesman that were later undercut by the evidence.\n\n\"Instead of taking responsibility, Mr. Secretary, you seem to want to blame others,\" Brown said. \"Blaming others seems to be the order of the day in the swamp. I think you need to take responsibility and get things right.\"\n\nCarson maintained that his Facebook post of March 5 was accurate -- that he and his wife were asked to pick out a table but that he wasn't aware of the final cost. A HUD spokesman initially told reporters that career staff selected the table without consulting Carson, but emails released last week show a HUD employee referring to \"print outs of the furniture Secretary and Mrs. Carson picked out\" on Aug. 29, 2017.\n\nBrown mocked the justification that the old table had become dangerous, accusing Carson of evincing more concern over a \"wobbly chair\" than the \"unsafe and unsanitary conditions in public housing.\"\n\nGiven an opportunity by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) to clear things up, Carson said that ultimately \"we spent a total of less than $3,500 decorating my office.\"\n\nScott -- who on Wednesday sent Carson a pointed list of questions about the order -- urged the secretary to end \"the sideshow\" of controversies. Two employees left the agency in recent weeks after media reports linked them to fraud and a questionable charity.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) suggested the real controversy is HUD's handling of housing discrimination under the Trump administration.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, I think scamming the taxpayers is a scandal, but the biggest scandal of your tenure is your unwillingness to do your job and enforce the laws that reduce housing discrimination and segregation across this country,\" she said.\n\n\"It is HUD's job to help end housing discrimination -- that's what the law said,\" Warren added. \"You said you would enforce these laws, you haven't, and I think that's the scandal that should get you fired.\"",

                "title": "Trump strikes back at Chinese tech practices with new tariffs",
                "body": "President Donald Trump will escalate economic tensions with China by unveiling on Thursday extensive new trade restrictions that would effectively block $50 billion in Chinese imports from entering the United States.\n\nTrump will direct his administration to take action that will likely result in tariffs on a proposed list of 1,300 products as punishment for Beijing's intellectual property practices, senior White House officials said ahead of the announcement.\n\nThe officials said the list of targeted products will largely focus on technology China is accused of forcefully taking from U.S. companies. The value of that list represents the harm that U.S. companies have suffered from China's practices, they said.\n\n\"What you'll see is that many of these areas are those where China has sought to acquire advantage through the unfair acquisition or forced technology transfer from U.S. companies with an aim toward establishing its own competitive advantage,\" said Everett Eissenstat, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, during a call with reporters.\n\nTrump's new tariffs are the first strike in a series of planned hard-line trade actions the administration intends to take to counter Chinese policies that U.S. technology companies argue force them to surrender billions of dollars in intellectual property and other proprietary information to gain access to China's state-controlled economy.\n\n\"Administrations before us and this administration have tried very, very hard to work with the Chinese,\" senior White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters. \"The problem with the Chinese in this case, talk is not cheap, it's been very expensive to the American people.\"\n\nA senior White House official said the value of targeted imports is a \"very conservative estimate of harm\" because it doesn't include instances of blatant cyber theft of U.S. technology and trade secrets.\n\nThe tariff list will be published within 15 days of the announcement and will go into effect within 60 days after a public comment process, another senior White House official said.\n\nTrump will also direct the Treasury Department to craft new restrictions that would block Chinese companies from being able to invest in certain sectors of the U.S. economy where it has sought to obtain U.S. technology, the officials said.\n\nUnlike tariffs on steel and aluminum that divided Trump's advisers, Navarro said there is \"not an inch of daylight between anybody either within the White House or within the Cabinet agencies on this action. We are united.\"\n\nAdministration officials have said the level of tariffs applied to the $50 billion in targeted products will largely remove any commercial incentive for China to export those goods, effectively blocking them from the U.S. market. Earlier this month, Trump demanded that China develop a plan to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. by $100 billion.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had earlier presented a retaliation package targeting $30 billion worth of Chinese imports, but Trump demanded a larger target amount.\n\nThe action has drawn a cautious reaction from Capitol Hill, where lawmakers largely support cracking down on China but not at the expense of U.S. businesses and consumers. Business and agriculture groups have warned that unilateral tariffs will spark retaliation that will stifle job creation and hurt U.S. exporters.\n\n\"My continued support is contingent on the president choosing an appropriate remedy,\" Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said at the start of a hearing on Thursday. \"That remedy should be targeted specifically at the perpetrators and beneficiaries of China's actions, and it must be part of a strategy to correct China's technology policies.\"\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) also urged Trump to choose the right remedy, \"not one that punishes American families, workers and small businesses by putting new taxes on the products they buy. That won't change China's behavior.\"\n\nTrump's latest trade restrictions were unveiled just one day before his tariffs on steel and aluminum will go into force on Friday, further antagonizing the Asian superpower and raising the specter of a damaging trade war. Chinese retaliation against U.S. soybeans, aircraft and other exports is now all but certain.\n\nDespite the potential consequences, Trump has been eager to hit China with tariffs to fulfill his campaign pledge to crack down on what he has described as China's trade abuses. Trump blames Beijing for America's ballooning trade deficit and has consistently held up China's trade surplus with the U.S. -- which now stands at more than $375 billion in goods -- as a central failing of U.S. trade policy.\n\nThe tariffs and pending restrictions on investments would respond specifically to violations of U.S. intellectual property rights and policies that force U.S. companies to hand over sensitive technology to the Chinese government or to Chinese companies as a condition of doing business there.\n\nThe move is related to an order Trump signed in August that directed Lighthizer to open an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Officials have been examining whether any Chinese laws, policies, practices or actions force American companies to transfer valuable technology to compete in the market or otherwise fail to adequately protect U.S. intellectual property rights.\n\nThe 300-page report the administration is expected to release to justify the trade restrictions detailed an aggressive push by China to ramp up its industrial policy to boost the country's manufacturing sector through government subsidies and other forms of support.\n\nCentral to the Trump administration's case that China is siphoning off U.S. innovation is the \"Made in China 2025\" plan, an initiative Beijing launched to support growth in advanced industries and technologies, such as biopharmaceuticals, robotics and artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and next-generation telecommunications.",

                "title": "Lawmakers gather behind election security bill  --  at last",
                "body": "For the first time since the 2016 election, Congress is poised to move legislation to combat hackers and online trolls targeting American democracy.\n\nSenior Republicans and Democrats will come together on Thursday to stump for a revised version of a stalled election security proposal that has gained new momentum in recent days. The measure has now gathered enough backing from high-level lawmakers that it could prove the first concrete action taken in response to repeated calls from cybersecurity experts, election integrity advocates and state officials for Congress to help cash-strapped states upgrade their aging voting technology in the wake of the Russian hacks and disinformation campaigns that roiled the 2016 presidential race.\n\nWhen the updated bill is reintroduced Thursday afternoon, it will include sponsorship from the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, giving the legislation the leadership backing it previously lacked. And chairs of other relevant committees have also indicated an openness to swiftly advancing the bill's provisions.\n\nThe legislation, known as the Secure Elections Act, \"helps the states to prepare our election infrastructure for the possibility of interference from not just Russia, but possibly another adversary like Iran or North Korea or a hacktivist group,\" Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, one of the four Republicans now on the measure, said in a statement.\n\n\"With 2018 elections across the country underway, the urgency to act is clear,\" added California Sen. Kamala Harris, one of four Democrats backing the bill.\n\nThe centerpiece of the legislation, originally introduced in December, is an election security grant program that would disburse money to states. The measure would also direct the creation of voluntary voting cybersecurity guidelines that states could get money to implement.\n\nAdditionally, the measure aims to improve the exchange of cyber threat intelligence between D.C. and the states, long a sore spot for local officials who say they've been kept out of the loop on vital information about Russian hackers.\n\n\"We must streamline cybersecurity information-sharing,\" Lankford said.\n\nWhile those provisions have remained largely in place since December, lawmakers have negotiated a few tweaks to ameliorate some concerns.\n\nThe revised bill, obtained by POLITICO, moves control of grant funding from the Homeland Security Department to the Election Assistance Commission, a panel that House Republicans have tried to eliminate funding for in the past.\n\nIt also ditches a proposed voluntary \"Hack the Election\" program that would have doled out rewards to ethical hackers who find digital flaws in election systems, a potential compromise to local officials and voting technology vendors who didn't like the idea.\n\nThe overhauled legislation's release comes just two day after the Senate Intelligence Committee released its own recommendations for strengthening the country's election defenses as part of the panel's year-long probe into Russia's 2016 election meddling and possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign on those efforts.\n\nThe committee's suggestions largely mirrored the bipartisan bill, suddenly giving the dormant bill new life.\n\nThe measure already had the broadest ideological support of any offering in Congress.\n\nIn addition to Harris and Lankford, the bill also had the support of other Intelligence Committee members like left-leaning Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from main. Outside of the Intelligence panel, the bill also had support from hawkish Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a rumored 2020 presidential hopeful.\n\nAfter the Intelligence Committee held a hearing on Wednesday to discuss its election security recommendations, it became clear that a consensus was slowly forming around the Secure Elections Act. Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and panel ranking member Mark Warner (D-Va.) both publicly said they would back the legislation, a major stamp of approval for the measure.\n\nIn fact, Burr and Warner had already helped fight to include provisions from the legislation in the $1.3 trillion spending deal reached by congressional leaders Wednesday night. The omnibus legislation would provide $380 million for election security grants, similar to the bill's funding proposal.\n\nLankford -- and other supporting the bill -- applauded the inclusion, but stressed that lawmakers must go further.\n\n\"Congress still must pass this legislation to put these needed election improvements into law,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not enough,\" Klobuchar agreed. \"There are 227 days until the next federal election and primaries have already begun. Congress should pass the bipartisan Secure Elections Act immediately.\"\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Burr signaled that portions of the legislation might go through the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the Senate Rules Committee, which both have jurisdiction over different provisions.\n\nIncoming Rules Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) has indicated he's interested in moving sections of the bill. Blunt will take over the committee in early April, and told POLITICO that one of his \"early hearings\" would be on election security and that the gathering \"\"in all likelihood, would lead to some kind of legislation.\"\n\nCollins warned that every delay in passing the bill is time the Russians have to disrupt American democracy.\n\n\"We know for certain that the Russians were relentless in their efforts to meddle in the 2016 elections, and that those efforts are ongoing,\" she said.",

                "body": "HOUSE VOTES TODAY ON THE OMNIBUS: After days of wrangling by congressional leaders and the White House, the omnibus spending legislation H.R. 1625 (115) was finally unveiled Wednesday night. And a final vote has been set in the House for this afternoon, less than 24 hours after the massive package was formally filed.\n\nBoth the House and Senate must act by midnight Friday to avoid another government shutdown.\n\nPOLITICO's John Bresnahan, Heather Caygle, Rachael Bade and Sarah Ferris have this update: \"With government funding running out midnight Friday, House GOP leaders are scrambling to push a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill through the chamber today, only hours after unveiling its text.\n\n\"But House Democrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), are pushing back, trying to defeat the bill on a parliamentary vote this morning.\n\n\"Top Republicans privately believe Pelosi's gambit will fail, but the last-minute maneuvering shows how confused the outlook for the omnibus package is on Capitol Hill at this moment.\"\n\n-- READ THE BILL: Text of the 2,232-page bill is here. And an explanatory statement for the defense portion is here.\n\n-- CUTTING A BIG CHECK FOR DEFENSE: The $655 billion defense portion is an increase of more than $61 billion from fiscal 2017. It allocates $589.5 billion for the base Pentagon budget and another $65.2 billion for overseas war operations.\n\nThe bill delivers -- at least for an initial year -- on Republican defense hawks' goals of launching a major military buildup to meet what they see as growing threats around the world and fill gaps in military readiness.\n\nOur colleague Connor O'Brien has a defense rundown here. Some highlights:\n\n-- FLEXIBILITY: Reflecting concerns that the military services would have trouble spending the massive infusion of cash with only half of this fiscal year remaining, the measure gives the Pentagon flexibly in spending for operations and maintenance.\n\nThe bill adjusts the so-called 80/20 rule, which prohibits the Pentagon from obligating more than 20 percent of its annual funds in the final two months of a fiscal year, by increasing the limit to 25 percent. It also increases the threshold for reprogramming operations and maintenance funds from $15 million to $20 million.\n\n-- BOOSTING HARDWARE: The legislation funds 90 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters at $10.2 billion, an increase of 20 fighter above the request. Appropriators also funded 24 Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets, 10 more than requested.\n\nFor shipbuilding, the bill provides money for 14 ships at $23.8 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion. That includes funding for two Arleigh Burke class destroyers, two Virginia class submarines, three Littoral Combat Ships, an amphibious warship and an aircraft carrier.\n\n-- MILITARY PAY RAISE: In addition to increasing the personnel levels of the services, the omnibus funds a 2.4 percent troop pay raise, which matches the fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act and is an increase from the budget request.\n\n-- DETAILED SUMMARIES ARE HERE: Senate Republicans | Senate Democrats | House Republicans | House Democrats\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we urge everyone to confirm events aren't postponed or canceled as Washington digs out from the spring snowstorm.

Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.).\n\nIt would give the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security authority to track, confiscate or destroy drones previously granted to the Pentagon to protect military installations, among other provisions.\n\n\"On the other side of the globe, militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have used weaponized consumer drones to target U.S. and coalition partners,\" Hartzler said in a statement. \"It is only a matter of time before similar acts are executed here at home to target U.S. citizens.\"\n\nThe aim of her bill, she said, is to \"protect against crime while encouraging the future growth of drone technology and availability.\"\n\nINDUSTRY INTEL -- RAYTHEON LASERS IN ON COUNTER-DRONE MARKET, reports Breaking Defense: \"The market for weapons that can shoot down small drones, used by the likes of Hezbollah and Daesh, should rise from almost nothing to 'several billion dollars' over the next five years.

                "title": "Insights from the Senate election security hearing",
                "body": "PLENTY TO CHEW ON -- Wednesday's Senate Intelligence hearing on election security was jam-packed with information. The biggest highlights:\n\n-- The states: One theme of the hearing was senatorial dismay at the Homeland Security Department not helping states quickly enough. Sen. Kamala Harris, for instance, pressed DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on how many of the department's highest-level security reviews, known as risk and vulnerability assessments, have been completed. Nielsen said the number was 15, with four more currently in the works. Harris said she had heard other figures from DHS officials, but either way, Nielsen committed to completing the assessments for anyone who asks before the November 2018 elections.\n\nThe states haven't always been easy for the federal government to deal with, senators and witnesses said. Nielsen said two unnamed states were not working with DHS to the degree the department wanted, and former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said he once had to call a senator to nudge a state into cooperating. Top panel Democrat Mark Warner said the public deserves to know which states are slacking, but Nielsen also warned that if the department reveals information it learned from states voluntarily, it could make the relationship even worse. The panel has seen some of states' distrust of the feds up close: Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said that after DHS dubbed election systems as \"critical infrastructure,\" they were less willing to talk to his panel for its election probe and recommendations.\n\n-- Voting machines: The security of election equipment also came up repeatedly. Nielsen called it a \"national security concern\" that some states don't have a backup paper trail to enable audits of electronic votes. Sen. Ron Wyden, who said he has been \"stonewalled\" when seeking information from voting machine vendors about their cyber safeguards, asked Jeanette Manfra, DHS' assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications, \"How confident are you that the election technology they sell to the states follows common cybersecurity best practices?\" Manfra answered: \"It's just hard for me to judge right now. I don't have perfect insight into the machines that the states buy.\" But she did say many manufacturers have submitted their equipment to federal agencies for voluntary security reviews. Sen. Angus King also asked how many vendors have foreign owners, but none of the witnesses he queried had an answer.\n\n-- Everything else: Manfra said she saw no signs of Russia or other foreign nations currently probing the election system to interfere in the 2018 races. Nielsen said 20 out of 150 top state election officials have received security clearances, a figure Sen. Susan Collins considered surprisingly low, although Manfra later said the number was 21. After the hearing, a DHS spokesman told MC that of the 41 state chief election officers who have sought clearances, 19 have received clearances. Each state has the option to get clearances for two more officials, the spokesman added. Manfra also said the department had requested a $25 million boost for election security, a reversal of the department's position last year that it had enough resources. Johnson acknowledged that the Obama administration's punitive response to Russia's election hacking didn't deter the Kremlin. And Burr said he will sign on as a co-sponsor of a bipartisan election security bill.\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

And a newly created government-wide IT upgrade fund would get $100 million to begin operations if Congress passes the bill. Congress had previously authorized the creation of a $500 million \"Technology Modernization Fund\" to pay for agencies' IT projects, but had yet to appropriate any money for the fund. The omnibus' $100 million appropriation will help fill the fund's coffers, but is still well short of the $250 million envisioned for each of the next two fiscal years. \"Better than nothing but $100m is a drop in the bucket for federal IT modernization,\" tweeted one technology lobbyist.\n\nOver at DHS, the department's main cybersecurity wing would get $1.9 billion, $110 million above fiscal 2017. Of that, $1.1 billion would go toward securing federal networks, including $71 million extra for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program that gives agencies cybersecurity tools to shore up their defenses. DHS would also get $26 million in new money for election security, approximately what the department sought as mentioned by Manfra at the Senate Intelligence hearing, and $14 million for cybersecurity education.\n\nElsewhere, appropriators boasted that the bill would send nearly $13 million toward improving security of the Senate's network, an 84 percent increase. For technical standards agency NIST, \"targeted funding will continue to support our nation's cybersecurity posture through cutting-edge research.\" Additionally, funding for the FBI would \"enhance its investigative and intelligence efforts\" related to cyber and other threats, according to the summary. And U.S. attorneys would get $4.9 million more than President Donald Trump requested for cybercrime prosecution.\n\nAt the Energy Department, efforts to protect the nation's electric grid from cybersecurity attacks would get $248 million in the package, an increase of $18 million from previous efforts.\n\nThe omnibus also contains a vague provision about government cyberattack response. It directs the head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a Commerce Department agency, to study how NTIA \"can best coordinate the interagency process following cybersecurity incidents.\" The resulting report must be delivered to the House and Senate commerce committees within 18 months.\n\nFIRST IN MC: GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE -- A pair of senators today are introducing bipartisan legislation designed to bolster the federal cybersecurity workforce, which constantly thirsts for qualified personnel. Democratic Sen. Gary Peters and Republican Sen. John Hoeven, who both sit on the Homeland Security Committee, are proposing a bill that would establish a civilian agency personnel rotation initiative modeled after the military's joint duty program. Peters said the rotation \"will boost collaboration between agencies and offer more opportunities for federal employees to enhance their careers and broaden their cybersecurity expertise.\" This month, Peters questioned NSA director nominee Army Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone about cyber recruiting, and Nakasone said joint duty programs work well for training and retention.\n\nMORE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA FALLOUT -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday broke his silence about the scandal surrounding Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked on Trump's election campaign and stands accused of misusing Facebook user data. \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post. \"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again.\" The social media giant recently revealed that it failed to ensure Cambridge destroyed information on some 50 million Americans that it obtained via an academic researcher. Zuckerberg acknowledged that it first learned about the violation in 2015 and laid out a series of steps to safeguard data and mend what he dubbed a \"breach of trust\" between the company and its users.\n\nOne Facebook source told our friends on the Pro Technology team that the atmosphere inside the company has been tense since Trump's election, and the latest situation is \"not exactly helpful for employee morale.\"\n\nBut that wasn't the only news of the day concerning Cambridge Analytica. Special counsel Robert Mueller's team is reportedly examining the relationship between Trump's campaign and the firm. Several digital experts who worked on the 2016 campaign have met with Mueller's team for closed-door interviews. Meanwhile, The Guardian reported that the firm was offered hacked emails that contained personal information about the current leaders of Nigeria.\n\nTECH GIANT SECURITY OFFICIALS ABANDON SHIP? -- It might just be a coincidence, but at a time of ever-expanding scrutiny of Silicon Valley's role in Russia's 2016 election meddling, three different top tech giants this week faced reports that their chief security officers are departing. First came the story that Facebook's chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, was leaving, although Stamos has rejected some elements of the report. Late Tuesday, Michal Zalewski, Google's director of information security engineering, announced his departure. And on Wednesday came a report that Twitter's chief information security officer, Michael Coates, is leaving the company.\n\n** A message from OWI: KNOW Identity Conference 2018 offers a unique & immersive event that convenes the world's smartest minds to shape the future of identity and security.

Targeted attacks were up 10 percent in 2017, according to the report. \"These are the most sophisticated people who can do the most damage and there are more and more of them every year,\" Kevin Haley, the company's director of security response, told MC. The most surprising finding of the report, Haley said, is the \"explosive growth\" of cryptojacking, with cyber criminals seizing others' equipment to mine digital currency. The good news, if any? After a breakthrough 2016 for ransomware, a \"market correction\" from a crowded field led to ransomware attackers in 2017 receiving less than half as much in ransom payments as they got the year before, on average.\n\nONE STEP FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK -- While the Senate appears to be moving on election security legislation, a top House Democrat is mad that his committee won't hold a hearing on the subject. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the House Homeland Security ranking member, on Wednesday demanded the panel Chairman Michael McCaul make good on a vow to convene his panel on the topic. In a statement, Thompson said he had received a written notice from McCaul that backed out on a promise the Texas Republican made earlier this month to hold a \"full hearing\" on the issue.\n\n\"Holding a focused and comprehensive hearing on election security is not a partisan or complicated request,\" Thompson said. \"It speaks volumes that while Chairman McCaul has been dragging his feet on this issue for over a year, the Senate is holding election security hearings today with current and former Homeland Security officials. This is all we are asking for.\" In his letter, McCaul noted that Nielsen will testify before the committee on April 26. \"I fully encourage all members to raise the issue when she appears,\" the Texas Republican wrote.\n\nTRUST ME, WE GET IT -- The Trump administration's top cyber diplomat on Wednesday defended the government's efforts to deter digital adversaries, pointing to several examples of what he called muscular responses to cyber threats. \"This administration is seeking to hold accountable malicious state actors. We've done that in a number of realms,\" said Rob Strayer, the deputy assistant secretary of State overseeing cyber policy, during a panel at the Billington International Cybersecurity Summit in Washington. Strayer cited the Trump administration's decision to blame the WannaCry ransomware attack on North Korea, point the finger at Russia for the NotPetya malware campaign and slap Russian cyber actors with sanctions.\n\n\"It's important that we worked with our partners on this,\" Strayer added, noting that the U.S. arranged for other nations in the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence-sharing group to join the WannaCry attribution statement. And he acknowledged criticism that simply naming bad actors wasn't enough, telling the audience, \"It's important that we call these out, but then we also [must] implement consequences.\"\n\nStrayer's office at the State Department, which handles both cyber issues and broader telecom policy, is in the process of being elevated. Strayer is expected to be promoted to an assistant secretary position supervising the officials handling cyber and telecom issues. Departing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson launched the reorganization in response to congressional criticism of his previous cyber office reshuffling. Strayer said Wednesday that despite Tillerson's looming departure, State has continued planning the elevation.\n\nJIGSAW EXPANDS SECURITY PUZZLE -- Google's parent company Alphabet wants to make it easier for anyone to run a virtual private network to hide their internet traffic from prying eyes. On Wednesday, Alphabet's tech incubator Jigsaw unveiled a service called Outline that will let people configure VPNs on either their own physical server or on their slice of a cloud platform like Rackspace. By letting anyone set up their own personal VPN -- whether locally or remotely hosted -- Alphabet hopes to free people from relying on the handful of popular commercial VPNs. That could make it harder for repressive regimes to block their citizens' access to restricted sites. \"You get the reassurance that no one else has your data, and you can rest easier in that knowledge,\" Santiago Andrigo, a product manager at Jigsaw, told Wired.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY -- Reps.

                "title": "Omnibus: We have a deal",
                "body": "OMNIBUS -- WE HAVE A DEAL: In a pleasant snowy day in Washington, Congressional leaders reached a deal to keep the government running for the rest of the year with a trillion-dollar-plus spending package. The bill (H.R. 1625 (115)) keeps the Office of the National Coordinator's and Office for Civil Rights's funding for the remainder of 2018 flat relative to 2017. Other health IT priorities enjoyed raises. The Department of Veterans affairs also got $782 million for its Cerner installation, though it requires the secretary to submit quarterly reports on the programs progress. Shulkin has asked for $1.2 billion in Cerner funding for fiscal year 2019.\n\nTo get down to the nitty-gritty: NIH overall receives a $3 billion boost, with $290 million going to the Institutes' precision medicine work. (That's a $60 million increase from 2017.) Meanwhile, telemedicine won much more funding, with broadband expansion subsidized to the tune of $600 million, and as much as $82 million going to three grant programs for the modality.\n\nBroadly, funding to combat the opioid crisis gets $4 billion. Some of that funding will be devoted to prescription drug monitoring programs; CDC is directed to make PDMPs more interconnected with each other, and integrated with EHRs. (It should work with ONC on that latter task.)\n\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality escapes the chopping block, and its funding stays flat at $334 million.\n\nWhether this constitutes a win or a loss for the health IT sector is up for debate. Flat budgets for ONC and OCR is higher than the Trump administration's budget request for 2018. The budget envisioned cuts of $22 million and $6 million respectively. Trump's 2019 budget will try for another bite at the apple, once again asking for cuts of $22 million and $8 million, respectively.\n\nBut health IT advocates, naturally, feel that ONC and OCR should get raises. Ben Moscovitch, of Pew Charitable Trusts, pointed our attention to a December 2017 letter written to Congressional appropriations leaders. The letter argues that ONC's got to have sufficient cash to fulfill its 21st Century Cures duties. (Pew Charitable Trusts has also argued, in the past, for federal funding devoted to health IT safety, though now it's going forward with more private-sector-focused plans.)\n\nMeanwhile, Lucia Savage, formerly the chief privacy officer at ONC, wondered, \"Gotta ask how is @HHSOCR supposed to give right of access teeth with no budget increase?\"\n\nAI FOCUS: Meanwhile, the implications of further tech development in artificial intelligence captured our attention:\n\n-- New AI trade group: The American Telemedicine Association's former CEO, Jonathan Linkous, has co-founded a new trade group dedicated to artificial intelligence and automation in health care.\n\nLinkous left the ATA last year after 24 years; he's now leading a new trade group, called the Partnership for Artificial Intelligence and Automation in Healthcare. Members will include health systems, industry, payers, regulators and individual professionals, and its goal is to more widely apply AI and automation to health care. \"With spiraling costs, increasing need, decreasing resources, and rapidly advancing technologies, healthcare desperately needs to catch up,\" according to Linkous. More for Pros here.\n\n-- New study shows some promise for atrial fibrillation-sensing gadgets: Small gadgets, using apps trained by artificial intelligence, have made at least preliminary progress in passively sensing atrial fibrillation, according to a new study in JAMA Cardiology. This particular effort - teamwork among the University of California, San Francisco, and startup Cardiogram - had some hiccups, as the app uploaded to an Apple Watch was not as successful at detecting arrhythmias when used on a real-world population (as compared to a group undergoing cardioversion at the doctor's office). As a consequence, UCSF's Greg Marcus, a co-author, acknowledged that \"we are not yet ready to roll out broad screening for atrial fibrillation using these tools quite yet.\"\n\nYet the UCSF/Cardiogram effort isn't the only attempt in this field. We've seen medical device manufacturers AliveCor build its own widgets to detect atrial fibrillation, and Apple itself is trying a clinical study. If the technology matures, the health care system will have to confront questions of implementation and cost-effectiveness. Pros can get the rest here; we also recommend this Twitter discussion between a Cardiogram exec and a few skeptical cardiologists for a detailed dive into the study.\n\n-- National security artificial intelligence commission?: Rep.

The Health Information Technology Advisory Committee voted Wednesday to accept a set of 27 recommendations from an internal task force about the Trusted Exchange Framework, including that ONC should clearly define its policy goals and better explain how the framework could further national goals, such as improving patients' access to data. The task force also recommended that ONC cut down on the framework's duplicative requirements -- and look to NIST for existing guidance on topics such as encryption algorithms. More for Pros here.\n\nThe task force leader, Arien Malec, tweeted out a storm of reflections on the recommendations, stating that his group's work \"beats the landspeed record for most high quality recommendations relative to time in deliberation.\" Malec concluded that the \"the real ... recommendation letter was the journey and the friends we made along the way.\"\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALLY NAMES REDFIELD FOR CDC: Robert Redfield, a prominent HIV/AIDS researcher at the University of Maryland, is the official appointee for the CDC, the Trump administration announced Wednesday. While questions have been asked about Redfield's views on HIV/AIDS (he supported mandatory testing and naming of patients early in the epidemic) and his potential research misconduct, the administration moved forward anyway. Our Health Care colleague Brianna Ehley mainly heard praise from Redfield's peers in the scientific community, and Sen. Lamar Alexander, the HELP Committee chair, was also pleased by the appointment. Alexander said in a statement that Redfield had a \"strong background\" to lead the agency. Redfield earned bipartisan praise; Rep. Elijah Cummings, a fellow Marylander, also gave his imprimatur.\n\nAt the CDC, Redfield can influence several areas of eHealth policy: the agency disseminates information and grants on prescription drug monitoring programs, to take one example.\n\nTECHNOLOGY HOLDING UP NURSING HOME CARE: Telemedicine is merely in its infancy and too early to know how it could help nursing home patients, an executive of the nursing home trade group said at a POLITICO Live event Wednesday. \"Telemedicine is just all over the map for what it means,\" said David Gifford, senior vice present for quality and regulatory affairs at the American Health Care Association. But it has a lot of promise and showing some signs of success.\n\nStill, the recent passage of the CHRONIC Care Act will help since it makes it easier for Medicare Advantage plans to offer telemedicine, panelists Wednesday said, allowing health insurers to experiment with the technology.\n\n-- An old bugbear: The lack of interoperability is a \"big problem\" for nursing homes, said Ruth Katz, head of public policy at LeadingAge. Nursing homes lose track of patients when they go to the hospital and have no idea how they were treated when they return.\n\nTim Peck, co-founder and chief executive of Call9, which provides telemedicine visits in nursing homes, said congressional offices are working on a bill intended to help nursing homes use telemedicine that should be introduced in the next few weeks.\n\nView the full event here if you missed it.\n\nHACKING UPDATE: How are our health care organizations doing on the hacking front?

                "title": "Spending bill would give big boost to education",
                "body": "WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE $1.3 TRILLION SPENDING BILL: Congressional negotiations finally yielded a proposed spending deal late Wednesday that would boost Education Department funding by $3.9 billion and dole out increases for other domestic programs tied to education. The list of winning programs is long -- and if Congress can pass the roughly 2,232-page bill by midnight Friday, it will also avert its third shutdown in as many months.\n\n-- \"After almost a decade of virtually stagnant federal funding for education, Congress has produced a Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations package that provides real increases for education,\" the Committee for Education Funding said in a statement.\n\n-- Notable K-12 increases: The deal includes $1.1 billion -- a $700 million boost -- for the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, which can be used for school counseling and mental health services, technology investments and STEM education. Both Title I funding for poor students and special education grants -- the two largest sources of federal K-12 funding -- would see increases. Federal funding for after-school programs would get a small $20 million boost, bringing total funding up to $1.2 billion. And the bill would maintain $2.1 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and class-size reduction efforts.\n\n-- The STOP School Violence Act, which would repurpose a Justice Department program aimed at reducing school violence, hitched a ride on the spending package. The bill, H.R. 4909 (115), would fund training and other initiatives intended to enhance school safety to the tune of $75 million annually -- including paying for physical improvements such as metal detectors, stronger locks and emergency notification technologies. Lawmakers also plan to funnel $47 million to programs within the Education Department and the Health and Human Services Department that address youth mental health, as well as social and emotional learning in schools.\n\n-- Historically black colleges and universities would get millions more, including a $35 million, 14 percent boost to a program meant to help the schools strengthen their physical plants, financial management, academic resources and endowment-building capacity.\n\n-- Other winners include Head Start, federal Impact Aid, Pell grant recipients, STEM education and rural schools.\n\n-- One of the biggest losers appeared to be Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Lawmakers interfered with her plans to overhaul how the Education Department collects federal student loans, blocking an effort to go to a new system that contracts out individual loan servicing tasks to different companies. They also pushed back against DeVos' efforts to dismantle her agency's central budget office, stopping the department from decentralizing some functions of the budget office. More on that from Michael Stratford here.\n\n-- Also losing out were most of DeVos' school choice proposals, which got scant traction from lawmakers. The only exception: Charter schools got a $58 million boost, bringing the total funding to $400 million. Trump's fiscal 2018 budget proposal called for $500 million for charter schools. It also proposed a new $250 million private school choice program, which was not funded. And it sought to use $1 billion in Title I funding for poor students to encourage public school choice, which was not included.\n\n-- The omnibus also would send an additional $8.5 million to the Education Department's civil rights office, which DeVos has sought to downsize. Appropriators said the money should go toward staffing up the office, from which the administration wanted to cut 46 positions. Appropriators also directed the department to maintain its 12 regional civil rights offices, turning back its proposal to reduce the number to four, according to reorganization plan obtained by POLITICO. A department spokeswoman told the New York Times this week that the plan had been abandoned.\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY. THIS IS MORNING EDUCATION.

Ricardo Rossello. The plan was pitched as the island's education system grappled with a tough recovery and mass migration to the states following Hurricane Maria.\n\n-- The proposal finalized by both legislative chambers this week would reduce the number of students who can receive school vouchers to a permanent 3 percent -- down from the 5 percent Puerto Rico's House of Representatives had approved last week. The finalized legislation would also prioritize students with severe disabilities, gifted and low-income students, among others. Vouchers would roll out in the 2019-2020 school year. It's unclear how much money would be granted to each student, but the legislation calls for no more than 70 percent of what is already allocated per public school student.\n\n-- The legislation would allow for the creation of charter schools, or for the conversion of existing public schools into charters. An amendment from the island's Senate, however, prohibits specialized schools, like Montessori schools, from converting to charters. The law would require charter schools be run by nonprofit operators, and be nonsectarian. Students from across the island would be able to participate in enrollment lotteries, though schools have to give preference to students in neighboring communities. Teachers who chose to work for charter schools would be given a leave of absence from the Education Department, which would hold their jobs for up to two years.\n\n-- Responding to concerns that Puerto Rico's system would emulate post-Katrina New Orleans, where nearly all students attend charter schools, both chambers agreed to cap the number of charter schools to 10 percent of all public schools.\n\n-- Rossello has not indicated when he would sign the bill, but said in a statement he is \"pleased\" with the legislation, and that it improves upon the plan submitted by the administration months earlier. \"With this bill, our boys and girls will have a better education system,\" he said.\n\n-- AFT President Randi Weingarten, whose organization is affiliated with the largest teachers' union in Puerto Rico, continued to decry the introduction of charter schools to the island but said she was pleased with the protections for teachers included in the bill. \"We will continue working with lawmakers to insert additional checks and balances as the legislative process unfolds,\" she said.\n\nVOUCHER REFERENDUM CLEARS ARIZONA HIGH COURT: The Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that state voters can decide whether to expand a state program that allows public funds to pay for private school tuition using education savings accounts.\n\n-- The case was spurred by an Arizona law enacted last year that would allow any family transferring from a public school to participate in the program, whereas it had been restricted in the past to a limited number of families, such as those with a child with a disability or a parent in the military.\n\n-- A group opposing the law, Save Our Schools, helped gather enough signatures to have it brought before voters in a November referendum. But the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity and others challenged the signatures, leading to the dispute in court. More from the Arizona Daily Star.\n\nSCHOOL CHIEFS KICK OFF TEACHER DIVERSITY INITIATIVE: Pointing to the lack of racial and cultural representation among teachers, the Council of Chief State School Officers is launching a push to diversify the workforce and prepare teachers to serve students from different backgrounds. The effort involves nine states - Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, and New York.\n\n-- By 2020, leaders in those states hope to \"revise, enact or remove state policies\" with the goal of diversifying the workforce \"and ensuring all educators are culturally responsive.\"\n\n-- Also on that topic, the Brown Center on Education Policy at Brookings is out with a new report on whether financial incentives could diversify the teaching workforce.\n\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS\n\n-- Rob Anderson will serve as the next superintendent for Boulder Valley Schools in Boulder County, Colo.

                "body": "A daily download of technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley\n\nWith help from Margaret Harding McGill and John Hendel\n\nZUCK 'HAPPY' TO TESTIFY IN CONGRESS -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday broke his silence on the bombshell Cambridge Analytica reports in a CNN interview, and said he'd be \"happy\" to testify in front of Congress -- but only, he suggested, if there's no one else Facebook would rather send. \"What we try to do is send the person at Facebook who will have the most knowledge about what Congress is trying to learn. So, if that's me, then I'm happy to go,\" Zuckerberg said. He also didn't shy from the prospect of facing more government oversight. \"I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" he said, adding that he backs policies that would require greater ad transparency from social media sites.\n\n-- As for the company's next steps on the Cambridge Analytica controversy, Zuckerberg said Facebook's working to inform users who were affected and track down other apps that may have improperly shared personal information. He said Facebook intends to notify anyone whose data \"might\" have been harvested by \"rogue apps,\" including some 50 million people whose information was reportedly collected by Cambridge Analytica. \"We need to make sure there aren't any other Cambridge Analyticas out there,\" he said, noting that the company aims to review how thousands of apps have handled user data.\n\n-- Still a lot of unanswered questions: The interview offered little clarity on election interference. Zuckerberg said it was \"really hard to have a full assessment\" of the impact that activity on Facebook may have had on the 2016 election. And his answers weren't much clearer when it came to the upcoming midterms. \"I'm sure someone's trying,\" he said when asked whether he believed there are efforts already underway to use the platform to meddle in the 2018 elections.\n\n-- Over on the Hill: As Zuckerberg makes the rounds with the press, Facebook staff are continuing its briefings with representatives from the Commerce, Judiciary and Intelligence Committees in both chambers scheduled for this week. Plus, Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intel panel, has invited Aleksandr Kogan, the researcher who allegedly gave user data to Cambridge Analytica, to testify before the panel's Democrats. An attorney of Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie has already said he'll meet with House Intel Democrats.\n\n-- And there's more happening across the pond: French President Emmanuel Macron is among the EU heads of state expected to discuss the Cambridge Analytica revelations during a gathering today, POLITICO Europe's Joanna Plucinska and Maia de la Baume report. \"The crux of his argument will be that tech companies need to do a far better job protecting citizens' personal data, and Europe needs to use its regulatory stick to make sure it happens,\" they write. EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova also called the reports a \"wake up call\" during an event in D.C. on Wednesday. \"Data protection is not an aim in itself, it is important to protect our democracy,\" she said. \"The new EU wide data protection rules, the so-called GDPR, general data protection regulation, come just in time.\"\n\nFCC MARCHES FORWARD WITH 5G PLAN -- The agency will take up an order today meant to drive down the regulatory costs for deploying 5G infrastructure by scrapping some federal reviews, despite calls for a delay from Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Democrats in Congress. The wireless industry has cheered the move, led by Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr, which would exempt from federal environmental and historic reviews the small-cell wireless antennas that will deliver 5G service. But tribes, which can charge fees for siting on areas outside of reservations, say the FCC is wrong to cut them out of the review process, Margaret reports.\n\n-- Democratic Sens. Tom Udall, Maria Cantwell and Tina Smith and Rep. Ben Ray Lujan urged the commission to delay its vote over concerns from tribes, saying in a letter that the order confuses \"streamlining with steamrolling.\" But wireless trade group CTIA, which backs the order, said the FCC has found the right balance. \"The FCC's action is targeted and long overdue and modernizing the process will help deliver faster wireless broadband deployment across the country while still safeguarding areas of importance to Tribal Nations,\" a CTIA spokesperson said.\n\n-- Also up for a vote is a proposal for a database that businesses can check to see if a phone number has been reassigned to a new consumer before placing a call, and an order that would lift the personal-use restriction on wireless signal boosters so that businesses can also use them.\n\n-- Scheduling note: The FCC meeting is set to start at 11:30 a.m., given a federal government delay announced by the Office of Personnel Management.\n\n-- Oh, and speaking of 5G, the wireless industry is going wild for the newly introduced RAPID Act from Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), which directs the FCC to reexamine broadband deployments subject to environmental and historical reviews within a 180-day period. Carr lauded the bill for ensuring the FCC updates \"outdated regulatory approaches.\"\n\n-- IA joins the net neutrality fray: The trade group repping companies like Google and Facebook will seek to join the lawsuit challenging the FCC's repeal of the Obama-era net neutrality rules today. In its motion to intervene in the 9th Circuit Court case, the Internet Association argues that its companies will be \"left to the mercy of broadband provider gatekeepers\" without rules banning ISPs from blocking, throttling or paid prioritization. Consumer groups, state attorneys general and tech companies are among the organizations challenging the FCC's repeal. \"The entire sector is committed to preserving an open internet and will continue to defend these protections in every venue available,\" Internet Association President Michael Beckerman said in a statement. Telecom trade groups NCTA, USTelecom and CTIA have already asked to join the case in support of the FCC.\n\nOMNIBUS (FINALLY) PULLS INTO STOP -- House appropriators have officially dropped the text of the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, H.R. 1625, POLITICO's Heather Caygle, Burgess Everett, Rachael Bade and Sarah Ferris report, and a few tech and telecom measures managed to hitch a ride.\n\n-- Ray Baum's Act (H.R. 4986 (115)), a package of telecom provisions, was able to secure inclusion, Margaret reports. The telecom bill, the culmination of a bipartisan deal between House and Senate lawmakers, would reauthorize the FCC; free up airwaves for next-generation 5G wireless networks; and cover a funding shortfall stemming from a massive airwaves auction.\n\n-- Rural broadband got a carveout: The omnibus includes $600 million for a new pilot program within USDA aimed at rural broadband, John and Sarah report. This additional boost of cash is on top of existing USDA broadband loan and grant programs.\n\n-- The CLOUD Act is on board as well: The legislation (S. 2383 (115)), which has the backing of an array of tech companies including Microsoft and Apple, sets up a new legal framework for U.S. authorities to access data that's stored abroad. The omnibus needs to be passed by both chambers of Congress by Friday to prevent another government shutdown.\n\nGOOD THURSDAY MORNING and welcome to Morning Tech, where we can't believe we're already a few days into spring.

The bill, H.R. 1865 (115), would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to hold sites like Facebook and Google liable for knowingly publishing content that facilitates sex trafficking. The White House welcomed the bill. \"Over the last year, the President and his Administration have worked closely with Members of Congress, industry experts, and human trafficking survivors to develop a comprehensive series of bold actions, including this legislation, to end modern slavery in all of its forms,\" it said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n-- Many of the large tech giants ultimately backed the bill, but they weren't always so keen on its passage, Ashley and Steven report. \"At a series of May [2017] meetings in the Russell Senate Office building with staffers for a bipartisan group of six senators, representatives of Google, Facebook and their trade group, the Internet Association, had a clear message, according to sources familiar with the discussions: Don't mess with the protections that shield us from lawsuits over content on our networks. Google went even further, describing it as a red line that lawmakers shouldn't cross, two congressional aides said. Google declined to comment. But in the months to come, the industry would encounter massive pushback. ... The story of how the industry lost this fight says a lot about Silicon Valley's changing status after years of kid-glove treatment in Washington.\"\n\nTODAY: DOJ-AT&T OPENING ARGUMENTS -- Opening arguments in the Justice Department's legal effort to halt the AT&T-Time Warner merger are expected to begin today, after they were postponed yesterday due to inclement weather. Attorneys will have 45 minutes apiece to land their initial blows in the high-stakes trial.\n\nTELECOM BILLS UNDER MICROSCOPE -- The House telecom subcommittee is holding a hearing this morning scrutinizing a slew of telecom bills. The bills in the spotlight would increase fines for illegal pirate radio operators, direct the FCC to study the prospect of designating a dialing code for a national suicide prevention hotline, streamline filing requirements for small businesses and develop a national standard for determining whether rural and urban areas have comparable wireless access.\n\nSILICON VALLEY MUST-READS\n\n-- White House to announce China trade crackdown: \"The White House is preparing to announce on Thursday a plan to eventually hit China with tariffs and other trade restrictions, according to two administration officials,\" POLITICO's Adam Behsudi and Andrew Restuccia report. \"President Donald Trump is slated to outline the results of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's investigation into allegations that China violates U.S. intellectual property rights by forcing American companies to transfer valuable technology to Beijing.\"\n\n-- Jack Dorsey's thoughts on bitcoin: \"Bitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade, Jack Dorsey, one of Silicon Valley's leading entrepreneurs, has said,\" The Times reports.\n\n-- Musk paycheck check-in: \"Tesla shareholders approved a compensation package potentially worth $2.6 billion for Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday in a test of their confidence in the leader of the electric car company,\" Reuters reports.\n\nTRANSITIONS -- Leigh Feldman, previously Citi's head of privacy and information compliance and the chief global privacy officer, is now managing director at Promontory Financial Group, an IBM Company, running the firm's U.S. privacy practice.\n\nQUICK DOWNLOADS\n\nGoogle and the blockchain: \"Google is working on blockchain-related technology to support its cloud business and head off competition from emerging startups that use the heavily-hyped technology to operate online in new ways,\" Bloomberg reports.\n\nYouTube has a new policy on videos with weapons: \"YouTube, a popular media site for firearms enthusiasts, this week quietly introduced tighter restrictions on videos involving weapons, becoming the latest battleground in the U.S. gun-control debate,\" Bloomberg reports.\n\nMore details emerge on self-driving accident: \"The Tempe Police Department has released the first footage of this week's fatal crash involving a self-driving Uber,\" The Verge reports.\n\n** A message from CTIA and America's wireless industry: We need new rules for new 5G networks. FCC rules modernizing federal environmental and historic preservation reviews of new wireless infrastructure are a critical step. We need similar action by cities, states, the FCC and Congress to update local siting rules. Identifying a pipeline of new low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum is the other piece of the puzzle. These key steps will allow U.S. wireless companies to invest $275 billion, create more than 3 million jobs, and add hundreds of billions to the economy, according to Accenture. This will drive breakthrough advancements in remote health care, connected vehicles, energy, education and beyond -- making our lives better and safer. But the race to deploy 5G wireless networks is underway -- and policymakers must act this year so that the U.S. can maintain our global leadership in wireless. The EU, China, Japan, South Korea and others are doing everything they can to win. Learn more at Raceto5G.CTIA.org. **",

                "body": "A KINDER, GENTLER BUST-UP: Republicans and Democrats alike have been sizing up the IRS for years, in an effort to find ways to make the tax collector more taxpayer-friendly.\n\nAnd while midterm election years aren't usually known for lots of legislating, House tax writers will release draft legislation to revamp IRS operations in coming days, Pro Tax's Aaron Lorenzo reports -- the first step in what backers hope will lead to a floor vote in the coming months. \"The proposal is aimed squarely at IRS dealings with taxpayers, including better dispute resolution, ensuring quicker responses to inquiries, and curbing over-zealous asset seizures, according to details shared with POLITICO.\"\n\nThat includes trying to give taxpayers more and better options to appeal IRS decisions; seeking to improve the IRS's phone answering statistics; offering permanent filing assistance to taxpayers who are either low-income, elderly or speak a primary language beyond English; putting new limits on the agency's ability to seize property; and beefing up information technology systems that can date back around a half-century.\n\nThe GOP's issues with the IRS have only heated up since the agency's tea party controversy five years ago, and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) has been a big fan of saying he wants to \"bust up\" the tax collector. But the new proposal is also full of the sort of measures that both Republicans and Democrats have generally been able to support, and there's hope that the legislation will have strong bipartisan support. Still, nothing's too simple these days: Republicans running the Ways and Means Committee were hoping to release the draft legislation today, but that looks likely to now slip into either Friday or Monday as they try to firm up a Democratic roster of cosponsors.\n\nTHE DAY HAS ARRIVED: It took days longer than expected, and seemed perpetually almost ready to be released throughout Wednesday -- but the 2,232 pages of omnibus spending text were finally released in the evening.\n\nThe bottom line for the IRS: It's pretty good, as Aaron also noted. The agency's budget will inch up to $11.4 billion, a $196 million increase. That's driven by a $320 million influx spread over two years specifically for implementing the GOP's new tax cut, which is about 80 percent of what the IRS had requested. David Kautter, the agency's interim chief, said most of the funds would go toward new technology and hardware.\n\nIt likely won't end there, either. \"The expectation is that there'll be additional money needed in '19,\" a GOP aide told Pro Tax about that $320 million figure. Either way, some liberal tax analysts were still far from impressed with how the IRS fared in the omnibus.\n\nAs for tax provisions: There's the \"grain glitch\" and not much else, Pro Tax's Brian Faler reports. Republicans cheered the fix for the mistake in the new tax law that gives farmers such an incentive to sell to cooperatives that some could even zero out their tax bills. Democrats got a four-year expansion of tax incentives for low-income housing -- the sort of temporary preference that could easily get extended again when the time comes, given how Congress has historically acted on those matters.\n\nWhat else is in: Technical corrections not dealing with last year's tax cut, but with measures like the big 2015 tax extenders deal and even earlier legislation. What was out: The omnibus does nothing about the Johnson Amendment, which bans churches and other tax-exempt groups from getting involved in electoral politics, and neither the online sales tax bill pushed by Rep. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) nor bipartisan retirement provisions found a home, either.\n\nWELCOME BACK TO MORNING TAX, where we hope everyone enjoyed that arduous multiday wait for the omnibus.

Will that actually happen? \"Paris was a major proponent of a move to make digital giants pay more into national coffers. But it's far from clear whether the proposal will survive inevitable pushback from the United States as well as several EU countries, which remain uncomfortable with Brussels' expanded role on tax and fear starting a 'tax war' with America,\" writes Bjarke Smith-Meyer.\n\nNot surprisingly, the European action got a chilly response from tech advocates here in the U.S. \"We agree with the fundamental thesis of the European Commission: today's tax systems do not reflect that today's economy is digital,\" said Dean Garfield of the Information Technology Industry Council. \"Unfortunately, the EU's proposal would exacerbate rather than solve this problem.\"\n\nWATCH OUT FOR IT TODAY: \"President Trump on Thursday plans to announce at least $50 billion worth of annual tariffs and other penalties on China for its theft of technology and trade secrets, which administration officials say has robbed American companies of billions of dollars in revenue and killed thousands of jobs,\" The New York Times reports.\n\nON THE ATTACK: The Koch political network has turned its focus toward Sen.

Now, public health experts are saying that the United Kingdom might have found a better way to tax sugary drinks, even though that tax doesn't actually go into effect until next month. That's because big beverage companies like Coca-Cola and San Pellegrino are already lowering the sugar content in their products, as The Washington Post notes -- so much so that the British have had to significantly lower their revenue projections from the tax. And that speaks to the big difference between the British tax, which seeks to nudge drink makers into slashing the sugar, and the taxes in Philadelphia, Oakland and countries like Mexico and South Africa, which try to reduce the consumption of high-calorie drinks.\n\nThe British tax charges two separate rates -- around 6 cents per serving on beverages with 12 to 19 grams of sugar per eight ounces, and 8 cents per serving on drinks with sugar above that level.\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nCHALLENGES CONFORMING, CONT'D: Idaho's efforts to bring its tax system in line with the new federal setup ended up cutting taxes in the state by another $100 million. But not everyone -- large families, mostly -- was held harmless, as the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center explained Wednesday. That's because Idaho cut all seven of its individual income tax rates and its corporate rates, but did not correct for the GOP tax cut's scrapping of personal exemptions. The new Idaho law does enact a $130 child tax credit, and state policymakers are already looking at bumping that up to $205 per child. \"But it won't make everyone whole,\" writes Richard Auxier. \"According to Idaho's Legislative Services Office, a $287 CTC would be needed to fully offset the loss of personal exemptions for all households.\"\n\nWhere else? A top South Carolina lawmaker has filed legislation that conforms the state's tax system, a measure that could save taxpayers there around $180 million in state taxes next year, The State reported.

Either way, that's what federal rail and transit programs are saying on the heels of the omnibus rollout, which finally happened Thursday night. The deal would funnel billions of dollars to rail and transit, thanks in no small part to the extra billions for infrastructure wrapped into the recent two-year budget deal. DOT's top-line discretionary figure came in at $27.3 billion, an $8.7 billion jump from current spending. Here's a quick breakdown of items in the bill that don't rhyme with \"late May\" (doesn't that kind of weather sound great right about now?):\n\n-- The TIGER grant program would triple in size to $1.5 billion;\n\n-- Amtrak would receive $1.9 billion, with $650 million going toward capital projects along the Northeast Corridor;\n\n-- $250 million would be dedicated for the federal-state partnership for state of good repair grants (a FAST Act program);\n\n-- $250 million would be funneled to positive train control implementation grants; and\n\n-- More than $2.6 billion would be available for FTA's Capital Investment Grants program.\n\nThe bill also directs DOT to cover the credit risk premiums for Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loans, a change promoted in the Trump administration's infrastructure plan to help broaden the prospective pool of applicants. One provision that didn't make it into the bill? An increase to the passenger facility charge cap, a move Senate appropriators had embraced.\n\nTaking FAA-light: The package also includes a six-month FAA extension, giving Congress until the end of fiscal 2018 to work out a long-term solution.\n\nBUILD A TUNNEL AND GET THROUGH IT? We can workshop that idiom later, but both sides of the Gateway morass were claiming victory yesterday over the omnibus deal. What's crystal clear is that it contains money that could go to the project, but it's nowhere near the $30 billion total (not that we were expecting that ...) and -- here's the key -- much of it would likely still be subject to some level of approval by DOT. The bill text confirmed figures your MT host reported hours before the legislation finally dropped, along with the fact that it contains no explicit Gateway mentions.\n\nPo-tay-toe, po-tah-toe: A senior DOT official chalked that up as a win Wednesday, saying the department gets \"to maintain all of our flexibility in allocating funding.\" Meanwhile, a senior Democratic aide maintained that as much as $541 million would be available for Gateway in fiscal 2018 -- without any DOT approval. According to the aide, Amtrak estimates it could funnel at least $388 million \"directly to Gateway projects,\" while New York and New Jersey would be awarded $153 million in FTA formula funds that could be used for related expenses. But the DOT official cautioned that FRA still has an oversight role in how Amtrak spends its capital funds, since the railroad must submit its plans to the department for sign-off. \"You can imagine that, if FRA or FTA doesn't believe a project's ready in one program, why would it be ready in another?\" he said. Two projects under the Gateway umbrella were recently downgraded in the CIG pipeline.\n\nIT'S THURSDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO's Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

President Donald Trump had proposed eliminating a reimbursement program for airports that hire local law enforcement, but Congress tacked on an additional $45 million for it. And instead of following Trump's advice to reduce the number of VIPR teams, the bill includes $43 million that would allow TSA to maintain all 31 teams. The bill also would dedicate $64 million to expediting TSA's adoption of new 3D computed tomography scanners. Also included was a $2 billion boost for Customs and Border Protection above its current funding levels that, among other things, would enable the agency to fill Customs vacancies at ports of entry -- an issue that Trump hadn't mentioned.\n\nLet's cruise: Congress also responded to the Coast Guard's plea for additional funding for its shipbuilding efforts with a funding boost. The service would receive $12.1 billion overall under the bill, including $150 million for a heavy polar icebreaker that Coast Guard leadership has said is desperately needed. The service would get $2.7 billion overall for its fleet modernization efforts.

Scott called the structure \"an FIU project\" at a press conference after it fell, but, as POLITICO Florida's Matt Dixon reports: \"As recently as September 2016, though, more than 10 months after the selection of the firms to design and build the project, his transportation agency was reviewing all construction-related material.\"\n\nMeanwhile: NTSB investigators continued work at the scene Thursday and announced they'd confirmed that bridge workers \"were adjusting tension on the two tensioning rods located in the diagonal member at the north end of the span when the bridge collapsed.\" \"They had done this same work earlier at the south end, moved to the north side, and had adjusted one rod,\" the board said in a statement. \"They were working on the second rod when the span failed and collapsed.\" Watch for this detail to crop up again as the investigation continues.\n\nOPTIONS FOR EXTRA CREDIT? Amtrak gave two freight railroads \"F\" grades this week in its first-ever \"report card\" assessing host railroads' performance in preventing delays to passenger trains, your MT host writes. Norfolk Southern and Canadian National took home the failing grades, while CSX earned a \"C.\" Note that all three railroads are the subjects of Surface Transportation Board investigations into substandard on-time performance along some of Amtrak's long-distance and state-supported routes.\n\nIN MEMORIAM: Amtrak announced Wednesday that it's renaming the station in Rochester, N.Y., in honor of Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), who died last week. The station opened in October 2017 and was funded in part through a $15 million TIGER grant for which she'd advocated.\n\nMR. ROBOTO TRAIN: FRA is seeking comment on \"the future of automation in the railroad industry,\" per a request for information set to publish today in the Federal Register.

We applaud the Trump administration for reaching an historic agreement with Qatar to enforce our Open Skies agreement and stand up for American jobs. Now it's time for the UAE to play by the rules and bring an end to their subsidy-fueled expansion campaign.

John Culberson (R-Texas) appears to be a shoo-in for reelection. ... But Culberson's suburban Houston district went for Hillary Clinton by 1 percentage point in 2016. And when GOP leaders found out last year that he was being outraised by Democrats and barely had a campaign staff, they were exasperated. Get your act together, they warned Culberson in so many words, according to sources familiar with the dress down.\n\n\"Culberson's slow start to his reelection campaign is what GOP leaders fear most heading into the thick of the midterm elections: incumbents who haven't seen a real race in years snoozing as a Democratic wave builds. ... Rep. Glenn Grothman's team is another office that's received a talking-to. Ryan is personally helping campaign for the Wisconsin Republican, who hasn't had a competitive race since he was elected in 2014. His sprawling district partly abutting Lake Michigan has been a Republican stronghold since the 1960s. But Grothman now faces a wealthy Democratic challenger who's planning to spend hundreds of thousands of his own money on the race.\" Full story.\n\nPROFILE -- \"The Former College Dropout Who Would Be Dianne Feinstein,\" by POLITICO's David Siders in Santa Ana, Calif.: \"Fourteen people and three rescue cats were awaiting Kevin de León when he pulled up to a PetSmart and stepped inside through drizzling rain. In his briefing folder, an aide had included a note titled, 'Cat puns you can use, if you're feeling festive!' De León hit nearly all of them. ... It had been two weeks since de León impressed a crowd on a more brightly lit stage. In a coup at the California Democratic Party's annual convention last month, de León -- until Wednesday the Democratic leader of California's state Senate -- deprived Dianne Feinstein of her own party's endorsement by outpolling the state's senior senator by 17 percentage points in the delegate vote. ...\n\n\"For de León and his supporters, the convention marked a turning point not only in his quixotic campaign to unseat Feinstein, but also in a generational struggle among Democrats in the nation's most populous state.\" Full story.\n\n-- \"Poll: Feinstein, Newsom lead California primaries,\" by POLITICO's Steven Shepard: \"A new Public Policy Institute of California poll shows Sen. Dianne Feinstein maintaining a wide lead over state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, a fellow Democrat, in the all-party Senate primary. Feinstein leads de León 42 percent to 16 percent. Nearly four in 10 likely voters, 39 percent, are undecided. .. In the governor's race, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has pulled in front of the all-party primary field, the poll shows, with 28 percent. The poll also shows the GOP has a shot at a second-place finish and berth in the general election, with three candidates in a virtual tie for second in the survey, two of them Republicans.\" Full story.\n\nSHE'S IN -- Bryant officially taps Hyde-Smith for Cochran seat: \"Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant has officially tapped state Agriculture Commissioner Cindy Hyde-Smith to replace Republican Sen. Thad Cochran when he steps down next month. Hyde-Smith said this afternoon in a statement that she will accept Bryant's appointment -- and also seek to complete the final two years of Cochran's term by running in this fall's special election. ... The special, nonpartisan election will be held Nov. 6; insurgent conservative state Sen. Chris McDaniel is already in the race.

Casten will take on Rep. Peter Roskam in November.\n\n-- \"Lipinski win stings liberals,\" by POLITICO's Heather Caygle and Elena Schneider: \"House Democrats are trying to hit the reset button a day after Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski eked out a win in a nasty primary battle that had several of his own colleagues publicly rooting for his defeat. ...

The group has reserved more than $200,000 of broadcast and satellite starting on Friday. It's unclear if the ads are attacking Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, boosting a candidate in the competitive GOP primary in the state, or both. The group recently started airing ads backing Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia.\n\nWEB WARS -- FIRST IN SCORE -- Rokita campaign launches microsite targeting Messer: Rep. Todd Rokita's campaign is out with a new microsite targeting his Senate GOP primary rival, Rep. Luke Messer. The site, MissingMesser.com, attacks Messer over his home in Virginia and vacation home in Tennessee, and compares his issues to those that plagued former Sens. Dick Lugar and Evan Bayh.

Trump won the district by 7 points in 2016, but 68 percent of those surveyed gave him a negative job approval rating.

The Los Angeles mayor and expected 2020 candidate is making a two-day swing through Iowa from April 13-14, with stops in Des Moines, Altoona, Davenport and Waterloo, hitting a union event, a political fundraiser and local tours along the way. The trip will make Garcetti the first prospective presidential candidate to visit all four of the first nominating states this cycle: he campaigned for Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in New Hampshire in August, attended the Democratic National Committee's meeting in Las Vegas in October and traveled to Columbia, S.C., to promote his 'Accelerator for America' nonprofit last month.\" Full story.\n\nOPEN SECRETS -- \"The 'Worst Bosses' in Congress?\" by POLITICO's Nolan D. McCaskill: \"LegiStorm -- the online portal that tracks Capitol Hill's workforce in detail -- is putting hard data to the debate over the worst bosses in Congress. ... The office of Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee topped the list in the House, with an annual turnover rate of 62 percent, according to LegiStorm. Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) came in behind her with 60 percent annual turnover, followed by Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) with 54 percent. In the Senate, Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar led the pack with an annual turnover rate of 36 percent, followed by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) with 30 percent and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) with 28 percent. LegiStorm declines to guess whether the high turnover stems from a toxic work environment or employees simply advancing in their careers.\" Full story.\n\nCODA -- QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"All of my options are on the table.

                "body": "WHAT'S IN THE OMNIBUS -- The $1.3 trillion spending bill was posted last night, with Congress now rushing to pass it by Friday midnight. If they don't, prepare for a possible third government shutdown of the year.\n\n-- $10 billion more for HHS. The agency overall would receive $88.1 billion in fiscal 2018, according to Senate appropriators, representing a $10.1 billion increase compared with fiscal 2017 levels.\n\n-- More funding for research too. NIH would receive a nearly 9 percent bump to $37.1 billion -- including $100 million toward developing a universal flu vaccine. More for Pros.\n\nCDC would receive $8.3 billion under the legislation, a $1.1 billion boost and a sharp departure from the nearly $900 million in cuts that the White House proposed last month. More for Pros.\n\nDrilling down:\n\n-- $4 billion to fight opioid crisis. The funding -- for prevention, treatment and law enforcement -- is spread across agencies including HHS, Homeland Security, Justice and Veterans Affairs. It represents a $3 billion increase over what lawmakers committed last year to addressing the addiction epidemic. More for Pros.\n\n-- Bioterrorism, public health response efforts see major funding boosts. Efforts to stockpile drugs, vaccines and other efforts to shield the nation from possible bioterrorism or another public health emergency are all set to receive boosts in funding under the bill, H.R. 1625 (115), to fund the government through September. More for Pros.\n\n-- More payment for a handful of new drugs. Less than two dozen products are estimated to benefit from the change in the omnibus that allows for five years of pass-through status actually limited to two years because the bill specifies that it only applies to drugs that lost pass-through status on Dec. 31, 2017 and for which payment was bundled into a group of services under Medicare policies beginning Jan. 1. More for Pros.\n\n-- $335 million for CDC's workplace safety office. Congress rejected the Trump administration's proposed 41 percent cut to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and also rebuffed the White House's attempt to move NIOSH out of the CDC. More for Pros.\n\n-- More money for abstinence education. Lawmakers agreed to boost funding for abstinence education by two-thirds, to $25 million.\n\n-- More info on ACA workers. The budget requires the Trump administration to publish information on the number of employees and contractors involved in \"implementing, administering, enforcing, or otherwise carrying out\" the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMEANWHILE: WHAT WASN'T IN THE OMNIBUS\n\n-- Congress nixed a series of anti-abortion riders, including a bill expanding conscience protections.\n\n-- Congress rejected the White House's plan to gut drug policy office. The Trump administration had proposed a 95 percent cut to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. It was the second straight year that lawmakers have rebuffed the attempt to gut the office, which sets drug-fighting strategy across the government and is popular on the Hill.\n\n-- Congress reiterated: No money for Obamacare's risk corridors. Once again, lawmakers prohibited money from being spent to make risk corridor payments to insurers. The program, which expired after 2016, was supposed to cushion the financial blow for insurers that attracted disproportionately expensive customers. Because Republicans required the program to be budget neutral, however, payments came up $12 billion short. Dozens of insurers have filed lawsuits to recover the funds.\n\n** A message from PhRMA: There is currently no requirement that hospitals pass 340B program savings along to patients, and economists suggest 340B may actually contribute to higher out-of-pocket costs for patients. Let's fix the 340B program. http://politi.co/2IqKpF3 **\n\nWHAT'S NEXT AFTER HOUSE PASSES RIGHT-TO-TRY -- The chamber in a party-line vote approved a bill designed to let very sick patients request access to experimental medicines without government oversight.\n\n-- It's a victory for the Goldwater Institute and the White House. The small libertarian think tank crafted the proposal and the administration vigorously campaigned for the law. Meanwhile, it's a blow for the many policy wonks who opposed the idea, saying it would weaken patient protections. Many pharma companies also opposed the bill, whose benefits are not as straightforward as they may seem.\n\n-- Up next: the Senate, which passed Sen. Ron Johnson's slightly different version of the legislation last summer under unanimous consent. The Wisconsin Republican said he plans to push for immediate passage of the House bill in the Senate, despite some disappointment that his version wasn't adopted.\n\n-- What policy wonks are saying: They're critiquing the broader anti-regulatory health agenda pushed by the Goldwater Institute.\n\n\"I think this is the first step, for sure. Tear down as many regulations as possible, take away all oversight, and let it be the Wild West of medicine,\" said Andrew McFadyen of the rare disease patient group Isaac Foundation. Keep reading: More.\n\nMEDICARE HONCHO: \"DON'T WORRY\" ABOUT PAYMENT REFORM EFFORTS -- CMS' No. 2, Demetrios Kouzoukas, tried to assure lawmakers that the Trump administration wasn't taking its foot off the gas in the move to value-based care, telling one member of Congress when pressed: \"don't worry about that.\" Multiple Democrats expressed concern during a Ways and Means Committee hearing Wednesday that CMS was abandoning the bipartisan goal of changing the way health care is paid for.\n\n\"Our goal is to make sure the health care system ... is the one that's right for each patient,\" Kouzoukas told Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), who asked about an Obama-era goal of having half of Medicare payments going to something other than fee-for-service by the end of this year. The Trump administration has backed off the goal, but Kouzoukas didn't acknowledge any sort of target on Wednesday.\n\nACOs HAVE BEEN \"DISAPPOINTING\" FOR NURSING HOMES -- Accountable care organizations have largely given the cold shoulder to nursing homes, despite their potential to reduce hospitalizations with a small amount of investment, David Gifford, senior vice present for quality and regulatory affairs at the American Health Care Association, said during a POLITICO Live event Wednesday. \"They've not partnered with the post-acute side,\" Gifford said. \"A handful have, and when they have, it's been really successful.\" Overall, hospitals and doctor practices view nursing homes as a cost, not a chance to save on money.\n\nThe nursing home community is in a \"watchful waiting\" mode to see where new HHS leadership will take the CMS Innovation Center, Tricia Neuman, head of Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said during the event. While acknowledging there are \"nuggets [of ACOs] that are very promising,\" she said it's still too early to judge overall success.\n\nView the full event here.\n\nIT'S OFFICIAL: ROBERT REDFIELD TO RUN CDC -- The University of Maryland AIDS researcher was formally tapped by the Trump administration on Wednesday, five days after POLITICO scooped that he was favored to run the agency.\n\nAnd that's not sitting well with some researchers, who issued a last-minute flurry of warnings despite Redfield's longtime prominence. \"This appointment would be disastrous,\" warned Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, citing Redfield's lack of public health leadership experience and \"history of scientific misconduct.\" More. (While the Army acknowledged there were accuracy issues with Redfield's work on an HIV vaccine, they didn't find misconduct.)\n\n-- But a slew of policy wonks and politicians, including Democrats, offered a character defense. \"He is somebody who cares deeply about serving those who are sick and in need,\" said Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Maryland's former lieutenant governor who served on the board of the Institute of Human Virology with Redfield. \"He's very devoted to Catholicism, and I think that sense of social justice permeates his every fiber,\" Kennedy Townsend added, describing Redfield's work to combat AIDS in Africa.\n\nKeep reading: More.\n\n-- What HHS leadership is thinking: They were prepared for the criticism of Redfield, chalking some of it up to long-held disputes among researchers, according to an individual with knowledge of HHS leadership strategy.\n\nBut the administration is hoping that, like Scott Gottlieb -- who faced ample criticism over his industry conflicts before taking the helm of FDA, where he's won bipartisan kudos -- Redfield can win over critics by finding areas of consensus.\n\nCalifornia: Lawmaker pushes bill to address \"patient brokering\" -- State Sen. Ricardo Lara today plans to introduce a bill, CA SB1228 (17R), that would require licensed recovery programs to refer patients to certified facilities. The goal: To crack down on low quality unlicensed sober-living homes, which have been known to pay addicts -- \"junkie hunters\" or \"interventionists\" -- to recruit new patients in a unsavory practice known as patient brokering.\n\n\"California needs to raise the bar for patient care and protect people in recovery from patient brokering, where quality care takes a backseat to profits and insurance fraud,\" said Lara, whose bill also requires certified recovery centers to have naloxone, the opioid overdose antidote marketed to consumers as Narcan nasal spray, available on site. California lawmakers have already introduced more than a dozen other bills this session to address the opioid crisis.\n\nMarch of Dimes launches new Center for Social Science Research today. The collaborative between the patient advocacy group and EMD Serono, a division of Darmstadt, Germany-based Merck KGaA, aims to produce research that helps improve the health of mothers and children.

The incoming HHS communications head will officially leave her current role at the American Enterprise Institute on Friday, she wrote in an email, calling her departure \"bittersweet.\"\n\nStecker will start transitioning into her duties as HHS assistant secretary for public affairs next week, according to people familiar with the plan, and take over full time on April 2. Michael Pratt, AEI's director of digital strategy, will take over as the think tank's director of media relations and marketing, Stecker wrote.\n\n** A message from PhRMA: Created a quarter of a century ago, the 340B program is greatly in need of a number of fixes to ensure it is targeted toward true safety-net entities and vulnerable or uninsured patients as intended when the program was developed. Independent economists, GAO and OIG have all raised concerns with the program and Congress has now echoed those concerns. Too many hospitals are profiting off a program meant to support needy patients.

Send theories, news and tips my way: srodriguez@politico.com or @sabrod123.\n\nPOLITICO Space is our new, free weekly briefing on the policies and personalities shaping the second space age in Washington and beyond. Sign up today to start receiving the newsletter right at launch on April 6. Presented by Boeing.\n\n** A message from Farmers for Free Trade: America's farmers depend on free trade to export more than $100 billion of products annually. With farm incomes declining, exports help keep farms and rural communities afloat. But some in Washington support restrictive trade policies that would be devastating. President Trump and Congress should protect free trade.

The airing of Republicans' grievances will likely continue today when Lighthizer returns to Capitol Hill for a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n\"Look, we've got wheat sitting on the ground in Kansas,\" Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), a member of the Finance Committee, told reporters Wednesday. \"It's that rough. We really have a challenge here. We've got an uphill battle.\"\n\nMexico is usually a big buyer for U.S. wheat and corn. But with Trump threatening to withdraw from NAFTA, Mexico has turned to other suppliers like Argentina and Brazil, Roberts said. In addition, after more than a year in office, Trump has failed to deliver on promises to negotiate new bilateral agreements to open markets to U.S. exports, he said.\n\n\"We haven't seen any trade bill yet,\" Roberts said. \"There's a lot of frustration out there -- when are we going to see a major or even a minor arrangement for any product -- we just haven't seen it. It's been what? 14 months. Some of the frustration is just obvious. ... We are in danger of losing our reputation as a reliable supplier. Once you lose that and they start making agreements with other folks, you're in a world of trouble.\"\n\nTo read Doug Palmer's recap of the House Ways and Means hearing, click here.\n\nGSP MAKES IT INTO OMNIBUS, BUT NOT MTB: The massive omnibus spending bill (H.R. 1625) released late Wednesday contains a three-year renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences program that waives duties on thousands of goods from developing countries to promote economic development and jobs.\n\nBut a renewal of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, which waived duties on raw materials and intermediate goods used by U.S. manufacturers, didn't make the cut. That means the Senate would have to pass it separately to get it to Trump's desk, since it has already cleared the House. The last MTB expired in 2012, and efforts to renew the measure got tangled up in the House Republican ban on earmarks. That prompted a change in how Congress decided which tariff codes would be included in the legislation.\n\nThe GSP program expired at the end of December, costing importers $77 million in taxes in the month of January alone, according to the Coalition for GSP. However, any duties collected since Jan. 1 will now be reimbursed.\n\nThe omnibus also contains GSP reform championed by Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.). GSP rules restrict imports of a particular product to certain dollar and percentage amounts called \"competitive need limitations.\" USTR may grant a CNL waiver under certain conditions, such as U.S. national security interests, no domestic production, or low total imports. Previously, a waiver on the grounds of no domestic production could only be granted if there was no production on Jan. 1, 1995. The reform now allows a waiver to be granted if there was no production during the previous three years.\n\nEU OPTIMISTIC ON TARIFFS EXEMPTION AFTER ROSS, MALMSTRÖM TALKS: Recent talks between Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström went unexpectedly well, leaving EU officials optimistic that the trading bloc could be exempted from Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum. Two European Commission officials told POLITICO Europe that an exemption for the European Union was now within reach, and a third official said there was reason to be hopeful.\n\nRoss and Malmström agree to try for a speedy resolution: \"We have agreed to launch immediately a process of discussion with President Trump and the Trump administration on trade issues of common concern, including steel and aluminum, with a view to identifying mutually acceptable outcomes as rapidly as possible,\" the two trade leaders said in a joint statement Wednesday.\n\nTiming on exemptions: Lighthizer told the Ways and Means panel that the process for excluding countries from the tariffs should wrap up by the end of April. He added he's in discussions to potentially exempt the EU, Australia and Argentina, and expects to start talks with Brazil. However, he said Trump will have the final say over whether the trading bloc will be spared from the duties, which take effect on Friday.\n\nLIGHTHIZER HOPES FOR KORUS DEAL SOON: The United States and South Korea are close to a deal on revamping the six-year-old KORUS free trade agreement, Lighthizer said during his House hearing. South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong \"is in town right now. I think we're down to the last few issues and I'm hopeful that we'll be able to come to some agreement that will make the committee happy,\" he said.\n\nLighthizer defended the administration's decision to amend the pact through a mechanism provided in the KORUS agreement, rather than use trade promotion authority procedures that would give Congress a greater role in the process. He also noted that current talks with South Korea involve the country's desire to get an exemption from new steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\n\"In the opinion of many people, Korea is a particular problem in area of steel, primarily. But we're trying to work our way through all of those things. I'm hopeful that we can make headway on it,\" Lighthizer said.\n\nLIGHTHIZER DEFENDS NAFTA FOOD LABELING PROPOSAL: Lighthizer defended a U.S. NAFTA proposal that would limit the types of warnings that could appear on food labels in Canada and Mexico, but he said it was about fighting protectionism rather than advocating junk food.\n\nThe Trump administration supports \"the idea of putting limits on the ability of countries to put warning labels or symbols on product,\" Lighthizer said at the House hearing. \"There are lots of examples of countries that are using this loophole to basically create a protectionist environment\" against American food exports.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett asked about the issue, which was the subject of a recent New York Times story. The Texas Democrat said he was worried the Trump administration was advancing proposals that would make it harder to fight obesity.\n\n\"I'd like to put my office on the record as being against obesity,\" Lighthizer said.\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" Doggett fired back. \"The question is whether you're against things that prevent us from addressing that problem.\"\n\nLighthizer replied that USTR saw the issue in the more \"nuanced\" manner described above.\n\nWTO HANDS CHINA PARTIAL VICTORY AGAINST THE U.S.: Amid all the trade news in Washington, the World Trade Organization ruled Wednesday that the United States did not fully comply with a 2014 ruling against countervailing duties on a range of Chinese products, Reuters reported from Geneva.\n\nThe case dates back to 2012 and involves duties that the United States imposed on Chinese solar panels, wind towers, steel cylinders and aluminum extrusions. \"The WTO panel agreed that the United States had not correctly used third country prices to assess the subsidies, but supported the U.S. assertion that exporters were getting subsidies from Chinese 'public bodies,' despite Beijing's assertions to the contrary,\" Reuters reported.\n\n\"The WTO's panel findings represent a step forward and a step backward on appropriately addressing non-market behavior from China that harms America's workers,\" USTR spokeswoman Amelia Breinig told Morning Trade. \"The United States is pleased that the WTO panel accurately concluded that China's state-owned enterprises are 'public bodies' under the WTO Subsidies Agreement, providing a massive number of subsidies. Unfortunately, the panel used a flawed Appellate Body approach from a previous dispute to fault the Department of Commerce's effort to measure subsidies when potential 'benchmark' prices are distorted by Chinese government intervention.\"\n\nIf China's complaint survives a potential appeal, it would move a step closer to retaliatory sanctions on U.S. trade, although the two sides would first have to settle on the value of sanctions, which would involve a round of legal argument, according to Reuters. Breinig did not say whether USTR would appeal the decision.\n\nLIGHTHIZER: NAFTA AUTO RULES-OF-ORIGIN TALKS STARTING TO 'CONVERGE': The U.S., Mexico and Canada are moving closer to striking a deal on auto rules-of-origin, one of the thorniest issues in the ongoing NAFTA renegotiation, Lighthizer said Wednesday. While Lighthizer kept mum on the details of a possible compromise, he added that \"I think we're in a good place.\"\n\n\"We're in a position that we're finally starting to converge,\" Lighthizer told lawmakers at the Ways and Means hearing. \"We're working very closely with the U.S. industry. I had people on Monday, and I think even until yesterday in Detroit, trying to work out the details of this kind of agreement.\"\n\nMexico waits on U.S. ROO proposal: Mexico will hold off on presenting its automotive rules-of-origin proposal until the U.S. presents its updated plan. Mexican officials are currently crafting a proposal that would take from both the U.S.'s and Canada's proposals, but remains lower than the U.S.'s ask that 85 percent of the parts of a car be made in the three NAFTA countries.\n\n\"What's the necessity for me to put forth a Mexican proposal if the U.S. government and its industry still haven't come to an agreement? It would be poor strategically if I put forth a proposal before waiting for there to be one [from the U.S.],\" Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told reporters on Tuesday, according to Mexican newspaper Reforma.\n\nDOUD VOWS TO KEEP CHALLENGING CHINA'S AG PRACTICES AT WTO: The Trump administration will continue to take on China by both challenging Beijing's agricultural market practices and pushing for new agricultural standards at the WTO, U.S. chief agricultural negotiator Gregg Doud said Wednesday. Doud emphasized that the U.S. will continue to pursue two ongoing Obama-era cases filed against China -- one over its farm subsidies and one on tariff rate quotas for rice, wheat and corn.\n\n\"We are calling for a reset of the agricultural negotiations [at the WTO], beginning with improved transparency and a more realistic understanding of who should and should not continue to claim things like developing country status,\" Doud said at the Agri-Pulse Ag and Food Policy Summit.\n\nFormer U.S. agricultural negotiator weighs in: Darci Vetter, a USTR chief agricultural negotiator in the Obama administration, said the U.S. shouldn't be \"going it alone and defining it as an us vs. them issue\" when it comes to China.\n\nThe U.S. should use the WTO when possible, and use \"the pressure of our allies to say this kind of behavior has to change and we're prepared to act together,\" she added.\n\nCIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS PUSH FOR A WORKER-FRIENDLY NAFTA: More than 1,000 civil society groups demanded that lawmakers push for an end to the investor-state dispute settlement process and advocate for strong labor and environmental standards in a new NAFTA. In a Wednesday letter to Congress, Citizens Trade Campaign, a coalition of labor, environmental and other civil society organizations, argued that a fair NAFTA would end rules that threaten food safety and labeling, add strong disciplines against currency manipulation and make medicine more affordable. The NAFTA renegotiation should also make room for more input from the public and lawmakers, the groups said.\n\n\"In the absence of a binding and easily enforced agreement based on these critical measures, Mexican workers will continue to be horribly exploited, American jobs will continue to be outsourced, the environment will continue to be degraded and the wages for workers in all three NAFTA countries will continue to decline,\" the letter said.\n\nSENATORS PUSH FOR NEW 'COMPETITIVENESS' CHAPTER IN NAFTA 2.0: Sens. Ted Cruz, Cory Gardner and Steve Daines urged Trump on Tuesday to further advance the Republican economic policy agenda by including a \"competitiveness\" chapter in the NAFTA renegotiation. The Republican senators said that a modernized NAFTA should incorporate \"both new rules that will enhance U.S. competitiveness abroad and structural reforms to ensure sustainable competitiveness at home.\"\n\n\"Rather than focusing on making it more difficult for companies to invest in other countries, we should instead make it easier for them to grow and invest here in the United States,\" the letter explains.\n\nThe chapter would create a coordinated permit system that speeds up infrastructure projects; codify regulatory reform measures to eliminate red tape; promote more participation in job training programs; and develop physical and digital infrastructure that expedites cargo movement, the senators said.\n\nMexico previously expressed interest in including a standalone chapter on competitiveness but did not give details. The senators added that their proposal would help ensure that a renegotiated NAFTA gets approved by Congress before November without a filibuster.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n-- Lobbyists want to use a new NAFTA to make it easier for U.S. companies to build factories, move cargo and export coal, Bloomberg reports.\n\n-- The Federal Reserve raised rates for the first time this year, signaling it will act more aggressively to head off inflation, POLITICO reports.\n\n-- Brazil claimed that the U.S. will suspend tariffs on the South American nation, but USTR declined to confirm that, Reuters reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

Our farmers and ranchers exported more than $129 billion worth of products in 2016, accounting for 20% of all farm revenue in the U.S. Agricultural exports also support more than one million American jobs - most of them in the nonfarm sector. These jobs provide stability for rural families and communities. Free trade is essential to maintaining the strength of our agriculture economy. But some in Washington now support policies that would restrict trade. That would be devastating to family farms across the country, and would cause higher prices for consumers. President Trump and Congress should protect free trade to keep our agriculture economy strong. Learn more here. **",

                "body": "With help from Eric Wolff, Anthony Adragna and Alex Guillén\n\nIT'S HERE! After days of waiting, Congress finally released the text Wednesday night of its $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2018. Now the clock starts ticking toward passage of the legislation H.R. 1625 (115), which must happen before current funding runs out Friday to avert a government shutdown. The good news: The House Rules Committee has already waived the usual three-day waiting period required before legislation can receive a vote on the floor. Read more.\n\nTHE (SPENDING) LEVEL PLAYING FIELD: The 2,232-page document is no light reading. Instead, here's the break down: the Energy-Water appropriations came in at $43.2 billion, up from $37.8 billion in fiscal 2017, while Interior-Environment rose to $35.25 billion from $32.28 billion in FY 2017. Of course, there's far more to it than that, and POLITICO's Energy team is here to guide you through what you need to know:\n\nEPA grants rise: The agency's operational budget would remain pretty much the same, but grant programs get a boost, Alex Guillén and Annie Snider report. That means the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving funds are slated to get an extra $300 million each, for a total of $2.9 billion in funding. Another $50 million is set aside for new programs created in last year's water resources bill to focus on basic infrastructure and reducing lead in school drinking water.\n\nLooking up for DOE: The Energy Department is one of the big winners: It would get $34.5 billion -- a $3.77 billion increase over fiscal 2017, Pro's Anthony Adragna reports. DOE's energy programs receive $12.9 billion, up $1.6 billion from the fiscal 2017 levels and $5.4 billion more than the Trump administration requested. Science research programs would receive $6.26 billion, $868 million above the fiscal 2017. Also of note: The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which President Donald Trump wanted to eliminate, stays alive and gets $353.3 million.\n\nInterior falls flat: Interior's budget remains near $13.1 billion, pushing aside Trump's request to cut it to $11.6 billion, Pro's Ben Lefebvre reports. The key takeaway for ME: Funding for agencies overseeing offshore oil and gas development and rig safety were boosted. For one, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management would see $171 million, up from $112 million, while the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement would receive $186 million, up from $98 million approved last year.\n\nWater infrastructure gets boost: The Army Corps of Engineers is set to receive a nearly $800 million boost to its budget, Annie reports, bringing it to $6.83 billion. Most of the agency's budget lines would see increases, including an additional $200 million for its construction account, and nearly $500 million more for operation and maintenance of its aging portfolio of locks, dams, levees and ports.\n\nWHAT'S MISSING? A few policy riders ME has been watching didn't make the cut. Namely, Senate Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran's controversial provision for a Mississippi flood control project. Another rider that would have delayed implementation of EPA's revised ozone standard for 10 years was axed, Anthony reports. The same with a rider that would have insulated repeal of the Waters of the U.S. rule from legal challenges.\n\n-- \"While I am disappointed that the Interior and Environment bill continues to be the target for poison pill riders, I am relieved that, once again, we were able to protect our bedrock environment and conservation laws,\" Sen. Tom Udall said in a statement. The agreement creates an emergency pot of money for the U.S. Forest Service -- which conservation groups are cheering -- to use when it exceeds its fire-suppression budget, Pro's Sarah Ferris and Kaitlyn Burton report.\n\nPHEW! HAPPY THURSDAY! I'm your host Kelsey Tamborrino, and NRECA's Dan Riedinger is today's trivia winner. Congress passed all its required appropriations measures on time on only four occasions: in fiscal 1977 (the first full fiscal year under the current process), 1989, 1995 and 1997. And, a correction to Wednesday's trivia answer: While Tonie Nathan was the first Jewish politician to win an electoral vote in a presidential election, some of you pointed out Barry Goldwater was the first ethnically Jewish person to receive a vote.

Presented by Boeing.\n\nPRUITT'S SECURITY FLEW FIRST-CLASS TOO: EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's security detail also flew first-class as the agency chief racked up more than $105,000 in first-class flights during his first year, according to a little-noticed disclosure in letters to House Oversight and Energy and Commerce Committees. Citing \"specific, ongoing threats\" to both Pruitt and his family as justifying the enhanced security procedures, the disclosure means the total tab for the trips is substantially higher.\n\nQuestions coming: Three senior Energy and Commerce Democrats said in a statement that Pruitt would face questions about his spending habits during an April 26 hearing. \"What is clear is that while he makes extreme cuts to critical public health and environmental protection programs, the Administrator has taken a holiday from all fiscal responsibility when it comes to his own travel and personal convenience,\" Reps. Diana DeGette, Paul Tonko and Frank Pallone said in a statement. In response, EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said: \"These security decisions are made by EPA's protective service detail and are similar to security protocols within the federal government.\"\n\nNOT JUST A DISTANT MEMORY: Following continued reports of Pruitt's first-class travels, ABC News obtained a photo of Pruitt deplaning a military-owned plane in June last year at New York's JFK Airport.

Senate EPW Chairman John Barrasso tells AP it'll be an opportunity to showcase the state's \"world-class coal operations and cutting-edge energy research.\"\n\nPERRY TALKS ATOMIC ENERGY: Energy Secretary Rick Perry will return to testify in Congress today. This time he'll appear before a Senate Armed Services panel reviewing the fiscal 2019 defense authorization request. Perry will be called upon to discuss challenges in DOE's atomic energy defense programs. Perfect timing, as the White House is looking to open up talks with Saudi Arabia over a potential atomic energy deal, and has called on Perry to play a role. Separately, the House Armed Services Committee will host Energy's Lisa Gordon-Hagerty and James Owendoff on the fiscal 2019 budget request for nuclear forces and atomic energy defense. If you go: The SASC hearing begins at 10 a.m. in 216 Hart, the HASC hearing at 9 a.m. in 2118 Rayburn.\n\nMARKEY GOES NUCLEAR: Democratic Sen. Ed Markey is interested in finding out what's going on with the nuclear talks between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. In a letter Wednesday to Perry, Markey requested the secretary immediately brief Congress on his trip to London, where the secretary led a delegation on a nuclear cooperation agreement, or 123 agreement, with the Saudis. Markey also questioned NRC Chairwoman Kristine Svinicki about the meeting Wednesday during a Senate hearing, where she confirmed that at least one NRC lawyer attended the February London meeting. Read it here.\n\nNRC YOU SOON? Senior Republicans are upping their public pressure on one of their own, Sen. Dean Heller, to release his hold on Republican Nuclear Regulatory Commission nominee Annie Caputo ahead of a June deadline when the federal regulator would lose a quorum. Sen. Jim Inhofe told ME a quorum-less NRC would empower Svinicki to take unilateral steps toward the construction of Yucca Mountain, which Heller staunchly opposes. \"What [opponents] don't want to happen is for June to get here and not have a quorum,\" Inhofe said. Not everyone, though, thinks that allowing the quorum to lapse would empower Svinicki. Barrasso said at a Wednesday hearing that while he continues to \"work to resolve this situation,\" a quorum-less NRC would likely allow groups to \"challenge the NRC's authority and ability to act.\" Heller's office didn't respond to request for comment.\n\nCOURT HEARS GREEN CHALLENGE TO EPA 'EXCEPTIONAL EVENTS' RULE: Environmental groups and EPA will duke it out in court today over whether a 2016 regulation makes it too easy for areas with high air pollution levels to get away with excess emissions from human-connected activity. The \"exceptional events\" rule defines certain causes of pollution that won't count against an area's air quality monitoring. The NRDC and Sierra Club argue the Clean Air Act limits exceptional events almost entirely to non-human-related causes like volcanic activity or forest fires. But the language of EPA's rule, they argue, means that exceedances that are partly natural and partly human-caused are wrongly counted as purely natural events. EPA argues that a \"purity\" test in which events must be \"totally untouched by any human activity\" would have left the law without any \"practical meaning.\" The arguments start at 9:30 a.m. at the Prettyman Courthouse. The panel includes Judges Thomas Griffith, Gregory Katsas and Harry T. Edwards.\n\nMORE NOMS: The Senate Energy Committee holds a markup to consider DOE nominees Theodore Garrish to be an assistant secretary for international affairs and James Edward Campos to be director of the Office of Minority Economic Impact. The committee will also consider the nomination of James Reilly to be director of the U.S. Geological Survey. Following the vote, the committee will hold a hearing on various bills, including S. 2539 (115), to amend the \"Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015,\" to re-authorize certain projects in the Colorado River System. If you go: The hearing starts at 10 a.m. in 366 Dirksen.\n\nRIVERKEEPER: CAN FERC REGULATE THE COMPANIES THAT FUND IT? Delaware Riverkeeper and its compadres will argue today before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that FERC is hopelessly biased in favor of pipeline approvals since it's partially funded through a formula based on how much natural gas is transported through pipelines. The nonprofit alleges that the due process clause in the Fifth Amendment requires that agencies be neutral, and that FERC can't be neutral because it is funded by the companies it regulates.\n\nMAIL CALL! GROUPS WANT METHANE RULE HEARING: Thirty-seven environmental and conservation groups wrote to Secretary Ryan Zinke requesting the Bureau of Land Management hold a public hearing on potential revisions to the methane and waste prevention rule. The letter also asks BLM to extend the public comment period by 60 days. Read it here.\n\nOIL AND GAS LOBBYIST TAKES ON NAFTA: While the three countries involved are working to come to a deal on NAFTA, lobbyists are eyeing a potential rewrite as the perfect vehicle to get a host of broad legislation advanced -- namely, making it easier to export coal. Using the fast-track authority of the president, a trade bill could sail through Congress with a simple majority, Bloomberg reports.\n\nLeading the effort, is a husband-and-wife duo with some oil and gas backing. Rebecca Rosen of Devon Energy Corp. and her husband Jeff Weiss, who spent 10 years in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and is now with Venable LLP, \"have spent months quietly developing the strategy, honing the approach as they slowly widened the circle of advocates, drawing support from business lobbies, lining up a few influential Senate supporters and getting buy-in from key White House officials.\" Read more.\n\nSPEAKING OF NAFTA: Republicans want USTR Robert Lighthizer to keep his hands off investment dispute-settlement provisions within the trade pact. More than 100 GOP members of Congress wrote to Lighthizer Wednesday, warning him not to drop the longstanding provisions, if he expects their support for a revamped agreement. Read more from Pro's Doug Palmer.\n\nGETTING EXPENSIVE IN HERE: Last year was the \"most expensive year on record\" for extreme weather and climate events, the World Meteorological Organization said Wednesday, noting the raft of hurricanes, major monsoon floods and severe droughts. The findings are part of the U.N. weather agency's annual statement on the state of the global climate, POLITICO Europe's Kalina Oroschakoff reports.\n\nBREAKING IT DOWN: U.S. natural gas exports surged in 2017, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

President Donald Trump \"appears grudgingly willing to support the measure, which is likely the last major piece of legislation he will sign before the midterm elections,\" POLITICO reports. To avoid a shutdown, Congress will need to pass the bill (or a short-term funding extension) by midnight Friday.\n\nBig boost for DHS: The Homeland Security Department would receive a roughly 13 percent funding increase in fiscal year 2018 compared with the previous year's enacted levels, according to a summary from the Senate Appropriations Committee. CBP would see a 15 percent funding spike under the spending agreement. ICE would get a 10 percent boost.\n\nBorder barriers, but not a wall: The spending bill devotes $1.6 billion to physical barriers and technology along the Southwest border. The funds cover 95 miles of \"border wall system\" -- 47 miles of new barriers plus 48 of replacement barriers, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee summary. Despite negotiations in recent months, the bill doesn't deal at all with \"Dreamers\" brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nSteady going for DOL, NLRB: Trump proposed slashing Labor Department funding by 20 percent in his fiscal year 2018 budget plan, but congressional negotiators didn't cooperate in the omnibus. The bill set funding at $12 billion, a 1 percent increase. NLRB funding will remain at the previous year's level, skirting a 6 percent cut proposed by the White House.\n\nTip pooling provision: The bill includes a compromise aimed at preventing employers from stealing tips under a proposed DOL rule that would allow the redistribution of tip money to back-of-house workers. The language -- brokered by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta -- would give workers the right to sue employers for stolen wages, with damages. In addition, the Labor secretary would have the power to sue companies for stolen tips and impose civil penalties.\n\nBut House Democrats, including House Education and the Workforce Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D-Va.) have come out against the compromise. They say it would allow employers to simply reduce base pay and replace it with tips, effectively keeping the money for themselves. Scott said in a written statement that he's \"unwilling to trade away the basic principle that workers are entitled to control the tips they earn.\"\n\nH-2B visa expansion: The omnibus includes language that would allow DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to approximately double the number of H-2B guest worker visas available in fiscal year 2018. The visa program offers 66,000 visas annually to businesses that seek foreign workers in seasonal, non-agricultural roles. When Congress passed the last omnibus spending bill in May, it included the same rider. Then-DHS Secretary John Kelly (in consultation with the DOL) eventually agreed in July to add 15,000 additional visas -- what he called a \"one-time increase.\"\n\nHardball on wages: Part of the spending bill targets the salaries of minor league baseball players, as Bloomberg Law's Chris Opfer highlighted in a tweet. \"Tucked inside the omnibus spending bill (page 1,967) is a provision that allows pro baseball teams to stop paying minor league players minimum wages and overtime,\" he wrote Wednesday evening. The Washington Post reported earlier this week that the measure could surface in the legislation.\n\nRelevant fact: Most minor league players earn poverty-level wages. \"Starting pay for minor leaguers is between $1,100 and $2,150 a month, and only during the season, which can be as short as three months,\" Mother Jones reported in 2014.\n\nBiden to talk jobs: Former Vice President Joe Biden and Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue will participate in a roundtable about creating jobs for American workers. The discussion will be led by Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, Prince George's Community College President Charlene Dukes, and Washington Center for Equitable Growth Executive Director Heather Boushey. The event starts at 10 a.m. at the Newseum. Watch a livestream here.\n\nOKLAHOMA LAWMAKERS SCRAMBLE TO AVOID STRIKE: Oklahoma legislators have begun discussions around teacher pay raises to avoid a walkout similar to the one that closed West Virginia public schools for nearly two weeks in late February-early March. Public school teachers have vowed to strike by April 2 if the state does not increase pay and education budgets. One plan proposed by a GOP state senator would raise salaries by $6,000 over three years. Accompanying legislation would generate more than $900 million in new revenue to pay for the wage increases. More from News9's Chris Gilmore here.\n\nHOMAN COULD GIVE 'SANCTUARY' TESTIMONY: Thomas Homan, the top official at ICE, will likely be called to testify in the administration's lawsuit against the state of California over its so-called \"sanctuary\" laws, Don Thompson reports in the Associated Press. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kendall Newman said it was his \"strong inclination\" to make Homan provide four hours of sworn testimony in the case, the AP reports.\n\n\"Homan must back up claims that the federal government is suffering 'irreparable harm' from three California laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities by employers and state and local law enforcement agencies, Newman said,\" according to the AP. The judge rejected a DOJ attorney's argument \"that such testimony would be too burdensome on a busy agency director.\" More here.\n\nINSLEE SIGNS GENDER WAGE EQUALITY BILL: \"[Washington State] Gov. Jay Inslee has signed a measure that seeks to reduce the wage gap between men and women and provide equal growth opportunities and fair treatment in the workplace,\" the Associated Press reports. \"The measure modifies the state's Equal Pay Act by making several changes, including making it unacceptable for employers to retaliate against an employee for asking about their wages or the salary of other employees. It also provides additional protections under the existing law for employees whose professional opportunities are hindered because of their gender.\" More here.\n\nUAW OFFICIAL CHARGED: A sixth high-level United Auto Workers official has been indicted for allegedly using illegal cash from Fiat Chrysler to pay for lavish personal expenses during contract negotiations, Robert Snell reports in the Detroit News. Prosecutors say the former official, Nancy Adams Johnson \"spent tens of thousands of dollars in illegal payments from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on $1,100 designer shoes, first-class flights to California, resorts and limousines.\"\n\nFrom Snell: \"Adams Johnson traveled, golfed, dined and shopped with Fiat Chrysler money funneled through a training center for blue-collar workers under a policy created by the auto company's officials to keep UAW leaders 'fat, dumb and happy,' according to the government. The policy was designed to wring concessions favoring the automaker, according to the government.\"\n\nThe scandal has ensnared former UAW Vice President Norwood Jewell, who is accused of being given a birthday party with training center fees that included top-shelf liquor and \"strolling models who lit labor leaders' cigars,\" according to the News. Adams Johnson is alleged to have spent $75,000 in training center money on personal items, \"including $1,000 Christian Louboutin shoes, clothes, jewelry, luggage, meals and more.\"\n\nThe UAW called the allegations \"appalling\" but said \"there is no evidence that compromised individuals involved in this investigation, including Ms. Johnson, in any way corrupted the negotiations of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.\" More here.\n\nFED RAISES RATES: \"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time this year and signaled it will act more aggressively to head off inflation, potentially threatening [Trump's] hopes for faster economic growth,\" POLITICO's Victoria Guida reports. \"Fed officials are now essentially split on the question of whether to hike interest rates a total of three times or four this year -- a response, in part, to recent tax cuts and increased spending by Congress, which the central bank fears could lead prices to spike.\" More here.\n\nDIGGING INTO TRUMP'S NDAS: The New York Times explores Trump's use of non-disclosure agreements in a piece by Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Maggie Haberman, Michael Shear and Katie Rogers. In the early months of his presidency, Trump was \"infuriated by leaks about everything from staff rivalries to his bathrobe-wearing, TV-viewing habits.\" He ordered then-chief of staff Reince Priebus to force aides to sign NDAs in an effort to stop the flow of inside information.\n\n\"To calm Mr. Trump, Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, drew up a broad document barring White House officials from publicly disclosing what they heard and saw at work,\" the Times reports. \"But he privately told senior aides that it was mainly meant to placate an agitated president, who was convinced that the people around him had to be pressured into keeping his secrets. Mr. McGahn made it clear the agreement could not ultimately be enforced, according to several people who signed.\"\n\n\"The nondisclosure agreement, presented by Mr. Priebus to the senior staff last April, did not specify any penalties -- financial or otherwise -- for breaking it,\" the Times reports. \"But it was an early indication that Mr. Trump, who spent decades using pressure tactics and secrecy in his private life, wanted to do the same thing at the White House, breaking with tradition.\" More here.\n\nCOFFEE BREAK:\n\n-- \"U.S. companies are pressuring their workers on how to lobby and vote,\" from the Washington Post\n\n-- \"Welcome to Zucktown.

Nearly four in 10 likely voters, 39 percent, are undecided. While being under 50 percent is typically a red flag for an incumbent, there are signs in the poll that Feinstein is in strong position.

It is a continued perpetration of a racist lie, that immigrants are not valued members of our society,'' Schaaf told reporters following her launch of a new ballot measure to support early childhood education. \"We in Oakland know better.

                "title": "House scrambles to pass omnibus spending package",
                "body": "With government funding running out midnight Friday, House GOP leaders are scrambling to push a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill through the chamber today, only hours after unveiling its text.\n\nBut House Democrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), are pushing back, trying to defeat the bill on a parliamentary vote this morning.\n\nTop Republicans privately believe Pelosi's gambit will fail, but the last-minute maneuvering shows how confused the outlook for the omnibus package is on Capitol Hill at this moment.\n\nWhile large majorities in both parties want the bill to pass -- and voted for the budget agreement that ended last month's government shutdown -- lawmakers are using what is likely the last \"must pass\" legislation of the year in order to move their own proposals or score some political points.\n\nThere also has been little time to review the huge bill, well over 2000 pages long, which has upset lawmakers in both parties.\n\nPelosi is urging her members to vote against the House rule to consider the omnibus -- the first step on the floor to debating the package -- after congressional leaders failed to secure protections for Dreamers in the funding bill.\n\nWhile Pelosi is supporting the overall spending package -- she and other Democrats have bragged that they defeated many \"poison pill\" rides sought by Republicans -- the California Democrat is unhappy that there was no action on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. President Donald Trump has sought to end the program, although the issue is now likely heading for the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The Republicans could easily have joined us in providing real protection for the Dreamers but refused to do so,\" Pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues sent overnight.\n\nPelosi's position may be a problem for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his top lieutenants. A number of conservative Republicans, including the House Freedom Caucus, are opposed to the package. Republicans believe some Democrats will support the rule -- despite Pelosi's push -- because they want provisions in the omnibus.\n\nTrump's apathy toward the omnibus package is also a potential issue. While he has publicly called for its passage, Trump on Wednesday vented to Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he wanted more money for his border wall with Mexico. Ultimately, Trump agreed to sign the bill once it's passed, but only after creating a panic with GOP leaders who had to scramble to convince the president that he had secured real legislative wins.\n\nGOP conservatives have already come out against the bill in droves. It took just minutes after the bill's release for the House Freedom Caucus to formally oppose it.\n\nRepublican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker said he and many of his members are leaning 'no.'\n\n\"There's good and bad and ugly, except the bad and ugly is really bad and ugly, so we'll see what happens,\" Walker said Wednesday night.\n\nCongressional leaders considered several options for trading Dreamer protections for wall funding in the omnibus but ultimately couldn't come to a deal. The White House wanted full funding for the wall -- $25 billion -- but Democrats were only willing to consider that if Republicans agreed to offer Dreamers a path to citizenship, not just a temporary reprieve.\n\n\"While some may differ, many Dreamers and their supporters made it clear that they did not want to accept a patch of less value tied to intensified interior enforcement,\" Pelosi wrote.",

                "title": "Here come the China tariffs",
                "body": "HERE COME THE CHINA TARIFFS -- The White House moved their timetable up by a day and President Trump plans to announce around $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. on Thursday at 12:30 p.m. EST. As discussed on the POLITICO Money podcast this week, the tariffs are meant as a response to estimates for what the U.S. lost to China in intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers last year. An official close to the process confirmed the $50 billion number but also said details could change at any time until Trump makes the announcement.\n\nWhite House Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Kevin Hassett has been working on the list of hundreds of products to be targeted to avoid the biggest possible hits on U.S. consumers. \"Kevin is trying to skew it to the smart side as much as possible,\" one senior official said. But the shear breadth of the products subject to tariff mean consumers will feel the pinch.\n\nPer this WSJ report, China is likely to respond with their own levies aimed at states that Trump won in 2016. The tariffs on the U.S. would likely hit Farm Belt states and products including soybeans, sorghum and live hogs. The big question is whether this trade dispute with China will remain relatively contained. An exchange of limited tariffs like these would not likely be a totally destabilizing event though it's likely to hit U.S. farmers fairly hard.\n\nTrump's tariffs could theoretically have a positive effect if they lead China to further open up their financial services and insurance markets to U.S. companies. But the big risk remains that China responds, Trump gets angry at their response and announces even more tariffs. That's the textbook definition of a trade war. And if it escalates it could do serious damage to the U.S. economy - much more than it would to China - slamming consumers, farmers and manufacturers and likely tanking the stock market.\n\nOMNIBUS DEAL REACHED -- Via POLITICO's Heather Caygle, Burgess Everett, and Rachael Bade: \"Congressional leaders have clinched an agreement on a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill that ... Trump, for now, appears grudgingly willing to support. Washington has until Friday to act before the government shuts down.\n\n\"Negotiators finally reached an accord to fund the government through September after abandoning many of the most controversial provisions lawmakers were trying to include in the must-pass bill ... and is likely the last major piece of legislation the president will sign before the midterm elections.\n\n\"The bill will, however, fix a snafu in the GOP's tax law -- the so-called 'grain glitch' -- that farm state lawmakers were seeking. It also includes a narrow gun safety measure and a compromise on a New York infrastructure project that had become a lightning-rod issue with the president.\" Read more.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BILL -- POLITICO's Sarah Ferris has the details on what's in and out of the omnibus, H.R. 1625 (115), from Gateway to border security. Overall the $1.3 trillion bill would add $143 billion in increased funding across defense and domestic programs in fiscal 2018.\n\nTHE FULL TEXT of the giant spending bill, finally posted around 8:00 p.m. Wednesday night, is here. It clocks in at 2,232 pages. The House is supposed to vote on it Thursday.\n\nIT INCLUDES a provision calling on OMB to \"submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the costs of implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\" It also extends a ban on redesigning the $1 bill, which is apparently a big issue for the vending machine industry.\n\nFLOOD INSURANCE -- Via POLITICO's Zachary Warmbrodt (@zachary) on Twitter: \"The omnibus would decouple expiration of the National Flood Insurance Program from government funding. The new deadline to reauthorize the NFIP would be July 31 -- a victory for House Republicans who want the Senate to get around to passing a long-term overhaul bill.\"\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES FUNDING -- Per POLITICO's budget gurus, financial services funding under the bill would be at $23.4 billion (up from $21.5 billion in FY17)\n\nSummary of financial services funding is here.\n\nHere's what a GOP Hill source told Zach about the omni: \"Democrats can point to whatever isn't in the Omni as 'saving Dodd Frank.' Our 'riders' are named Mick Mulvaney, Steven Mnuchin, Jay Clayton, and Randy Quarles. And they're around longer than this Omnibus.\"\n\nSee any Easter Eggs in the Omni? Please email me at bwhite@politico.com.\n\nCongress now has 48 hours to pass the funding bill to avoid a shutdown. President Trump supports the measure (at least for now). House conservatives in the Freedom Caucus hate the bill and will oppose it. But there should be enough Democrats to get the bill through the House on Thursday and to the Senate on Friday. But nothing is certain. And a short-term CR could be needed if any senator (see: Paul, Rand) decides to hold things up into Saturday.\n\n** A message from FICO: Don't be fooled. VantageScore isn't an independent startup -- it's owned by the three credit bureaus. Allowing the credit bureaus to offer a credit score they own in mortgage lending decisions would consolidate their power over the entire credit reporting process. That's not good for competition or consumers.

'But on the other hand, you have to ask yourself, can we go on with an $800 -- and growing -- billion trade deficit,' Lighthizer said. 'So, we have to do something and the people who are benefiting from the status quo are always going to be against it. We understand that, and we have to balance their interest.'\"\n\nSTEEL NO BIG DEAL? -- Via Platts: \"Trump's Section 232 tariffs likely will be viewed in retrospect as 'a relatively small event' for the global steel and aluminum industries, BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie said .. Speaking during the FT Commodities Global Summit in Lausanne, Mackenzie said the tariffs on imports -- 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum -- seemingly have been 'made smaller by a lot of the exemptions' the administration is now mulling for a number of countries and products.\"\n\nZUCK SPEAKS -- POLITICO's Nancy Scola: \"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday addressed the Cambridge Analytica controversy that has embroiled the company since the weekend, calling it 'a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. .. 'We need to fix that,' he said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"The CEO also outlined a series of steps the company is taking to shore up the security of the Facebook platform, including telling users when their data has been misused and turning off data access for applications that people haven't used within the past three months. According to sources inside Facebook ... employees have been clamoring for Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to personally address the situation\" Read more.\n\nZuckerberg did a bunch of other media interviews, including to the NYT here and ReCode here where he said he was willing to testify before Congress: \"So I'm open to doing it if I'm the right [person].\"\n\nTOO LITTLE, TOO LATE? -- Per POLITICO's Steven Overly: \"Facebook's slow, unsteady response to the furor over its handling of people's data is doing perhaps permanent damage to the D.C. reputations of ... Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, its two most famous executives.\" Read more.\n\nPOWELL MAKES HIS MOVE -- It was only a quarter point hike, as expected, but Fed Chair Jay Powell erred on the hawkish side, as POLITICO's Victoria Guida reports here, posing a threat to Trump's hopes from significantly faster economic growth.\n\n\"Fed officials are now essentially split on the question of whether to hike interest rates a total of three times or four this year -- a response, in part, to recent tax cuts and increased spending by Congress, which the central bank fears could lead prices to spike. ... Fed officials upgraded their forecast for economic growth this year and next, projecting a 2.7 percent increase in GDP in 2018 and a 2.4 percent increase in 2019. But over the longer term, the central bank still expects growth to hover at or below 2 percent.\"\n\nREGULATORY COMMENTS -- Cowen's Jaret Seiberg on the Powell presser: \"Nothing discussed at today's press conference runs contrary to our view that policy continues to be a tailwind for regional and community banks. On the monetary policy front, our worry remains that the President could start attacking the Federal Reserve if rates keep going up as the FOMC is forecasting.\n\n\"On the CCAR stress test, Powell noted that Congress is considering raising the SIFI designation level to $250 billion of assets though the Federal Reserve would retain the power to designate smaller banks. He would not endorse having stress tests occur less frequently than annually though he acknowledged that Congress did give the Federal Reserve more discretion on this front.\"\n\nWHAT'S NEXT? -- S&P's Beth Ann Bovino: \"Despite the Fed's near-term outlook for only 3 rate hikes, we believe the Fed will likely raise rates slightly faster, with four rate hikes in total this year. This takes into account a stronger near-term economic outlook, helped by fiscal spending\"\n\nHAWKISH TILT -- Manulife's Megan Greene: \"The Fed's March announcement and Jerome Powell's press conference offered no dramatic shocks, but the bias was decidedly hawkish relative to what we expected. ... What was more telling was the shift in the so-called dot plot, showing that most FOMC members were more hawkish about the Fed's rate path over the next three years\"\n\nGOOD THURSDAY MORNING -- Hope everyone made it through the snow OK.

This includes protections for veterans from credit bureaus. Others appear to be more than what Senate could accept such as bills on writing Volcker rules, the SLR and Deposit Advance Products. ... We believe the votes ... bode well for House passage of the Senate bank deregulatory bill, which includes some of these measures. Passage of that bill is broadly positive for regional banks.\"\n\nDEMS PLAN CRACKDOWN ON BUYBACKS -- Via CNNMoney: \"Democrats in Congress want to rain on Wall Street's buyback parade. Senator Tammy Baldwin plans to introduce a bill on Thursday that would prohibit companies from repurchasing their shares on the open market, Baldwin told CNNMoney.\n\n\"While the legislation faces an uphill battle getting through Republican-controlled Congress, it demonstrates a growing backlash against companies using extra cash to reward shareholders instead of sharing it with workers.\" Read more.\n\nSTOCKS WOBBLE AND END LOWER -- AP's Marley Jay: \"After a jittery afternoon of trading, major U.S. stock indexes fell Wednesday while smaller companies fared better. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as investors expected, and said it could raise rates at a quicker pace next year. Stocks traded higher early in the day and jumped after the Fed announced its decision.\n\n\"The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 250 points, but gave it all up as new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addressed reporters.

The U.S. warned last week against imposing tax measures that single out digital companies.\" Read more.\n\nTHINK CRYPTO IS CONFUSING? TRY PAYING TAXES ON IT -- NYT's Kevin Roose: \"The room was full of stressed-out cryptocurrency traders. And for once, they weren't nervous about the price of Bitcoin, or the roller coaster swings of the virtual currency markets. No, the subject of this gloomy affair was taxes. Specifically, how -- and whether -- to pay them.\n\n\"With this year's April 17 tax filing deadline fast approaching, many virtual currency traders are sweating over their tax returns. They're confused by the complicated rules, many of them stemming from guidelines issued by the I.R.S. in 2014, governing the taxation of virtual currencies. They're afraid that the windfall profits created by last year's cryptocurrency boom, which sent currencies like Bitcoin and Ether skyrocketing and created a new class of crypto-millionaires, have left them with huge tax bills.\" Read more.\n\nTREASURY HAS PREPARED INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS ON CHINA -- Reuters: \"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday his agency has worked on U.S. investment restrictions on China for ... Trump to consider as part of his decisions on intellectual property actions against Beijing. 'We have worked on options for his consideration,' Mnuchin said, referring to Trump.\n\n\"Mnuchin also told Reuters in an interview that the administration would keep a dialogue open with senior level government officials in Beijing to try to open China's economy to U.S. companies and help shrink a gaping U.S. trade deficit.\" Read more.\n\nMORE TARIFF TALK -- Bloomberg's Jeanna Smialek: \"Trump's tough trade rhetoric has got the Federal Reserve talking. Chairman Jerome Powell, picked by Trump to lead the U.S. central bank, said policy makers had not altered their economic outlook following the president's announcement of trade tariffs on steel and aluminum and threats of measures against Chinese goods.

Her first day will be June 18th.\"\n\n** A message from FICO: FICO is the independent standard in credit scoring, trusted by lenders and securitization experts for decades. FICO supports a competitive review of credit scores in mortgage lending, but the only other score being considered is VantageScore, which is owned by the three credit bureaus. Allowing the credit bureaus to offer a score they own in a system where they are the single point of sale and distribution for both credit reports and scores would not increase competition or innovation, it would consolidate their power. What's more, introducing a score with lower minimum scoring criteria could result in riskier loans, while doing little to expand mortgage access. Let's keep credit scores independent and reliable.

But congressional leaders didn't unveil the text until late Wednesday, giving lawmakers a roughly 48-hour window to look through and pass a 2,232-page bill. \"President Donald Trump, for now, appears grudgingly willing to support the measure, which is likely the last major piece of legislation he will sign before the midterm elections,\" Heather, Burgess, Rachael and Sarah Ferris report. \"The so-called omnibus bill abandons many of the most controversial provisions lawmakers were trying to include in the must-pass bill -- which had painfully stalled the bill's release for days.\"\n\nThe bill includes a fix for the \"grain glitch\" in the GOP tax law, a narrow gun safety measure and a compromise on a New York-New Jersey infrastructure project. \"But the deal wasn't without its detractors,\" they write. \"The president was unhappy that GOP leaders didn't win more money for his border wall with Mexico or any new detention beds for undocumented immigrants and new deportation agents.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) went to the White House to discuss the omnibus with the president on Wednesday afternoon, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) spoke to the president by phone.\n\n\"Both parties' negotiators walked away with sales pitches for their rank-and-file after weeks of back-and-forth,\" they add. \"Republicans secured an $80 billion annual increase for the Pentagon, its largest in 15 years, with a substantial 2.4 percent pay raise for the troops.

Thirty-five Democrats voted for the measure, and two Republicans opposed it. \"The passage of the bill, known as right-to-try, is a big victory for the small libertarian think tank that crafted the proposal -- and for a White House that has vigorously campaigned for the law,\" Sarah Karlin-Smith reports. \"And it comes one week after Republicans failed to pass a similar measure through an expedited process that needed two-thirds support from the chamber.\"\n\nThe legislation now heads to the Senate, which passed a similar version of the House bill last summer. It's unclear, however, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will take up the bill. \"The Senate cleared its version of right-to-try over the summer on unanimous consent,\" Karlin-Smith adds. \"But it stalled in the House...

The House passed it in February, so the legislation now heads to the president's desk, where Trump is expected to sign it into law. \"The legislation would hold websites liable for 'knowingly' enabling sex trafficking,\" Ashley Gold reports. \"It's targeted at sites like Backpage.com, the subject of a long-running Senate investigation, which was accused of hosting ads that promoted the trafficking of minors -- but its passage comes as divisions within the tech industry and rising frustration with companies like Facebook have weakened the sector's power in the Capitol.\"\n\n\"The effort has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Congress, but it was the subject of fierce lobbying by the tech industry,\" which warned the bill would create a dangerous precedent by amending a legal provision that's long shielded websites like Google and Twitter from lawsuits over user-posted content. \"For an industry that for years enjoyed a free ride in Washington, the trafficking legislation marks a stinging defeat -- and the first tangible sign of Washington's changing attitude toward Silicon Valley,\" Gold continues.

                "title": "Trump fires back at Biden: He's 'mentally and physically' weak",
                "body": "President Donald Trump on Thursday called former Vice President Joe Biden \"weak, both mentally and physically,\" suggesting he could easily beat up Biden, in response to the former vice president's comment that he would have sought to fight Trump over his remarks about women if the two were in high school together.\n\n\"Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault,\" Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday morning. \"He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe!\"\n\nBiden's remarks came earlier this week at the University of Miami, where he reiterated to students comments he had made on the 2016 campaign trail after the publication of Trump's \"Access Hollywood\" tape, wherein the current president can be heard bragging about how his celebrity status allowed him to sexually assault women without consequence.\n\n\"A guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, 'I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it,'\" Biden said last Tuesday, according to ABC News. \"They asked me if I'd like to debate this gentleman, and I said 'no.' I said, 'If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.'\"\n\n\"I've been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life,\" the former vice president continued. \"I'm a pretty damn good athlete. Any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest S.O.B. in the room.\"\n\nBiden has kept up his criticism of Trump since leaving office early last year, stoking talk that he might launch a White House bid in 2020 to unseat him. Trump, who is 71 years old, was the oldest person ever to assume the presidency, but would lose that title to the 75-year-old Biden if the former vice president were to unseat him.\n\nIn a subsequent post to Twitter, Trump lobbed criticism at his 2016 foe, Hillary Clinton, taunting those who suggested that her campaign apparatus and fundraising would make her an insurmountable opponent for the president.\n\n\"Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore!\" Trump wrote online.",

                "body": "THE BUZZ: We're headed from one election to the next -- and we're not talking about the general election ramp-up.\n\nThe 2019 Chicago mayor's race has arrived.\n\nLast night, Garry McCarthy, the police superintendent Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired in 2015, made it official: he's running against Emanuel. If you thought the Bruce Rauner-J.B. Pritzker race was going to be ugly, just wait. This could quickly devolve into a political bloodbath.\n\nThe challenge of the McCarthy bid is seeing past the fact that he and Emanuel carry the same vulnerability: the handling of the Laquan McDonald fatal shooting and the subsequent distrust it stirred up in the the African American community. McCarthy headed Chicago police when the shooting happened and when officers on the scene allegedly falsified police reports.\n\nThe Mayor's Office fought the release of the Laquan McDonald video for months until a judge ordered it be made public. The following days, protests broke out, pressure intensified and Emanuel fired McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy does pose the danger of pulling votes away from Emanuel, thereby benefiting a third candidate. Here's McCarthy's announcement: \"Chicago does not have to live like this:\" Watch\n\nThe Tribune's Bill Ruthhart, who had the first sit-down with McCarthy, lays out the challenges:\n\n\"He has little in the way of campaign cash, loathes the idea of fundraising and, unlike other high-profile Illinois Democrats of late, does not have his own money to pour into a run. He also lacks experience working on issues outside of crime and will have to address the Laquan McDonald police shooting scandal that occurred on his watch. Plus, his entree into politics will be for one of the toughest public jobs in America against one of the country's most seasoned politicians.\n\nAnd the benefits: \"What McCarthy does have, though, is high name recognition, two decades working in top posts in three major cities, and plenty of experience communicating his priorities to reporters, TV cameras and the public. After more than four years as serving as Emanuel's frontman for Chicago's crime-fighting strategies, McCarthy now will try to make the case to take the job of the man who fired him two years ago amid the McDonald fallout.\" Story here\n\nAnother major problem for McCarthy: that whole New Yorker thing. Expect his Chicago bonafides and loyalty to the city to be questioned repeatedly: WLS' Bill Cameron on Twitter: 'Anyone who thinks Chicago is only 'ONE of the greatest cities in the world' not only does not deserve to be mayor of Chicago but does not make the minimum requirement needed to run for mayor of Chicago.' - Rahm camp responds to McCarthy.\"\n\nPRIMARY TAKEAWAYS\n\nThe prevailing day-after-the-election theme centered on the work Rauner has to do to rebuild his relationship with the conservative base who abandoned him on Tuesday.\n\nOur story: \"Is Bruce Rauner toast?\" \"In the span of one day, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's fortunes went from bad to worse. He was already widely considered to be the most vulnerable incumbent governor in the country. Then came Tuesday's Illinois primary, where he spent $17 million in TV ads but barely squeaked out a victory against a nearly unknown state legislator. With Democrats already uniting behind the free-spending billionaire who will lead their ticket in the fall, Illinois Republicans are wondering: After Tuesday's weak showing, does Rauner even have a prayer of winning reelection in November?\"\n\n... Rauner's first order of business is stitching the broken party back together. But the day after the primary, Rauner and Ives were still squabbling over who should have called whom the night before. Ives remained peeved the governor took the stage to claim victory before the two had spoken. \"Why would she talk to him after the disrespect he showed last night announcing victory before all of the counties were in -- without a call to the campaign, after he poured millions of dollars into an attack campaign that flat-out lied about her ... ?\" Ives spokeswoman Kathleen Murphy said in an email. \"She has no reason to believe or trust anything he says.\"\n\nRauner spokesman Will Allison suggested it was the governor who was waiting for a call. \"She never called last night,\" Allison said. \"Our team has reached out to their team to set up a call.\" Story here\n\nThe Daily Herald's Marni Pyke reports Ives won't endorse Rauner: \"For now, Ives is promising to deliver only one vote. \"I'm a Republican. I'll vote for him, but I will not endorse him,\" she said. \"I will not campaign for him. ... Maybe if he takes out a million-dollar ad buy and admits he lied about me, maybe we'll talk.\" Rauner ads painted Ives as a patsy for powerful Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. That cost her votes downstate, Ives said, although she and Madigan are the polar opposite politically.\" Story here\n\n-- St. Louis Post Dispatch questions the Illinois GOP field including having two racists on the ballot: \"If these are the best candidates the party can muster, Illinois Republicans are in serious trouble.\" Story here\n\n-- Turnout: 1.92 million people voted ... the highest for a gubernatorial primary election since 2002, according to the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform (that's the year Rod Blagojevich first ran as a clean government reformer in the wake of then Gov. George Ryan's corruption investigation).\n\n\"Although Governor Rauner played down the legitimacy of challenger Jeanne Ives' candidacy for most of the primary, the closer-than-expected win by the governor underscores the engagement Ives drew from the GOP base,\" ICPR said in a report published Wednesday.\n\n-- \"Rauner cites own remarks as proof of outside support for election night claim,\" by Better Government Association's Kiannah Sepeda-Miller: \"Incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner struck a number of familiar notes in his speech Tuesday night as he claimed a narrow primary victory over insurgent Republican challenger Jeanne Ives, talking about tax cuts, job growth and term limits for elected leaders. But the multi-millionaire Rauner also sought to frame his coming general election battle against Democratic nominee J.B. Pritzker as one pitting the interests of the little guy against entrenched political insiders allied with the billionaire Pritzker.\n\n\"Then Rauner threw in a new wrinkle to his standard line of attack. 'Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia,' he told the applauding crowd. 'But it's really the people versus the Illinois mafia.' Rauner has long been free with tossing around incendiary terms to describe rivals, in particularly Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, whom the governor frequently lambastes as 'corrupt.' But this latest turn of phrase, which Rauner attributed not to himself but 'newspapers,' got us to wondering. Which newspapers?\" Story here\n\n-- We asked Pritzker about being too close to Dem Party Chair Mike Madigan: \"This is the common attack that Bruce Rauner brings against every single Democrat. He's got no other message. He's wrong if he thinks I'm anything but an independent speaker, an independent leader. And remember, I still favor independent maps and making sure we have leadership term limits.\"\n\n-- \"Lipinski win stings liberals,\" by POLITICO's Heather Caygle and Elena Schneider: \"House Democrats are trying to hit the reset button a day after Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski eked out a win in a nasty primary battle that had several of his own colleagues publicly rooting for his defeat. Lawmakers from the progressive and conservative wings of the party insisted on Wednesday there were no hard feelings after Lipinski's narrow triumph over his liberal challenger, Marie Newman. But it's clear that some of the residual feelings about Lipinski's politics -- as an anti-abortion Democrat who has opposed marriage equality and Obamacare, he's one of the most conservative members of the caucus -- still linger.\" Story here\n\n-- Robin Kelly for Dem Party chair? Lynn Sweet explains: \"Rep. Robin Kelly won two victories in the primary from Democratic voters in the 2nd Congressional District. She was nominated for another term in Congress -- that's a clinch for November on this Democratic turf -- and she won her race to become one of 38 members in charge of the Democratic Party of Illinois. They pick the chairman. The party chair is state House Speaker Michael Madigan, who has been slammed for his handling of sexual harassment allegations -- serious hits in this \"MeToo\" era. GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner plans to continue to make Madigan a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. Madigan will be up for re-election as state party chair. With Kelly on the committee, there is, for the first time in ages, a viable alternative to Madigan.\" Story here\n\nSTATE\n\n-- \"Former campaign worker sues Madigan fund, Democratic Party in sexual harassment case,\" Chicago Tribune's Ray Long, Stacy St. Clair, Christy Gutowski: \"The campaign worker who disrupted House Speaker Michael Madigan's political operations with sexual harassment allegations against a top lieutenant filed a federal lawsuit late Wednesday afternoon, saying her decision to report the behavior cost her a chance to advance in his organization. Alaina Hampton, who first told the Tribune last month of receiving inappropriate texts from Madigan aide Kevin Quinn, contends in the lawsuit that her effort to stop his unwanted advances effectively prevented her from getting further work on Democratic campaigns.\" Story here\n\n-- \"Waitresses claim in federal lawsuit they were groped, grabbed at local pancake house,\" by Belleville News-Democrat's Beth Hundsdorfer: \"While women working in entertainment, media and government careers are drawing attention to sexual harassment in the workplace, employees who delivered pancakes at two metro-east restaurants said they were subjected to groping, grabbing and the fear of sexual assault on the job by co-workers. Eleven women and one man who worked as servers filed suit in federal court against the International House of Pancakes and the owners and at least four of the employees of their franchise restaurants in Glen Carbon and Alton.\" Story here\n\n-- \"Rahm Emanuel: Why the O'Hare expansion is crucial,\" by Rahm Emanuel in Crain's Chicago Business: \"I am confident that aldermen will recognize what business groups, organized labor, editorial boards and aviation experts already have concluded: This is a plan that works for everyone. It will inject billions of dollars into our local economy, create enough jobs to go around every community in Chicago and position O'Hare as the gold standard for airports around the world. O'Hare is bursting at the seams with customers and cargo. Last year, a record number of passengers (79.8 million) and products (1.9 million tons) moved through the airport. Nearly a third of China's air cargo to the U.S. comes through O'Hare. Chicago must create the capacity to keep up with rising demand, or risk getting left behind.\" Story here\n\n-- \"'We got it wrong,' United CEO says of puppy's death,\" by Chicago Tribune's Michael Sasso and Kim Chipman: \"United Continental Holdings' boss expressed regret for the recent in-flight death of a 10-month-old puppy. 'We got it wrong last week,' Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz said in a speech to a Chicago business group. 'We take this deeply seriously.' Munoz acknowledged the shortcomings after a bruising week of public-relations fiascoes involving animals.\" Story here\n\n-- \"Gary mayor asks police to be less 'intimidating' at airport protests over deportations,\" by Post-Tribune's Gregory Tejeda: \"Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson said she has talked with Gary police officials about being less intimidating during protests outside the Gary/Chicago International Airport. Activists on Tuesday used a Common Council meeting to express their concerns about the police presence that is at the airport whenever activists show up to picket federal immigration officials deporting individuals from the United States, saying they believe it is excessive. Freeman-Wilson said she shares their concerns, and said she has had talks with Chief Richard Allen and his top-ranking staff.\" Story here\n\nAROUND THE COLLARS\n\n-- \"Cronin: Changes coming after DuPage Election Commission's 'inept' performance,\" by The Daily Herald's Robert Sanchez: \"DuPage election commission officials must publicly explain their 'totally inept' performance on Election Night when technical problems prevented them from releasing final voting results until roughly eight hours after the polls closed, county board Chairman Dan Cronin said Wednesday.

                "body": "STORM POLITICS REPORT -- As a fourth winter storm knocks Massachusetts with more of a whisper than a wallop, the state House and Senate leaders of the committees on Global Warming and Climate Change say Gov. Charlie Baker's week-old $1.4 billion environmental bond bill (with $300 million for infrastructure and mitigation and prevention of climate change) doesn't go far enough to gird the state from the effects of climate change.\n\nAnd Senate chair Marc Pacheco specifically criticized the timing around Baker's proposals.\n\n\"It's good optics, when you talk about politics, it all sounds good, but when you really have a chance to analyze the bill's language,\" Pacheco told me. \"When I read it, I found a watered-down version of the climate adaptation bill that had already passed the Senate.\" The Senate bill in reference has been passed multiple times by the body, and stalled out before getting to the House floor.\n\nPacheco says his full response to the bill itself was delayed in part because he and others had only seen the text of the governor's proposal the morning of the announcement.\n\n\"The danger is that we can't think that we're solving something just based upon the optics of what the governor has filed,\" Pacheco said.\n\nPacheco (and his House counterpart state Rep. Frank Smizik) said any comprehensive response would require a so-called coastal buy-back program that would enable the state to buy-back coastal properties frequently demolished by storms, as well as the need for a comprehensive, statewide plan to respond to climate change.\n\nSmizik hinted at the potential those proposals be folded into the finished bill by the House and Senate. \"Though I am glad that the bill would significantly boost funding to help municipalities plan for the impacts of climate change, the Legislature must expand the bill's reach,\" Smizik said in a statement. \"We must include provisions allowing for coastal buyback and requiring that policies be consistent with the statewide climate adaptation plan.\"\n\nMeanwhile, 47 percent of Massachusetts voters say the state is \"somewhat prepared\" to deal with the effects of climate change, according to new polling from MassINC and WBUR. Only six percent say the state is \"very prepared\" while 16 percent say Massachusetts is \"not at all prepared.\"\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

The shooter's 18-year-old brother, Zachary Cruz, was arrested Monday at the school for trespassing, according to the Broward Sheriff's Office, who on Tuesday reportedthey had arrested a 10th-grade Stoneman Douglas student on a misdemeanor charge for making a threat on social media.

Jordan Salter's lawyer, Assistant Public Defender Brian Reidy, argued that worries from the school massacre have led prosecutors to seek higher bond amounts for teen defendants. Salter is accused of displaying a 2-inch black knife at Stoneman Douglas on Tuesday after a boy asked Salter's friend a sexually offensive question.

His dad owned a revolver. He had experience in a shooting range. He resented being the target of bullies in school. And, police said, he made violent comments online -- and craved the 'adrenaline rush' of carrying out a mass shooting.

But Tallahassee lawyer Jason Gonzalez, who argued on behalf of the Florida Department of Health, said the 71 percent of Florida voters who approved the 2016 constitutional amendment to expand medical marijuana use would feel duped if Judge Karen Gievers agreed the law allows the drug to be grown at home.

So-called CON laws were once part of a federal program repealed in 1987. But today most states maintain the law, which requires hospitals to get approval before they build new facilities. It's based on the concept that hospitals are expensive to build and operate, and that doctors' critical skills require constant practice. By that logic, hospitals should be heavily regulated to improve care and keep down costs. But advocates for repeal believe the opposite: Competition would break up hospital monopolies and force them to be more efficient, while offering better health care to patients.

Edward Peachey, the former leader of CareerSource Tampa Bay and CareerSource Pinellas, was fired in Hillsborough County last week and in Pinellas County on Wednesday. The job centers are under state and federal investigations, which are seeking in part to determine whether the agencies have inflated the number of job placements they've reported to the state in recent years.

Now, the New York lawyer is poised to help represent Palm Beach County in what could be one of the biggest court cases in the county's history, a battle against drug manufacturers and distributors, which some governments have come to blame for not limiting the availability or potency of drugs being abused in the opioid epidemic.

Visitors who set off metal detectors must consent to unclothed searches of their person and their vehicles, or forfeit visitation privileges. The Times-Union analyzed consent forms to determine the genders of those being searched at Baker. More than 97 percent of nearly 200 searches in a three-month span were conducted on females ...

An investigation into Reams began in 2016 after his former girlfriend reported to the Sheriff's Office that he'd taken nude photos of her at the courthouse and had sex with her in the judge's chambers.

THE BIG PICTURE: CONGRESS IS DONE, YA GOT WHAT YA GOT. There are 229 DAYS between now and Election Day. But after this omnibus spending bill passes this week, legislating is effectively over, and a big part of the political picture of the first two years of DONALD TRUMP'S presidency is frozen and ready for the voters' review. Some might argue that if Democrats take the House, the heaviest period of legislating for Trump's first term ends this week.\n\nREPUBLICANS HAVE rewritten the tax code, boosted military spending, provided $1.6 billion to build the border wall with Mexico (the same wall Mexico was going to pay for), repealed health care's individual mandate and rolled back a ton of regulations. They've done little on immigration and they will have passed a few minor gun-control measures.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH FOR FOR THE REST OF 2018: Republicans will give vulnerable lawmakers a chance to score some minor legislative victories for messaging purposes. The Senate has confirmations to handle, as well.\n\nBETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY, you might see a few more items pop up from time to time, but the next six or so months are about campaigning for control of Congress.\n\nTWO NIGHTS AGO, in a comment that drew little notice, PRESIDENT TRUMP told NRCC donors this about his campaign season plans: \"I'll be all over the country. Kevin, you'll get me all over. Where is our Kevin? You're going to get me all over the country, Kevin? And I'll be complaining every single trip.

LATE YESTERDAY, House Republicans told us they would probably vote on the 2,232-page omnibus on early Friday morning. It made sense. A Thursday vote would've been too ambitious for a several-thousand page piece of legislation that came out Wednesday around 8 p.m.\n\nTHAT'S CERTAINLY NOT HOW Republicans promised to run the House. But things change. Republicans now seem to be interested in VOTING TODAY. Let's be clear: a vote on a 2,000-page bill is coming up less than 24 hours after it was posted. Of course, that's subject to change too. AS OF NOW, the House is planning to hold their votes around 10:15 a.m. and be done for the day around 1:30 p.m.!\n\n-- THIS WOULD GIVE the Senate a little more than a day to clear the package. Of course, a RAND PAUL filibuster would throw the whole schedule off course. We expect the bill to clear both chambers with a very healthy margain.\n\nSITUATIONAL AWARENESS: Republicans are launching a moderately risky gambit here. They're giving themselves 48 hours to get a massive bill through the House and Senate. Yes, it's expected to pass with wide bipartisan margins. But that doesn't mean things can't go awry.\n\nLAWMAKERS are traveling to the late Rep. Louise Slaughter's funeral in Rochester, New York, Friday morning. They are going on a military aircraft.

                "title": "The Former College Dropout Who Would Be Dianne Feinstein",
                "body": "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Fourteen people and three rescue cats were awaiting Kevin de León when he pulled up to a PetSmart and stepped inside through drizzling rain. In his briefing folder, an aide had included a note titled, \"Cat puns you can use, if you're feeling festive!\" De León hit nearly all of them. \"Meow is the time,\" he told the members of Kitty Devore Rescue, describing himself as an \"alley cat.\" Grateful for de León's attention, a woman beamed back at him, \"Someone knows our name!\"\n\nIt had been two weeks since de León impressed a crowd on a more brightly lit stage. In a coup at the California Democratic Party's annual convention last month, de León -- until Wednesday the Democratic leader of California's state Senate -- deprived Dianne Feinstein of her own party's endorsement by outpolling the state's senior senator by 17 percentage points in the delegate vote. Although de León fell short of the 60 percent threshold necessary to claim the party's backing himself, he embarrassed Feinstein and put a California institution on her heels.\n\nFor de León and his supporters, the convention marked a turning point not only in his quixotic campaign to unseat Feinstein, but also in a generational struggle among Democrats in the nation's most populous state. For decades, Feinstein and her centrist brand of politics have appeared as immovable as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and California's fourth-term governor, Jerry Brown. For once, a restless, more progressive class of Democrats had unsteadied the establishment. De León skewers Feinstein for her moderation and depicts her as unfit to battle President Donald Trump. He is also testing the muscle of the nation's newly emboldened left.\n\n\"Time's up!\" de León's supporters chanted as Feinstein left the convention stage. Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist and Democratic megadonor who once considered challenging Feinstein himself, described the contest on MSNBC as \"incrementalism versus visionary thinking in the Democratic Party.\"\n\nYet if de León's success at the convention showed the power of the Democratic Party's left flank, the days that followed have laid bare its limitations. A champion of progressive causes in Sacramento, de León is largely unknown statewide. Typical of state lawmakers, despite his outsize influence crafting state law, de León's plight outside the capital is jarring anonymity. Calls he places to prospective donors go to voicemail, and the checks he does receive are small.\n\nWatching de León campaigning between displays of DentaStix and turkey-and-sweet-potato dog food, state Sen. Josh Newman, a colleague of de León and a representative from the area, turned and said, \"What is it, 9 in the morning on a rainy Saturday? And he's out talking to cat people.\" Newman took that as a positive sign. It wasn't long before the 2008 presidential election, Newman said, that \"Barack Obama was speaking to crowds of, like, eight.\"\n\nLeaving the PetSmart, de León climbed into the passenger seat of a staffer's Honda Odyssey for two more campaign stops and 12 hours on the road.\n\n***\n\nThe odds against de León are so overwhelming that when Sara Nichols, a retired environmental attorney, begged him to challenge Feinstein at a fundraiser in Los Angeles a year ago, she recalled him telling her: \"It's a suicide mission. I'm not going to do it.\" Now, heading north from Santa Ana to Santa Barbara on California's coastal Highway 101, de León put it this way: \"Hard as hell? Yes!\" before adding, \"But things have always been hard for me.\"\n\nDe León, 51, says he spent part of his childhood living with his mother and sisters in a basement with a bathroom up a flight of stairs outside. He would ride the bus with his immigrant mother from San Diego's Logan Heights to her jobs cleaning houses in wealthier neighborhoods. He was the first member of his family to graduate from high school and the first to attend college, at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He then became the first to flunk out. \"I was embarrassed to go back home,\" he said. \"I didn't know what I was going to tell my mom.\"\n\nSo de León stayed in Santa Barbara, going to work for a nonprofit that taught English to immigrants in preparation for their citizenship exams. He bounced checks at a local restaurant and slept on a floor in his office, he said, showering with water that he heated on a hot plate.\n\n\"I was completely oblivious as to what he was doing, and I was very confused by it,\" says San Jose Vice Mayor Magdalena Carrasco, de León's former girlfriend and the mother of his now-grown daughter. \"Who does that? You're supposed to be studying, and you're supposed to be having fun, and you're supposed to be hanging out with the boys.\"\n\nInstead, said Carrasco, who remains close to de León, \"He was hanging out with all the older women who were cleaning the dorms, and he was teaching them English, and he was helping them get ready for their U.S. citizenship classes.\"\n\nDe León went on to work as a labor organizer, and in 1994 he helped organize a massive protest against Proposition 187 -- the voter initiative, later overturned by the courts, that barred undocumented immigrants from receiving certain public services. Years later, he graduated with honors from Pitzer College in Claremont. And after defeating a granddaughter of the late labor leader Cesar Chavez to win a seat in the California State Assembly in 2006, he went on to amass a string of legislative victories on liberal causes from climate change to gun control to wage and labor law.\n\nBut it was the election of Trump that gave de León a platform from which to run for higher office, drawing national media attention -- if not widespread name recognition -- as a principal combatant in California's Democratic resistance to the president. After Trump's election, de León pressed for state money to provide legal assistance to immigrants facing deportation, and he introduced California's so-called sanctuary state legislation, which limits local law enforcement officials' ability to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The headlines kept coming this year, when de León responded to the Republican tax overhaul in Washington by introducing state legislation seeking to give California taxpayers an end run around new limits on the state and local income tax deduction.\n\nAfter spending much of the past year passing -- and now defending -- the \"sanctuary state\" bill, de León says he recoiled when Feinstein suggested at a public forum last year that Trump, given time, could become a \"good president.\"\n\n\"That was a very powerful statement to make that violated the values I abide,\" he said, pointing to tracts of strawberry fields where he once recruited English learners for his classes outside of Santa Barbara. \"You can't ask Dreamers to have patience. You can't ask a hard-working immigrant mother who's fearful of being detained and deported to have patience, who's been here for decades to have patience. You can't ask someone who is a beneficiary of health care to have patience. You can't ask those who suffer disproportionately from climate change and the harmful effects of toxic pollution to have patience. That comment, I believe, runs strongly contrary to the values of who we are as a great state. And that's when I actually started thinking about it for the first time.\"\n\nNow, sprinting across the state from one small crowd to another, de León paints Feinstein as a creature of Washington out of touch with California's younger, more progressive electorate. He criticizes her support for the Iraq War and the PATRIOT Act, and for her skeptical view of single-payer health care. And though he scrupulously avoids mentioning her age directly -- at 84, she is the Senate's oldest member -- his frequent praise for her \"decades of service\" appears designed to make the point.\n\n\"I do believe this is a campaign of vastly different values,\" de León says. \"You know, I respect her service to California and the nation, but the state has changed dramatically in the past quarter-century, and it requires, I believe, a new voice that carries the values of California today, not yesterday.\"\n\nDe León's politics -- and his circumstances -- diverge sharply from those of Feinstein, one of the wealthiest members of Congress. He does not own a house, and his investments include stocks worth no more than $40,000, according to financial disclosures filed this month. In the home he rents in Mount Washington, in northeast Los Angeles, two hammocks hang across the room from a chess board and a weight bench that he uses when he finds time. His favorite suit has holes in its lining. For a \"bad stretch\" during the campaign, de León says, he was eating at In-N-Out Burger every night.\n\nTwelve years after de León defeated her in his first legislative campaign, Christine Chavez, Cesar Chavez's granddaughter, says she likely will vote for him.\n\n\"I just think he really sticks his neck out there when not so many people are willing to be as bold as he is, when he's talking about protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants, protecting Dreamers,\" she told me. However, she says, \"You need money to run ads on TV, and you need money to get your message out there.\"\n\n***\n\nWhile De León's thumping of Feinstein at the state party convention startled many in Washington, it was not unexpected by most political observers in California. Feinstein has long maintained a tenuous relationship with the party's most progressive activists, and she lost the state party endorsement once before, to John Van de Kamp, when she ran for California governor in 1990.\n\nBut state party conventions reflect a more fervent class of Democrats than exists within the party statewide. In that broader landscape, Feinstein remains stalwart, outpolling de León 42 percent to 16 percent among likely California voters, according to a poll released Wednesday by the Public Policy Institute of California. As one woman put it to de León at an event in Santa Barbara, to vote against Feinstein -- after marking ballots for her for decades -- seems \"counterintuitive.\"\n\nDe León has secured endorsements from two politically powerful unions, the Service Employees International Union and the California Nurses Association, and he may benefit from getting to run against Feinstein twice: Because of California's unusual top-two primary rules, he and Feinstein are each likely to advance from the June primary to face each other a second time, in a runoff in November. But de León's fundraising to date is concerning not only to de León's supporters, but also to the candidate himself. Feinstein held close to $10 million in cash on hand at the end of last year, while de León reported raising just $500,000.\n\nTold by an aide following an event in Santa Barbara that a supporter had cut a $50 check, de León's eyes grew wide and he responded enthusiastically, \"Are you serious?\"\n\nWhen de León made a brief round of fundraising calls on the road to his next appearance, no one answered. \"Therein lies the challenge,\" he said. \"When I talk to folks, they say 'I'm voting for you.' But I don't have the money to get the message out.\"\n\nWhen I asked him why his prospective donors aren't answering his calls, he smiled and said, \"Because they love me, but they don't know if I can win.\"\n\nFabian Núñez, California's former Assembly speaker and a childhood friend of de León, says it has frustrated de León that, after serving as president of the state Senate, \"still people in California don't know who he is.\"\n\n\"That's a real frustration,\" Núñez says. \"I think he expected more people would know him.\" On the other hand, Núñez says, \"he's banging the drums so loudly now, they are starting to take notice.\" He added, \"If people knew him -- if he's able to get out there and build that contrast between him and her -- then I think he can win.\"\n\nDe León has proved adept -- and tireless -- at cultivating the news media. He rises early for cable TV hits, returns reporters' telephone calls and is a reliable fount of rhetoric lambasting Trump. On the evening this month that Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced his lawsuit against California's \"sanctuary state\" legislation, de León fielded calls while collecting Carrasco's son from a track event. In the middle of talking about the Department of Justice's record in court against the state (\"I like our odds\"), de León interrupted himself as he steered his Toyota Camry around a neighborhood in San Jose. \"Where is this kid?\" he said.\n\nFor her part, Feinstein has been largely dismissive of de León. De León cannot run for reelection to his current seat because of term limits, and Feinstein's longtime campaign adviser, Bill Carrick, said of de León's U.S. Senate candidacy, \"Oh, please ... He's a termed-out politician looking for a gig.\" Of all the races he could have entered -- for governor or lieutenant governor or any other statewide office -- Carrick said, \"This is probably the biggest challenge he could have taken on.\"\n\nEven so, Feinstein's allies have started to chip away at de León. Christine Pelosi, the chairwoman of the California Democratic Party's Women's Caucus and the daughter of the House minority leader, regularly criticizes him for his handling of a sexual harassment scandal in the state legislature that has led to the resignation of two Assembly members and one senator, Tony Mendoza, in whose house de León previously stayed while working in Sacramento. Pelosi has said legislative leaders should have done more to investigate complaints and shield victims from reprisals, while de León said he was \"really proud\" about procedural changes the legislature made to address sexual harassment in recent months.\n\nDe León says the scandal won't present a political problem for his Senate run. \"They've politicized it,\" he says. \"We understand what they're going to do.\"\n\nIf his campaign takes flight, de León's critics are likely to grow louder. Days after de León's convention performance, former state Treasurer Phil Angelides, labor icon Dolores Huerta and a handful of other Feinstein supporters formed a super PAC to back Feinstein in her reelection bid. Angelides, a former state party chairman, advised Democrats to focus instead on \"taking back the House and the Senate.\"\n\nStill, Angelides acknowledged the winds that de León is hoping to ride. \"There's a tremendous amount of restlessness in the country,\" he said. \"There's a lot of tumult. Our politics right now are in a sense turned upside down.\"\n\nIf de León falls short, he could run for mayor of Los Angeles or for another statewide office. He says he'll \"cross that bridge\" if he has to in November. But on this day, he had come to San Luis Obispo, where he stood on a stage with red, white and blue bunting, and looked down at a crowd of about 100 people inside a community hall. The city's mayor, Heidi Harmon, introduced de León as the \"next United States senator from California and professional thorn in the side of the federal government.\" People were cheering, just like at the convention.\n\nLeaving town for the long drive back to Los Angeles, de León turned up Morrissey and sang along, tapping his phone on his knee, \"The more you ignore me, the closer I get.\" He was yawning, but he offered to drive.",

                "title": "Cambridge Analytica boss went from 'aromatics' to psyops to Trump's campaign ",
                "body": "While Alexander Nix draws headlines for his role in the Trump 2016 digital operation, his colorful business partner Nigel Oakes may be an equally important figure.\n\nLong before the political data firm he oversees, Cambridge Analytica, helped Donald Trump become president, Nigel Oakes tried a very different form of influencing human behavior. It was called \"marketing aromatics,\" or the use of smells to make consumers spend more money.\n\nIn the decades since, the Eton-educated British businessman has styled himself as an expert on a wide variety of \"mind-bending\" techniques -- from scents to psychological warfare to campaign politics.\n\nBut some 25 years after his foray into aromatics, a bad odor has arisen around his use of data to influence voter behavior. Oakes and his partners, who include Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, are under intense scrutiny over their methods in the 2016 campaign, including the alleged improper use of Facebook data. Some news reports have also found links to Russia that the company has downplayed.\n\nOakes and the company he co-founded in 2005 along with Nix, SCL Group, have now drawn the interest of congressional officials. Three Republican senators wrote Oakes a letter this week requesting information and a briefing related to Facebook's sudden suspension last Friday of Cambridge Analytica, which is a closely affiliated subsidiary of SCL.\n\nThe request -- from Senate Commerce Committee members John Thune (R-S.D.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Jerry Moran, (R-Kan.) -- came after recent allegations that Cambridge Analytica used inappropriately harvested private Facebook data on nearly 50 million users and exploited the information to assist President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nBut that has triggered wider questions about whether Cambridge Analytica, whose board once included former Trump political strategist Steve Bannon, could have played some role in the Kremlin's scheme to manipulate U.S. social media in 2016. The company denies that.\n\nCaptured on an undercover video by Britain's Channel 4 News, Nix boasted that the firm \"did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting,\" for the Trump campaign, adding that \"our data informed all the strategy.\" (Trump officials call that an exaggeration.)\n\nAdding to the concern is the role of Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-born researcher at Cambridge University who collected the Facebook data without disclosing that it would be used commercially, and who was also working for a university in St. Petersburg Russia at the time. Cambridge Analytica also reportedly discussed a business relationship in 2014 and 2015 with the the Kremlin-connected Russian oil giant Lukoil, which expressed interest in how data is used to target American voters, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe recent flurry of coverage has barely mentioned the 55-year-old Oakes, a virtual unknown in the U.S. but more familiar in Great Britain, in part because of his relationship in the 1990s with a member of the royal Windsor family.\n\nBut data analytics experts described Oakes as a hidden hand running both SCL and Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\"Anyone right now that is focusing on the problems with Cambridge Analytica should be backtracking to the source, which is Nigel Oakes,\" said Sam Woolley, research director of the Digital Intelligence Lab at the Silicon Valley-based Institute for the Future.\n\n\"My research has shown that Cambridge Analytica is the tip of the iceberg of Nigel Oakes' empire of psy-ops and information ops around the world,\" said Woolley, whose research aims to help protect democracy from the nefarious use of rapidly evolving communications technology. \"As you start to dig into that, you find out a lot of very concerning things.\"\n\nWoolley said he attended a Cambridge Analytica \"meet-up\" in April 2016 during the New York presidential primary in New York. At the time, the company was working for another candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and gave a wide-ranging overview of their activities, Woolley said.\n\nIt was clear from the session that the two companies are completely intertwined, Woolley said. He recalled that Cambridge Analytica leaders \"conflated all of their work with SCL's work,\" including in several overseas elections. Based on his ongoing research, he described the two firms as selling \"political marketing to the highest bidder, whether you're in government, the military or politics, even authoritarian\" regimes.\n\nOakes and SCL Group did not return calls seeking comment through a spokesperson.\n\nSCL Group -- like its predecessor, Strategic Communication Laboratories, which Oakes co-founded in 1993 -- is no stranger to controversies related to foreign elections, including in connection with alleged dirty tricks it has allegedly employed on behalf of political clients from Europe to Africa and Asia.\n\nThe company also made headlines in 2005 when it billed itself at a global arms fair in London as the first private company to provide psychological warfare services, or \"psyops,\" to the British military.\n\nAt the time, Oakes, as chief executive, said he was confident that psyops could shorten military conflicts and that governments would buy such a service, which SCL had provided commercially.\n\n\"We used to be in the business of mind-bending for political purposes,\" he told a reporter, \"but now we are in the business of saving lives.'\n\nThose who know Oakes, or know of him, are somewhat skeptical.\n\nOne private investigator said the company is known to have done extensive work for the U.S. military and other government agencies against targets including Iran. SCL got its start in the U.S. by selling the same psychological warfare product as it did to the British, including manipulation of elections and \"perception management,\" or the intentional spread of fake news.\n\nThe State Department confirmed to Defense One this week that it retains SCL Group on a contract to \"provide research and analytical support in connection with our mission to counter terrorist propaganda and disinformation overseas.\"\n\nCompany literature describes some of SCL's services, besides \"psychological warfare,\" as \"influence operations\" and \"public diplomacy.\"\n\nAbsent from such descriptions is some of the more bombastic rhetoric of Oakes' youth.\n\n\"We use the same techniques as Aristotle and Hitler,\" he told an interviewer in 1992. \"We appeal to people on an emotional level to get them to agree on a functional level.\"\n\nOn its website, SCL Group does not highlight its connections to Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\"Our vision is to be the premier provider of data analytics and strategy for behavior change,\" the website says.\n\n\"Our mission is to create behavior change through research, data, analytics, and strategy for both domestic and international government clients.\"\n\nBut Oakes and his company have a history of secrecy, making the hidden-camera footage of Nix all the more shocking. In the footage aired by Channel 4, Nix appears to tell a journalist posing as a potential client that the company could, for instance, send Ukrainian sex workers to an opponent's house to sabotage him.\n\nSCL Group said it has suspended Nix while it investigates, and several U.S. lawmakers cited the reports in saying that they want to call him back before committees investigating Russian meddling to answer more questions.\n\nOne British journalist who has investigated the two companies and their leaders also suggested that the real trail of questions leads to Oakes.\n\n\"Alexander Nix has been suspended from a shell company that has no employees and no assets,\" said Carole Cadwalladr of The Observer, who authored last weekend's exposé, and others. \"If you think this ends here, think again.\"\n\nThe letter from the three senators -- which they also sent to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- asked Oakes whether he acknowledges the conduct described in a Facebook's statement announcing the suspension of Nix's account, and those of both SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIt also asks him to provide information about whether he was aware of other activity by Cambridge that Facebook said led to the suspension, including how it accessed the data in question and whether it falsely certified that it had destroyed it at Facebook's request.\n\n\"Consumers rely on app developers to be transparent and truthful in their terms of service so consumers can make informed decisions about whether to consent to the sharing and use of their data,\" the senators wrote. \"Therefore, the allegation that SCL was not forthcoming with Facebook or transparent with consumers is troubling.\"\n\nThe senators reminded Oakes that their committee has jurisdiction over the Internet and communications technologies generally, as well as over consumer protection and data privacy issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats who have been investigating Russian election interference and suspected collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign are expressing heightened interest in Oakes's company, though for now their focus is primarily on Nix.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday on MSNBC that he was particularly concerned about Nix's comments, captured by Channel 4, about how he got off easy during his interview with Congress.\n\n\"The Republicans asked three questions. Five minutes, done,\" Nix said. And while the Democrats asked two hours of questions, Nix said he didn't have to answer them because \"it's voluntary.\"\n\nSchiff said Wednesday he wants Nix to come back and testify as well as witnesses the committee Democrats wanted to interview.\n\n\"We didn't get the information that we needed and in light of these whistleblower allegations there are serious questions about the truthfulness of Mr. Nix's testimony,\" Schiff said.\n\n\"We ought to bring Alexander Nix back and quite frankly the other Cambridge Analytica witnesses that had been on our witness list. Still a lot of questions.\"",

                "title": "House leaders' biggest 2018 fear: The lazy Republican",
                "body": "GOP members who haven't had a tough race in years are being warned to start running scared.\n\nOn paper, Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) appears to be a shoo-in for reelection. He's served nine terms in what's been a GOP stronghold for decades, hasn't had a serious challenger in years and sits on one of the most powerful committees in Congress.\n\nBut Culberson's suburban-Houston district went for Hillary Clinton by 1 percentage point in 2016. And when GOP leaders found out last year that he was being outraised by Democrats and barely had a campaign staff, they were exasperated.\n\nGet your act together, they warned Culberson in so many words, according to sources familiar with the dressing-down.\n\nCulberson's slow start to his reelection campaign is what GOP leaders fear most heading into the thick of the midterm elections: incumbents who haven't seen a real race in years snoozing as a Democratic wave builds. Speaker Paul Ryan and the National Republican Congressional Committee are less concerned about their battle-tested swing-district members -- who face tough races every election cycle -- and more worried about complacent Republicans not prepared for a fight.\n\n\"This is a very tough environment for Republicans. If you're getting outraised or if you haven't started your campaign yet, you need to be scared and start today,\" said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Ryan-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund. \"Saying 'I've never lost before, therefore I can never lose this time' is not a campaign plan.\"\n\nIt's one of the reasons Ryan's political team and NRCC officials have started holding a series of meetings with lawmakers from traditionally reliable GOP districts. Their message: Get ready for a roller coaster and begin your campaign in earnest now.\n\nIt's too early to tell whether leadership's message is registering. More than 40 GOP incumbents were outraised by Democratic challengers during the last three months of 2017, a staggering number that senior Republicans said is unacceptable and amounts to nothing short of laziness.\n\nBut GOP leaders aren't satisfied there won't be more John Micas. The iconic former Transportation Committee chairman literally laughed at the notion that his Democratic challenger in 2016, Stephanie Murphy, would beat him -- until it was too late.\n\nRepublicans blamed the loss on his blasé approach.\n\nOther lawmakers in swing districts have been through this before. They don't need to be warned about taking victory for granted.\n\n\"I've had three very tough races in a row, been a top target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and so I think I'm well defined to the electorate,\" said Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), who represents a tossup suburban Denver district. But for any Republican from a safer district who \"hasn't had a fight,\" he continued, \"it could be turned into a competitive situation.\"\n\n\"Many of our members have not been in Congress during a possible 'wave' election cycle, as happened in 2006 and 2010,\" added a Republican campaign staffer. \"Members in Republican-leaning districts should heed the warnings from House leadership and get ready for a fight.\"\n\nRep. Glenn Grothman's team is another office that's received a talking-to. Ryan is personally helping campaign for the Wisconsin Republican, who hasn't had a competitive race since he was elected in 2014. His sprawling district partly abutting Lake Michigan has been a Republican stronghold since the 1960s. But Grothman now faces a wealthy Democratic challenger who's planning to spend hundreds of thousands of his own money on the race.\n\nGrothman acknowledged in an interview the battle he's in for and said he's doing \"100 percent\" what he can to prepare. The 62-year-old former attorney pulled up his schedule on his phone and read a list of constituent events: a fish fry, a bowl-a-thon, some St. Patrick's Day parades and Lincoln Day dinners.\n\n\"Obviously, that's a bigger problem than the typical year,\" Grothman said of his Democratic challenger, Dan Kohl, the nephew of former Milwaukee Bucks owner and ex-Sen. Herb Kohl. \"I'll raise more money, I think, because there's more a necessity. ... My opponent has a lot of money, and he's telling people he's going to spend a lot of money ... so it's concerning.\"\n\nRep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) also hails from a solid Republican district but is facing a well-funded Democratic opponent who last quarter raked in over $100,000 more than the incumbent. His staff, like Grothman's, has been warned to be ready -- particularly because Pittenger is still introducing himself to constituents after a recent redistricting changed his district's borders.\n\nAnother North Carolinian on GOP leaders' radar is freshman Rep. Ted Budd. His well-connected Democratic opponent, philanthropist Kathy Manning, raised $564,000 last quarter, compared to his $183,000 haul.\n\nBudd said he realizes \"the environment is tough this year,\" and he just hired a campaign manager who will start next month.\n\nRyan's political executive director, Kevin Seifert, and deputy executive director, Jake Kastan, are handling many of the reality-check meetings with incumbent Republicans or their staffs. While Ryan's team often helps incumbents, it's hosting more meetings than usual, and with a greater sense of urgency.\n\nRyan and NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) have also delivered the same message to lawmakers in conference gatherings in recent weeks: Raise money now, be active in your districts, find legislative issues that resonate with constituents and tout your accomplishments constantly. Also, define yourself and your opponent early, and label Democrats as obstructionists.\n\n\"When you have a million dollars spent attacking [GOP lawmakers] for the first time, a lot can change, and quickly,\" Bliss said.\n\nThe warnings from leadership aides are also expected to extend to a handful of Freedom Caucus members who typically feel safe enough to vote with the far right of the House Republican Conference -- if they haven't already. Three Democratic opponents of caucus member Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) outraised him in the last fundraising quarter, two of them by $100,000.\n\nGarrett's district elected a Democrat to the House in 2008, before a Republican reclaimed the seat two years later. And Garrett's conservative votes could make him more susceptible in a Democratic wave year, senior Republicans said.\n\nDitto, they said, for Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), another Freedom Caucus member, who upset former Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary.\n\nBrat declined to discuss his campaign with POLITICO; two Democratic opponents collected more than him in the final three months of 2017 -- including one by nearly $150,000.\n\n\"Policy, policy, policy,\" Brat said when asked about his reelection effort. \"All I talk is policy.\"\n\nAt least one Republican, Culberson, appears to have heeded the warnings from leadership, aides say. He has hired new staff and outraised his Democratic opponents in the last quarter of 2017, though in the first six weeks of this year, his top two competitors collected more money than him, according to campaign filings.\n\n\"I'm always ready,\" Culberson in a brief interview this week, \"and even more so this year.\"",

                "title": "How Trump Is Just Like Bill Clinton",
                "body": "Trump's tactics on Stormy Daniels are almost indistinguishable from the 42nd president's.\n\nStormy Daniels could have stepped right out of the 1990s.\n\nShe would have been a natural in a Bill Clinton scandal, and, in fact, all the same means would have been used against her.\n\nDonald Trump's tactics in these cases are almost indistinguishable from the Clintons'. The effort to shut down the accusers, the unconvincing denials, the legal maneuvering, the sleazy fixers, the media allies trying to sweep it under the rug -- it's all there.\n\nThat Daniels finally broke into the news cycle a few weeks ago is actually a step toward normality in the Trump era. Prior to that, it was downright bizarre that a sex scandal involving a porn star got overshadowed by other mediagenic outrages.\n\nBut now Daniels is firmly on the agenda. It helps that there is a legal fight -- she wants out of her nondisclosure agreement -- which gives the media the excuse to cover it like all it cares about are the finer points of contract law, when the appeal of it is obviously a freaking porn star fighting it out with the president of the United States.\n\nThe legal battle, and that of former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal (seeking an exit from her agreement with the publisher of the National Enquirer giving it exclusive rights to her story of a Trump affair), doesn't seem complicated. You don't get to sign an NDA or an agreement selling exclusive rights to your story, and then turn around and get out of it when it no longer suits you.\n\nOf course, the effort to buy their stories in the first place speaks volumes. There was no reason for Trump fixer Michael Cohen to spend $130,000 of his own money -- or $130,000 of Trump's -- to silence a random porn star making up a ludicrous fantasy about his boss. A simple denial would have sufficed and been more in keeping with Trump's parsimony.\n\nEven if Trump's side wins the legal battles, Daniels and McDougal have, in effect, found ways around their agreements by making such a stink about them. The point of an NDA is supposed to be that no one knows about the NDA. Typically, the subject of an NDA doesn't promote a tour of strip clubs based on the affair she was supposed to not disclose, while her lawyer becomes a cable TV star.\n\nTrump's best strategy in all of this would be one easy sentence: \"I've done things I'm not proud of.\"\n\nIt would have the advantage of being true, of acknowledging what everyone knows, and of not delving into the details of any particular allegations while allowing everyone around him to revert back to this statement. Look, the president has already said there are things he regrets in his past -- next question.\n\nStanding in the way of such a simple out is Trump's M.O. of never giving an inch in favor of no-holds-barred legal combat (Daniels will owe $20 million in damages!), perhaps the worry that any show of weakness will encourage other women to come forward, and, presumably, the personal element.\n\nHow would a semi-confession affect Melania Trump? Compared with Hillary Clinton, who was part of her husband's political operation and participated in his defense against female accusers, she is an innocent bystander. The first lady surely knew she wasn't marrying Mitt Romney, but she didn't sign up for the daily humiliating reminders that her husband probably cheated on her.\n\nAs the governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton wasn't the celebrity that Trump was, so he had to settle with dalliances with Little Rock lounge singers and low-level government workers -- porn stars and playmates were out of his reach. But the basic picture is the same.\n\nStormy Daniels is Trump's Gennifer Flowers. Summer Zervos, the former \"Apprentice\" contestant suing Trump for defamation, could be his Paula Jones, if she actually gets him embroiled in civil litigation. What Trump lacks is a Monica Lewinsky to drag all of this into the present. It was Clinton's affair with a White House intern and his lies about it under oath that transformed his scandals from lurid distractions to all-consuming national scandal and the occasion for his impeachment.\n\nThat's a significant difference and something that Trump's evangelical supporters can hang their hat on. Almost all of them know that Trump is not, and has never pretended to be, a paragon of virtue. Their calculation now is the same as it was in the general election -- the alternative to Trump is a disaster on every policy front, so stay close to nurse for fear of something worse.\n\nThe cost is a tawdry spectacle that they scorned 20 years ago and is now part of the scenery of their own side.",

                "body": "The House of Representatives passed on party lines Wednesday evening a bill designed to let very sick patients request access to experimental medicines without government oversight.\n\nThe passage of the bill, known as right-to-try, is a big victory for the small libertarian think tank that crafted the proposal -- and for a White House that has vigorously campaigned for the law. And it comes one week after Republicans failed to pass a similar measure through an expedited process that needed two-thirds support from the chamber.\n\nThe bill passed by a vote of 267-149 with 35 Democrats in favor and two Republicans against. It now heads to the Senate, which passed a slightly different version of the legislation last summer. With a final law all but assured, health policy advocates who have vigorously opposed the idea are now looking toward the broader anti-regulatory health agenda being pushed by the Goldwater Institute.\n\nArizona-based Goldwater has a handful of other ideas that could dramatically weaken the authority of the FDA to oversee the safety and effectiveness of medicines and has already made progress getting one of those ideas -- giving drug companies more freedom to market their products -- on state lawmakers' agenda. Goldwater spearheaded passage of a law in Arizona's legislature last year that allows companies to promote non-FDA-approved uses of their products to doctors without fear of repercussions by state officials. It helped get similar bills introduced in Colorado and Missouri's legislative sessions this year and expects other states to follow suit soon.\n\nSome are concerned that Goldwater could be emboldened by the right-to-try success.\n\n\"I think this is the first step, for sure. Tear down as many regulations as possible, take away all oversight, and let it be the Wild West of medicine,\" said Andrew McFadyen, executive director of the rare disease patient group Issac Foundation and a member of New York University's working group on compassionate use and pre-approval access.\n\n\"Republicans know this doesn't give access to patients. But they opened the door to Koch brothers and Goldwater to rip apart the FDA, and then other government bodies after that,\" McFadyen added.\n\nThe victory also highlights the success of Goldwater's strategy of pushing legislation state-by-state -- 38 states have approved -- and using that momentum to take it to the national level, said Christopher Robertson, an expert on health law and bioethics at the University of Arizona.\n\nIt's \"easy for them to bend the ear of local politicians,\" Robertson said, and \"even if the state legislation is completely ineffectual it does present one symbolic victory after the next.\" Moreover, the average state legislator doesn't need to understand the intricacies of FDA law, making it easier for Goldwater to sway state lawmakers. Besides drug marketing, Robertson said pushing to get more medicines available over the counter, without a doctor's prescription, is also on the libertarian group's agenda.\n\nSenate Majority leader Mitch McConnell's office declined to provide any guidance on if and when the Senate might consider the House proposal, but the chamber is expected to eventually pass the House bill.\n\nThe Senate cleared its version of right-to-try over the summer on unanimous consent. But it stalled in the House due to concerns from patient advocacy groups, bioethicists, drug companies and President Donald Trump's own FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb.\n\nAfter months of deliberation, the House released an updated version last week with tweaks designed to make it safer for patients and encourage more drug companies to participate -- but Democrats continued to oppose the bill, arguing it wouldn't help more patients to get access to experimental medicines and could cause them harm.\n\nWith the GOP attempting to pass it under an expedited process requiring a two-thirds vote, Democrats sank the bill last week, knowing full well that it would pass easily when brought back under regular procedures requiring a simple majority for passage.\n\nTrump, who called for swift passage of the bill during the State of the Union in January, called out Democrats for stalling the legislation at a speech Monday in New Hampshire.\n\n\"It is hope. It's incredible. They've been talking about this for years and years and years. We're going to get it approved. So important,\" Trump said.\n\nBut Democrats continued to push back against the law Wednesday. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said right-to-try doesn't address the true barrier facing patients requesting experimental drugs -- resistance from drug companies -- and thus offers patients little more than \"false hope.\"\n\n\"The fact is when a patient is denied access to an experiential treatment, it is because a company has said no, not the FDA. So let's be clear about what this legislation is. It's an attempt to undermine the authority of the expert public health agencies charged with reviewing drugs to ensure their safety and efficacy,\" Pallone said during House debate of the bill.\n\nPallone's argument got a boost from four former FDA commissioners who served under Republican and Democratic presidents. Margaret Hamburg, Robert Califf, Mark McClellan and Andrew von Eschenbach issued a statement earlier this week saying \"there is no evidence\" that either the House or Senate right-to-try bills \"would meaningfully improve access for patients, but both would remove the FDA from the process and create a dangerous precedent that would erode protections for vulnerable patients,\"\n\nUltimately, Republicans' messaging won the day.\n\n\"It's not false hope; It is hope. Support of this bill is compassionate. Support of this bill is fair,\" said Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), one of the original sponsors of the House legislation.",

                "title": "Is Bruce Rauner toast?",
                "body": "The Illinois Republican was already the most endangered governor in the nation. Then came a disastrous primary.\n\nIn the span of one day, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's fortunes went from bad to worse. He was already widely considered to be the most vulnerable incumbent governor in the country. Then came Tuesday's Illinois primary, where he spent $17 million in TV ads but barely squeaked out a victory against a nearly unknown state legislator.\n\nWith Democrats already uniting behind the free-spending billionaire who will lead their ticket in the fall, Illinois Republicans are wondering: After Tuesday's weak showing, does Rauner even have a prayer of winning reelection in November?\n\nThe day after the primary, Jeanne Ives, the conservative state lawmaker Rauner defeated 51 percent to 49 percent, didn't seem to think so.\n\nShe wasn't showing any signs the two would put their differences behind them.\n\n\"I really don't care to say anything to the governor, quite frankly,\" Ives said in a conversation with conservative radio show host Dan Proft, a strategist in her campaign. \"He's unelectable in 2018. He has destroyed the Republican Party brand ... He's a lame duck governor at this point.\"\n\nPart of Rauner's predicament is the solidly blue state he governs -- his reelection was never going to be easy, especially in a state where polls show Donald Trump is deeply unpopular. But Rauner also opened up a deep divide within the Republican Party by signing bills that alienated conservatives -- among them, measures supporting abortion rights, enacting immigration protections and making it possible for transgender individuals to change their sex on birth certificates.\n\nThose fissures showed in the primary voting results, with Ives not only beating Rauner in many conservative strongholds in southern Illinois, but also in suburban and exurban areas the governor won easily in 2014, including DuPage, McHenry, Will and Kane counties.\n\nPat Brady, former Illinois GOP chairman who has long supported Rauner, said the governor knows the kind of party rebuilding that's ahead of him.\n\n\"As he said last night, he acknowledged that 'hey, I heard the message.' It's a close race. I think he got it. I don't think he's tried to be anything that he's not,\" said Brady. \"In a close race like that, he's got to take pause and figure it out.\"\n\nRauner's first order of business is stitching the broken party back together. But the day after the primary, Rauner and Ives were still squabbling over who should have called whom the night before. Ives remained peeved the governor took the stage to claim victory before the two had spoken.\n\n\"Why would she talk to him after the disrespect he showed last night announcing victory before all of the counties were in -- without a call to the campaign, after he poured millions of dollars into an attack campaign that flat-out lied about her, and after he dispatched his slimy operatives to the media last night to disparage Ives, her campaign and all of her conservative supporters?\" said Ives spokeswoman Kathleen Murphy, in an email. \"She has no reason to believe or trust anything he says.\"\n\nRauner spokesman Will Allison suggested it was the governor who was waiting for a call.\n\n\"She never called last night,\" Allison said. \"Our team has reached out to their team to set up a call.\"\n\nA fractured Republican Party is only part of Rauner's predicament. He now faces billionaire J.B. Pritzker, who just spent $70 million in the Democratic primary without a second thought. It was a high-turnout but relatively low-conflict affair, with Pritzker showing strength up and down the state -- he won 98 of 102 counties, a testament to his robust statewide campaign infrastructure.\n\nOn Wednesday Pritzker told POLITICO that both of his top opponents, state Sen. Daniel Biss and Chris Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy's son, have already told him they'd back him in the general election.\n\n\"It's clear that the Republican Party is completely divided and Democrats with a reasonably common message were able to bring out voters,\" Pritzker said.\n\nPritzker held his first general election news conference Wednesday with banners that read \"Rauner Failed\" -- and he had five people with him on stage to represent those who he said the governor had \"failed\" since taking office in 2015.\n\nFormer Rauner adviser and political strategist Lance Trover said the governor is certain to charge hard against the Democrat in short order. After all, Rauner had already spent millions of dollars in attack ads against Pritzker during the Democratic primary, bringing attention to Pritzker's unflattering conversations with former Gov. Rod Blagojevich that were caught on FBI wiretap.\n\n\"The governor clearly has a lot of work to do but what he cannot do is focus on the past,\" Trover said. \"He's going to have to look to what unites the party and for Bruce, that'll be [Democratic Party Chairman and state House Speaker] Mike Madigan...you've already seen it today, Bruce's message to voters will be: 'I am the only thing standing between you and Mike Madigan.'\"\n\nYet even as Rauner looks to tie Pritzker to the state's longtime Democratic party boss, Pritzker has his own bogeyman to exploit: Donald Trump. The president was defeated in Illinois in 2016 by nearly a million votes.\n\n\"I'm not going to let Donald Trump have an inch of Illinois. If Rauner is desperate he may engage with Donald Trump and invite him to help him,\" Pritzker said. \"He may need to bring his party together. But I think Bruce Rauner has already proven that he's like Donald Trump.\"",

                "title": "Lipinski win stings liberals",
                "body": "Some of them called the narrow defeat of their candidate, Marie Newman, a moral victory, and insisted there were no hard feelings.\n\nHouse Democrats are trying to hit the reset button a day after Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski eked out a win in a nasty primary battle that had several of his own colleagues publicly rooting for his defeat.\n\nLawmakers from the progressive and conservative wings of the party insisted on Wednesday there are no hard feelings after Lipinski's narrow triumph over his liberal challenger, Marie Newman.\n\nBut it's clear that some of the residual feelings about Lipinski's politics -- as an anti-abortion Democrat who has opposed marriage equality and Obamacare, he's one of the most conservative members of the caucus -- still linger.\n\nAnd the outside groups that sided with Newman, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, MoveOn and Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said the slim margin should send a signal to other Democrats that they're not backing down.\n\n\"This was a district where some of us as individuals decided to get involved,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \"I would like my husband and I to be considered equal by colleagues in our caucus.\"\n\nPocan is one of a half dozen House Democrats who endorsed Newman, a rare public rebuke of an incumbent from the same party.\n\nNow Democratic members insist they're trying to turn the page. In interviews Wednesday, lawmakers on both ends of the spectrum highlighted their embrace of apparent winner Conor Lamb, the conservative Democrat whose upset victory in Pennsylvania Trump country last week has energized the party.\n\nLamb was welcomed by the House Democratic Caucus with a standing ovation Wednesday and had trouble leaving the room as several members wanted to personally congratulate him.\n\nBut the Lipinski primary caused a nasty rift within the caucus as lawmakers publicly took sides in a race that became as much about the party's ongoing ideological messaging battle as the candidates themselves.\n\nLipinski, a co-chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition, represented moderate Democrats' efforts to carve out a home for themselves on social and economic issues in a party that continues to move steadily to the left.\n\nNewman embodied the liberal wing's emboldened effort to force the party to embrace a national progressive message, in line with the populist politics pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and a half dozen other Senate Democrats eyeing the White House.\n\nNewman supporters insist that Lipinski's victory, \"by the hair of his chiny chin chin,\" is proof that he's \"definitely not the future of the Democratic Party,\" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.\n\nLipinski beat Newman by a little more than 2,000 votes, or about 2.4 percentage points, according to the Associated Press, with some ballots left to be counted.\n\n\"People on the ground in Illinois' 3rd [congressional district] and nationally are willing to play the long game and say, 'We fell short, but change doesn't happen in one cycle,'\" Hogue said. \"We're not taking our ball and going home.\"\n\nWhat's less clear is how those bad feelings, exposed in the Illinois race, will manifest in the months ahead, as Democrats look to several crowded primaries in districts that are considered must-win if they want to take back the House.\n\nProgressive, pro-Newman groups have already waded into dozens of House Democratic primaries -- but not against other Democratic incumbents. NARAL has endorsed 28 House candidates, including Newman, while MoveOn hasn't yet endorsed more House candidates, but is still evaluating options, such as New Jersey's 2nd District.\n\nSpokesman Nick Berning said the group is watching the open seat, where state Sen. Jeff Van Drew, a conservative Democrat, entered the race after GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo announced his retirement. Van Drew is one of more than a dozen candidates the Blue Dogs are backing this cycle.\n\n\"We're aware he's had a 100 percent rating from the NRA and he fairly recently voted against marriage equality,\" Berning said. \"That's a race we're tracking and may endorse in.\"\n\nAnd some progressives are already setting the stage for another showdown later this spring.\n\nThe PCCC announced four new House candidate endorsements on Wednesday, including Kara Eastman, a progressive Democrat who's running against former Rep. Brad Ashford, a Blue Dog, in a May primary for an Omaha, Nebraska-based seat.\n\n\"There are two schools of thought on this race -- the old, more moderate white guy who's already had his chance and was swept out of office, or lean into the type of candidate who's going to inspire people to the polls,\" said Sarah Badawi, a spokeswoman for the PCCC.\n\nHogue said Democratic candidates across the country should take Newman's narrow loss as a \"really clear signal that, to the extent Democrats retake the House and the Senate, they're doing it on a mandate to defend their base.\"\n\nLike Lipinski, Ashford is to the right of many in the Democratic Party on abortion. He backs abortion rights but has said he's open to some restrictions late in pregnancy. Unlike Lipinski, Ashford has the public support of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which refused to endorse Lipinski, infuriating Blue Dogs.\n\nRep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) said he hopes the House Democratic caucus has \"learned our lesson\" after the Lipinski race and won't come out publicly against Ashford, who served one term before being knocked off by Republican Don Bacon in 2016.\n\nSchrader, chairman of the Blue Dog PAC, said it wasn't so much Pocan and leading voices of the progressive caucus -- including Reps. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Ro Khanna of California -- endorsing Newman that burned.\n\nFor Schrader and other Blue Dogs, it was liberal Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky's decision to back Newman against her own in-state colleague, while maintaining her leadership position at DCCC, that really inflamed tensions between the two ideological poles of the caucus.\n\n\"I'm not going to throw stones at my progressive colleagues for trying to back progressive candidates, I think most every Blue Dog member understands that,\" Schrader said. \"What I don't want to see is someone in DCCC leadership on the committee lend their weight in a campaign against an incumbent.\"\n\nSchakowsky's office did not respond to a request for comment. But she insisted in an interview last month that her opposition to Lipinski was unique and she wouldn't be using her leverage at the DCCC to oppose Blue Dogs or other candidates backed by the coalition ahead of the midterms.\n\n\"This has nothing to do with going after people who differ in positions from me around the country,\" Schakowsky said.\n\nFacing a deeply entrenched candidate whose family had dominated the district for more than three decades, Newman had much to overcome and not much time to do it.\n\nBridget Gainer, a Cook County Commissioner who also helped Newman's campaign with fundraising, said momentum behind Newman may have come too late.\n\nSix months ago, few thought Newman was a viable candidate to try to unseat Lipinski, Gainer said. But once polling showed a path, money flowed to her, allowing her to get out her message.\n\n\"I think the late entry of EMILY's List and some of the pro-choice groups into this race -- it's always speculation -- but if they had come on earlier, could that have made the difference?\" Gainer said. \"Some of the people came in very late. It was hard to gain traction.\"\n\nFor now, progressives are taking solace in forcing Lipinski to the left on several issues, including immigration and the minimum wage. And while Lamb said he personally opposed abortion, he also campaigned on some of the economic populist ideas progressives tout as key to winning back the House.\n\n\"I think what that showed,\" Pocan said, \"is there is a populist, progressive economic message that [resonates] anywhere.\"",

                "title": "Zuckerberg and Sandberg lean out",
                "body": "Facebook's slow, unsteady response to the furor over its handling of people's data is doing perhaps permanent damage to the the D.C. reputations of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, its two most famous executives.\n\nZuckerberg, the founder and CEO of the social network, waited until Wednesday to speak out about the controversy surrounding the mass leaking of Facebook data to the Trump-aligned firm Cambridge Analytica -- confessing to a \"breach of trust\" and outlining steps the company will take to fix it. Sandberg, the chief operating officer whose bestseller \"Lean In\" has given her a sizable public following of her own, echoed the CEO's remarks moments later. Zuckerberg also plans to give an interview to CNN on Wednesday night.\n\nBut those words came too late and too reluctantly for a growing number of critics of the two executives, who often garner as much attention as world leaders from lawmakers, investors and the media. As the public faces of the social media giant, Zuckerberg and Sandberg have drawn immense criticism for taking six days to react to the revelations, and then doing it in a highly controlled fashion.\n\n\"The signal they're giving is that they need a new management team and that's tragic, because Mark and Sheryl are immensely talented,\" Roger McNamee, an early investor and adviser to Facebook. \"The notion that they don't have the courage to face their critics and face up to the mistakes they made, I find baffling.\n\n\"If I were a member of Congress, I would be immensely skeptical,\" added McNamee, who co-founded the Center for Humane Technology. \"They have been disingenuous about literally everything in this process. I can't imagine that that's going to sell.\"\n\nEven in his written statement Wednesday afternoon, Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook has known since 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had compiled the data.\n\n\"I still want to know why it took Facebook so long to do anything about this,\" said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. He acknowledged that Facebook has taken \"a basic first step\" by agreeing to notify customers whose data were leaked, but said the CEO needs to do more.\n\n\"Mr. Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate and answer some tough questions about Russian activity on the platform, and the way his company protects -- or doesn't -- its users' data,\" Warner said.\n\nFacebook's problems are rapidly spilling out of the political realm. Advertisers were already expressing concern about content on the company's platforms, and some have even threatened publicly to cut ties. An online campaign urging people to \"#DeleteFacebook\" has also begun spreading, seeking to make a dent in the social network's 2.2 billion-user base.\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg have a lot to lose, with both executives deeply involved in policy issues beyond Facebook's immediate concerns. Zuckerberg has led a national campaign for immigration reform -- placing him at odds with President Donald Trump -- and embarked on an across-the-U.S. road trip last year that struck many people as a prelude to a future run for public office. Sandberg, meanwhile, is a Democratic power player and was seen as a potential candidate for Treasury secretary if Hillary Clinton had won in 2016.\n\nFacebook has been reeling since the revelations that Cambridge Analytica -- a data firm that worked on Trump's election campaign -- improperly obtained information on some 50 million Facebook users via an academic researcher. The situation didn't come to light until five days ago, when The New York Times and The Observer of London reported the details and raised questions about whether Cambridge still possessed some of the information.\n\nThe days of silence from Facebook's top leaders followed by the written statements came too late for a number of lawmakers, who said too many questions are left unanswered. Many repeated their calls for Zuckerberg to personally testify before Congress.\n\n\"I've seen people who came with one reputation and left with another,\" said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), who has previously criticized Facebook's lack of workforce diversity and met with Sandberg in October. \"It's all going to be determined by his willingness to come.\"\n\nIn his Facebook post Wednesday, Zuckerberg outlined a series of steps Facebook is taking to toughen its security. Facebook will crack down on third-party app developers that violate its policies, he promised.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" he wrote. \"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n\nOne tech lobbyist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the fallout, said Facebook's actions create challenges for the broader industry in Washington as lawmakers rethink their traditional hands-off regulation of tech companies.\n\n\"This issue of consumer privacy has always been one where members of Congress try to play the 'I'm standing up for my constituents' [card]. It's a very pro-populism kind of message,\" the lobbyist said. \"If I were a member of Congress running this fall, I would go up there and beat the crap out of Facebook.\"\n\nFacebook defended the executives' response even before their public statements. \"Mark, Sheryl and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue,\" a company spokesperson said Tuesday.\n\nBill Whalen, a Hoover Institution research fellow who worked as a speechwriter for former Republican California Gov. Pete Wilson, said the fact that politicians on both sides of the aisle have taken aim at the social network suggests a visit to Capitol Hill is inevitable. But he said the fast-moving news cycle in the Trump era could work in Zuckerberg's favor.\n\n\"In Donald Trump's America, the question when a controversy occurs is how much shelf life does that controversy have,\" he said.\n\nThe tech industry has long produced executives whose personal brands are on par with that of their businesses, whether it's Jeff Bezos at Amazon or Elon Musk at Tesla. Sometimes that dynamic reflects well on the businesses or can cause headaches, as was the case with former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who stepped down after a series of leadership controversies.\n\nAnd in times of political scrutiny, tech executives have stomached the trek to Washington for contentious talks with lawmakers.\n\nGoogle's former chairman, Eric Schmidt, spoke about the company's search practices during a Senate Judiciary hearing in 2011. Two years later, Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed senators directly as they investigated the company's tax practices. Back in 1998, Microsoft's then-chairman, Bill Gates, parried lawmakers' monopoly concerns about his company in defensive testimony.\n\nBut since the \"techlash\" began brewing after the 2016 election, many companies have hustled to keep their top brass out of the Washington spotlight. Facebook, Google and Twitter sent their top lawyers and security officials to a trio of hearings on Russian election interference last fall, a decision that some lawmakers openly found objectionable.\n\n\"This has had a terrible impact on this country, our citizens, our security, our privacy, and we need to be holding people accountable,\" said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), who also met with Sandberg in October. \"Otherwise we're in a whole new game about social media and what has been this freedom that they've enjoyed thus far.\"",

We in Oakland have a community that welcomes and honors all people, no matter where they came from -- no matter how they got here.''\n\nThe Democratic mayor said that continued White House attacks on Oakland conveniently \"distract from the fact that even sanctuary states like California do have policies in place to allow ICE to detain the most dangerous criminals.\"\n\nSchaaf's comments came one day after a White House law enforcement roundtable in which Trump again lambasted California's sanctuary cities, and ICE acting director Thomas Homan again singled out Oakland. And they came as Fox News headlines blared Wednesday that \"Illegal immigrants, who dodged California ICE raid after Dem mayor's tip-off, re-arrested for new crimes.\"\n\nThe mayor's office said that -- based on statements from ICE officials themselves today -- \"there is no evidence that any of these immigrants were from Oakland, were arrested in Oakland\" or heard any warning from the mayor about impending ICE raids.\n\nIn recent weeks, Schaaf has been the focus of calls for prosecution and \"Lock her up\" chants at conservative rallies.\n\nHoman specifically referenced Oakland as an example when he cited the case of a Mexican national, recently arrested in Merced, whose record included \"robbery and multiple weapons violations, including carrying a concealed weapon and willful discharge of a firearm and gross negligence.\"\n\n\"This alien was previously released from local custody back into the community in November 2017, following his arrest for conspiracy to commit crime and vandalism. Despite the fact we issued a detainer, he was released,'' Homan said. But the ICE director did not specify if Oakland was the location of his release.\n\nSchaaf said that Homan's citation of a Merced case in attacking her was confounding.\n\n\"If they are in fact, convicted ...not just arrested, but convicted -- of dangerous crimes, there are procedures in place to address that,'' she said. \"That is the business of our criminal justice system, and the fact that this administration continues to deceive the American people, distract them from really inhumane immigration processes, does not change those facts.\"\n\nThe Oakland mayor raised questions about the veracity of the acting ICE director's attacks. \"I think the strongest statement about ICE's credibility is [former San Francisco regional spokesman] James Schwab's resignation because of his refusal to continue to lie for this administration,'' she said.\n\nSchaaf also pointed to this week's resignation of Fox News military analyst Ralph Peters, a retired lieutenant colonel, who said the network has become a \"propaganda machine\" for the administration. In doing so, Schaaf said, Peters \"has acknowledged that the media is continuing to perpetuate outrageous lies and fear mongering, and that no American should take part in that.\"\n\nSchaaf said the specific suggestion Tuesday that she has endangered the public is a \"continued distraction from the broken immigration system. It's a continued distraction from facts -- that immigrants, and undocumented immigrants have been shown to commit fewer crimes than American born citizens.\"\n\nCiting news reports which she said underscored a matter of real concern in her community, Schaaf said the Trump administration has more than tripled the number of deportations from people with no criminal background whatsoever.\"\"\n\nWith both the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions both referring to her as a \"disgrace\" -- and Homan, likening her action to that of a \"gang lookout yelling police\" to warning fellow hoodlums, the mayor said, \"this administration has really emboldened bullying, lying and hatred -- and this is something that our community in Oakland is standing up against.\"\n\nAs for the calls for her prosecution from conservative cable hosts and analysts, and chants about incarcerating her at recent pro-Trump rallies, Schaaf said she hopes the debate can be handled in a more civil manner.\n\n\"This has brought out a lot of ugliness from a lot of people, mostly from outside our community. I really hope people tone down the vitriol and start studying the facts,\" she said. \"The bullying, the misdirection have been a constant tactic of this administration, and if we believe in democracy, we cannot let it distract us. We must continue to engage in civil and thoughtful discourse, and use actual facts and data.\"",

                "body": "New data is out that ranks the lawmakers with the highest staff turnover.\n\nEveryone has an opinion, and many have horror stories to back them up.\n\nBut now LegiStorm -- the online portal that tracks Capitol Hill's workforce in detail -- is putting hard data to the debate over the worst bosses in Congress.\n\nThe site is out with a new feature -- actually titled \"Worst Bosses?\" -- that shows the members of the House and Senate with the highest turnover. The organization used salary data from 2001 to 2016 to determine the 10 offices in each chamber that have the highest annual turnover rate, with a formula that weights the departure of senior officials higher than lower-level staff. Leadership offices, where frequent turnover is expected, were excluded.\n\n\"It's much more important, for example, if a chief of staff turns over than if a lowly staff assistant turns over,\" said Jock Friedly, LegiStorm's CEO and founder. \"It's perfectly normal for a staff assistant to turn over. And obviously it's particularly usual for paid interns to turn over so that obviously has little impact on an office.\"\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee's (D-Texas) office topped the list in the House, with an annual turnover rate of 62 percent, according to LegiStorm. Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) came in behind her with 60 percent annual turnover, followed by Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) with 54 percent.\n\nIn the Senate, Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar led the pack with an annual turnover rate of 36 percent, followed by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) with 30 percent and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) with 28 percent.\n\nLegiStorm is declining to guess whether the high turnover stems from a toxic work environment or employees simply advancing in their careers.\n\n\"We don't say why\" the offices have high turnover rates, Friedly said. \"We can't tell you whether they're bad human beings or, you know, if they're sexual harassers or, you know, phone throwers.\"\n\nRep. Kay Granger's (R-Texas) office, which had the seventh highest annual turnover rate in the House from 2001 to 2016, said her office has been a launching pad for staffers, who have gone on to serve in the Bush administration and congressional leadership. Barrett Karr, Granger's former chief of staff, for example, is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) chief of staff.\n\n\"Congresswoman Granger hires the best, and when staff does decide to leave, they go to work for influential people or businesses,\" said Kevin Boland, Granger's communications director. \"She appreciates the dedication and hard work of her current and former staff members.\"\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), fifth on the list, also suggested his staff excelled and so moved on to other opportunities, as did a source in Rep. Elizabeth Esty's (D-Conn.) office, which is No. 9 in the House's top 10. Former Esty communications directors Laura Maloney and Craig Frucht, for instance, are now Sen. Chris Murphy's (D-Conn.) press secretary and deputy communications director on Rep. Jared Polis' (D-Colo.) campaign for governor, respectively.\n\n\"This ranking doesn't reflect the fact that most of the Senator's senior staff have been with her since the beginning of her first term,\" said Ryan Nickel, a spokesman for Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) on the senator's ninth-place spot. \"Many departures during this time period were either junior staff pursuing higher education or more experienced staff joining the Obama administration, all of which the office encouraged.\"\n\nOther lawmakers on the list defended their offices for demanding a lot from aides, including Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), who rounded out the House's top 10 in turnover.\n\n\"It's no secret that Rep. Coffman is one of the hardest working Members on the Hill. Mike has high standards -- expects a lot,\" said Coffman spokesperson Daniel Bucheli. \"He has one of the hardest working staffs in the Capitol and back home, and it shows from the results he produces for the district.\"",

                "title": "Trump's trade policies slammed by GOP lawmakers",
                "body": "President Donald Trump's his \"America First\" trade policies took a bashing Wednesday from free-trade House Republicans, angry and fearful about the prospect of global retaliation and how the policies are playing back home.\n\nFrom the uncertainty caused by NAFTA renegotiations, to his imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum, to his expected announcement this week of duties on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese goods, many lawmakers said that farmers and manufacturers in their districts are worried about lost sales and being hit with retaliation.\n\nSome of those actions could also hurt consumers, they said, especially if Trump goes after Chinese-made electronics and other household goods in a bid to level the trade playing field.\n\n\"I think we're on pins and needles,\" Rep. Erik Philip Paulsen (R-Minn.) told U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Trump's trade agenda. \"I hope we won't be seeing tariffs imposed on products that a lot of American families and consumers and small business purchase every day.\"\n\nTo drive home his concerns, Paulsen cited a study by the Trade Partnership, a Washington-based analytical firm, that estimates Trump's steel and aluminum tariff will cost five jobs in downstream manufacturing and services sectors for every one job it creates in steel and aluminum.\n\nIf expected trade retaliation is added in, the ratio widens to 18 lost jobs to every one job created, affecting many blue-collar workers who voted for Trump, Paulsen said.\n\nLighthizer brushed aside the economic analysis, saying he doubted its accuracy and assuring the congressman Trump had no desire to launch a trade war.\n\n\"But on the other hand, you have to ask yourself, can we go on with an $800 -- and growing -- billion trade deficit,\" Lighthizer said. \"So, we have to do something and the people who are benefiting from the status quo are always going to be against it. We understand that, and we have to balance their interest.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is already taking some steps to limit the impact of the new steel and aluminum tariffs by entering into talks to exempt some countries, and starting a process for importers to ask for specific products to be excluded.\n\nBut it's still uncertain how much difference that will make and whether it will dissuade the European Union from following through with plans to retaliate on billions of dollars of U.S. exports.\n\nRep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) told Lighthizer she was concerned not only about the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs, but also how China might retaliate against farmers and businesses in her district if Trump imposes tariffs to punish Beijing over its poor protection of U.S intellectual property rights.\n\n\"In my district in northern Indiana, with the second largest concentration of manufacturing jobs in the country, there's a whole host of ag that I'm concerned about -- corn, soybeans, dairy, pork, beef, poultry, tomatoes and the list goes on,\" Walorkski said. \"Half the soybeans grown in Indiana are exported to China. Honeywell makes brakes and avionics in South Bend that go into Boeing airplanes. China is threatening retaliation against both.\"\n\nAgain, Lighthizer said the administration was sensitive to those concerns, but \"we can't be in a position where we take no action because of threats of retaliation. That's how you end up having an $800 billion trade deficit, which costs literally millions and millions of jobs in America.\"\n\nLighthizer acknowledged that it's unfortunate that agriculture always \"is on the front line of retaliation.\"\n\n\"It's an unfair situation, but one that we have to come to grips with,\" he said. \"You have to think about [the U.S. imposing] counter-retaliation. You have to think about programs for farmers who are in this situation. There are a lot of things that are outside of my realm that have to be considered.\"\n\nLighthizer faced some of the toughest Republican criticism when it came to questions about the NAFTA negotiations, where the Trump administration has made several controversial proposals.\n\nThose include eliminating a special dispute settlement mechanism for investors and inserting a new \"sunset review\" mechanism that would terminate the pact after five years unless the three countries agree to renew it.\n\nRepublicans started the hearing by releasing a letter signed by 103 party members in the House and Senate, warning Lighthizer he would have a difficult time winning approval of the revamped NAFTA deal if it drops the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, also known as ISDS.\n\nSeveral Republicans drove home that point, including Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), both of whom rejected Lighthizer's argument that the provision undermines U.S. sovereignty.\n\nRep. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) told the story of a farmer in her district who asked if she knew what the Trump administration was thinking on trade \"'because it seems like every time they take a position, soybeans drop 40 cents a bushel and we can't hardly pay our bills today.'\"\n\n\"These farmers are very worried that the administration, who they supported, is going to lose them a trade deal over provisions that are widely unpopular,\" Noem added, focusing in particular on the business uncertainty caused by the sunset provision.\n\nShe pressed Lighthizer to say whether he would accept a final deal without the sunset clause, but the trade chief told Noem he wasn't going to negotiate in public.\n\nNot every Republican clashed with Lighthizer.\n\nA few such as Reps. Tom Rice of South Carolina and Jason Smith of Missouri said they welcomed Trump's tougher approach. Smith credited Trump's new aluminum tariff with the reopening of a smelter in his district that had closed several years ago.\n\n\"These are real changes and real aspects that are affecting real people who have not always been on the right side of victories,\" Smith said.\n\nBut Rep. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), who represents one of the largest agricultural producing districts in the United States, got under Lighthizer's skin when he asked the trade representative if he knew of any business group that supported the administration's proposal for rewriting NAFTA's auto trade rules.\n\n\"Listen, there are business groups all over the place. I have no idea where they are on rules of origin,\" Lighthizer said. He then refused LaHood's request to provide the information later.\n\nLaHood also asked Lighthizer if he agreed with one of Trump's tweets calling NAFTA \"a bad joke.\" The veteran attorney declined to answer by saying he hadn't seen the quote.\n\n\"Well, I would just say that causes a lot of concern,\" LaHood said. \"The farmers in my district and rural America support the president ... But I can't emphasize enough the concern with farmers in rural America when it comes to NAFTA.\"",

                "title": "Dems seize on McCabe firing to scrutinize Sessions",
                "body": "The attorney general is also coming under fire for his shifting statements on Trump campaign contacts with Russia.\n\nSenate Democrats want to grill Attorney General Jeff Sessions about his firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and his past testimony on Russia -- but it's unclear if they'll get the chance despite a GOP promise for FBI oversight hearings.\n\nSessions' decision to axe McCabe inflamed Democratic suspicions that he bowed to political pressure from President Donald Trump. Though Sessions followed the advice of a nonpartisan Department of Justice review board, Trump has attacked McCabe for months. Republicans have largely defended Sessions, but lawmakers in both parties are eager to see the flap aired out in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe Judiciary panel's chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), this week said he would hold hearings on the still-unreleased DOJ inspector general's report, which underpinned Sessions' firing of McCabe. Although all 10 Democrats on the committee have urged Grassley to ask for \"an advance and embargoed copy of\" the report and called on DOJ \"to explain the timing and manner of this firing,\" whether the GOP would insist on testimony from Sessions himself remains an open question.\n\nDemocrats would welcome the chance to put Sessions back on the hot seat for the first time since last fall. And it's not just the McCabe firing that Democrats want to dig into.\n\nShould Sessions return to his former home in the Senate for the first time since two ex-Trump campaign aides pleaded guilty to lying to investigators, he can also expect sharp questions on his shifting statements about Trump campaign contacts with Russia.\n\nSessions \"either made a false statement or misled the committee\" in the past when discussing contacts with Russia, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said in an interview. \"I think that that's not a question -- that's a fact.\"\n\nThe attorney general told the Judiciary panel at his confirmation hearing last year that he \"did not have communications with the Russians,\" only to later revise himself after reports of two meetings with the then-Russian ambassador. Sessions said he attended those meetings in his role as a senator, not a Trump campaign adviser, although media reports have suggested the two discussed campaign-related issues.\n\nMcCabe himself authorized a criminal inquiry into Sessions' Senate testimony last year in response to a request from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), ABC reported Wednesday. That move is bound to raise further questions among Democrats already concerned about politicization driving Sessions' firing of McCabe less than two days before the former FBI No. 2's scheduled retirement.\n\nSessions \"wasn't forthcoming with the truth,\" Booker said before ABC's report, adding that \"it sounds eerily familiar to what the IG's accusing McCabe about.\"\n\nThe DOJ's inspector general has found that McCabe made an unauthorized disclosure to media about an ongoing investigation and then misled investigators about it -- an allegation McCabe denies.\n\nA source close to Sessions said the attorney general was unaware of the probe McCabe opened when he decided on the firing. Chuck Cooper, Sessions' lawyer, said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is not currently investigating Sessions' congressional testimony.\n\n\"The special counsel's office has informed me that after interviewing the Attorney General and conducting additional investigation, the Attorney General is not under investigation for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and related written submissions to Congress,\" Cooper said in a statement.\n\nA DOJ spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Sessions would consider testifying in the Senate Judiciary Committee if asked. A spokesman for Grassley said that the panel first would \"need to review\" the inspector general's report and the recommendation for McCabe's firing from the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility before deciding on witnesses for a hearing.\n\nBut several Democrats on the committee, including ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, made clear this week that they would want Sessions himself to discuss the unique circumstances behind McCabe's firing.\n\nIt's \"very important\" for the attorney general to personally address the McCabe firing, Feinstein told reporters, adding that she has \"a lot of questions.\" Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) also issued a call for Sessions' testimony hours after McCabe's firing.\n\nLeahy and Franken sent three requests for an FBI inquiry into Sessions' communications with Russian officials last year, raising concerns about false statements -- the first two to Comey, dinging Sessions for \"lack of candor,\" the same ethics breach that resulted in McCabe's dismissal.\n\nThe Democrats' sent their third letter seeking a Sessions probe to McCabe, three days after McCabe became acting FBI director following Trump's firing of Comey.\n\nAnother hot-button issue that Democrats want addressed: how Sessions' recusal from investigative matters related to Hillary Clinton's email server and family foundation squares with his decision to fire McCabe over the ex-FBI No. 2's disclosures to the media about its probe of the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\"I have concerns about his respect to the scope of his recusal,\" said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), another Judiciary Committee member. \"I also have concerns that the president is inappropriately influencing the leadership of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nDOJ points to existing internal regulations to note that, while Sessions is recused from investigative matters relating to the 2016 election, that recusal does not cover personnel or employee misconduct decisions such as McCabe's firing or last year's Comey firing.\n\nWith the IG's report still under wraps and subject to potential delays, Democrats who challenged the timing of McCabe's termination face political pitfalls of their own in any effort to probe more deeply.\n\nBefore seeing the results of the DOJ watchdog's probe, it's impossible for them to know whether McCabe's behavior documented within it undercuts his claim to be a target of Trump administration allies who want to \"undermine my credibility\" ahead of likely cooperation with Mueller.\n\n\"What's been widely reported, and I assume it's true, is Mr. McCabe leaked classified information and lied, including but not limited to lied under oath,\" another Judiciary panel Republican, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, said in an interview. \"And that's a firing offense.\"\n\nTrump's GOP allies in the House have largely applauded Sessions' decision to fire McCabe, calling it a justified action after a year of questions about his role in both the Clinton investigation and Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nSenate Republicans on the Judiciary panel have offered more measured responses, welcoming the chance for a hearing on the inspector general's report while stopping short of passing judgment on conclusions they have yet to see.\n\n\"I want the country to understand what happened. Was it political reprisal or was it justified?\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \"I think it'd be good for the country to understand the basis of the firing.\"\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) agreed with Grassley's camp that lawmakers should first get a complete look at the inspector general's and internal FBI recommendations.\n\n\"I'm sure the attorney general will be testifying\" at some point soon, Cornyn told reporters, as part of his periodic returns to the Hill. \"[S]o people will have their shot at him. But I'd like to get the facts first.\"",

                "title": "Trump administration taps AIDS researcher to lead CDC",
                "body": "The Trump administration will appoint prominent HIV/AIDS researcher Robert Redfield to lead the CDC, administration officials announced Wednesday amid new scrutiny of controversies surrounding his earlier research and views.\n\nRedfield, a clinical scientist and former Army doctor who co-founded the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, has been leading a massive HIV treatment program and a global program funded by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. He previously served on former President George W. Bush's HIV/AIDS advisory panel and in various advisory roles at NIH.\n\nThe appointment comes nearly two months after former CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald resigned following a POLITICO investigation that revealed she had traded tobacco, drug and food stocks while leading the country's top public health agency.\n\nRedfield emerged as the favorite to take the top CDC job last week, POLITICO reported over the weekend. Sources close to the decision process say Redfield was chosen based on his groundbreaking work on HIV/AIDS in Maryland. The position does not require Senate confirmation.\n\n\"Dr. Redfield has dedicated his entire life to promoting public health and providing compassionate care to his patients, and we are proud to welcome him as director of the world's premier epidemiological agency,\" HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.\n\nRedfield's expected appointment has revived examination of controversial positions he took decades ago. At a time when effective treatments for HIV/AIDS weren't yet available, he expressed support for mandatory HIV testing and identifying by name patients who tested positive for the virus -- practices that were staunchly opposed by patient advocates. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the HELP Committee, had asked President Donald Trump to reconsider his appointment, citing those views.\n\nRedfield's colleagues defended his record, saying he was motivated by a desire to help his patients.\n\n\"He took a position not caring about the politics,\" said Robert Gallo, who co-founded the Institute of Human Virology and has worked closely with Redfield for decades. \"That was a time of a lot of panic and a lot of pressure politically in a lot of directions. Bob, in his position in the Army, was concerned about soldiers and I'm sure he acted in the best interest of his patients.\"\n\nCritics have also raised questions about his oversight of a failed effort to develop an AIDS vaccine at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the early 1990s. A whistleblower who came forward this week said he believed Redfield was either sloppy with data or fabricated the results. The Army cleared him of wrongdoing but said there were accuracy issues with the data.\n\nRedfield has tried to address criticism in recent days by privately assuring public health and HIV/AIDS advocacy groups that he is committed to science-based approaches in all areas of CDC's work, according to multiple sources familiar with those conversations.\n\nSome public health experts are cautiously optimistic about the new CDC director, pointing out that his controversial views were held decades ago and the science and public understanding of HIV/AIDS has changed dramatically since then.\n\n\"Questions raised by his past views are legitimate and I would love to know what he currently thinks,\" said Jeffrey Crowley, former director of the Office of National AIDS Policy under President Barack Obama. \"But what we need to recognize is the epidemic today looks very different than it did then and technology has changed our views dramatically. Redfield is a respected scientist and we could do far worse by some other appointment.\"\n\nRedfield has also participated in Maryland's response to the opioid crisis, including the development of medication-assisted treatment facilities, according to colleagues.\n\n\"He has been a leader on the opioid epidemic,\" said Carlos del Rio, a professor of medicine at Emory University and chair of PEPFAR's Scientific Advisory Board, which Redfield also serves on. \"Right now, our biggest public health problem is the opioid crisis, and we need someone who actually understands and wants to do something about it.\"\n\nSome public health experts respect his research background but question whether he has enough experience to lead a massive government agency like the Atlanta-based CDC, which has been under threat of budget cuts by Congress and the Trump administration. The president's 2019 budget proposal called for a $900 million cut to the agency.\n\n\"He's a strong scientist and has really sound science credentials. The only red flag is that he hasn't led an institution like this,\" said Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. \"The ability to really be a strong leader and spend time on Capitol Hill educating Congress about the importance of public health investments is really important.\"\n\nLawmakers made no secret they were frustrated that Redfield's predecessor, Fitzgerald, often recused herself from key public health issues, such as the opioid crisis and cancer, on the account of her financial conflicts. Her resignation in late January came after just nearly seven months in the job.\n\nRedfield's appointment has already been supported by some lawmakers, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from his home state of Maryland.\n\n\"Although I seldom agree with the Trump administration, I am in complete agreement that Dr. Bob Redfield is the best choice to lead the CDC,\" Cummings said in a statement. \"Bob has devoted his life to improving the public health.\"\n\nLongtime CDC official Anne Schuchat, who had been acting director since Fitzgerald's resignation, will return to her job as principal deputy director.",

                "body": "The Senate on Wednesday approved a bill to combat online sex trafficking that faced opposition from major parts of the tech industry, marking a rare policy defeat for an increasingly embattled Silicon Valley in Washington.\n\nThe bill passed by a vote of 97-2. It now goes to President Donald Trump, who's expected to sign the measure. The House passed the bill in February.\n\nThe legislation would hold websites liable for \"knowingly\" enabling sex trafficking. It's targeted at sites like Backpage.com, the subject of a long-running Senate investigation, which was accused of hosting ads that promoted the trafficking of minors -- but its passage comes as divisions within the tech industry and rising frustration with companies like Facebook have weakened the sector's power in the Capitol.\n\nThe effort has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Congress, but it was the subject of fierce lobbying by the tech industry. Tech groups warned the bill creates a dangerous precedent by amending a legal provision -- Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act -- that has long shielded websites like Google and Twitter from lawsuits over content posted by users.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), an author of the original 230 provision and leading internet advocate, proposed two amendments to change the language of the bill, one of which was voted down and the other withdrawn. Survivors' groups said those changes would have essentially gutted the bill.\n\nFor an industry that for years enjoyed a free ride in Washington, the trafficking legislation marks a stinging defeat -- and the first tangible sign of Washington's changing attitude toward Silicon Valley. Facebook, Twitter and Google have faced intense scrutiny in recent months over everything from their role in Russian election meddling to the spread of online conspiracy theories to so-called tech addiction.\n\nAs the anti-trafficking bill gained momentum this year, the tech industry splintered, with players like Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg expressing robust support for congressional action and groups like Engine and NetChoice scrambling to halt or water down the legislation.",

                "body": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday criticized his three predecessors in defending his recent congratulatory call to President Vladimir Putin of Russia -- a move that's been widely criticized in the wake of news that Trump was specifically instructed not to congratulate Putin on his reelection.\n\n\"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in the past, Obama called him also),\" Trump tweeted Wednesday afternoon. \"The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\n\n\"They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race,\" Trump followed up in another tweet. \"Bush tried to get along, but didn't have the 'smarts.' Obama and Clinton tried, but didn't have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!\"\n\nTrump spoke with Putin on Tuesday, not only to commend him on \"his electoral victory,\" but also to discuss North Korea, Ukraine, Syria, arms control and a potential meeting between the two leaders in the \"not-too-distant\" future, according to the White House. The exchange did not include mention of Putin's disproportionate margin of victory nor Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nReports emerged on Tuesday night that briefing materials prepared for Trump's call specifically said \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE\" and further recommended that the president condemn the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, which the United States and several allies have blamed the Kremlin for.\n\nTrump ignored both of these recommendations. Some administration officials even questioned whether Trump fully read the notes telling him not to congratulate Putin, according to initial reports from The Washington Post. The leak has further illustrated concerns about Trump's hesitation to criticize Putin or Russia.\n\nThe administration's reaction to Putin's reelection, along with Trump's call, has been widely disparaged by Republican lawmakers.\n\n\"An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\" Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) tweeted Tuesday afternoon. \"And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said during his weekly news conference on Tuesday: \"Well, the president can call whomever he chooses, When I look at a Russian election, what I see is a lack of credibility in tallying the results.\"\n\n\"Calling him wouldn't have been high on my list,\" McConnell added.\n\nAlthough Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) did not directly comment on the call, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman did refer to Putin by noting that that, personally, he \"wouldn't have a conversation with a criminal.\"\n\nOther Republicans were more frustrated by the leak of the briefing notes than the call itself.\n\n\"I don't agree with congratulating #Putin but bigger outrage is this leak that could only come from someone in @POTUS inner circle,\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) wrote. \"If you don't like the President, resign, but this ongoing pattern of duplicity holds potential for serious damage to the nation.\"",

                "title": "Sasse rips Trump for congratulating Putin on 'sham' election win",
                "body": "Sen. Ben Sasse tore into President Donald Trump Wednesday for making a congratulatory call to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling it \"terribly ill-advised\" and urging staffers who leaked Trump's briefing materials to resign.\n\nThe Nebraska Republican, in a speech on the Senate floor, called Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders' refusal to condemn Putin's \"sham\" election this week \"very foolhardy\" -- among the strongest statements made by a member of Trump's own party in the aftermath of Trump's call to the Russian president.\n\nSasse even turned Trump's signature campaign phrase against him, condemning a \"Russian despot that aims to make Soviet tyranny great again.\"\n\n\"The president of the United States was wrong to congratulate him, and the White House press secretary was wrong to duck a simple question about whether or not Putin's reelection was free and fair. It was not. The American people know that, the Russian people know that and the world knows that,\" Sasse said. \"The White House refused to speak directly and clearly about this matter; we were weakened as a nation and a tyrant was strengthened.\"\n\nTrump has hit back amid the mounting criticism.\n\n\"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also),\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. \"Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\n\nSasse never supported Trump's presidential campaign, though he kept a relatively low-profile during the first year of Trump's presidency. Lately, however, Sasse has felt compelled to speak out against Trump's new tariffs, his comments about due process and on Wednesday, about his foreign policy.\n\nOther Senate Republicans have also criticized Trump's call to Putin on Tuesday, notably John McCain of Arizona. But Sasse's comments stand out given his past opposition to Trump and the venue of the Senate floor.\n\n\"The moral responsibilities of the office of the presidency matter. And when we don't affirm these basic truths, it is a failure to who we are. It is a failure to do what we do, and it is a betrayal. Not just to the millions of people who are denied free and fair elections in Russia this week, but it is a failure to people all across the globe who are struggling in darkness against tyrants,\" Sasse said.\n\nSeveral media outlets reported that Trump's briefing materials included a directive not to congratulate Putin, which Trump ignored. Sasse said the leaking of those materials is \"wrong.\"\n\n\"A president's staff shouldn't leak. In cases of principle, you may need to resign. So resign,\" Sasse said. \"Do the right and honorable thing if you believe your conscience is compelled to do so and resign your position.\"",

                "title": "Kasich: 'All of my options are on the table' for 2020",
                "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich, appearing alongside former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger as he mulls a primary challenge to President Donald Trump, said Wednesday that the Republican Party has \"never been my master\" and that \"all of my options are on the table\" for 2020.\n\nSpeaking at an event promoting a nascent group of moderate Republicans in heavily Democratic California, Kasich said the GOP should cast itself in a more moderate, compromising mold.\n\nThe former presidential candidate yoked himself to the legacy of President Ronald Reagan, who \"compromised with [former Democratic House Speaker] Tip O'Neill on saving Social Security\" and \"was very welcoming to immigrants.\" Kasich said. \"The Republican Party is my vehicle. It's never been my master.\"\n\nHe added, \"And it's my job to lead the party.\"\n\nAsked if he was ruling out running against Trump as an independent, Kasich, who could also challenge the president in the Republican primary, told reporters, \"All of my options are on the table. But I'm a Republican, I'm a conservative, and I just want to add to the public debate and do a good job.\"\n\n\"I'm not ruling anything in or out,\" he said.\n\nLong political allies and friends, Kasich and Schwarzenegger have served as de-facto leaders of a small, anti-Trump movement within the GOP. On Wednesday, Schwarzenegger, who supported Kasich in his failed presidential campaign in 2016, lauded Kasich's oversight of budgets in Washington as a congressman and in Ohio as governor.\n\n\"John, get back to Washington and kick some butt,\" he said.\n\nThough Schwarzenegger avoided mentioning Trump by name, he fretted about a party message \"drowned out by a few loud voices.\" And he called for like-minded donors to apply pressure on the GOP, saying \"people that are funding the Republican Party should turn off their financial support.\" If starved of funding, Schwarzenegger said, the party might \"come to its senses.\"\n\nThe joint appearance at a youth center in East Los Angeles' Boyle Heights neighborhood came at an event to promote \"New Way California,\" a small group of Republicans seeking to advance a more moderate version of the party in the state. Despite its weak position in California, Republicans here remain significant nationally as a potent source of fundraising and as a battleground for the GOP's efforts to maintain control of the House. Republicans here are defending seven Republican-held congressional districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nBut since Schwarzenegger warned Republicans in 2007 that the party was \"dying at the box office\" in California, the GOP has withered. Republican Party registration has dropped to 25 percent statewide, and no Republican holds statewide office. California last went for a Republican for president, George H.W. Bush, in 1988.\n\nYet Trump remains more popular among California Republicans than Schwarzenegger would suggest. And efforts to reshape the party to appeal to the state's younger, increasingly diverse electorate have met with resistance. State Assemblyman Chad Mayes, who lamented Wednesday that the party had grown \"insular,\" was pushed out of his post as Assembly Republican leader last year after negotiating with Democrats to extend California's controversial cap-and-trade program.\n\nShawn Steel, a Republican National Committee member from California, called Schwarzenegger \"pathetic\" and said, \"Had I known the soullessness of Arnold Schwarzenegger, I never would have supported [the 2003] recall against Gray Davis.\"\n\nAs for Kasich, Steel said he hopes that he does run, if only because \"Trump kicked his ass so badly in Ohio\" in 2016.\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, a San Francisco attorney and member of the Republican National Committee, warned that California Republicans should not \"compromise our principles and become more like the Democrats in order to win elections.\" And Jon Fleischman, a conservative blogger and former state Republican Party executive director, asked of Schwarzenegger and the \"New Way\" group, \"Rather than start a new Republican group, why don't they just go form a new party?\"\n\nThe appearance comes as Kasich mulls a possible presidential run in 2020, either in a primary challenge to Trump or by running as an independent. Kasich is scheduled to return to the early primary state of New Hampshire in April.\n\nEven supporters of the fledgling \"New Way\" effort acknowledged the difficulty gaining traction in the current GOP. Surveying the crowd, Reed Galen, a strategist who left the party in 2016, said, \"The sad thing is it only fills a small gymnasium in East L.A.\"",

                "title": "Should You Delete Your Facebook Account?",
                "body": "If every new communications technology contains within it the seeds of its own demise, we might have just witnessed Facebook's death sprouts breaking ground.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's social media site, which made so many of us giddy with gladness not long ago for the way it plugged us in to our friends, our fake friends and our interests and kept us fully charged, has now fallen in public estimation to something approximating a curse. Once celebrated for its all-seeing, all-knowing, all-tracking ways, it's now damned for those same attributes. Up and down the internet, people are calling on others to delete their Facebook accounts. The most prominent of the new Facebook refuseniks -- WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who sold his company to Facebook in 2014 for $16 billion -- tweeted on Tuesday that it's time to delete Facebook. \"Now is the time to care about privacy,\" he added.\n\nThe latest Facebook backlash was triggered by press reports about the flow of Facebook data profiles to a personality app to political analytics company called Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica helped -- nobody is certain how much -- Steve Bannon to elect Donald Trump, and Trump's inclusion in the equation probably explains the scale of the fury as much as anything because Facebook has always been slipshod about privacy. Need proof? Just gander at this list of Zuckerberg \"apologies\" over the years, compiled by Fast Company. Like any habitual sinner, he sins, seeks forgiveness in confession, and then with that naughty boy expression pasted on his face he goes forth and sins again. Zuckerberger's filibustering apology and promise today to be a better boy is just more of the same.\n\nAt Techdirt's Karl Bode points out, Facebook deserves our disapprobation. But it's only one of the many privacy scoundrels operating in the technosphere. Your \"bloat-laden smartphone\" harvests and sells personal information, including real-time location, to third parties. Your internet service provider does the same with your online habits. Gizmodo readers know all about how home devices -- toothbrushes, smart TVs, Amazon Echos, sleep monitors, coffee makers, thermostats, smart lights, bathroom scales, et al. -- spy on them via the internet. Meanwhile, car companies have joined the queue to sell your driver data. We're living in a Philip K. Dick novel!\n\nYes, Facebook is and always has been a rapacious and creepy thing, pestering you to tell it more and more about yourself so that it can hawk your profile to more and more places. But why is it catching the extraordinary heat? Most emerging technologies conform to a standard pattern: At first introduction, we wax dreamily about how the new technology makes everything better. It happened with the telephone, whose ring once signaled the happy news that somebody somewhere wanted to converse. But over time, we came to loathe that ringing sound, and as soon as technology could catch up, we attached answering machines and Caller ID to our phones to blunt the interlopers. The answering machines recorded messages that, as the wheel turned, we eventually stopped checking. Who among us doesn't treat the phone call as an annoyance today?\n\nThe fax machine traveled a similar arc, transitioning from the wonder device to a hell-sent nuisance spewing out spam and howling in the corner of the office like a tortured beast. Some of us are old enough to remember how television was destined to become the world's greatest teaching tool and promoter of universal peace or how the CB radio would unify the citizens of the road into a political force. We loved email for liberating us from the phone and our love affair ended with us ditched it for direct messages and Slack as soon as we could. Sometimes the cycle advances so fast we fail to record sufficiently our disappointment. Remember the brief enthusiasm we invested in fitness trackers, smart watches and Google Glass when they appeared?\n\nLike previous rebellions, the one against Facebook is being waged by multiple caucuses. Privacy advocates despise it for its promiscuous treatment of data. Others had their fuses lit by the Bannon-Trump connection. Zuckerberg haters grow angrier every time he adds a new \"I'm sorry\" to his encyclopedia of apologies, so the Cambridge Analytica episode has only renewed their fury. I suspect that part of the Facebook rejection grows from its incredible success. In the beginning, it could efficiently connect you to people and things of interest. But the party eventually got too big, forcing users to weed out the bores and blowhards clogging their feed. And as mentioned above, Facebook started to creep people out by becoming so needy with its overuse of notifications that it became an impossible place for the casual user.\n\nFollowing the established pattern, the Facebook boon was destined to become a bane. It's only an accident of timing that the Cambridge Analytica incident fomented such a rebellion that so many are calling for its shunning. Our appetites for media or communications have steadily grown since the advent of the telephone, radio, television and the internet -- they won't ebb because we delete a single app. Facebook refuseniks are as likely as not to end up diddling their time away on other services that mint money by keeping tabs on users: Twitter, LinkedIn, the Facebook-owned WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned Instagram, Snapchat, etc.\n\nStill, if it will make you feel better to nuke your Facebook account, go ahead strike that blow against the empire. Just don't confuse your minor act of rebellion with throwing off the internet surveillance shroud that you've wrapped yourself up in tighter than a taquito.\n\n******",

Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.) and Don Bonker (D-Wash.) are part of a team of APCO Worldwide lobbyists working on behalf of an exiled Russian billionaire and vodka magnate. The billionaire, Yuri Shefler, has ramped up his advocacy in Washington after being included on a Treasury Department list of Russian oligarchs earlier this year (Congress asked the Treasury Department to compile the list as part of a Russia sanctions bill last year. While the individuals on it are not necessarily under sanction, the report will be used to help determine who to sanction in the future).\n\n-- Shefler's company, SPI Group, which makes Stolichnaya vodka, recently registered to lobby and also hired Covington & Burling last month to lobby on its behalf. APCO, meanwhile, is lobbying on behalf of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the New York law firm, which represents another entity affiliated with SPI Group. APCO will engage in outreach \"in connection with the Stolichnaya vodka brand in light of ongoing U.S. trademark litigation\" as well as the Treasury report and its \"consequences on SPI Group and its principal owner, Yuri Shefler,\" according to a disclosure filing.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to PI.

Cigna spent $5.5 million on Washington lobbying last year and also retains the Eris Group, Invariant, the Nickles Group, Polaris Government Relations, Tiber Creek and WilmerHale.\n\nOMNIBUS UPDATE: Lobbyists have been pushing for a host of riders to make it into the omnibus spending bill, but many did not make it in, including the so-called Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act. (RESA includes a provision that allows multiple employers to pool their retirement assets into a single 401(k) account and changes to nondiscrimination rules for frozen defined-benefit plans.) Among the groups pushing for its inclusion in the spending package were the American Benefits Council and the American Council of Life Insurers.\n\n-- A rider to narrow the standard for joint employment also did not make it in. In a statement to POLITICO's Ian Kullgren, the International Franchise Association's Matt Haller blamed Democratic leadership for not including the rider in the omnibus. \"It's clear Democrat leadership is complicit in the SEIU's war on franchising that began in 2012, and will do anything they can to protect the interests of their largest campaign funders,\" he said. Full story.\n\n-- In addition, the spending bill does not include changes to the Medicare doughnut hole -- a loss for the pharmaceutical industry, POLITICO's Sarah Karlin-Smith and Jennifer Haberkorn report. \"The omission marks the second major defeat for the pharmaceutical industry in the past month. Brand drugs previously paid for just 50 percent of a drug's costs in the coverage gap phase of Part D, but a short-term spending bill Congress approved in February raised the industry's contribution to 70 percent. That made health plans responsible for 5 percent of the cost in the so-called doughnut hole, leaving patients to pay 25 percent. Brand companies were lobbying Congress to lower their share of the cost to 60 percent in the omnibus, but lawmakers struggled over how to pay for that change.\" Full story.\n\n-- And in a win for the National Grain and Feed Association and the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the omnibus includes a fix to the grain glitch, which gave a major tax break to farmers.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION POSITION ON NAFTA ALIGNS WITH JUNK FOOD LOBBY: The New York Times' Azam Ahmed, Matt Richtel and Andrew Jacobs report that \"the Trump administration is using the trade talks with Mexico and Canada to try to limit the ability of the pact's three members -- including the United States -- to warn consumers about the dangers of junk food, according to confidential documents outlining the American position.\" That's what the soda and junk food lobbies want, too. \"The Grocery Manufacturers Association, a food industry trade group that sits on the advisory board to the trade talks, says it favors voluntary labeling programs. The group says it 'supports a modernized Nafta that will ensure standards are based on science, minimize unnecessary trade barriers, and benefit consumers in all three countries.'\" Full story.\n\nMORE NAFTA LOBBYING: Bloomberg News' Jennifer Dlouhy reports that lobbyists are trying to add \"what is essentially a big business wishlist of regulatory reforms and other policies too ambitious or politically sensitive to clear Congress in a piecemeal fashion\" to a potential NAFTA deal. \"The brains behind the plan are a husband and wife in Washington, one an oil and gas lobbyist, the other a trade lawyer at a top firm. Rebecca Rosen works for Oklahoma-based Devon Energy Corp. Her husband, Jeff Weiss, spent 10 years in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and is now with Venable LLP. They have spent months quietly developing the strategy, honing the approach as they slowly widened the circle of advocates, drawing support from business lobbies, lining up a few influential Senate supporters and getting buy-in from key White House officials.\" Full story.\n\nA DIFFERENT BREED OF IN-HOUSE LOBBYIST: Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, an assistant professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University, has an interesting piece in The Washington Post based on his new book, \"Politics at Work: How Companies Turn Their Workers into Lobbyists.\" The book examines \"employers' relatively new -- and increasing -- efforts to rally their workers on behalf of policies and candidates that companies support. According to one business association's polling, since 2000, nearly four times as many employees are hearing about politics from their bosses. In my own review of corporate activities, I found that until the late 1990s and early 2000s, companies didn't commonly try to recruit employees as voters and lobbyists. That has changed. Roughly a quarter of U.S. employees say that they have heard about politics from their bosses.\" Here's the full piece.\n\n-- Judy Mayka Stecker will leave the American Enterprise Institute, where she is executive director for media relations and strategic marketing, at the end of the week to join the HHS as assistant secretary for public affairs.\n\n-- The Managed Funds Association has promoted Brooke Harlow to chief commercial officer.

                "body": "White House chief of staff John Kelly is furious over the leak of briefing materials prepared for President Donald Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a White House official told POLITICO on Wednesday, as the West Wing faced another wave of damaging news coverage following the revelation.\n\nTrump was instructed in briefing materials \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE\" before his call with the recently re-elected Putin, but congratulated him anyway, according to the Washington Post's report on Tuesday night. He also ignored a recommendation to condemn the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in the United Kingdom, which the Kremlin has been accused of orchestrating, according to the report.\n\nIt's not clear, however, whether Trump read the briefing notes instructing him to not congratulate Putin.\n\nStill, White House aides were reeling about the fact that the briefing materials were leaked, and were left wondering who would provide such sensitive information to reporters, the official said.\n\nTrump addressed the controversy head-on in a series of tweets on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also),\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\n\nHe added: \"They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didn't have the 'smarts.' Obama and Clinton tried, but didn't have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!\"\n\nThe results of the Russian election were largely pre-ordained, according to international experts, but the White House declined to say on Tuesday whether it considered the election \"free and fair.\"\n\n\"We're focused on our elections,\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. \"We don't get to dictate how other countries operate. What we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country, and that's not something that we can dictate to them how they operate.\"\n\nSanders also said Trump did not discuss the U.K. poisoning.\n\nThe declaration regarding Russia's election startled many observers and, coupled with Trump's congratulatory call, drew widespread criticism, including from his own party.\n\nIn a statement, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Tuesday dismissed the election as a \"sham\" and said Trump \"insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country's future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin's regime.\"\n\nThe leak, demonstrating Trump ignored advisers' call to avoid congratulating the Russian strongman and to address the poisoning, only deepened the controversy. Trump has long been loathe to criticize Putin or Russia.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is currently leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded in the effort. The intelligence community has concluded Russia interfered to aid Trump, but Trump has repeatedly insisted there was \"no collusion\" and has expressed deepening frustration with the ongoing investigation, which has led to a number of indictments of close Trump associates.\n\nThe episode also raised the broader issue of leaks, a subject that has animated Trump since he took office. Trump insisted early last year that senior White House officials sign non-disclosure agreements, according to two former senior administration officials, and after some resistance officials agreed, concluding the agreements would not be enforceable anyway.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley declined to discuss NDAs in detail earlier this week, but he said he had never been asked to sign one and had not signed one.\n\nOther prominent Republicans also slammed the leak of the Putin briefing materials.\n\n\"Who leaks this stuff?\" wrote former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer on Twitter. \"This WH still is disloyal to the president and to each other. What a mess.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with congratulating #Putin but bigger outrage is this leak that could only come from someone in @POTUS inner circle,\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) wrote on Twitter. \"If you don't like President resign, but this ongoing pattern of duplicity holds potential for serious damage to the nation.\"",

                "body": "Fifty-three percent of respondents to a new Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday said they disapprove of the way President Donald Trump is handling his job as president, the lowest that number has been in more than a year.\n\nTrump's 40 percent approval rating in the newly released poll is just two points shy of his high-water mark as president -- the 42 percent approval rating poll respondents gave him in early February, 2017. The president's approval rating is up 2 points relative to the previous Quinnipiac poll, released March 7, while his disapproval rating dropped 3 points over that same stretch.\n\nThe president's announcement earlier this month that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un earned a warm reception from poll respondents, with 66 percent of those polled saying they approve of the meeting and 24 percent saying they disapprove. Respondents were less bullish on Trump's ability to handle the North Korean situation, with just 46 percent responding that they have confidence in the president's ability to do so while 51 percent said they did not have confidence in Trump.\n\nOverall, 65 percent of those polled predicted the U.S. will solve its differences with North Korea diplomatically and 16 percent said the U.S. will need to use military force.\n\nTrump received poor reviews from those polled on other personal questions as well: 56 percent said he does not have good leadership skills, 64 percent said he is not level headed and 53 percent said he does not care about Average Americans. The president got better marks on questions of strength - 62 percent said he is a strong person - and intelligence, which 57 percent of respondents said he possesses.\n\nFifty percent of those polled said they are embarrassed to have Trump as president, while 30 percent of respondents said he makes them proud. Asked about the media, respondents disapproved by a 59-35 margin of the way it covers Trump. Fifty-eight percent said they disapprove of the way Trump talks about the media, while 38 percent approve of the president's rhetoric.\n\nWith the 2018 midterm elections approaching next fall, 68 percent of respondents said they disapprove of the job Republicans have done in Congress, while 63 percent said the same of Democrats. Forty-nine percent of respondents said they want Democrats to win control of the House of Representatives this November, compared to 43 percent who said the same of Republicans, a six-point margin down from 10 points on the same question in the Quinnipiac poll conducted two weeks ago.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted from March 16-20, reaching 1,291 voters nationwide via landlines and cell phones. The poll's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3.3 points.",

                "body": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time this year and signaled it will act more aggressively to head off inflation, potentially threatening President Donald Trump's hopes for faster economic growth.\n\nFed officials are now essentially split on the question of whether to hike interest rates a total of three times or four this year -- a response, in part, to recent tax cuts and increased spending by Congress, which the central bank fears could lead prices to spike.\n\nThe Fed's interest rate-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee, said in a statement that it expects inflation to reach its 2 percent target \"in the coming months.\" The committee unanimously agreed to raise its main borrowing rate to between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent, the first action taken under new Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nThere is some good news for Trump. Fed officials upgraded their forecast for economic growth this year and next, projecting a 2.7 percent increase in GDP in 2018 and a 2.4 percent increase in 2019. But over the longer term, the central bank still expects growth to hover at or below 2 percent.\n\nTrump is aiming for annual GDP growth of 3 percent.\n\n\"The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,\" the FOMC said in its statement.\n\nFed officials also projected unemployment would fall to 3.8 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, and then balance out at around 4.5 percent over the longer term. This would be the first time that the unemployment rate has dipped below 4 percent since the 1960s.\n\nAlthough the Fed's median projection is still for three rate hikes this year, four hikes are a very real possibility, since some of the central bank officials who are most vocal about waiting for further increases -- such as Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans -- are not voting members this year.\n\nThe Fed is also projecting three rather than two hikes for 2019.",

                "body": "Gov. Phil Bryant went ahead with his planned appointment of former Democrat Cindy Hyde-Smith.\n\nWhite House officials this week told Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant that President Donald Trump did not plan to campaign for or endorse Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith if she was appointed to the state's open Senate seat, saying they were worried that the former Democrat would lose.\n\nBryant responded that he intended to pick Hyde-Smith for the post, anyway. He went ahead and formally announced Hyde-Smith, who had previously been serving as the state agricultural commissioner, as his selection Wednesday, praising her \"intellect, compassion, toughness and determination to get things done.\"\n\nDuring a phone call Tuesday, administration officials told Bryant that Hyde-Smith's past history as a Democrat would hobble her in the special election contest for the seat being vacated by longtime GOP Sen. Thad Cochran. Hyde-Smith switched parties in 2010 while serving in the state Senate.\n\nThe conversation was described by two White House aides with direct knowledge of the call.\n\nThe message underscored the profound misgivings the administration and senior Republicans have about the Hyde-Smith pick.\n\nRepublicans are deeply concerned that Chris McDaniel, an anti-establishment conservative state senator who is running for the seat, will use Hyde-Smith's past party affiliation against her in the race. In recent days, the White House and other senior Republicans reviewed polling conducted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee showing Hyde-Smith in third place in a prospective match-up, trailing McDaniel and a prospective Democratic candidate.\n\nA spokesman for the governor, Clay Chandler, would only say that, \"Gov. Bryant isn't going to respond to leaks from unnamed sources in Washington.\"\n\n\"Today is about Mississippi making history, and Commissioner Cindy Hyde-Smith becoming Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith when she is sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence,\" he added.\n\nHyde-Smith and the NRSC did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump had initially lobbied Bryant to appoint himself to the seat, but the governor declined. Many in the party had hoped that Bryant would select Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann for the post. The White House has been in touch with the governor over the course of the past three weeks about his selection.\n\nWhile the president does not currently plan to endorse Hyde-Smith, the White House will continue to monitor the race, one of the administration officials said.\n\nAdministration officials do not want Trump to embarrass himself by weighing in for a candidate who is seriously hobbled. It was a scenario that played out in last year's Alabama Senate special election, when the president got behind appointed Sen. Luther Strange in a GOP runoff, only to see him fall short against former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore.\n\nWhite House aides briefed Trump on Tuesday prior to speaking with Bryant. They recommended that, for now, the president should not endorse or campaign for Hyde-Smith should she get the appointment. Trump, according to one person familiar with the conversation, did not object.\n\nThe 80-year-old Cochran earlier this month announced his resignation effective April 1, citing health problems. The decision set off a special election to be held on Nov. 6. The winner will serve out the remainder of Cochran's term, which expires in 2020.\n\nFollowing Cochran's announcement, McDaniel declared that he would be a candidate for the seat. McDaniel, who in 2014 waged a hard-fought but ultimately unsuccessful campaign against Cochran, had earlier launched a 2018 primary campaign against GOP Sen. Roger Wicker.\n\nBut with the president voicing his support for Wicker, McDaniel decided that running for the seat being vacated by Cochran would be a better play.",

                "body": "Congressional leaders have agreed to include $540 million in the federal spending bill that could be used to fund a portion of the massive Gateway tunnel project, according to two people close to the budget negotiations.\n\nThe still-tentative deal could offer an end-run around President Donald Trump, who had vowed to veto the spending bill if it included a $900 million earmark sought by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other New York and New Jersey lawmakers. Gateway, which calls for constructing two new tubes connecting New Jersey to midtown Manhattan and repairs on the existing tunnel that is now falling apart, is considered to be among the most pressing infrastructure projects in the nation.\n\nThe $540 million would not go directly to the project but would be kept out of the hands of the federal Department of Transportation, according to the sources, neither of whom was authorized to speak publicly.\n\nDOT Secretary Elaine Chao has put up numerous roadblocks to the project, including the rejection of an Obama-era deal in which the federal government was expected to cover half the cost of the project.\n\nUnder the terms agreed to by congressional leaders -- who are said to be closing in on a final, $1.3 trillion spending bill -- most of the $540 million would be provided to Amtrak for upgrades on the Northeast Corridor, according to one of the sources.\n\nThe funding bill will also provide $2.9 billion in discretionary grants to DOT that could be used to fund a portion of Gateway, the sources said. The Gateway builders, which include Amtrak and officials in New York and New Jersey, have already applied for some of those grants.\n\nThe current tunnel to Penn Station is more than a century old, damaged by Hurricane Sandy's flood waters and said to be at risk of failing within the next two decades. Taking just one tunnel out of service would reduce capacity to Penn Station by 75 percent, making it virtually impossible for NJ Transit's commuter trains to reach New York during peak travel times.\n\nEven more pressing is the work on the Portal Bridge project, a creaky old span that carries Northeast Corridor trains across the Hudson River. The work, estimated to cost $1.6 billion, could begin immediately when funding is made available.",

It invited him to speak at its annual Red, White and Blue Dinner at the Davenport Radisson.\n\n\"A lot of individuals are looking at him as a real leader in human rights and there was definitely interest in him,\" Gayman said. She added, however, \"I think people are still trying to figure out who's who, so it's more introductory.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who's also been mentioned as a potential candidate, will address the dinner as well.\n\nGarcetti built the trip around a visit to the new United Brotherhood of Carpenters\n\ntraining center in Altoona. The union is the single largest backer of Accelerator for America, and a big supporter of Garcetti.\n\nHe'll also scheduled to take a tour of Des Moines with Mayor Frank Cownie and will go to Waterloo, in the northeast of the state. His wife, Amy Elaine Wakefield, has family roots in the area, though she is not scheduled to join him for the trip.\n\n\"The thrust of the trip is to support our fellow Democrats in the run-up to the midterms, but Mayor Garcetti's also interested in hearing what's on people's minds across the country and exchanging ideas with Iowa residents and officials alike,\" said Garcetti adviser Yusef Robb, confirming the trip.\n\nGarcetti is also doing early state political maintenance at home in Los Angeles. On March 25 he's hosting a fundraiser for Jacky Rosen, the Democratic candidate for Senate from Nevada, and is in discussions to host a similar event for the South Carolina Democratic Party on May 15.",

                "body": "Congressional leaders -- at the urging of President Donald Trump -- have reached a tentative deal to pass modest gun legislation as part of a broader spending package, three sources familiar with the talks told POLITICO Wednesday.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) endorsed the inclusion of narrow, bipartisan legislation aimed at improving records and information-sharing in the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System -- even though gun control advocates say the provision barely moves the needle on firearms restrictions.\n\nIn return, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are discussing language allowing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence. A law banning gun control advocacy by the CDC, known as the Dickey Amendment, has long had a chilling effect on such research.\n\nThe details are still being hashed out, but the tentative accord is one of the final loose ends leaders must tie up in spending negotiations.\n\n\"I can't imagine Sen. Schumer saying no but until the ink is dry I'm not declaring victory,\" said one of the provision's main authors, No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn.\n\nThe government runs out of money at midnight on Friday. And while leadership sources say the deal is essentially finalized, 218 votes still need to be found in the House, and any one senator can hold up passage at least temporarily in the upper chamber.\n\nThe so-called FIX NICS bill would increase penalties on agencies that do not report sensitive information to the FBI's national background checks system that bars criminals as well as people with severe mental health conditions from purchasing a firearm. Cornyn of Texas and Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy introduced the bill after 26 churchgoers were killed last year.\n\nThe gunman had been discharged from the Air Force for domestic violence and should have been added to the criminal background check system but was not.\n\nTrump asked Congress to pass the bill, which is backed by the National Rifle Association, in the wake of the Parkland high school shooting in Florida. Republicans urged their Democratic colleagues to allow the text into the spending package -- even though Democrats argue it's unlikely to do much to curb mass shootings.\n\nDemocrats have called for expanding background checks to include sales online and at gun shows, and many want to reinstate the ban on assault rifles.\n\nIndeed, the gun issue remained a key holdup in the talks as Schumer pushed for more aggressive gun restrictions, according a source familiar with the talks. Murphy personally made the case to Democratic leadership to accept the compromise, even if it didn't go as far as they wanted, the person said.\n\nHouse conservatives are already balking. Members of the Freedom Caucus say GOP leaders promised them that the provision would only be considered alongside a gun-rights friendly measure to honor concealed carry permits across state lines.\n\n\"What we were told by our leadership is directly opposite what is happening today,\" Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) complained Wednesday.\n\nJordan said House leaders assured them they wouldn't decouple the two proposals, though others said they always expected leadership to reverse themselves.\n\n\"We all knew this was going to happen,\" said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) \"I don't think you'll find many Second Amendment conservatives who are clutching their pearls at this particular issue.\"",

Trump tightly controlled his image by insisting that everyone around him sign nondisclosure agreements threatening steep monetary penalties if they revealed anything about him or his company.\n\n\"So a few months into his presidency, Mr. Trump -- infuriated by leaks about everything from staff rivalries to his bathrobe-wearing, TV-viewing habits -- ordered Reince Priebus, then his chief of staff, to do the same thing in the West Wing.\n\n\"Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, had warned the president before that such a blanket policy could not be imposed on federal employees.

                "title": "The One Thing Trump Should Ask of Kim Jong Un",
                "body": "Behind closed doors at the White House and at the State Department, staffers are busily preparing for President Donald Trump's historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Who knows if the summit will really happen -- Kim has yet to RSVP to his own offer of talks -- but time is short. To turn this surprising opportunity into a deal, the U.S. will have to make smart decisions on a bevy of key questions. Among them: Where to meet, for how long, what to put on the table going in, and what to expect coming out.\n\nLet's start with where. Trump is a real estate guy, so he knows that a big score starts with location, location, location. Where should this meeting be held? Certainly not in Pyongyang or Washington, D.C.; the summit should occur on neutral ground. Panmunjom on the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea may be technically neutral, but would be a negative, backwards-looking backdrop for the gathering. The usual international locations for these sorts of talks are Geneva, or Oslo or even Paris. But a more imaginative choice would be Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. It would be more practical for Kim to travel to Hanoi than to Europe, and the symbolism of meeting in a communist country that reconciled with the United States after decades of hostility would set a positive tone.\n\nSecond, shorter is better. A session that lasts a day or more would provide too many opportunities to go down roads the United States and North Korea are not prepared to travel. These two enemies are not going to solve all of their problems in a single session. Better for this initial meeting to last only one or two hours -- just long enough for the leaders to meet, exchange pleasantries and agree upon a single, achievable goal.\n\nThird, be confident. To some degree, President Trump has already won. Kim made three concessions in suggesting the meeting. He committed to eventual denuclearization, pledged to cease missile and weapons tests, and stated his acceptance of the U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Trump's goal should be to build on those concessions and facilitate further progress in U.S.-DPRK relations and denuclearization.\n\nFourth, keep expectations low. It's tempting to get caught up in the historical drama of the moment and dream of massive, quick breakthroughs. That would be a mistake. The North Koreans are already taking a big step by even sitting down with leader of the hated United States, let alone by offering concessions. They are not about to roll their nuclear weapons into the room and say, \"Here, we're done with these.\" Kim may very well make some demands of his own, demands that should be viewed with skepticism and caution.\n\nThe fifth and final step: Establish a permanent diplomatic presence in each country. This should be President Trump's singular goal for the meeting. After all, the United States needs a diplomatic mission in Pyongyang, and should welcome the North Korean office in Washington. For now, these would be liaison offices -- not formal diplomatic recognition. The two offices would offer a means for direct communication, through which the two countries can embark on the detailed work required to make real progress on denuclearization. Additionally, the staffs should be tasked with beginning the long process of normalization of relations between the United States and North Korea.\n\nSome will argue that this is a concession to Kim, a dictator who abuses his own people and menaces the world with unhinged threats. That view couldn't be more wrong. Setting up more reliable communications channels is a necessary step to continue moving back from the nuclear brink and change the paradigm on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nOf course, closing this deal with North Korea will require conditions. Kim must understand that the terms of that agreement include continued adherence to his three prior pledges, and further, real progress on denuclearization. Those must be preconditions to any relaxation of sanctions and other measures, with the understanding, as the [resident tweeted, that the U.S. remains prepared \"to go hard in either direction!\"",

                "body": "The social media company has become a rogue actor, accountable to nobody.\n\nFacebook is flailing amid the fallout from revelations about the alleged misuse of user data by Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign's 2016 data firm, dating back to 2014.\n\nBut the narrow focus on Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign misses the broader problem with Facebook, and lacks fundamental context. Facebook is, to put the matter bluntly, a deeply un-transparent, out-of-control company that encroaches on its users' privacy, resists regulatory oversight and fails to police known bad actors when they abuse its platform.\n\nAnd it's not just Republicans who have taken advantage of Facebook's invasive features. Far from it: During the 2012 campaign, President Obama's re-election team built an app that extracted the same types of data in the same fashion as the Cambridge Analytica data in question, with one critical difference: Obama's team extracted nearly five times the information.\n\nAccording to Carol Davidsen, a member of Obama's data team, \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn't stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.\" The social graph is Facebook's map of relationships between users and brands on its platform. And after the election, she recently acknowledged, Facebook was \"very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.\"\n\nThere's been no word on whether the Obama team was asked to delete their data, nor have they been suspended from Facebook.\n\nI've experienced Facebook's ineptitude and inconsistent policy enforcement firsthand, having served as digital director to Ed Gillespie's 2014 Senate campaign, Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign and, most recently, Gillespie's 2017 campaign for governor. For example, in the 2017 Virginia Republican primary, on February 15, I flagged for Facebook's political team a post from a page supporting our opponent, Corey Stewart, that shared a link to a Washington Post article, but with an altered headline that gave users the impression that it was a legitimate headline from the Washington Post.\n\nThe actual headline, referring to Corey Stewart, read: \"Protesters mob provocative Va. governor candidate [Stewart] as he defends Confederate statue,\" but the page used Facebook's headline editing feature (which has since been deactivated because of this incident) to say, \"Gillespie: I'm OK with Charlottesville Taking Down the General Lee Monument.\"\n\nIt was the clearest case of false news I've seen and a perfect microcosm of the tactics that were employed by foreign actors during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nFor weeks, while this inaccurate headline was promoted to voters, misrepresenting Gillespie's position on a hot-button issue via Facebook ads, I was told by members of Facebook's U.S. Politics & Government Outreach team that nothing could be done. Finally, on March 21, 2017, when a reporter from the Associated Press contacted Facebook, the company decided that the post \"violated Facebook's terms of not doing 'anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.'\" To my knowledge, Facebook never returned the money it received for the ads that violated its own policies.\n\nThe most frustrating aspect of dealing with Facebook is its infuriating inconsistency. The platform's terms of service are a sledgehammer when they need it, but company executives apply them sparingly and without any clear consistency. Only when Facebook is confronted with the possibility of public scrutiny and bad coverage will they take action to do the right thing.\n\nFacebook knew about the hundreds of apps that were extracting massive amounts of social graph data about its users dating back to its earliest days. Now faced with a whistleblower, media exposés and a parliamentary inquiry, Facebook is only now taking action against a single entity for an incident that occured years ago.\n\nThere's a constant thread, too, throughout all of Facebook's scandals, including the mishandling of the Russian interference in the 2016 election: It is an appallingly terrible corporate citizen.\n\nFacebook makes millions of dollars every day selling its users' personal information, interests, political persuasions, location data, social relationships and internet history to advertisers who mix their content in with users' videos, photos, and posts. In return, users receive none of the revenue and yet bear many of the well-documented adverse effects, which include decreased wellbeing and self esteem, lost friendships and a degraded civil society. Facebook has repeatedly shown itself incapable of behaving as a good corporate citizen and thus it is time the company is regulated and broken up.\n\nI don't want to tar all of Silicon Valley with the same brush. New regulations can be narrowly targeted to Facebook, given its size and scope as a platform without hampering innovators across the industry who are behaving responsibly and ethically. Facebook has duopoly status (along with Google) in the advertising market, effective monopoly in the social media space and monopolies in many markets with its messaging platforms, like WhatsApp.\n\nRegulation should include limits on the information Facebook may gather on its users and subsequently sell to advertisers, greater oversight and transparency related to its compliance with federal election laws and more cooperation with researchers about the adverse effects of its various platforms on individuals and communities. More broadly, the government should begin looking into breaking Facebook apart into smaller entities to allow for greater competition and more consumer-friendly practices in the online advertising, publishing and communications spaces.\n\nFor conservatives like me, it's not easy to call for increased regulation and antitrust enforcement, but Facebook has shown time and again that its leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg himself, aren't capable of responsibly wielding their immense power and influence in Americans' lives.",

                "body": "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his wife took security detail on their vacation to Greece and Turkey last year, official documents show, in what one watchdog group said could be a \"questionable\" use of taxpayer resources.\n\nZinke has faced questions for months over his travel expenses and use of official resources, as have other members of President Donald Trump's administration such as EPA leader Scott Pruitt, who was revealed Tuesday to have spent $30,000 on security for an official trip to Italy last year.\n\nUnlike Pruitt, Zinke was not conducting government business during his two-week vacation, which included stops in Istanbul and the Greek Isles. The documents do not reveal exactly how many security personnel accompanied the couple, who paid for them, how much they cost or whether they traveled with Zinke and his wife, Lola, for the entire trip.\n\nAn Interior spokeswoman did not immediately answer questions on how much the security detail cost or why Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, required one for a European vacation -- even with a history of ISIS attacks in Turkey.\n\nOnly two agencies -- the State Department and the Secret Service -- have specific authority allowing them to provide security to executive branch officials, according to a Government Accountability Office report. Despite that, Cabinet members in the 1990s came under scrutiny for traveling with security teams, a matter the GAO reported on in 1994.\n\n\"It's not necessarily an abuse of authority or a waste of taxpayer dollars if there's a credible threat, but it can be questionable if an agency chief just wants a big entourage and the trappings of power,\" said Nick Schwellenbach, director of investigations at the government watchdog group Project On Government Oversight. \"Security personnel are not errand boys or girls and agency leaders are not royalty.\"\n\nHe added: \"When it's a private vacation, there must be even more scrutiny given to these security arrangements than usual.\"\n\nObama administration Interior Secretary Sally Jewell abstained from traveling with security teams, particularly on private travel, said Kate Kelly, who served as senior adviser to Jewell and is now director of the public lands program at the Center for American Progress.\n\n\"I think, in her mind, it would have defeated the point of 'getting away' and would have amounted to a totally unnecessary expense to taxpayers,\" Kelly said.\n\nTraveling with security staff even on official business is \"incredibly expensive,\" although the actual cost would depend on the nature of the trip and which department supplied the detail, said Chris Lu, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia's Miller Center who was a White House Cabinet administrator during the Obama administration.\n\nCabinet secretaries who required security for official travel would generally take two security personnel, one a \"body man\" who would stay close to the secretary and one \"advance\" who would arrange things at the destination, Lu said. The advance person would help a Cabinet secretary bypass the regular airport security lines and customs, pick the secretary up at the airport and drive him or her to the hotel and other destinations, said one source familiar with the process.\n\nIf safety was an issue in a foreign country, the department in question would have been expected to rely on the U.S. embassy in that country to provide security, Lu said.\n\n\"Unless there's a compelling national security justification, a Cabinet member should not bring a security detail on a personal vacation,\" Lu said. \"We would not have allowed this practice during the Obama administration. The U.S. Treasury should not be your personal piggy bank.\"\n\nThe emails from Interior Special Assistant to the Secretary Caroline Boulton show that multiple members of a security team, one of whom was sent to the region in advance, were given temporary cell phones through which Zinke could contact them while there. One security team member was flagged in the email to be in Turkey in advance.\n\n\"For contacting your detail when they're with you in Europe, these will be their temporary numbers,\" Boulton wrote to Zinke on Aug. 3, the day before he was scheduled to leave. (The numbers themselves were redacted before Interior made the emails public as part of a batch of records it recently released under the Freedom of Information Act.)\n\nAccording to an itinerary, Zinke arrived in Istanbul on Aug. 5 following an overnight flight from Washington and met his wife, Lola, who had been visiting Italy for the previous three weeks. The trip included \"courtesy\" visits with U.S. diplomats stationed in Istanbul and Athens, but the couple spent most of their time vacationing before returning to Washington on Aug. 19.\n\nLola Zinke shared photos of their vacation on her Twitter page and wrote that the couple was celebrating 25 years of marriage.\n\nAt the time of the trip, Interior would say only that Zinke was out of the country and provided no indication of when he left or would return. The vacation coincided with the tail end of the period Zinke had set aside to review national monument borders for a report he submitted to Trump on whether some of the protected areas should be shrunk. He supplied a draft to the White House later in the month, missing the deadline for a final report.\n\nZinke has already come under fire for mixing personal and official Interior business. Interior's inspector general is scheduled to release its findings on his attendance at political events while on official travel around the middle of next month.",

                "body": "A federal judge has dismissed former Trump adviser Carter Page's legal claims over a September 2016 Yahoo news article that revealed he was under U.S. government scrutiny over his ties to Russia.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lorna Schofield rejected a portion of a lawsuit Page filed without an attorney last year seeking damages against Yahoo's parent company Oath over the 2016 story by veteran investigative reporter Michael Isikoff.\n\nSchofield's ruling issued Tuesday came largely on technical grounds. She said the article could not be considered a violation of a federal law known as the Anti-Terrorism Act, despite Page's claim that the story, headlined \"U.S. intel officials probe ties between Trump adviser and Kremlin\" resulted in death threats against him.\n\nHowever, Schofield noted that Page never really argued that the Yahoo story was false.\n\n\"The Article does not say that Plaintiff actually met with....two Russians, but rather that U.S. officials had received reports of such meetings,\" wrote Schofield, an Obama appointee based in Manhattan. \"The substance and even headline of the Article express uncertainty about the occurrence and substance of any such meetings. That some readers may have assumed that the meetings occurred does not constitute fraud by the Article's publisher.\"\n\nIndeed, the 2016 Yahoo story appears to have been accurate. A House Republican memo declassified by President Donald Trump last month shows that Just weeks after the Yahoo story was published, the FBI sought and obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for Page's communications because of suspicions that he was a conduit for Russian intelligence services.\n\nPage's prolix legal pleadings also included a more pedestrian defamation claim and one for interference with his business dealings, based on both the Yahoo article and various Huffington Post stories. The judge dismissed those claims as well, saying those were state law issues. She didn't rule out considering a revised version of Page's suit, but was dubious about such an effort, saying it would likely be \"futile.\"\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, Page argued that the judge was misled by high-powered lawyers for Oath. He also took shots at former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump last year, and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired last week by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\n\"Similar to the slick maneuvers by Comey & McCabe in the FISC over recent years, clever lawyers for powerful entities often manage to briefly pull the wool over the eyes of busy District Court Judges,\" Page wrote. \"My future updated Complaint will shine an honest light and help restore justice.\"\n\nA spokesman for Oath declined to comment on the ruling, citing a policy against commenting on pending litigation.\n\nA portion of Page's suit against the U.S. government Board of Broadcasting Governors over Radio Free Europe news broadcasts he contends libeled and endangered him remains pending. That part of the suit seems likely to be dismissed as well, because damage claims against the federal government generally have to be formally demanded from the agencies involved before going to court.",

                "body": "TALLAHASSEE -- The Scott administration quickly worked to distance itself from the collapse of a Florida International University pedestrian bridge that left six dead, but documents from the state's transportation department and the university paint a different picture.\n\nFrom the selection of the politically powerful firm that led the project to the days leading up to the collapse, the Florida Department of Transportation, overseen by Gov. Rick Scott, had direct involvement in a project whose collapse has rocked South Florida and sparked a federal investigation.\n\n\"It's not an FDOT project,\" Scott said during a press conference the night the bridge fell. \"It's an FIU project.\"\n\nAs recently as September 2016, though, more than 10 months after the selection of the firms to design and build the project, his transportation agency was reviewing all construction-related material.\n\n\"The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) is currently reviewing 100% of CD [construction documents] for the bridge foundation, roadway and superstructure,\" read a Sept. 1, 2016 agenda for the FIU Board of Trustees Finance and Audit Committee.\n\nDuring that meeting, the committee received an update on the \"University City Prosperity Project.\" The idea behind the project was to build a pedestrian bridge over SW 8th Street connecting the university and the city of Sweetwater.\n\nThe department quickly sought to distance itself from the March 15 collapse, sending out a \"preliminary fact sheet\" hours after the disaster saying it was a \"local agency project, not a Florida Department of Transportation project.\"\n\nEven under the department's own guidelines, though -- under the so-called local agency projects they administer -- FDOT has oversight responsibility.\n\n\"The FDOT is not relieved of oversight and monitoring responsibilities by certifying a Local Agency,\" reads the department's Local Agency Program Manual.\n\nPOLITICO provided FDOT a list of questions along with all documents used as part of this story. The department in response issued a statement saying it \"coordinates\" with certified local agencies, but said it was not involved in specific details.\n\nFDOT's \"Structure Design Office does not review the engineering calculations or perform an in-depth review of the engineering decisions or administer the construction of the project,\" read the statement, which was much more nuanced than the agency's original public statements on the project.\n\nFrom the start, the department's local agency manual indicates it should have had a role in the process. District FDOT staff must \"review all back-up documentation\" after a bid is awarded to the vendor, and it must \"review and concur with award recommendation in writing.\"\n\nIn November 2015, FDOT also sent a letter specifically concurring with FIU's decision to hire design-build team MCM-FIGG Bridge Engineers, Inc.\n\nMCM has long had local political ties and is also a player on the statewide level. During the time MCM, a Miami-based firm, was seeking the bid, the company gave nearly $50,000 in contributions to Scott or his affiliated political committee, according to state campaign finance records. The decision to hire the firm was made by FIU, but Scott's transportation agency was involved from the very beginning of that process. It's among $250,000 in state political contributions the company has given in recent election cycles.\n\nThe Miami Herald also reported last week that FDOT was part of the committee that selected MCM-FIGG, attended regular meeting on the project and had input on design and location, had input on dozens of planning details and had officials at a meeting with engineers hours before the bridge collapsed.\n\nThe Scott administration doubled down on its contention that it carried no blame for the collapse one day after the tragedy, issuing a statement that an engineer from FIGG, a lead firm on the project, called an FDOT official two days before the collapse indicating \"cracking has been observed\" in the bridge. That call, FDOT says, went to a landline of an official out of the office, and was not received until after the collapse. The department hammered the engineering firm for the tragic mishap.\n\n\"The responsibility to identify and address life-safety issues and property communicate them is the sole responsibility of the FIU design build team,\" read the FDOT statement. \"At no point during any of the communications above did FIGG or any member of the FIU design build team ever communicate a life-safety issue.\"\n\nThe statement also noted the firms never requested a permit to get full closure of the street below during construction of the walkway.\n\nFIGG declined comment for this story, while MCM and FIU said they could not comment because of an ongoing federal investigation.\n\n\"As you know, the National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a thorough investigation,\" said Maydel Santana, an FIU spokeswoman. \"We are cooperating [with] and assisting authorities fully in the effort to understand what happened.\"",

And while it grapples with this blowback, company chief Mark Zuckerberg has remained quiet on the matter. Facebook held an internal town hall on the subject on Tuesday, but Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg were no-shows at that gathering.\n\n-- Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) are among the lawmakers pressing Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs to hit the Hill for a hearing, Ashley and Nancy report. \"I think it would be helpful to have them weigh in,\" Blackburn, who chairs Energy and Commerce's telecom subcommittee, told John on Tuesday. \"We need to understand how they use the data that they mine from users, their personal information,\" said Cornyn.\n\n-- Facebook's got some briefings lined up: While it may not be sending its top executive, the company is dispatching some representatives to Congress this week to participate in a series of briefings scheduled with the Intelligence, Commerce and Judiciary panels in both chambers, Ashley and Nancy report. The company is also holding a nationwide briefing by phone Thursday for state attorneys general, a company spokesperson confirms. Several AGs have begun raising concerns, and those in New York and Massachusetts sent a letter Tuesday asking questions. \"We appreciate their attention to this matter and look forward to responding,\" Facebook Vice President Will Castleberry said.\n\n-- Privacy groups put pressure on FTC's Facebook probe: A collection of privacy organizations including EPIC and the Center for Digital Democracy are throwing their backing behind the FTC's probe of Facebook's potential violations of a 2011 agreement it made with the agency. Under a 2011 consent decree with the FTC, Facebook agreed to get express permission and notify users before sharing their data with third parties. The social network could face massive fines if the FTC determines it violated the terms of the agreement. The agency has begun a review of Facebook's adherence to the consent decree in light of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n-- \"Facebook's transfer of personal data to Cambridge Analytica was prohibited by the 2011 Facebook Order,\" the groups argue. \"The FTC's failure to enforce its order has resulted in the unlawful transfer of 50 million user records to a controversial data mining firm to influence a presidential election.\"\n\n-- And another one: \"My view, based on what has been publicly disclosed, is that Cambridge Analytica's acquisition of personal information from as many as 50 million Facebook users likely violated Facebook's consent decree with the FTC,\" said David Vladeck, a former director of the agency's bureau of consumer protection, who helped develop the 2011 agreement.\n\n-- And that's not all: Brian Acton, a co-founder of the Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp, is rallying people to delete Facebook. Acton left WhatsApp last year to build a foundation.\n\nFOSTA FINISH LINE -- The Senate could vote today on an anti-sex-trafficking bill (H.R. 1865 (115)) that's agitated some of the tech industry. The legislation, dubbed FOSTA, would hold companies like Facebook and Google accountable for knowingly publishing content that helps facilitate sex trafficking, and amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the process. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a longtime opponent of the bill, argues that it could hurt smaller websites and make it tougher to catch bad actors. He's proposed amendments that would set up funding for prosecuting traffickers and offer additional legal cover for sites that are pursuing traffickers in good faith, both of which will be debated on the floor today. SESTA (S. 1693 (115)), FOSTA's upper chamber counterpart, has more than 65 cosponsors, a sign that the bill has a strong chance of sailing through the Senate and heading to President Donald Trump's desk.

Opening arguments in the Justice Department's legal effort to halt the AT&T-Time Warner merger have been postponed until Thursday due to winter weather forecasts. Attorneys have spent the past two days sparring over evidence and tomorrow will have 45 minutes apiece to formally kick things off. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes were slated to attend today.\n\nJOUROVA'S ITINERARY -- EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova is due to discuss her swing through the U.S. during a briefing this afternoon that will touch on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the CLOUD Act. While in town, Jourova has meetings set up with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). According to a Reuters report, Jourova planned to talk about the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica revelations during meetings with U.S. officials.\n\nSHAKING UP THE BROADCAST CAP DEBATE -- The ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC affiliates are floating a new two-tiered idea for how the FCC should address the 39 percent cap limiting the number of households a single broadcaster is allowed to reach. The FCC should \"modify the national audience reach cap as it applies to non-Big-Four network-owned stations while retaining the current 39 percent cap as it applies to the networks,\" they recommended Tuesday. \"Such a tiered cap is necessary to ensure that the Commission's ownership rules continue to serve their intended purpose: to protect and promote localism by maintaining an appropriate balance of power between national networks and local, non-network-owned stations.\" That two-tiered approach differs from what the National Association of Broadcasters advocated: retain the 39 percent limit but count all TV stations at 50 percent reach (currently the FCC discounts the reach of UHF stations by half but not VHF).\n\n-- That regulatory loophole known as the \"UHF discount\" made headlines last year, recall, because it enabled Sinclair Broadcast Group to make its bid for Tribune Media, which would reach more than 70 percent of U.S. households if approved. Sinclair suggests the FCC kill any limits and, if it does remove the UHF loophole, grandfather in existing ownership calculation for the purpose of pending mergers. Several groups resist any relaxation of these rules because, as Consumers Union put it in comments, it \"does not believe the cap is an antiquated notion from a bygone era; rather, that is how we view the UHF discount.\"\n\nLOBBYIST FOR HIRE -- Ligado Networks, the telecom company formerly known as LightSquared, has tapped Justin Lilley of TeleMedia Policy Corp. to lobby on \"legislative and regulatory matters relating to telecommunications and wireless spectrum,\" per a registration filing.

Immigration has been one of the biggest sticking points, with Republicans and Democrats trading offers across Tuesday.\n\nNEW CDC CHIEF EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED TODAY -- Robert Redfield, the Baltimore-based AIDS researcher, is the Trump administration's choice. POLITICO on Friday scooped that Redfield was favored for the role.\n\n-- Critics point to Redfield's record in AIDS research. Specifically, they seize on an episode more than 20 years ago, when Redfield oversaw a failed effort at Walter Reed to develop an AIDS vaccine. A whistle-blower who came forward this week said Redfield's handling of study data left questions about his trustworthiness. The Army later acknowledged there were accuracy issues with Redfield's work, but it didn't find misconduct.\n\n\"Either he was egregiously sloppy with data or it was fabricated,\" former Air Force Lt. Col. Craig Hendrix, a doctor who is now at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told Kaiser Health News. More.\n\n-- But Elijah Cummings gave a vote of support. The Maryland Democrat says he fully supports \"this deeply experienced and compassionate public health physician.\"\n\n\"Although I seldom agree with the Trump administration, I am in complete agreement that Dr. Bob Redfield is the best choice to lead the CDC,\" Cummings said in a statement. \"Bob has devoted his life to improving the public health, including leading PEPFAR efforts around the world and as the clinical head of the Institute of Human Virology in Baltimore fighting the HIV and Hepatitis C epidemics in this region.\"\n\n** A message from PhRMA: Analysis finds commercially insured patients at 340B hospitals are prescribed more medicines and/or more expensive medicines.

But in 24 years, federal prosecutors have never once used it, POLITICO's Arthur Allen writes.\n\nThey hardly need to, considering the draconian penalties already available for punishing convicted drug smugglers. But even the most aggressive prosecutors believed the death penalty for these cases would be found to violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, experts said. More for Pros.\n\n-- Meanwhile: Many Americans oppose the idea. That's according to a Morning Consult/POLITICO poll of nearly 2,000 voters, out this morning. While 47 percent of respondents favored the death penalty for people convicted of large scale drug trafficking, only 29 percent of voters favor the death penalty for people convicted of local drug dealing.\n\nWELCOME TO WEDNESDAY PULSE -- Where the late-night Illinois returns had a couple of nuggets for health wonks.

That means reversing the cuts would force Medicare to reprocess a large chunk of the 100 million hospital outpatient claims it annually pays, which the agency says would wreak havoc on its operations and providers. HHS made a similar argument to a lower court in December, and it said Congress also outlined in law that Medicare's hospital payment rates couldn't be challenged in court, a legal barrier that invalidates the hospitals' 340B lawsuit. HHS's arguments.\n\n-- Details on the case: Hospitals are challenging the Trump administration's rule cutting payments for certain drugs in the program by 28.5 percent, arguing that the move flouts congressional intent for 340B program.

Tune in to \"Avoiding 911 - How to Improve Health Care in Nursing Homes and Bend the Cost Curve\" at 8:00 a.m. Watch live here.\n\nHOW HHS VIEWS OPIOID TREATMENT DRUGS -- POLITICO's Sarah Karlin-Smith dug into why Trump's opioid plan singled out naltrexone as a treatment for opioid-addicted prisoners, given that a federally funded study recently found that naltrexone and the much cheaper buprenorphine were similarly effective in treating opioid addiction.\n\nAlex Azar: Naltrexone is 'best option' for opioid treatment in prison, post-detox. That's what the HHS secretary told reporters on Tuesday, although he added that HHS supports all forms of FDA-approved medication assisted therapy, especially for different populations.\n\nAsked why the president's opioid plan specifically mentioned only naltrexone (Alkermes' Vivitrol), Azar initially said he believed it was an oversight, before offering an update that the preference came from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration.\n\n-- Meanwhile, the NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse doesn't \"favor one drug over the other\" given different patient responses and ongoing research into treatment, said director Nora Volkow.\n\nAnd speaking of the NIH...\n\nAn opioid vaccine in the works? That's what Volkow said on Tuesday, noting that vaccines against heroin and fentanyl have been successful in animals and the NIH is working to bring them to humans.\n\nWhat Francis Collins shared: Thirty-three companies also have expressed interest in working with NIH to develop non-opioid, non-addictive alternatives to treat pain, said Collins, adding that an in-development work plan would \"involve sharing of information in very unprecedented ways.\" NIH is also trying to develop a biomarker to measure pain, so caregivers don't have to rely on \"smiley face\" assessments from patients rating their pain.\n\nAZAR SAYS HIS DRUG PRICING PLAN WILL BE DIFFERENT -- For one, Azar noted he wasn't at HHS when previous proposals were laid out by the White House and the agency.\n\nHe added that the plan teased by the White House this week will include \"additional actions as well as thoughts and request for input,\" which could signal formal requests for information or advanced notices of proposed rulemaking. Azar says he's aiming to tackle two issues - getting the best net price deals for government programs and private insurers as well as bringing list prices down after years of increases. But no other hints on specific policies from the HHS secretary, Sarah reports.\n\nFamily doctors to HHS: We're worried about push for 'conscience' expansion. That's what American Academy of Family Physicians board chair John Meigs, Jr., writes to HHS Secretary Alex Azar, offering comment on the agency's new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division.\n\nHHS has said its new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division is necessary to protect health care workers from being compelled to participate in medical procedures that violate their religious or moral beliefs.\n\nWhile AAFP supports physicians declining to participate in a procedure, with adequate notice, the organization doesn't support denying access to care to an individual patient on religious, ethical or moral grounds.

A handful of thorny issues continue to dog the bill -- one of which is, you guessed it, the $900 million in Gateway funding over which President Donald Trump has threatened a veto. When asked Tuesday about Trump's opposition to funding Gateway, spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded: \"The president specifically wants to address infrastructure on a broader scale, not put all our emphasis into one project. We certainly want to see the infrastructure across this country rebuilt, which is why we put forward priorities when it comes to that in a plan moving forward.\" When asked Tuesday about Trump's opposition to funding Gateway, spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded: \"The president specifically wants to address infrastructure on a broader scale, not put all our emphasis into one project. We certainly want to see the infrastructure across this country rebuilt, which is why we put forward priorities when it comes to that in a plan moving forward.\"\n\nWaiting for Godot: For his part, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has kept his powder dry on the $900 million New York and New Jersey lawmakers want to steer toward the mega-project as part of the omnibus, repeatedly refusing in recent days to go beyond voicing support for it. \"I'm not gonna get into a back and forth with the president,\" Schumer told reporters Tuesday when asked why Trump has objected to the Gateway funding.\n\nDON'T FAA-GET ABOUT ME: An FAA extension is still in play, but Sen.

Fifty-six percent of freight-owned route miles were PTC-operable by the end of 2017, compared to just 24 percent (the same as in the third quarter of that year) on the passenger side. Fifteen of the 41 railroads subject to the mandate reported having all necessary PTC hardware installed; another 12 are at least 75 percent done. Read through the tables here.\n\nUs too: Meanwhile, NJ Transit officials said Tuesday they think they're making good headway on complying with the mandate, the initial deadline for which is Dec. 31. The agency met with officials from FRA, Amtrak, Metro-North and Conrail last week, POLITICO New Jersey's Ryan Hutchins writes. \"I think they were pleasantly surprised with what we came with: a plan for how we're going to do that,\" Executive Director Kevin Corbett said.\n\nGive us the deets: Thune and Sen. Bill Nelson, his Democratic counterpart on the Commerce Committee, sent a letter to FRA Administrator Ron Batory Tuesday asking the agency to divulge \"detailed\" descriptions of its plans to review PTC safety plans, test waivers and revenue service demonstration applications. They also pressed FRA to describe how it will provide guidance to railroads on alternative criteria passenger outfits could meet to qualify for extensions, as well as how regulators expect to handle any that don't qualify for a grace period.\n\nIG REVIEW REQUESTED FOR BRIDGE COLLAPSE: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao wants a DOT inspector general probe into the pedestrian bridge collapse in Florida.

Bill Nelson asked the IG to include him on the request and to also evaluate how the Florida Department of Transportation and DOT oversaw the project.\n\nQuick draw: Inspector General Calvin Scovel III promptly responded to Nelson Tuesday. \"Given its safety sensitivity, we have made this matter a top priority and expect to formally announce the scope and objectives of our review and begin our audit work as soon as possible,\" he wrote.\n\nDocument dump: The Associated Press obtained documents showing that a design change made to the structure contributed to the project being behind schedule and over budget. \"Though it is still unclear if the design change played a role in the failure, emails between the school, contractors, officials with the city of Sweetwater and permitting agencies show a project that ended up behind schedule, which had officials worried that further delays could jeopardize millions in federal Department of Transportation funds\" through the TIGER program, the AP reported Tuesday. Another source of delays, per the report, was a \"bottleneck\" at the Army Corps of Engineers, which had stopped doling out permits due to budget cuts.\n\nBARKLEY'S NEWS CORNER: United Airlines announced Tuesday that it's suspending its animal shipment service while it conducts \"a thorough and systematic review\" over the next six weeks. The airline's PetSafe program is tailored toward animals that can't travel in a plane's cabin -- The Washington Post writes that the German shepherd that flew to Japan instead of Kansas City last week was transported under that program.

And we were waiting well into the night for results out of DuPage County.\n\n-- \"Lipinski beats Newman in Illinois Democratic slugfest,\" by Campaign Pro's Elena Schneider and Daniel Strauss: \"Rep. Dan Lipinski, an avid foe of abortion rights and one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, fended off a fierce challenge from the left on Tuesday night in Illinois, all but assuring an eighth term in Congress.\"\n\n-- Illinois voters also set the stage for the most expensive gubernatorial race in the nation's history. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner narrowly defeated state legislator Jeanne Ives, 52 to 48 percent. It was a surprisingly strong showing for Ives, who attacked Rauner as insufficiently conservative, and a worrisome sign for the incumbent governor. Billionaire J.B. Pritzker, who sunk $70 million into his bid, easily clinched the Democratic nomination against several liberal opponents.\n\nIL-04: 2015 Chicago mayor candidate Chuy Garcia easily won the Democratic nomination to replace retiring Rep. Luis Gutiérrez.\n\nIL-06: As of 5:30 a.m. Eastern, Kelly Mazeski held a 260-vote lead over Sean Casten in the Democratic primary to take on GOP Rep. Peter Roskam. But a significant number of precincts were still not reporting in DuPage County, which cited \"certain technical difficulties ... in closing the precincts, unrelated to the Ballot Tabulation\" for the delay.\n\nIL-10: Consultant Doug Bennett narrowly captured the GOP nomination to face Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider. Bennett defeated attorney Jeremy Wynes by just 259 votes.\n\nIL-12: St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly cruised to the Democratic nomination and will face GOP Rep.

National and local operatives believe that the new map, drawn by a court-ordered special master in January, will give Democrats an advantage in flipping a handful of seats in 2018, aiding their effort to retake the majority in Congress. Republicans appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the imposition of the new map, but the court denied that request earlier this week. ... A whopping 14 Democrats are now running for Republican Rep. Pat Meehan's now-open seat (PA-05), which will likely turn into a safely Democratic seat under the new lines.\" Full story.\n\nFIRST IN SCORE -- DSCC raises $5.1 million in February: The DSCC raised $5.1 million in February and has $25.7 million on hand.

Phil Bryant is expected to appoint state Agriculture Commissioner Cindy Hyde-Smith to the Senate seat being vacated next month by GOP Sen. Thad Cochran, according to multiple Republicans with knowledge of the governor's plans. Bryant has narrowed his shortlist in recent days. He said Monday that he wouldn't appoint Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves to the seat, leaving Hyde-Smith and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann as the two most commonly mentioned names.\" Full story.\n\n-- How do Republicans feel about the appointment? Expect the party establishments in both D.C. and Mississippi to line up behind Hyde-Smith after her appointment today. But that doesn't mean there isn't any grumbling. Hyde-Smith was a Democrat until 2010, and voted in the 2008 Democratic primary, which Bryant and his team believe won't be an issue in her race against state Sen. Chris McDaniel and Democrat Mike Espy. D.C. Republicans are more skeptical, but trust Bryant's judgment, noting he's personally interviewed and vetted each potential senator. And while McDaniel was a Trump skeptic during much of the 2016 GOP presidential primary, Hyde-Smith was an enthusiastic supporter and a member of the campaign's agricultural advisory committee.\n\nTRENDWATCH -- \"Democratic Campaigns Start Unionizing in #MeToo Era,\" by Roll Call's Eric Garcia: \"So far, six congressional campaigns, all for Democratic candidates, have unionized.

Joe Manchin, Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp all had records warranting close to the 70 percent score that earns a reelection endorsement from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But all three ended up with identical 53 percent scores in 2017, according to the new Chamber scorecard released Tuesday. Heitkamp now has a 68 percent lifetime score, while Manchin is at 58 percent and Donnelly is at 65 percent. One Democrat running for Senate, Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, has a 75 percent score in 2017 and 76 percent lifetime score. But one of her potential GOP opponents, Rep. Martha McSally, had a 93 percent in 2017 and a 98 percent lifetime.

                "body": "With help from Eric Geller, Martin Matishak and John Hendel\n\nKICKING THE TIRES -- The Senate Intelligence Committee convenes this morning to get feedback on its raft of bipartisan election security recommendations, unveiled Tuesday. At the hearing, the proposals -- which range from specific measures like creating a voluntary state grant program to high-level guidance such as enhancing cyber threat information sharing between D.C. and the states -- will be put to the test via current and former Department of Homeland Security leaders, state election administrators and national election experts.\n\nBut early returns from the election community are encouraging. While many of the proposals looked familiar -- reflecting not only the persistent advice of cyber and election security experts but even a pre-existing Senate bill -- that's not necessarily a bad thing, said former DHS Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute, now president at security firm SICPA. \"I'm not disappointed that it's predictable,\" she told MC. \"Some things that are obvious need saying, and they need to be said by authoritative voices.\"\n\nStates, too -- sometimes resistant to federal election security assistance as potentially intrusive of their turf -- were mostly positive. \"I think it's not just a step in the right direction but a timely one,\" Alex Padilla, California's Democratic secretary of state, told MC. \"The sense of urgency is clear to secretaries of state across the country, and I'm hoping this is an indicator that it's not just important but urgent for Congress to act as well.\" Maria Benson, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Secretaries of State, told MC that states \"are already implementing many, if not all,\" of the panel's recommendations, as her organization will testify today.\n\nIt's not all sunny, though. \"One glaring omission is any call for voting system vendors and service contractors to take more responsibility for systems security, including periodically subjecting their code and maintenance systems to independent third-party security testing and providing those results to state election officials,\" said Bruce McConnell, a former DHS deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity and global vice president for the EastWest Institute.\n\nAt today's hearing, former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson will talk about the conflicts he encountered when, in the waning days of the Obama administration in 2017, he designated election systems as \"critical infrastructure.\" The move, intended to elevate election security as a federal priority, initially encountered strong resistance from states but has become less controversial since. \"The 2018 midterm elections are now upon us. The first primaries in the 2020 presidential election are less than two years away,\" his written testimony states. \"I am pleased that state election officials, to various degrees, now seem to be taking serious steps to fortify the cybersecurity of their election infrastructure, and that the Department of Homeland Security is currently taking serious steps to work with state and local election officials to strengthen their cybersecurity.\"\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

Elise Stefanik is out with a new bill aimed at helping the Pentagon wrap its arms around the issue of artificial intelligence and its future impact on warfare, Martin reports. The measure from Stefanik, who chairs the House Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities subpanel, would establish an independent commission to help ensure America doesn't lag behind countries like China and Russia in the bleeding-edge field, which national security leaders have been warning lawmakers about in recent weeks. \"We need to make sure that our adversaries do not leap beyond us,\" Stefanik said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nThe panel would, among others things, study how the military is using AI, and whether the government is working effectively with the private sector to develop the industry. Stefanik, who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, noted that the Defense Department has working groups examining AI, but stressed, \"it's clear that we need to do more.\"\n\nThe New York Republican predicted the legislation would attract the support of the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee, as well as other subpanel chairs, and be incorporated into to the military's annual policy bill, the National Defense Authorization Act. Pros can read the full story here.\n\nBIPARTISANSHIP ON CDM, SORT OF -- Democrats said at a joint House committee hearing Tuesday that they wanted to see more progress on a Homeland Security Department program to strengthen federal agency cyber defenses. Their comments, at a hearing of Homeland Security and Oversight subpanels, mirrored Republican complaints about the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program. But Democrats were more willing to point the finger at the Trump administration for some of CDM's sluggishness. In a written statement, top House Homeland Security Democrat Bennie Thompson said agencies needed better training on some of the cybersecurity tools offered through the program, and still need a \"full accounting\" of devices connected to these networks.\n\n\"These obstacles are compounded by the staggering number of cyber vacancies throughout the federal government, both for rank-and-file civil servants, as well as key leadership positions,\" Thompson added. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a member of the Oversight Committee, said at the hearing that Trump budgets have been insufficient for the program and that has \"impeded development.\"\n\n** A message from OWI: KNOW Identity Conference 2018 offers a unique & immersive event that convenes the world's smartest minds to shape the future of identity and security.

Secretary Rick Perry touted a newly established Energy cyber office and a requested budget increase as evidence the department understands it's an important subject. But the panel's top Democrat panned the moves as insufficient. \"Establishing a new DOE cyber office with marginal [budget] increases is not a substitute for the meaningful action we need,\" said ranking member Maria Cantwell. \"We don't need rhetoric at this point, we need action.\"\n\nPanel Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski was more generous about the new office, saying she was \"intrigued.\" Still, Murkowski expressed concerns about DOE's response to the recent government alert about Russian government hackers targeting the U.S. energy industry. Perry tried to assure her: \"We work very closely with the Department of Homeland Security.\"\n\nCantwell also said a Trump administration-requested 10 percent budget increase on cybersecurity probably isn't enough for fiscal 2019. Cantwell has called for a doubling of cybersecurity funding, but said that proposal might still be too small. \"My concern is we still don't have an assessment,\" she said. \"If we don't have a risk assessment, how do we know what we are really budgeting towards?\" Perry said discussions about such an assessment ongoing, adding that some cybersecurity-related funding is going up more than Cantwell mentioned, such as a 30 percent boost in funds to manage massive amounts of DOE data. In the past year, Cantwell has asked three times about when a cyber risk assessment might be finished.\n\nR IS FOR RESILIENCE -- The government's tech standards-setting agency is publishing a handbook today to help organizations develop more cyber-resilient systems. The document -- from the National Institute of Standards and Technology -- is the first in a series of supplements to an earlier publication on secure systems engineering, and it focuses on cyber-specific considerations for manufacturing and product design.\n\nLike NIST's popular cyber framework, the new publication is a high-level walkthrough of important considerations and not a step-by-step guide for developing secure systems. \"It can be viewed as a handbook for achieving the identified cyber resiliency outcomes based on a systems engineering perspective,\" NIST said in the document.\n\nYET ANOTHER BREACH -- Leading travel booking site Orbitz recently discovered a possible data breach affecting 880,000 payment cards, the company announced Tuesday. On March 1, Orbitz, a subsidiary of Expedia, discovered evidence that hackers may have \"accessed personal information\" on a legacy platform between Oct. 1 and Dec. 22, according to a statement. The affected data included personal information submitted during purchases made between January 2016 and December 2017. \"Information that was likely accessed may include full name, payment card information, date of birth, phone number, email address, physical and/or billing address and gender,\" the company said. However, it added, \"We do not have direct evidence that this personal information was actually taken from the platform.\"\n\nOrbitz said it bolstered the \"security and monitoring of the affected platform\" and hired \"a leading third-party forensic investigation firm and other cybersecurity experts\" to investigate the potential breach. Affected users will receive one year of free credit monitoring services.\n\nPRIVACY GROUPS PUT PRESSURE ON FTC'S FACEBOOK PROBE -- Per our friends at Morning Tech: A collection of privacy organizations including EPIC and the Center for Digital Democracy are throwing their backing behind the FTC's probe of Facebook's potential violations of a 2011 agreement it made with the agency. Facebook is confronting a firestorm of criticism for failing to prevent Cambridge Analytica from allegedly compiling a cache of data drawn from the social media profiles of some 50 million Americans. Under a 2011 consent decree with the FTC, Facebook agreed to get express permission and notify users before sharing their data with third parties. The social network could face massive fines if the FTC determines it violated the terms of the agreement. The agency has begun a review of Facebook's adherence to the consent decree, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n\"Facebook's transfer of personal data to Cambridge Analytica was prohibited by the 2011 Facebook Order,\" the groups argue. \"My view, based on what has been publicly disclosed, is that Cambridge Analytica's acquisition of personal information from as many as 50 million Facebook users likely violated Facebook's consent decree with the FTC,\" said David Vladeck, a former director of the agency's bureau of consumer protection, who helped develop the 2011 agreement.\n\nThe company is launching a charm offensive on Capitol Hill this week with briefings scheduled with the Intelligence, Commerce and Judiciary panels in both chambers, Ashley Gold and Nancy Scola report. Facebook will also hold a nationwide briefing by phone Thursday for state attorneys general, a company spokesperson confirmed. Several attorneys general have begun raising concerns, and those in New York and Massachusetts sent a letter Tuesday asking questions.\n\nThe efforts come as lawmakers including Sens. Mark Warner and John Cornyn and Rep. Marsha Blackburn ramp up calls for Facebook to send CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in Congress.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY -- Johnson Joy resigned as Housing and Urban Development's chief information officer. ...

                "body": "BORDER WALL, TIP POOL IN OMNI TALKS: Lawmakers struggled Tuesday to cement the provisions in a $1.3 trillion spending bill, including potential funding for President Donald Trump's border wall, POLITICO's Burgess Everett, Rachael Bade, Sarah Ferris and Heather Caygle report. The negotiations, which also touched on a large-scale infrastructure project in the New York City area, appeared likely to spill into Wednesday, if not later in the week.\n\nThe border wall resurfaced, but in far less sweeping terms than previously discussed, according to POLITICO. \"Talks to protect young immigrants facing deportation fell apart over the weekend, but congressional Democrats spent Monday and Tuesday pushing to freeze hiring of immigration enforcement officials in return for providing Trump [$1.6 billion] in funding on his border wall,\" the quartet reported. The White House reportedly floated a proposal to Democrats over the weekend that offered a two-year extension of the DACA program for $25 billion in border wall money, but Democrats rejected the offer.\n\nLawmakers also wrestled with whether to include $900 million for the Gateway project, a planned railway tunnel from New Jersey to New York, POLITICO reports. \"Gateway supporters are trying to include language that would allow the project to apply for competitive grant money and prevent the Trump administration from squashing the project,\" the quartet write. \"Trump has told Republicans he will veto a bill that funds the project specifically.\"\n\nThe Labor Department's tip pooling rule also factored into spending bill discussions, POLITICO's Andrew Hanna and Ian Kullgren report. \"Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and the Labor Department are at work on a legislative compromise to prevent the Trump administration's proposed tip-pooling rule from allowing employers to pocket tips given to workers,\" they reported last night.\n\n\"But the compromise, intended for inclusion in the forthcoming omnibus spending bill, faces stiff resistance from Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the ranking member on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, according to two sources familiar with the negotiations,\" POLITICO reports. \"Murray is the ranking member on the Senate HELP Committee.\"\n\n\"The legislative compromise would allow DOL to proceed with its rule permitting employers to require so-called tip pools in which tipped workers such as waitresses share tips with back-of-the-house workers such as kitchen workers,\" Hanna and Kullgren report. \"But the legislation would make it illegal for employers to help themselves to the tip pool.\"\n\n\"As of Tuesday night, it was unclear whether the language would be included in the final spending bill, given firm opposition from Scott,\" POLITICO reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. \"According to these sources, Scott believes that the legislative fix would encourage businesses to reduce base pay for back-of-the-house workers.\" More about the border wall here and the tip pooling deal here.\n\nGOOD MORNING!

Granted, there's not much snow yet from our perch in northwest D.C., but the Weather Channel radar shows the storm closing in on the beltway. Alas, there will be no snow day in Congress, however.\n\nCASSIDY OUT AT DHS: Ben Cassidy, assistant secretary for legislative affairs at DHS, left that post last week, three current and former department officials tell Morning Shift. A DHS spokesman confirmed the departure, but didn't provide additional detail.\n\nAs the department's top legislative dealmaker, Cassidy facilitated congressional negotiations in recent months over the DACA program. He helped arrange a meeting between Trump and a bipartisan group of senators over the issue back in January, a source briefed on the confab later told POLITICO, only to see the president derail the session with a racist (and well-publicized) rant about \"shithole\" countries. The talks never regained momentum; the Senate devoted a week to immigration debate in mid-February, but failed to advance legislation. Again, Trump played the obstructionist, as the White House took potshots at the bipartisan measures with the best chance of passage.\n\nThe prospect of a DREAMer pact hasn't evaporated entirely, but it appears less likely by the day. Deal or no deal, Cassidy's departure means another vacancy among senior leadership at the department, where several high-level posts remain empty or filled by acting officials.\n\nUSCIS SUSPENDS H-1B FAST-TRACK: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will temporarily suspend fast-track processing for all H-1B visa petitions subject to the fiscal year 2019 cap, the agency announced Tuesday evening. The premium processing service allows a business to have an H-1B petition for a high-skilled worker considered within 15 calendar days if it pays a $1,225 fee -- an assurance the petition will be handled in a timely manner. USCIS said the pause (which will last until Sept. 10) will allow it to deal with \"long-pending petitions\" that have been sidelined as premium requests have grown. The San Francisco Chronicle reported the possibility of the move earlier this month. USCIS will begin accepting petitions subject to the FY19 cap on April 2. More here.\n\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT DEVELOPMENTS:\n\nFarenthold considers exit: Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) may depart Congress before his term concludes, POLITICO's Jake Sherman, Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan report, citing multiple Republican sources. \"Farenthold already announced he would not seek re-election in his southeastern Texas district, after POLITICO reported he settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with $84,000 in taxpayer funds,\" the trio report. \"But he now is on the brink of leaving Congress well before the end of his term, which would allow him to dodge an Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of inappropriate office behavior.\" More here.\n\nJudge won't toss allegations against Trump: A New York judge refused Tuesday to dismiss a lawsuit that alleged President Trump groped a contestant on \"The Apprentice\" in 2007, POLITICO's Josh Gerstein reports. The legal action was brought by Summer Zervos, who announced in the weeks before the 2016 election that Trump had groped her breast and repeated kissed her when she met with him to discuss employment opportunities. \"No one is above the law,\" Schechter wrote in the decision. More here.\n\nFormer Mavericks employee steps forward: A woman who anonymously accused the former president of the Dallas Mavericks of inappropriate workplace behavior stepped forward in an article published Tuesday in Sports Illustrated. The woman, Melissa Weishaupt, penned a follow-up column where she pressed the team to respond to the accusations against Terdema Ussery, the former executive. \"I'm using my name because I'm still not sure the Mavericks get it,\" she wrote. \"Since the story broke, owner Mark Cuban has repeatedly claimed he oversaw only the basketball side of that franchise, not the business side. Sorry. It doesn't work that way.\" More here.\n\nWeinstein Co. voids disclosure agreements: The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy late Monday evening, Brooks Barnes reported in the New York Times. As part of the filing, the company released anyone \"who suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein\" from nondisclosure agreements, the Times reports. In October, the Times revealed that Weinstein had silenced sexual harassment accusers for decades with payments, a story that triggered an outpouring of misconduct claims against the Hollywood producer. More on the bankruptcy here.\n\nNYC UBER DRIVERS SEEKS MIN WAGE: \"Uber and Lyft drivers demanding a minimum wage mounted a campaign Tuesday to ensure they'll get one from their ride-hailing companies,\" Graham Rayman reports for the New York Daily News. \"More than 15,000 drivers signed a petition calling on the city to pass a law establishing a minimum wage that would hike drivers' pay by 37 percent, the Independent Drivers Guild said. The guild also wants to cap the fees riders pay to the companies at 20 percent.\"\n\nBut the petition sparked backlash from NYC yellow cab drivers who want government-regulated cab fares to be the minimum rate of pay. \"We reiterate to the Mayor and Taxi and Limousine Commission that we need a livable income and a halt to the race to the bottom, not proposals aimed at protecting Uber's bottom line,\" the New York Taxi Workers Alliance said. More here.\n\nROBB OFFERS TO DISCUSS CHANGES: NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb sent a letter Tuesday to the agency's union president, Karen Cook, inviting her to discuss proposed changes to field operations and case processing. The NLRB Professional Association criticized Robb for providing \"multiple, inconsistent justifications\" for restructuring the agency's regional offices in a missive last week. Responding Tuesday, Robb claimed the proposed organizational changes \"came from NLRB employees from all levels.\" Cook expressed skepticism about Robb's claim. \"With so much opposition at all levels, we'd like to know who the employees he consulted are,\" she told Morning Shift. Read Robb's letter here.\n\nMIN WAGE, PAID LEAVE ADVANCE IN CONN: Connecticut's Labor and Public Employees Committee approved Tuesday a plethora of bills on fair wages and paid leave. The legislation aims to \"expand Connecticut's family and sick leave laws, update sexual harassment training requirements, prevent unintended pay discrimination disadvantaging women and increase the minimum wage,\" Emilie Munson reports for the New Haven Register.\n\nOne measure under consideration would raise the state's minimum wage to $13.50 by 2020, up from the current $10.10. Other bills would require employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave and mandate sexual harassment training at larger businesses, the Register reports. \"While the equal pay and anti-sexual harassment bills passed the committee with unanimous support, votes on paid family and sick leave and minimum wage were divided on party lines, with opposition stemming from Republicans,\" Munson writes. More here.\n\nCHIPOTLE WORKER FILES APPEAL: Attorneys for a Chipotle worker found to be in contempt of court earlier this week filed a notice of appeal Tuesday and requested a stay of the judge's ruling. The worker filed a lawsuit against Chipotle last year, arguing that the company withheld time-and-a-half pay under the Obama administration' rule, even though the rule never took effect because the same court issued an injunction.\n\nAttorneys for the worker argued that their lawsuit wasn't a violation of the court's order because the court, in issuing an injunction against enforcement, didn't stop the rule itself from taking effect. They also contend the federal injunction didn't stop lawsuits under state law. A U.S. District Court judge in Texas didn't buy that argument, and on Monday ordered the worker to withdraw its complaints and pay Chipotle's legal fees. The worker's attorneys on Tuesday asked the court to stay the contempt ruling pending appeal.\n\nCALIF HOSPITAL UNION MOVES: \"Both Dignity Health and Kaiser Permanente announced Monday that they had reached major contract agreements with labor unions representing thousands of employees at the two companies,\" Cathie Anderson reports in the Sacramento Bee. \"The roughly 15,000 members of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West concluded voting Friday, ratifying a five-year contract with Dignity that will increase pay by 13 percent over the term of the deal. ... Over at Kaiser, about 19,000 members of the California Nurses Association reached a tentative, five-year deal after voting two weeks ago to authorize a strike, if needed, if their concerns about patient care were not met.\" More here.\n\n-- \"A Lone New York sheriff signs up to aid immigration crackdown,\" from the New York Times\n\n-- \"Uber driverless-vehicle accident complicates push to ease rules,\" from the Wall Street Journal\n\n-- \"Up, up, up goes the economy.

                "body": "With Catherine Boudreau, Sabrina Rodriguez and Maya Parthasarathy\n\nHOUSE FARM BILL TALKS REMAIN AT AN IMPASSE: House Agriculture ranking member Collin Peterson said Tuesday that he shared additional details (though not the text) of proposed changes to the food stamp program in the farm bill with committee Democrats, but that they remain unanimously opposed to Republicans' \"extreme, partisan\" policies, Pro Ag's Catherine Boudreau reports.\n\n\"This opposition will not change,\" Peterson said in a statement, indicating that a bipartisan farm bill likely isn't feasible unless Chairman Mike Conaway walks back proposals to tighten eligibility and impose stricter work requirements on able-bodied adults participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\nDemocrats want details: The announcement follows a letter Peterson received last week from 19 committee Democrats demanding that he stop negotiating with Conaway over SNAP until they could see the text of the farm bill. They complained they had not seen the contents of any of the chapters -- let alone the nutrition title -- forcing them to rely on news reports to see what was being discussed. They also criticized how the talks had taken place in secrecy. Peterson pledged to heed their request, and farm bill talks have since remained deadlocked.\n\nConaway told reporters Tuesday that he is still trying to figure out how to move forward with Democrats, though no meetings are scheduled for this week.\n\n\"The plan has always been that once the ranking member and chairman sign off on the language, then [the farm bill] is released,\" he said. \"I can't get my ranking member to sign off on the language. [Peterson] got a letter from his members saying he can't. I'm in a bad circle trying to get this done. So we're still trying to figure out how we get past this impasse.\"\n\nSenate outlook: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) suggested that the House side would have to come to terms if they wanted to get anything to fly in the Senate.\n\n\"I don't think it has any chance of getting through the Senate if it isn't bipartisan,\" Grassley said of the House bill during a call with reporters Tuesday morning. \"Consequentially, we'll write our own bill and it'll be a bipartisan bill.\"\n\nGrassley met recently with Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts to discuss what he'd like to see in the Senate version. \"The staff is starting to draft a farm bill, and he told me he hopes to start the process after the Easter recess,\" the Iowa Republican said of Roberts.\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21!

Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) to opposite sides of the debate over whether to lower the cost of biofuel credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers.\n\nA fix could be found in a bill to overhaul the Renewable Fuel Standard from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.). Details about the bill are scarce but it's rumored to include a national octane standard, and possibly a new kind of RIN for sales of high ethanol blends of gasoline.\n\nSECTION 199A MISHAP THREATENS SMALL BUSINESSES: Paul Kroeker can't believe that \"ineptitude\" on Capitol Hill may just put him out of business. Kroeker owns an independent grain elevator and lumber company in Henderson, Neb., that handles about three million bushels of corn and soybeans each year. But the new Section 199A language in the Republican tax law has hurt him immensely as he tries to compete with three grain cooperatives in his area.\n\nAlready costing money: For the 2017 crop, Kroeker has lost 30 percent of his business from corn growers because farmers just can't turn down the lucrative deduction they get when selling to co-ops over other types of businesses. Some producers could be able to write off their income entirely.\n\n\"The longer this drags on, the more business I lose,\" Kroeker told Pro Ag's Catherine Boudreau in an interview on Tuesday. \"It will be a catastrophe for businesses my size.\"\n\nLegislative hold up: Congressional leaders have been trying to include a fix to the so-called grain glitch in the fiscal 2018 omnibus spending package, but House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday he opposed Senate Democrats' demands that a low-income housing tax credit be expanded in exchange. Plans to roll out the spending package were derailed late Tuesday after congressional leaders failed to reach agreement on a number of disputes. Among the roadblocks: how to fix \"fire borrowing,\" in which federal agencies must dip into other funding accounts for firefighting and prevention, instead of receiving emergency dollars like the response to hurricanes.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses like Kroeker's hang in the balance, and he is frustrated that fixing the Section 199A deduction has become a political bargaining chip. \"There's been a lot of tears in my household,\" he said, noting that he has traveled to Washington to bend the ear of Nebraska's congressional delegation and members of the House Ways & Means Committee -- most recently last week. He has also tweeted hundreds of times to get their attention.\n\nFAMILY FARMS STILL IN CONTROL: Agricultural production has shifted to larger farms during the last three decades, but family farms still dominate as they've absorbed more acres and production, according to USDA. Family farms account for 99 percent of all U.S. farms and that hasn't changed over time, reveals a new report on consolidation in ag released on Tuesday from USDA's Economic Research Service. Even among the largest farms raking in at least $5 million in sales, family operations account for 78 percent of farms.\n\nTech bump: Advancements in technology are the driver of ramped-up consolidation across crop production and livestock as developments have allowed farms to manage more acres and animals, the report states.\n\n\"Larger, faster, and more precise tractors, planters, sprayers, and harvesting equipment reduce the time a farmer must devote to field tasks on a given acreage, freeing a farmer to manage more acres,\" it reads.\n\nUpgrades in pest management -- such as new chemical herbicides, genetically engineered herbicide-tolerant seeds and seed treatments -- have freed up labor. Tailored feeding of animals, along with improvements in disease prevention and reproduction have also helped.\n\nCorporate influence: Big companies do own and operate farms -- especially poultry and hog ones -- but their main role in ag is to coordinate supply chains and contract with family farms to raise commodities, the report states.\n\nListen in: An author of the report, USDA economist James MacDonald, was scheduled to host a webinar today to discuss the report's findings, but it was rescheduled to March 27 due to inclement weather.

Separately, Pairwise said it raised $25 million during its first round of financing, with Monsanto's venture capital arm and the investment firm Deerfield Management each investing $12.5 million and becoming minority shareholders.

Our farmers and ranchers exported more than $129 billion worth of products in 2016, accounting for 20% of all farm revenue in the U.S. Agricultural exports also support more than one million American jobs - most of them in the nonfarm sector. These jobs provide stability for rural families and communities. Free trade is essential to maintaining the strength of our agriculture economy. But some in Washington now support policies that would restrict trade. That would be devastating to family farms across the country, and would cause higher prices for consumers.

                "title": "Why Trump's school safety commission omits students and teachers",
                "body": "OMNIBUS HELD UP, MUST PASS BY FRIDAY: The rollout of a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill was held up Tuesday night after talks between Capitol Hill negotiators and the White House moved slowly. The bill contains fiscal 2018 spending levels and has to pass by Friday to keep the government running. Immigration has been one of the biggest sticking points, with Republicans and Democrats trading offers late Tuesday afternoon. POLITICO's Sarah Ferris and Kaitlyn Burton report.\n\nWHY TRUMP'S SCHOOL SAFETY COMMISSION OMITS STUDENTS, TEACHERS: The new White House commission on school safety will consist of just four Cabinet secretaries -- prompting concerns from parents, students, teachers and school administrators who feel they should play a bigger role. But the Trump administration says it's about getting to work quickly.\n\n-- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Tuesday testified during a hearing of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees education funding. While she was there to discuss the Trump administration's fiscal 2019 budget proposal, she offered new details about the commission's makeup. DeVos will chair the commission, which was recently unveiled by the White House in response to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month that left 17 people dead. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will join her, she told lawmakers.\n\n-- \"Is that it? Just four Cabinet secretaries? No experts? No Democrats?\" asked Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.). DeVos replied, \"This is an urgent matter and we want to ensure that we're able to move and operate as quickly as possible and without getting bogged down by a lot of bureaucracy.\"\n\n-- What does DeVos mean by \"bureaucracy\"? Keeping the commission to just four federal officials who have jurisdiction over school safety issues means the group can \"get up and running as quickly as possible,\" said Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill.\n\n-- \"Advisory commissions with non-Federal employees have to follow Federal Advisory Committee Act rules, which adds significant bureaucratic bloat,\" Hill said in a statement. \"FACA imposes many bureaucratic hurdles, such as requiring a charter that must be approved by the General Services Administration and the appointment of an Agency Committee Management Officer and a Designated Federal Officer, as well as other requirements that would delay the start of this important effort.\"\n\n-- Input from students, parents and teachers \"will be critical,\" Hill added. \"The Commission will receive input from and hold meetings over the coming weeks and months with students, parents, teachers, schools safety personnel, administrators, law enforcement officials, mental health professionals, school counselors and others holding a wide variety of views.\"\n\n-- Still, education groups want to ensure they're heard. \"It is critical that parents have a seat at the table whenever decisions are made that impact their children, and particularly on the critical issue of school safety,\" said Jim Accomando, president of National PTA, which represents parent-teacher associations nationwide.\n\n-- \"As school building leaders, principals must be heard on school safety and student well-being issues,\" said L. Earl Franks, executive director of the National Association of Elementary School Principals. Noelle Ellerson Ng, associate executive director for policy and advocacy at AASA, The School Superintendents Association, said that \"by keeping it only to Cabinet members, it's necessarily political ... I would venture a guess that the commission described by Secretary DeVos today isn't set it up to be super productive.\"\n\nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING, MARCH 21.

Presented by Boeing.\n\nSCRUTINY FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE: DeVos' appearance before the House Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday also drew scrutiny from members on both sides of the aisle. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, told DeVos that he wants a meeting with her and is \"concerned that we have kind of a disconnect here.\" Frelinghuysen said his comments were \"more to the secretary's staff\" than to DeVos, and that he has said the same thing to other agency chiefs. But he told DeVos, \"You've been on the job for a while\" and \"it's important for members who pay the bill to meet with the secretaries before they come to the committee.\"\n\n-- Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees education funding, told DeVos that he's \"concerned\" the Trump administration is \"continuing to request cuts\" Congress has rejected. The administration's proposal calls on Congress to reduce fiscal 2019 discretionary spending at the Education Department by $3.8 billion below current levels.\n\n-- Lawmakers pressed DeVos repeatedly on whether racial bias and discrimination is a problem when it comes to school discipline practices. DeVos said only that \"there is no place for discrimination and there is not tolerance for discrimination\" and that \"we will continue to uphold that.\" DeVos also acknowledged data has shown disparities.\n\n-- At the same time on Tuesday morning, a House Judiciary subcommittee held a hearing targeting Obama-era guidelines meant to address racial disparities in school discipline. Republicans charged that those Obama guidelines contributed to law enforcement's failure to identify and stop the school shooter in Parkland, Fla. POLITICO recently reported there's no evidence to suggest that those policies had anything to do with the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING AS LAWMAKERS TALK SCHOOL SAFETY: DeVos' appearance on Capitol Hill came just after news broke of another school shooting -- this time at Great Mills High School in Southern Maryland -- that left two students injured and the shooter dead. The shooter, identified as 17-year-old Austin Wyatt Rollins, was confronted by a school resource officer stationed at the school. \"This is the beginning of a very long and tragic process,\" said James Scott Smith, superintendent of St. Mary's County Public Schools. \"It looks as though the SRO did exactly what SROs are trained to do, and yet we still have loss of life ... we have students and staff impacted.\" The shooting comes just days before hundreds of thousands of students are expected to call for an end to gun violence in marches nationwide.\n\n-- News of the shooting trickled into the House Appropriations subcommittee hearing with DeVos. \"Do you believe we have a crisis with gun violence in our country? That's a yes or no question,\" Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) asked. \"I believe we have a crisis of violence in our country, yes,\" DeVos replied, omitting the word \"gun\" from her reply. DeVos stressed the need for strengthening background checks and measures that can remove a person's access to guns if that person is deemed a danger to himself or herself or others.\n\n-- The shooting was also raised at a Tuesday afternoon forum on school safety held by House Democrats. Stacey Lippel, an English teacher and survivor of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was asked about the Trump administration's support for training and arming school personnel, like teachers. She said, \"I had seconds to respond, so if I had a gun it probably would've been useless or dangerous to my students and myself. When you're put in a situation like that, you're just trying to secure your students.\" But having school security officials or officers who are trained to use a weapon is another thing, she said.\n\nFIRST LADY ADDRESSES CYBERBULLYING SKEPTICS: Melania Trump on Tuesday addressed critics as the White House convened a discussion on cyberbullying and internet safety. \"I am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\" she said. Critics and pundits have pointed to the president's tendency to light into enemies on Twitter and in speeches, deeming it ironic that the first lady would choose cyberbullying as her issue. \"I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue,\" she said. \"But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right. I am here with one goal: helping children and our next generation.\" More from The Associated Press.\n\nTEXAS FINALIZES DRAFT SPECIAL EDUCATION PLAN: Texas education officials this week finalized a draft plan that would overhaul the way the state teaches students with disabilities -- while acknowledging there's limited money available. The plan comes after a federal investigation concluded earlier this year, finding that Texas education officials substantially reduced the number of students receiving special education services, failed to identify children with disabilities and illegally denied tens of thousands of students those services required by law. The federal probe was sparked by a 2016 Houston Chronicle investigation that found Texas education officials arbitrarily capped at 8.5 percent the number of students who could receive special education services, while the national average of public school students receiving special education services is about 13 percent.\n\n-- Texas education officials note that the draft plan, which was ordered by federal officials, was informed by extensive feedback from teachers, parents, administrators, advocates and more. Among the corrective actions, the Texas Education Agency says it will allocate $65 million to school districts to help them locate and identify students who've been improperly denied special education services under federal law.\n\n-- The Texas Education Agency says the draft plan is designed \"so that it can be sustained with existing appropriations\" for special education. The agency says it \"cannot legally commit additional funds outside of those that are appropriated by the Texas Legislature and the U.S. Congress. A sizeable amount of stakeholder feedback is related to funding. While that feedback may warrant additional action, any recommendations for action are most appropriately heard by state and federal legislators.\" State education officials are accepting public comment on the plan through April 6 before the plan is submitted to federal officials later that month. Check out the plan.\n\nWHERE'S THE 'HOMEWORK GAP' STUDY?: Federal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel urged the Education Department Tuesday to release its \"homework gap\" study -- a report on student access to online educational resources at home commissioned by the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n\n-- \"That study is more than nine months overdue. Nine months? That's a school year,\" Rosenworcel said during an event on school broadband access held on Capitol Hill. \"I think it would be justice right now to make sure that we get that study released so we can all see what the homework gap looks like nationwide.\" A coalition of education groups echoed similar sentiments in a letter sent last month to the Institute of Education Sciences, the department's data and research arm.\n\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\n-- The left-learning Center for American Progress is out with a critical look at whether private school vouchers are effective.\n\n-- The Food Action & Research Center, a nonprofit, says in a new report that nearly 1.1 million low-income children benefited from afterschool meals in October 2016, compared to 200,000 children in October 2011.\n\nSYLLABUS\n\n-- Florida Gov.

                "body": "With help from Doug Palmer and Sabrina Rodriguez\n\nWHAT'S THE CHINA STRATEGY? President Donald Trump is expected by Thursday to announce a plan to hit China with tariffs, investment restrictions and potentially other trade limits, but will these actions actually get Beijing to rein in an industrial policy that it only seemed to double down on when its legislature met this week?\n\nU.S. trade actions might eventually bring China to the table to talk about American concerns with Beijing's industrial overcapacity, state subsidies and lack of market access for U.S. companies. But still unclear is whether the administration has any specific thresholds for progress on those issues and what China might do for the U.S. to reverse the tariffs or investment curbs, according to administration officials and outside advisers.\n\n\"It's a little bit of a red herring for the business community to be overly critical that there aren't clear off-ramps for China, because it's really unclear if the Chinese would even take them,\" said one outside adviser to the administration who has been briefed on the planning on trade actions against China. The adviser added that the administration is entering entirely uncharted waters in terms of testing China's reaction.\n\nThe expected 300-page report the administration is putting together as part of its Section 301 probe into China's intellectual property and technology transfer policies makes some recommendations on what China should do to curb those practices, a source familiar with its contents told Morning Trade.\n\nBut the tariff action Trump is ready to move ahead with seems geared more toward creating shock value and gaining leverage against China than achieving the methodical engagement that U.S. businesses would prefer.\n\n\"There's a recognition that you have to punch a bully in the face,\" said an administration official involved in the planning. \"That's the best explanation of what's going on here.\" Read the latest on the China trade action here.\n\nIT'S WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21!

Premature, unilateral sanctions alone are unlikely to achieve this objective,\" National Foreign Trade Council President Rufus Yerxa wrote in a letter sent Tuesday to Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees.\n\nLighthizer is scheduled to testify on Trump's trade agenda in front of the Ways and Means Committee today and at Senate Finance on Thursday.\n\n\"Unilateral imposition of tariffs prior to any meaningful negotiations with China will raise charges that the U.S. has ignored its WTO commitments and will turn the focus from China's unjust behavior to the legitimacy of our own action,\" Yerxa warned.\n\nTRUMP FORMALLY REQUESTS THREE-YEAR TPA EXTENSION: Trump on Tuesday formally requested a three-year extension of trade promotion authority to negotiate free trade agreements that he can submit to Congress under fast track approval procedures. The move comes amid growing concern among Republicans over the direction of Trump's trade policy.\n\n\"I hope my administration can continue to work with the Congress to pursue new and better trade deals for America's workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses,\" Trump said in a message to Congress. \"Extension of trade authorities procedures is essential to fulfill that task and to demonstrate to our trading partners that my administration and the Congress share a common goal when it comes to trade.\"\n\nCongress last passed trade promotion authority in 2015 in one of the hardest-fought congressional trade battles in years. It allows the White House to submit trade deals to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote without any amendments.\n\nTrump's request means Congress has until July 1 to try to block renewal by passing a resolution of disapproval. Trump came into office promising to negotiate \"better\" trade deals, but so far he has not concluded any. In his message, he refers to the ongoing NAFTA negotiations and possible new trade deals in Africa and Southeast Asia. To read the administration's full report on why it wants a TPA extension, click here.\n\nHATCH COOL TO IDEA OF GIVING TRUMP MORE TARIFF POWERS: Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch on Tuesday poured cold water on the idea of giving Trump power to raise individual U.S. tariffs to the high levels that U.S. companies sometimes face in other countries like China, India and even the European Union.\n\n\"I can't speak for Congress, but all I can say is 'I don't think so,'\" Hatch told reporters when asked if he thought Congress would approve such a plan. \"We're not very enthused about the raising of tariffs. We think it's better to have open markets and to move on from there. The more we can do that, the better off the United States is.\"\n\nA reciprocal tariff dream denied: Trump has spoken repeatedly in recent weeks of his desire to pursue a \"reciprocal tax program,\" prompting reports that the White House is actually considering asking Congress for legislation. But any such bill would have to get through the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means committees, whose leaders both believe the United States benefits from its low tariffs regime, even if exporters face higher tariffs abroad.\n\nHatch, who has announced plans to retire at the end of the year, delivered a speech on Tuesday that expressed concern about the direction of Trump's trade policy and dangled the possibility of revoking the White House's trade promotion authority if it departs too far from congressional negotiating objectives in revamping NAFTA.\n\nThe Utah Republican also urged Trump to narrowly target China in any trade action under Section 301 and emphasized that Congress must have the final word on the fate of NAFTA, despite Trump's frequent threats to withdraw from the pact. For more on his speech, read Doug Palmer's story here.\n\nCAN MAKERS WARN OF PITFALLS IN STEEL TARIFF-EXCLUSION PROCESS: U.S. can manufacturers are urging the Commerce Department to let companies file joint requests for excluding certain products from tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\n\"My fear is DOC may find our industry filing nearly 1,500 applications in the coming days, overwhelming DOC staff with exclusion requests, if only individual requests are filed,\" Robert Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, wrote in comments to the Commerce Department.\n\nBudway said the exclusion process raises three concerns. First is the inability of companies to seek exclusions for groups of closely related steel products, leaving open the possibility that a company could be forced to submit more than 300 individual applications for different sizes and specifications of tinplate steel. Second is the concern over an apparent prohibition on joint applications for the same product. Finally, granting an exclusion to individual applicants could create a \"competitive imbalance\" if one company is granted an exclusion but another company is not for the same product.\n\nROSS: KING OF SPAIN TO SPEAK AT SELECTUSA SUMMIT: King Felipe VI of Spain will be one of several \"notable foreign dignitaries\" to speak at the annual SelectUSA Investment Summit in June, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Tuesday. \"We are getting more and more excited about this year's event,\" Ross said at a meeting of the department's Investment Advisory Council, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. \"The theme is 'invest here, grow here, succeed here.'\"\n\nFelipe, 50, has been king since 2014. Spain was the 10th largest foreign investor in the United States in 2016, just ahead of China, according to the Organization for International Investment. However, China's investment in the United States skyrocketed 534 percent between 2011 and 2016, compared to just 36 percent for Spain over the same period.\n\nThe Investment Advisory Council, which includes a mix of companies, economic development groups and the OII, approved a number of recommendations aimed at attracting more investment from abroad. One called for \"the complete and immediate repeal of all Section 385 regulations\" introduced in 2016, which the council said has made the United States a less attractive place for foreign investments by increasing costs. Another urged the Trump administration to issue a written statement saying the United States welcomes foreign investment, similar to ones issued by past presidents.\n\nRoss, in a statement to POLITICO, seemed to downplay the necessity of such an action without ruling it out. \"The president made clear in Davos, and many times since then, that 'America is open for business,' in reference to the fact that he is committed to increasing investment here in the United States,\" he said. \"We welcome the recommendations of the Council, but we would also remind them that words are different than action, and President Trump has done more to encourage investment here in America than any president in history.\" For more on the IAC meeting, read Doug Palmer's story here.\n\nROSS KEEPS THINKING ABOUT THAT SEAFOOD TRADE DEFICIT: Ross said one of his \"pet peeves\" continues to be the fact that the U.S. has a trade deficit in seafood.\n\n\"I hate the idea that with all the waters surrounding us and with all the waters inland that we have a trade deficit in fish,\" Ross said Tuesday in response to a question at a House Appropriations Committee hearing. \"I've put a lot of pressure on the fisheries management group at NOAA to try to deal with this situation. I think there's some potential that some of the constraints that we've had on fresh catch here maybe need to be relaxed a little bit.\"\n\nRoss said he's also focusing his attention on seafood imports, although he didn't say what specific action he is advocating. \"It seems to me that we should be very careful about importing seafood from places that do not adhere to the same standards we would have for aquaculture here in the U.S.,\" he said.\n\nLÓPEZ OBRADOR TAPS NAFTA LEAD NEGOTIATOR CHOICE IF HE WINS: Mexican presidential front-runner Andrés Manuel López Obrador reiterated Tuesday that a new NAFTA should not be signed until after the July 1 election, adding that he has already chosen the lead negotiator if he wins. Mexico does not want \"that in haste, the error is made of signing something that will harm us - that will affect our national producers,\" López Obrador, often called by his initials AMLO, said in a video shared on his social media accounts.\n\nLópez Obrador said that if he wins the election, he would have Oxford-educated economist Jesús Seade Helú replace current chief NAFTA negotiator Kenneth Smith Ramos as Mexico's chief NAFTA negotiator. Seade has served as an economist at the World Bank, senior adviser at the International Monetary Fund and a deputy director-general to the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe announcement runs counter to comments last week from López Obrador's economic adviser, who indicated that AMLO would be open to keeping the same negotiating team after the election.\n\nMEXICO'S RULES OF ORIGIN PROPOSAL COMING SOON: Mexico plans to present its own automotive rules of origin proposal in the next ROO intersessional meeting. The proposal is expected to include changes to how the three NAFTA countries calculate what percentage of cars is made in North America and how far Mexico will go in upping the regional content percentage.\n\nMexico's proposal will take from both the U.S.'s and Canada's proposals, but will not go as high as the U.S.'s ask that 85 percent of the parts of a car come from the three NAFTA countries, according to Mexican newspaper Reforma. The U.S. has also proposed that 50 percent of the parts of a car come from the U.S., but Canada and Mexico have repeatedly labeled it a nonstarter.\n\n\"Mexico agrees that there are aspects within the rules of origin provision that need to be modernized and Mexican officials have been identifying how to address this,\" a source close to the talks told Morning Trade. \"When it comes to rules of origin, Mexico wants a trade agreement that addresses the rapidly changing nature of this industry. Yet, 50 percent U.S. domestic content is not an option.\"\n\nNAFTA AUTO TALKS COULD SHIFT INTO HIGH GEAR: Mexico and Canada might not have to worry anymore about that U.S. demand that a car contain 50 percent American content to get a tariff cut. Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper reported Tuesday night that Lighthizer dropped that contentious demand in a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland last week in Washington.\n\nCIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS TO USTR: DON'T BLOCK COLOMBIA'S OECD ACCESSION: More than 30 human rights and civil society groups criticized USTR on Tuesday for using Colombia's accession to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to pressure the South American government into changing its drug-pricing policies. In a letter sent to Lighthizer on Tuesday, the groups urge the U.S. government to \"stop promoting the interests of pharmaceutical companies even at the expense of people's health in Colombia.\"\n\nThe letter is a response to the U.S. drug industry's push for Colombia to drop a controversial patent challenge before it is allowed to join the international forum with 35 member nations. Last month, Lighthizer outlined for Colombia what USTR expects its government to complete in return for the U.S. offering a positive opinion at the April OECD trade committee.\n\nREPORT SHOWS NORTH AMERICAN BUSINESS UNITY ON NAFTA: A new survey released by banking giant HSBC has found that most businesses in the United States, Canada and Mexico are on the same page when it comes to NAFTA's benefits. Roughly half of the 750 companies surveyed across North America said they felt the pact would have a positive effect on their businesses over the next two years. Only about 9 percent of U.S. businesses had a negative view of NAFTA, which was smaller than the 16 percent in Mexico and 13 percent in Canada that felt the same way.\n\nThe survey found that 77 percent of U.S. businesses expected their trade volumes to increase in the next 12 months with Mexico and Canada as the most important markets for expansion. Still, 60 percent of those companies surveyed think that governments are becoming more protective of their domestic businesses.

Our farmers and ranchers exported more than $129 billion worth of products in 2016, accounting for 20% of all farm revenue in the U.S. Agricultural exports also support more than one million American jobs - most of them in the nonfarm sector. These jobs provide stability for rural families and communities. Free trade is essential to maintaining the strength of our agriculture economy. But some in Washington now support policies that would restrict trade. That would be devastating to family farms across the country, and would cause higher prices for consumers. President Trump and Congress should protect free trade to keep our agriculture economy strong. Learn more here. **",

                "body": "SO, TODAY. REALLY: Maybe? The schedule on that elusive omnibus spending package slipped again on Tuesday, with the hope now that the measure will be released Wednesday.\n\nThe provisions holding up the spending bill are largely outside the tax sphere, as Burgess Everett, Rachael Bade, Sarah Ferris and Heather Caygle noted. But there is some intrigue over that so-called \"grain glitch,\" the part of the new tax law that gives farmers good reason to sell to cooperatives instead of independent companies.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is largely the holdup there, having so far resisted a proposed trade from Democrats that would allow for a grain glitch fix and an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.\n\nSenate Republicans -- some of whom played a central role in crafting the fix -- are more willing to go along with the exchange, and there are certainly Democrats who would be interested in seeing both incentives on the omnibus.\n\nThose negotiations have already been somewhat topsy-turvy, but House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told reporters on Tuesday that Republicans on his committee were still talking with both Ryan and the Senate. \"We think it's important to move it in the omnibus if there's an opportunity to do it, so we're just staying at the table to figure it out,\" Brady said.\n\nFor his part, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Ryan would have to know that a grain glitch fix would come with a price after Republicans largely went solo in passing their tax cut last year, even as plenty of lawmakers in his party are also interested in correcting the mistake. \"I've received more mail from the reddest areas of my state about this issue than any other issue. It's a mess. It was made a mess because of the way they handled the tax reform bill,\" Durbin said. \"For the speaker to believe that we're going to walk away from this problem without addressing other problems is naïve.\"\n\nOnline update! The grain glitch fix might still be in flux, but it's pretty clear that online sales tax legislation won't make the omnibus. But there was this development on Tuesday: The Trump administration formally asked the Supreme Court to take part in arguments next month over the South Dakota online sales tax law, as your Morning Tax author noted -- perhaps a sign that the administration has a fair amount of interest in the case.\n\nQUITE A WEEK ALREADY so far, and thanks for joining us this Wednesday -- where your Morning Tax author really never figured that a snow event would block his efforts to get out of town for a few days.\n\nWhat have you done lately: It's now been 33 years since Rick Hansen, a Canadian paraplegic athlete, kicked off his Man in Motion wheelchair tour -- in which he traveled some 40,000 kilometers (around 24,000 miles) through 34 countries over 26 months to raise money for spinal cord research.\n\nLet us know if you find that omnibus text hanging around.

As The Wall Street Journal noted, Kudlow himself has suggested that President Donald Trump could take that step without the help of Congress. But that's also the sort of step that at least one previous Republican administration -- George H.W. Bush's -- rejected, and the administration would likely have to index other parts of the tax code to inflation as well to tamp down distortions.\n\nTHE DAY IN POLITICS: Americans for Prosperity, part of the Koch political orbit, has a new fact sheet that seeks to fight what it calls myths being perpetuated about the new tax cut -- including that around 5 out of every 6 dollars' worth of benefits goes to the top 1 percent and that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will \"explode\" the national debt. \"History shows, however, that economic growth following tax reform actually results in more tax revenue for the federal government,\" the group wrote.\n\nSpeaking of the Kochs: On the other side of the political spectrum, the liberal coalition Not One Penny is announcing today that it's putting up billboards in the brothers' hometown of Wichita, Kan., that argue that regular families will be left behind while the Kochs get big tax cuts.\n\nAlso from the left: Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee, led by Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), have a new interactive map that seeks to illustrate how many years an average family could live off of $193,000 -- the sort of tax cut that the super-wealthy might see.\n\nTHE DAY IN RESEARCH: Heather Boushey and Greg Leiserson of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth have a new article laying out a roadmap for progressives to present their kind of tax system. That doesn't just include raising more revenue from the wealthiest families, to funnel into areas like infrastructure and the Earned Income Tax Credit. In an effort to boost growth and living standards, Boushey and Leiserson argue in Democracy Journal for corrective levies like a carbon tax, scrapping the preferential treatment of capital gains and equalizing the tax treatment of corporate and pass-through income. \"Together, these changes would deliver broad-based increases in Americans' quality of life,\" they wrote.\n\n-- The American Accounting Association is out with a new paper maintaining that the 2004 law that gave multinational corporations a low tax rate for offshore income -- which is not remembered fondly by some tax analysts -- wasn't all that bad. Critics of that measure say it led largely to stock buybacks, and the domestic investment promised by companies never materialized -- a dynamic they expect might also play out with the new tax law. But the accounting association argues that while there was certainly stock buybacks after the 2004 law, \"repatriation resulted in an increase of R&D of about $30 billion, or about 11 percent of the total of $268 billion brought home by the large sample of nearly 400 companies included in the study.\"\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nYOU, TOO? Finance Minister Bill Morneau of Canada is now openly musing about whether Ottawa needs new methods to tax Silicon Valley powers, Bloomberg reports. The European Union is expected as soon as today to roll out a new tax on the revenues of companies like Apple, Facebook and Google that would also cut down on the benefits of setting up in low-tax countries on the continent, leading Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top GOP tax writers to accuse the EU of singling out American corporations. \"We are looking at it carefully because we need to understand what if anything happens to our tax base based on a changing of the economy towards a different business model,\" Morneau said at a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada has previously brushed aside the idea of taxing Netflix.\n\nNOT PLAYING AROUND: Zambia has sent a nearly $8 billion tax bill to First Quantum Minerals -- an amount that's almost 85 percent of the mining company's revenues. The company said it \"unequivocally refutes this assessment which does not appear to have any discernible basis of calculation,\" but it's also not the first time the two sides have clashed. \"Last year Zambia cut power to mines, including the Kansanshi pit owned by First Quantum, and two operations held by Glencore, after a fight escalated over tariffs,\" Bloomberg reports.\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nOUT OF HERE: The Wisconsin Senate wrapped up a two-year session by finishing off one of Gov. Scott Walker's priorities, The Associated Press reports -- a $100 per child tax rebate. \"The Senate agreed with the Assembly on the $100 child tax rebate but scaled back provisions that would establish a sales tax holiday, making more items subject to the tax than the Assembly did to save $38 million in revenue. Under the Senate version of the bill, sales tax would be waived on clothing costing less than $75, a computer costing less than $750, computer supplies costing less than $250 and school supplies costing no more than $75.\"\n\nZambia and Congo have more than half the world's reserves of cobalt.\n\n** A message from the Intuit Tax and Financial Center: This tax season, government and industry are engaged in a system-wide collaborative known as the Information Sharing and Analysis Center or \"ISAC.

                "body": "'BELLWETHER' LEASE SALE TODAY: Interior will hold its region-wide lease sale today for all available parcels in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Secretary Ryan Zinke said today's sale -- which Interior has touted as \"the largest in U.S. history\" -- would serve as \"a bellwether\" on where oil and gas companies want to spend their money drilling. The auction will offer up 14,776 blocks across about 77 million acres.\n\nPriming the pump: National Oceans Industry Association President Randall Luthi reminded offshore oil and gas explorers of today's big sale. \"The good news is that as commodity prices and market conditions have slowly improved, the Trump administration has worked to safely reduce regulatory burden and also incentivize industry investment by offering a 12.5 percent royalty rate for shallow water leases,\" Luthi said in a press release. But other observers were already downplaying expectations -- particularly since it doesn't include any of the new areas Zinke is considering opening up, S&P Global reports. \"Industry's views on the tracts available [today] do not necessarily say much, if anything, about industry's interest in [the eastern Gulf of Mexico] or Atlantic one to six years from now,\" Christopher Guith, of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute, told S&P.\n\nKeep in mind: Last summer's auction to oil and gas companies raised far less money than officials initially anticipated, Pro's Ben Lefebvre reported. That underperformance may illustrate how DOI's plan to cut royalty rates isn't necessarily the solution needed to stem the long-term decline in oil and gas companies buying up the Gulf of Mexico.

That figure comes from records EPA turned over to House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy on Tuesday, but does not include an additional $58,000 on charter flights and a military plane. The most expensive trip listed in the new documents? A $16,217 trip in December to Morocco where Pruitt touted American natural gas exports, POLITICO's Emily Holden, Anthony Adragna and Alex Guillén report.\n\nNew questions on security: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse sent a letter to EPA's inspector general asking the office to look into Pruitt's 24/7 security detail, including the administrator's use of it on non-official business such as jaunts to Disneyland, the Rose Bowl and college basketball games. \"The request presents new questions concerning Administrator Pruitt's travel outside Washington, including about the aggregate cost to taxpayers, comparisons of costs incurred under previous administrators, and the cost and burden to the agency of reassigning personnel to accommodate the Administrator's travel,\" a spokesman said. Whitehouse's office, which declined to release the letter due to sensitive security information included in the document, said it obtained documents showing multiple agents accompanied Pruitt to those destinations unrelated to his official duties.\n\nWE'LL KEEP THE LIGHTS ON: Batten down the hatches, folks! Between incoming snowfall and a quickly approaching funding deadline, omnibus negotiations are navigating quite the storm. Congressional leaders failed to release the $1.3 trillion fiscal 2018 omnibus text before midnight, as they'd hoped. And it's looking grim for the bill that last week negotiators said was almost complete. Talks between Capitol Hill and the White House have moved slowly, Pro's Sarah Ferris and Kaitlyn Burton report, with several issues still on the table after administration officials participated in a lengthy meeting Tuesday afternoon with appropriations leadership.\n\n\"Everything that remains is going to be pulling teeth to resolve,\" said a senior congressional aide with knowledge of the meeting. In all, four of the 12 subcommittees have yet to close out their bills, according to a Democratic appropriations aide, including Interior-Environment. The House is aiming to vote on the bill Thursday, though timing could be affected by the snowstorm expected to hit Washington today. Read more.\n\nMore trouble on the horizon: Count House appropriators among those decidedly not on board with using the omnibus to advance a controversial Mississippi flood control project long-sought by outgoing Senate Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran. \"The problem is adding things that would be looked at by the House as an earmark,\" Rep. Mike Simpson told reporters. \"We can't do that.\" But Simpson added he wasn't directly aware of the provision nor whether leadership planned to include language related to the Waters of the U.S. regulation.\n\nSimpson's got plans: Though he predicted Congress would need into the weekend to clear the spending bill, Simpson said he'd be home one way or the other for knee replacement surgery ... and he's got big plans. \"I'm thinking I'm going to take it out to Walter Reed and put it with Sickles' leg,\" he said. \"We're going to go out and do a toast to Sickles' leg.\"\n\n** A message from Chevron: Chevron and local partners are helping to provide DOERS with the hands-on technical training needed for today's jobs in the manufacturing and energy industries.

Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. John Shimkus have some ideas. The two have been working on a bill for well over a year to overhaul the Renewable Fuel Standard, a likely vehicle for the fixes Perdue referenced, Pro's Helena Bottemiller Evich and Eric Wolff report. But the text of the Cornyn-Shimkus bill has been kept under wraps. \"Interest group representatives who have seen parts of it remain mum, though it is rumored to include a national octane standard, and possibly a new kind of RIN for sales of high ethanol blends of gasoline,\" Helena and Eric write. A spokesman for Shimkus said the lawmaker has \"contacted staff and officials at the White House, USDA, and EPA to say that any administrative changes to the RFS at this time would be counterproductive to legislative efforts to reform the program.\"\n\n(SOON) GOOD TO GO: Energy Secretary Rick Perry's suspension of uranium transfers for the remainder of the fiscal year has left Sen.

PHMSA opened an investigation into how the cracks developed in the two tanks, an incident Cheniere reported in late January. Cheniere has sought an informal settlement with PHMSA, saying that the government's corrective damage order detailing the damage contained \"factual errors and unsubstantiated statements and misleading statements.\" Meanwhile, FERC told Cheniere last month to keep the two tanks out of service until more is learned about the situation.\n\nNO WORRIES: PJM Interconnection gave the OK Tuesday for FirstEnergy to retire a 1,278 MW coal-fired power plant in West Virginia, saying the shutdown wouldn't hurt the power network's reliability, Eric reports.

Six months after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, information about the botched federal response is still trickling out.

Congressional investigators Tuesday released emails from the supermarkets, which were sent to members of Congress for help gathering FEMA's attention. In a letter to Gowdy, Democrats request a subpoena to force DHS to provide documents related to FEMA's disaster response.\n\nBut that's not all: Ranking members from various House committees called on FEMA Administrator Brock Long to address concerns they have with his agency's response.

But it's not clear yet how the partnership is going -- vendors and providers have generally been reluctant to share details about user numbers during the beta phase.\n\nFor Cerner, the partnership is going well enough to expand the number of participating provider sites from four to nine, company vice president John Gresham told POLITICO.\n\nThe partnership could also lead to new integrations. Jonathan Bush, CEO of athenahealth, told POLITICO the company is working \"really hard\" to convince Apple to come up with an appointment calendar interface in addition to the EHR download. Bush pointed to services like Kayak and OpenTable as good consumer-facing apps to emulate.\n\nPros can get the rest here.\n\nADMINISTRATION EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE NEW CDC CHIEF TODAY: Robert Redfield, the Baltimore-based AIDS researcher, is the Trump administration's choice.

Discuss winter wonderlands (in spring!) socially at @ravindranize, @arthurallen202, @dariustahir, @POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.\n\nVA QUESTIONS DEEPEN: The various questions surrounding the Department of Veterans Affairs continued to swirl Tuesday:\n\n-- Minnesota Democrat follows up on POLITICO reporting: Sen. Tina Smith wants to know more about the VA's pending contract and implementation of its Cerner EHR after POLITICO raised questions about the first phase of the software rollout at some of the Department of Defense's Pacific Northwest facilities. In a letter to VA Secretary David Shulkin, Smith asks for more information on budget and personnel devoted to the plan, and more detail about VA providers' ability to get data from both VistA and Cerner's EHR.\n\n-- Meanwhile... A bill further overhauling the VA's health delivery system is on hold, the Washington Post reports, due to objections from Nancy Pelosi's office. Pelosi apparently believes the bill, the Caring for Our Veterans Act (S. 2193 (115)), would outsource too much care to the private sector, among other objections.\n\nThere's a micro and macro view to the bill here, of course. From a micro perspective, the bill would legislatively secure VA providers' right to provide telemedicine across state lines, which the Trump administration had already worked to resolve administratively. It would also require the VA to report to Congress on the effectiveness of telemedicine in its system.\n\nMore broadly, the bill adds to the wider drama surrounding the department. Shulkin's job security has been under question for weeks, amid some conservative frustration that he has been slow to adopt their their preferred policies. (Among their other department priorities: expanding privately furnished care.)\n\nHITAC TODAY: If you're cold or dreading being outside amid the flurries, perhaps today's virtual meeting of the Health IT Advisory Committee will tide you over. The committee is scheduled to consider Trusted Exchange Framework draft recommendations from the relevant task force. You can read the draft here. The task force wants clear goals with non-duplicative requirements, among several suggestions.\n\nAHIMA MEMBERS TOOK THE HILL: The American Health Information Management Association's members took to the Hill on Tuesday to advocate for two bills -- the Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act (H.R. 3545 (115)) and Protecting Jessica Grubb's Legacy Act (S. 1850 (115)) -- intended to change privacy laws governing substance use data.\n\n\"We are facing one of the nation's deadliest substance abuse epidemics, and it's time for the laws put into place decades ago to reflect the needs of the industry today,\" said Pamela Lane, the association's vice president of government relations.\n\nSENATORS WRITE LETTERS: Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Bill Cassidy really want Alex Azar to push fee-for-value payment models, having written a letter to the HHS secretary on the issue. They warn that if HHS slackens, the private sector will pull back accordingly.\n\nPDMP IN THE STATES: A couple of PDMP bills in the states to track:\n\n-- Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed House Bill 21 earlier this week. The bill, intended to offer a battery of responses to the opioid crisis, contains some relevant provisions to the state's prescription drug monitoring program. It allows VA and Indian Health Service providers to access the PDMP and allows the state to share data, but it also requires the system purge data that's more than four years old, among other adjustments. It marks a notable transformation for Scott, who came into office trying to scale back the program.\n\n-- Colorado may join the trend of states requiring prescribers to query the PDMP, as a new opioids bill was introduced earlier in the session. The legislation also requires the PDMP to allow direct access from an EHR.\n\nTANGENT TIME: In a report examining potential overpayments to hospitals accounting for $4.4 million, HHS's Office for the Inspector General returns to a familiar hobbyhorse: the need for unique device identifiers.\n\nThe report examined hundreds of claims concerning recalled cardiac medical devices, and concluded that hospitals should've properly reported receipt of rebates for some of these devices, with potential overpayments flowing from them.\n\nOf course, OIG has an idea for helping with these problems: putting unique device identifiers in claims forms, which would allow CMS to more closely track such devices. Trump's CMS has not stated a definitive position on the matter.",

                "title": "Congressional leaders on verge of massive spending deal ",
                "body": "Congressional leaders are nearing agreement on a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September, staving off a shutdown if both chambers can act by Friday night.\n\nMost major issues, including funding for a massive New York transportation project and the border wall have been resolved. But negotiators are still haggling over a plan to fix a snafu in the GOP's tax law -- the so-called \"grain glitch\" -- that ag state lawmakers are seeking.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is opposed to the latest proposed \"grain glitch\" fix, delaying the announcement of a final deal, according to two sources. But a Democratic aide disputes that the grain glitch standoff is the only thing holding up a deal, saying multiple issues, including provisions related to guns, are still in question.\n\nThe Big Four -- Pelosi, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) -- will meet later Wednesday morning to hash out the final details with text expected to be posted at noon.\n\nCongressional leaders are still hoping to avoid the need for a short-term spending bill to keep the government open for a few days beyond Friday. But if the spending bill is released Wednesday as planned, the House will likely vote on the measure Thursday, giving the Senate just one day to clear the deal before funding expires.\n\nUnder this timetable, any single senator could cause a brief government shutdown under Senate rules and push work into the weekend. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul has pointedly refused to rule out doing so.\n\nThe bill provides nearly $1.6 billion for border security, but does not include any money for an increase in detention beds or federal deportation agents, a key priority for Democrats in the talks.\n\nThe deal provides $641 million for new fencing, including levees, but does not allocate money for a concrete wall, according to a source familiar with the agreement. The proposal also includes nearly $1.3 billion for other border security technologies.\n\nNegotiators also agreed to a compromise of sorts on the Gateway project. President Donald Trump had vowed to veto the must-pass spending bill if it included funding for the $900 million tunnel project, a top priority for Schumer and other New York and New Jersey lawmakers.\n\nThe bill doesn't provide the specific funding for the project but does include funding increases for other federal transportation accounts, including Amtrak, that will allow tunnel construction to begin. And there will be more than $500 million available for Gateway this year that doesn't require administration approval under the terms of the deal, and the project can apply for billions more, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.\n\nPelosi is holding up an agreement on one of the final sticking points, according to two sources familiar with the issue: a deal to fix a glitch in the GOP's tax law in exchange for a temporary boost in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.\n\nOne of the sources said Pelosi is blocking an agreement between Ryan, McConnell and Schumer because of concerns about her own growers in California -- even as some Democrats from agriculture states join Republicans in their desire to fix the problem.\n\nThe so-called \"grain glitch\" lowers the tax bills of farmers that sell grain to cooperatives but at the expense of other farmers. Democrats at one point had sworn off allowing Republicans to iron out problems in their partisan tax bill passed last December. But many vulnerable swing-state and swing-district Democrats also want the relief for their own agriculture sectors back home.\n\nPelosi's opposition comes just a day after Ryan also rejected a separate deal on the matter that had the backing of Pelosi, Schumer and McConnell. Democrats sought an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit that Senate Republicans were ready to grant, but Ryan vetoed the proposal. Since then, a source familiar said Ryan, McConnell and Schumer have agreed to an increase in the annual housing credit for the poor for four years as well as some changes to income averaging rules.\n\nHouse Democrats are worried that the language as drafted doesn't protect small farmers or specialty crop co-ops, according to a senior aide. Pelosi and Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee, both oppose the current language.\n\nIn the end, congressional leaders ended up abandoning negotiations on many of the most controversial provisions lawmakers were trying to include in the must-pass bill -- likely the last major piece of legislation to reach Trump's desk before the midterms.\n\nThere is no agreement to protect so-called Dreamers, as Democrats had initially sought, or cuts to funding for sanctuary cities, as Republicans had wanted.\n\nLawmakers also gave up on efforts to stabilize Obamacare markets through subsidies known as cost-sharing reduction payments after both sides failed to settle a dispute over restrictions on abortion.\n\nThe deal does not include a provision to protect special counsel Robert Mueller if he's fired by Trump -- as Schumer and Pelosi had wanted -- but it does provide for an increase in funding to fight Russian hacking ahead of the November elections.\n\nThe proposal includes an increase in the FBI's budget to combat Russia cyberattacks this year and provides an additional $380 million for technology grants that will allow states to secure election systems.",

                "body": "FBI Director Christopher Wray said this week that he is \"utterly unyielding\" in his commitment to running the bureau free from political influence, suggesting in an interview with NBC news that the firing of former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe was not politically motivated.\n\n\"I am committed to doing things objectively and independently and by the book,\" Wray told NBC News when asked about McCabe's firing. \"I think that has to extend not just to our investigations, our intelligence analysis, but it also has to extend to personnel decisions and disciplinary decisions.\"\n\nMcCabe was fired late Friday night, a decision Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he made based on a yet-to-be-released report from the Justice Department's internal watchdog that found McCabe had leaked information to the media without authorization \"lacked candor\" in interviews with investigators. His firing came one day before he was set to officially leave the FBI, likely denying him access to the pension benefits he would have received had he been allowed to retire as scheduled on Sunday.\n\nMcCabe, in a length statement issued after his firing, said his dismissal amounted to an effort by the administration of President Donald Trump to discredit him. McCabe said he was \"being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.\"\n\nTrump, who took to Twitter to celebrate McCabe's firing in the hours after it was announced, has been a longtime critic of the former deputy director. The president has suggested online that he believed McCabe was biased against him because his wife's campaign for a seat in Virginia's state legislature accepted money from a super PAC controlled by former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close ally of Hillary Clinton's.\n\nDespite the president's clear distaste for McCabe, Wray told NBC that he does not feel any political pressure from the White House and that the president has never asked him to do anything in relation to the Russia investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller. Wray refused to specifically address reports from earlier this year that he had threatened to resign under pressure to fire people at the bureau, although he did not deny those reports.\n\n\"I want to be careful about what I can say about the process,\" Wray said of McCabe's firing. \"But I will tell you that my commitment to making sure that our process is followed, that it relies on objective input and that most importantly, it is not based on political or partisan influence, is something I am utterly unyielding on.\"",

                "title": "HHS strips lesbian, bisexual health content from women's health website",
                "body": "Multiple LGBT health resources were removed from a popular HHS website last fall, a new report finds.\n\nA webpage devoted to lesbian and bisexual health, links to LGBT topics and other references were removed between September and October 2017 from WomensHealth.gov, a website maintained by HHS' Office on Women's Health. The removals were tracked in a pair of reports by the Sunlight Foundation's Web Integrity Project and shared with POLITICO.\n\nHHS said the pages and links, some of which were first posted in 2012, were taken down as part of a routine update. \"The outdated lesbian and bisexual health pages were removed and the health content was integrated into the relevant health topics pages across the website,\" an HHS spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, the Sunlight Foundation determined that existing health topic pages do not appear to have been updated with new material and the now-missing lesbian and bisexual health content was not integrated elsewhere. For instance, HHS removed a page that raises multiple LGBT-specific questions -- such as \"What are important health issues that lesbians and bisexual women should discuss with their health care professionals?\" -- that are not explicitly addressed elsewhere across the website. \"Bisexual and lesbian health\" was also removed from the website's listing of more than 100 different health care topics, which still includes other population-specific topics like \"breastfeeding information for African-American communities.\"\n\nA lesbian and bisexual health fact sheet also was removed from its web address. Sunlight Foundation researchers say the fact sheet was quietly moved to a different location in the website's archives and \"placed on an island.\" No links currently direct to it.\n\nThe office's Twitter account, @womenshealth, which has nearly 1 million followers, also has not mentioned LGBT health issues since a post on Nov. 11, 2016.\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation's Andrew Bergman, who helped lead the study, said that the group has identified similar removals on other HHS webpages, but the changes at the women's health website stand out. \"We've seen nothing this targeted at one HHS site,\" Bergman said. \"The removal of lesbian and bisexual health materials in particular, without advance notice and in a targeted way, raise concerns that they've targeted information for vulnerable populations.\"\n\nHHS has faced questions about its broader approach to LGBT health. POLITICO in February detailed how the agency has taken steps to dismantle LGBT health initiatives, stripped LGBT-friendly language from documents and reassigned the senior adviser dedicated to LGBT health.\n\nWomensHealth.gov is among the health department's more-trafficked websites. The website received about 700,000 visits over the past month, ahead of sites like Medicaid.gov and FoodSafety.gov.\n\nThe website is managed by Hager Sharp, a communications firm, which has been under contract since 2012. But HHS, not the outside communications firm, determines the content. Hager Sharp referred questions to HHS.\n\nThe women's health office also saw a personnel shake-up late last year. Suzanne Haynes, who had been a senior science adviser at HHS and the former president of the Lesbian Health Fund, oversaw the office's LGBT health research. Haynes, who retired from HHS in December, declined comment.",

                "body": "LIPINSKI PREVAILS OVER PRIMARY CHALLENGER NEWMAN -- Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.) never got the DCCC's backing in his primary. It turns out he didn't need it. Lipinski, a Blue Dog Democrat who opposes abortion rights, survived a fierce primary from a progressive challenger, all but assuring another term in the House. \"Lipinski narrowly prevailed over businesswoman Marie Newman, 51 to 49, after a bitter campaign battle that pitted the party's ideological poles against one another,\" Elena Schneider and Daniel Strauss report. \"Lipinski was backed heavily by anti-abortion rights groups and by some unions, while Newman boasted endorsements from a host of outside groups on the left in the 3rd District contest.\"\n\n\"Several other House primaries -- from the suburbs of Chicago down to the southwestern tip of the state -- will also produce Democratic nominees to compete in a handful of GOP-held districts that Democrats must make competitive to retake the majority,\" they continue.

Jones told the newspaper, \"Even if only myself and my wife voted for me, I'd win the primary because the Republican Party screwed up big time.\" The state party had urged voters to \"stop Illinois Nazis\" in campaign fliers and robocalls.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would keep the chamber in until the bill is passed. \"Still, on the House's current schedule, the Senate would have just a day to pass the bill before government funding runs out on Friday evening -- allowing for any one senator to shut the government down briefly,\" they write. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) shut down the government last month and wouldn't rule out doing it again. Lawmakers are still haggling over key issues but hope to unveil the omnibus text this morning.

He said Democrats would raise taxes and block every effort to secure the border. \"Trump's assessment came during a speech ... that served as a pep talk for members of his party who are growing increasingly anxious about losing seats in the November midterm elections,\" The Washington Post's John Wagner reports. The president mocked Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), calling her a \"low-IQ individual,\" and slammed moderate Democrats as \"Pelosi Democrats\" who are weak on crime, terrorism and defense. \"The truth is the Democrats never have been more vulnerable because they've lost touch with normal, everyday working people,\" he said.

And they've also struggled to deliver on Trump's border wall with Mexico, though the latter was never a huge priority for most congressional Republicans.

Phil Bryant is scheduled to make an announcement on the U.S. Senate this afternoon in Brookhaven, where he is expected to say that state Agriculture Commissioner Cindy Hyde-Smith will be appointed to replace Sen.

She would be the sixth woman in the Senate, if appointed, and the first female senator from Mississippi.\n\n\"A special election will be held for the remaining two years of Cochran's term on Nov. 6,\" Daniel Strauss and Burgess report. \"All candidates will run on one ballot, without party identification listed. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the top two vote-getters will compete later that month in a runoff election.\" Hyde-Smith would likely face state Sen.

                "title": "What happens after China tariffs?",
                "body": "WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE CHINA TARIFFS? -- The latest POLITICO Money podcast digs into whether President Trump's planned tariffs on China are a good idea and what might happen after they go into effect.\n\nDavid Dollar, a Brookings Institution fellow and former U.S. Treasury envoy to Beijing, argues that Trump fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the U.S. trade relationship with China and that a trade war, should it materialize, could badly damage the American economy, potentially hitting the farm sector the hardest.\n\nDollar: \"I think the argument that we are losing out to China, that they are cheating everywhere, I think that's overblown. The administration focuses a lot on the imbalance in the relationship and that's not really a very useful metric ... The trade balance is largely a macro economic variable. In the case of the U.S., we don't save enough so as a result we run a trade deficit.\"\n\nIf a trade war with China escalates, Dollar said, the American farm sector could be hit hardest: \"What you would find in a serious trade war is much reduced demand including for U.S. agricultural products ... Farm prices would fall and maybe even collapse. You could definitely see the economy going into recession if the trade war were serious enough.\"\n\nCeleste Drake, trade and globalization policy specialist at the AFL-CIO, argues on the podcast that fears of a trade war are overblown and that tariffs are a useful weapon against China. \"We think that trade enforcement is always a good idea ... If you are going to have rules to try to establish a level playing field on trade then they are not rules at all if you don't enforce them.\" Sign up here.\n\nOne more useful thought from Dollar: \"China's overall surplus has come down very dramatically, that seems to be missing from the dialogue. Their surplus is about 1.5 percent of GDP which is not a very big deal.\n\n\"They run a surplus with the U.S. but they run a deficit with many other countries in the world because China is natural resource poor. Their overall standing is pretty balanced. We are the ones with the problem that we are not saving enough and the big tax cut that we put in place this year that is going to reduce our savings further and its almost inevitable that our overall trade deficit is going to get bigger.\"\n\nMNUCHIN ON TRADE -- MM has been arguing for some time that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is temperamentally disinclined to buck Trump on trade even if he might personally disagree. That's certainly been true of Mnuchin at the G-20 in Buenos Aires.\n\nVia the FT's Benedict Mander: \"Mnuchin ... has dismissed fears of a brewing trade war between the US and China as policymakers from leading economies wrapped up an annual meeting overshadowed by the US embrace of new tariffs. In a closing communiqué on Tuesday, finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 industrialised nations called for 'further dialogue and actions' on trade. But Mr Mnuchin rejected accusations that the Trump administration was engaging in a wave of protectionism by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium that are set to take effect on Friday.\n\n\"The US is also poised to announce tariffs aimed at China in the coming days. 'This is not about protectionism,' Mr Mnuchin told reporters, saying President Donald Trump had telegraphed his plans to take on unfair trade practices well in advance. 'We need to be prepared to act in US interests to defend free and fair and reciprocal trade,' Mr Mnuchin said.

FICO supports a competitive review of credit scores in mortgage lending, but the only other score being considered is VantageScore, which is owned by the three credit bureaus. Allowing the credit bureaus to offer a score they own in a system where they are the single point of sale and distribution for both credit reports and scores would not increase competition or innovation, it would consolidate their power. What's more, introducing a score with lower minimum scoring criteria could result in riskier loans, while doing little to expand mortgage access. Let's keep credit scores independent and reliable.

Bloomberg reported Monday that the Trump administration had urged the Supreme Court not to hear the appeal because issues in the case \"have been overtaken by events.\"\n\n\"Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona. I agree with @LouDobbs. Should have sought review,\" Trump wrote on Twitter, citing Fox Business Network Lou Dobbs.\n\nThe case rejected Monday by the Supreme Court dates back to former President Barack Obama's original implementation of the DACA program, which shielded undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation and issued them work permits. Arizona's Republican-led government responded by refusing to issue driver's licenses to DACA recipients with work permits, a step that was overturned last year by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nTrump has regularly lashed out at the Department of Justice through his first 14 months in office, especially as it relates to the ongoing investigation into allegations of collusion between his 2016 campaign and the Russian government's efforts to interfere in that year's presidential election.\n\nThe president has characterized Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has recused himself from all investigations related to the 2016 campaign, as \"beleaguered,\" and attacked the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller as a \"witch hunt.\"",

                "body": "THE BUZZ: The nation's second primary election produced a stunning result Tuesday -- little-known conservative state Rep. Jeanne Ives nearly upset GOP Governor Bruce Rauner. Even in defeat, Ives' performance raised serious questions about Rauner's ability to win reelection in November in a blue state with President Donald Trump serving as the backdrop.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, got the result the party establishment has long sought in the governor's race: J. B. Pritzker cruised to victory in his primary, putting a free-spending billionaire at the top of ticket in the general election.\n\nBut that wasn't the only closely watched Democratic race on the ballot. In a hard-fought primary viewed as a test of whether there's still a place in the Democratic Party for cultural conservatives -- especially those who oppose abortion rights -- veteran Democratic Congressman Dan Lipinski squeaked to victory over challenger Marie Newman, who was backed by major abortion rights and progressive groups.\n\nHere are a few other takeaways from last night's primary:\n\nThe Pritzker steamroller\n\nJ.B. Pritzker had to overcome unflattering FBI tapes of his private conversations, tax issues and party-machine taint but with the help of $70 million from his own personal fortune and a statewide infrastructure plan, Pritzker went on to crush the Democratic field. Pritzker had long led in the polls in this six-way race, but few predicted he'd win by roughly 20 percentage points over credentialed challengers Daniel Biss and Chris Kennedy. While Pritzker spent heavily on TV advertising, he also built up a statewide ground game that he's already counting on to help him in November. \"I've seen the enthusiasm,\" Pritzker recently told POLITICO. \"I'm trying to make sure they show up on Tuesday, but I'm also trying to make sure they're ready for November.\"\n\nLipinski's ace in the hole\n\nIn the toughest fight of veteran Democratic Congressman Dan Lipinski's career, abortion opponents delivered critical support in the final days. Lipinski's campaign was slow to respond to the assault waged by challenger Marie Newman, an abortion rights supporter who had the backing of a number of powerful progressive groups, including EMILY'S List and Planned Parenthood. Enter the Susan B. Anthony List -- a group that backs candidates who oppose abortion rights. For the first time in a decade, the SBA List list got involved on behalf of a congressional Democrat -- and they went all in for Lipinski. The group deployed 70 volunteers in the district for four days, targeting 17,000 voters who opposed abortion rights, including knocking on more than 26,000 doors. And the SBA List bundled money for Lipinski, sent two pieces of voter contact mail and produced digital ads on his behalf. In a razor-close race where the two candidates were separated by less than 2,000 votes, they might have made the difference.\n\nBruce Rauner's in big trouble in November\n\nYes, it's a win. But it was a weak, lifeless victory -- an anemic performance from an incumbent governor who vastly outspent his competitor. In a solid blue state where he's already polling below President Trump, Rauner now must contend with a divided party as he squares off against a billionaire Democrat.\n\nRauner's poor showing is in part due to his dismissal of state Rep. Jeanne Ives as a \"fringe candidate.\" Rather than focusing on her, the governor pointed his campaign weaponry at Pritzker. Getting the GOP base motivated again to support him will be one challenge, but the herculean task will be bringing Ives' conservative supporters back into the fold in November. For the rest our our takeaways (including Joe Berrios' defeat): click here\n\nWELCOME TO THE GENERAL ELECTION!\n\nRepublicans were livid over a Democratic Governors Association mischief-making, last-minute ad buy aimed at building conservative support for Ives. In the end, Rauner still prevailed, leading the Republican Governors Association to proclaim victory over DGA's meddling.\n\nWe now have a first look at the DGA's opening shot against Rauner on day one of the general election campaign.

AUSTIN AMERICAN STATESMAN: \"A man whom authorities were attempting to arrest early Wednesday in a string of bombing attacks in Austin killed himself with an explosive device as authorities closed in, a high-ranking law enforcement official told the American-Statesman early today.\n\n\"The official said authorities identified a suspect in the past 24 hours based largely on information gained after police said the suspect shipped an explosive device from a FedEx store in Southwest Austin. That evidence included security video.\n\n\"Authorities also relied upon store receipts showing suspicious transactions from the person and obtained a search warrant for his Google search history that showed him conducting searches they considered suspicious, the official said.\" https://atxne.ws/2pv8fa1\n\nWell, GOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING and happy first day of spring from upper Northwest Washington. At this point, calling what we have a dusting would be insulting to dust. We understand the snow is going to get heavy as the day goes on.\n\nThe OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT has CLOSED the government today. D.C. public schools are closed, so are Montgomery County schools and Fairfax schools. List of all closures http://bit.ly/2pu7HB9\n\n-- CAPITAL WEATHER GANG'S 5 A.M. UPDATE: \"SIGNIFICANT SNOW\" ... \"A wintry mix changes to all snow from west to east across the area around 5-8 a.m. And then the snow accumulates into and through the afternoon, anywhere from 2 to 8 inches across the D.C.-Baltimore area as shown in our forecast map below. More snow will stick to the grass than pavement, thanks to the high March sun angle. But with temperatures hovering right near the freezing mark, the snow should manage to stick to many road surfaces, especially during heavier bursts.\" http://wapo.st/2IFxteT\n\nPLAYBOOK SCOOP ... PROTECT THE HOUSE, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE and HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY's joint fundraising committee, will report it has given out $2.1 MILLION to House Republicans -- a large lump of cash that again solidifies them as a top cash duo for the GOP.\n\n-- PROTECT THE HOUSE is structured so McCarthy and Pence can dole out five-figure sums of cash to GOP candidates of their choosing. In addition to giving $1.1 MILLION directly to candidates, the pair gave another $1 MILLION and change to McCarthy's account, the Great America Committee, McCarthy's PAC and the NRCC.\n\n-- CHECKS RANGED from the $34,000 range to upwards of $56,000. NOTABLE NAMES include Texas Rep. John Culberson, who is facing the toughest race of his career in the Houston area, and Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr, who represents a relatively safe district.\n\n-- WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT: The vice president and the House majority leader have rarely worked this closely to raise so much money for such a broad swath of lawmakers. They raised millions in California and New York on two swings this Congress. Money equals power in D.C., and right now, their ability to raise and dole out to lawmakers is unparalleled (except for the speaker). It's a definite show of force by McCarthy -- the No. 2 House Republican -- and a show of loyalty to the chamber by Pence, a former Hill man himself.\n\n-- THE DETAILS OF THE DONATIONS http://politi.co/2GOT5EY\n\nGOVT FUNDING UPDATE ... Stop us if you've heard this before, but THE OMNIBUS IS ALMOST DONE. People involved in the talks expect it to post BEFORE NOON. We got an early-morning download from some folks involved in the overnight negotiations...\n\nSOME DETAILS ... all subject to change, since the negotiations were happening over night and into this morning:\n\n-- GATEWAY EARMARK OUT OF THE BILL. Money for the New York-New Jersey tunnel is still in the bill, but will be controlled by Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao instead of flowing directly to the project. WIN: Donald Trump -- well, a half win anyway.\n\n-- THE WALL is funded at $1.6 billion, not the $25 billion the president wanted. Democrats were able to hold the funding for interior enforcement lower than the administration wanted.\n\n-- THEY ARE STILL HAGGLING OVER GUNS. Republicans are pushing for Fix NICS -- the background check bill -- and Rutherford-Hatch, which is a school safety bill. Democrats want more than this, especially on a must-pass bill, but Republicans believe this is all that's achievable at this point, given the complex matrix of issues in this bill.\n\n-- THE GRAIN CO-OP issue is still outstanding. (Remember: the tax bill treated grain co-ops much better than corporate producers.)\n\nTIMING IS TIGHT for this omnibus. The government shuts down Friday night, and it looks like today might be a snow day for many, although the House and Senate appear to be sticking in session as of now. Congress will have to move quickly. And senators will have to forgo a filibuster if this timing is to work.\n\nAT THIS POINT, there is some whispering of a stopgap measure to avoid a government shutdown Friday night. But aides are desperately trying to avoid that.\n\n-- THE GUN CONTROL MARCH is Saturday in D.C. It would be tough for Republicans if Congress was in session during the march.\n\nQUICK SCOOP: JOE BIDEN is scheduled to meet with the Blue Collar Caucus, a group of House Democrats led by Reps.

He did it anyway,\" by WaPo's Carol Leonnig, David Nakamura and Josh Dawsey: \"President Trump did not follow specific warnings from his national security advisers Tuesday when he congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his reelection -- including a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating 'DO NOT CONGRATULATE,' according to officials familiar with the call.

If that meeting takes place, Mr. Trump will be the first-ever sitting American president to meet a North Korean leader; Washington and Pyongyang are still technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War was halted with a truce, rather than a peace treaty.\" http://nyti.ms/2DJOAs1\n\nRONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL SPEAKS -- The RNC chair has kept a low public profile in her first year in the job, but she sat down with ANNA for the #WOMENRULE podcast earlier this week.

Pruitt has drawn criticism for regularly booking first-class flights rather than the coach tickets recommended by EPA protocol. The agency has said the expensive flights were necessary because of the high number of security threats Pruitt has received.\n\n\"That $105,000 figure doesn't include an additional $58,000 Pruitt rang up on charter flights and a military jet to carry him and his staff from an event with President Donald Trump in Cincinnati to catch a connecting flight to Europe out of New York, according to previously released records.\n\n\"The most expensive airfare listed in the new documents was a $16,217 trip in December to Morocco where Pruitt touted American natural gas exports. Pruitt missed a connecting flight and stayed overnight in Paris, and appears to have missed other two flights to Morocco before flying to Rabat on Monday, Dec. 11. He left the country two days later.\" http://politi.co/2FXQF5L\n\n-- \"New documents show nearly $68,000 in recent premium flights, hotel stays for EPA's Pruitt,\" by WaPo's Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin: \"The records, which came at the request of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and were obtained by The Washington Post, show dozens of first-class domestic and overseas flights for Pruitt and other trip expenses between August and last month.

Mr. Carson offered a rambling, at times contradictory, explanation of the purchase of the table, chairs and hutch, a transaction that turned into a public relations disaster that led President Trump to consider replacing him, according to White House aides.\n\n\"'I was not big into redecorating. If it were up to me, my office would look like a hospital waiting room,' said Mr. Carson, who repeatedly told committee members that he had no knowledge of the $5,000 limit imposed on cabinet secretaries for redecorating their offices -- despite the release of emails between top aides discussing how to justify getting around the cap.\n\n\"Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon with no prior government experience, said the decision to replace the furniture was made in the interest of safety rather than redecorating. 'People were stuck by nails, and a chair had collapsed with someone sitting in it,' he said, apparently a reference to an email sent by a senior aide last summer who said she was afraid that the old dining set was falling apart and could lead to a mishap.\" http://nyti.ms/2pv1C7D\n\nWASHINGTON TO ZUCKERBERG: COME SEE US -- \"Congress to Facebook: Send us Zuckerberg,\" by Ashley Gold and Nancy Scola: \"Lawmakers are demanding to hear directly from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg on the growing controversy over the misuse of its data by Trump-linked Cambridge Analytica, as the social network confronts its most serious political crisis ever in Washington.\n\n\"For now, the company is sending lower-level staffers to brief a half-dozen congressional committees about how data on more than 50 million users ended up in the hands of Cambridge during the 2016 campaign. But Facebook's Washington, D.C., troubles show no signs of abating amid news that the FTC has opened a data-privacy investigation into the company and its stock price takes yet another hit.\n\n\"Several lawmakers want top Facebook executives to testify -- with some Republicans joining Democrats' criticism of the onetime Capitol Hill darling. Some said it's just a matter of time before Zuckerberg, the company's hoodie-wearing CEO and founder, or Sandberg, the chief operating officer and 'Lean In' author, have to explain themselves to Congress.\" http://politi.co/2puukWf\n\nANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST? -- \"Farenthold weighs resigning from Congress,\" by Jake Sherman, Rachael Bade, and John Bresnahan: \"Texas GOP Rep. Blake Farenthold is considering stepping down from Congress before the end of his term, according to multiple Republican sources with direct knowledge of private party conversations.\n\n\"Farenthold already announced he would not seek re-election in his southeastern Texas district, after POLITICO reported he settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with $84,000 in taxpayer funds. But he now is on the brink of leaving Congress well before the end of his term, which would allow him to dodge an Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of inappropriate office behavior.\n\n\"Farenthold has not made a final decision, but has spoken informally with several top Republicans about the possibility of stepping down. If he does resign, it could trigger a special election in his conservative Texas district, which runs from the coastal city of Corpus Christi to the outskirts of Austin.

That never happened.\n\n\"But more than a year after Trump took office, he finds himself the target instead, increasingly enmeshed in litigation related to pre-election efforts to contain stories about his alleged sexual affairs and improprieties -- a legal morass seemingly unrelated to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russia and the firing of FBI Director James Comey, among other issues.\" http://politi.co/2HRDvHW\n\n-- HOW WE GOT HERE: \"Trump's Stormy History: The Seven-Year Battle Between the President and the Porn Star,\" by WSJ's Joe Palazzolo and Michael Rothfeld: \"The extraordinary legal battle between the president of the United States and a former adult-film star has been building for seven years.\n\n\"The standoff is rapidly escalating, as the porn actress, Stephanie Clifford, seeks to go public with details of her claims of an extramarital affair, and President Donald Trump and his attorneys fight to stop her.

                "title": "Police chief says Austin bombing suspect is dead",
                "body": "ROUND ROCK, Texas -- The suspect in a series of bombing attacks in Austin blew himself up early Wednesday as authorities closed in, a dramatic end to a weekslong siege of the Texas capital, where two were killed and four injured in a series of blasts.\n\nAuthorities had zeroed in on the suspect in the last 24 to 36 hours and located his vehicle at a hotel on Interstate 35 in the Austin suburb of Round Rock, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said at a news conference. They were waiting for ballistic vehicles to arrive to move in for an arrest when his vehicle began to drive away, Manley said. Authorities followed the vehicle, which ran into a ditch on the side of the road, the police chief said.\n\nWhen members of the SWAT team approached, the suspect detonated an explosive device inside the vehicle, the police chief said. The blast knocked back one officer, while a second officer fired his weapon, Manley said.\n\nAuthorities identified the suspect only as a 24-year-old white man and wouldn't say if he was from Austin.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump congratulated law enforcement and others involved in the case.\n\nAustin has been targeted by four package bombings since March 2 that killed two people and wounded four others. A fifth parcel bomb detonated at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio early Tuesday.\n\nManley said the suspect is believed to be responsible for all the major Austin bombings, but authorities acknowledged it was too soon to say if the suspect had worked alone. Authorities also said they didn't know his motive.\n\nFBI agent Chris Combs, head of the agency's San Antonio office, said, \"We are concerned that there may be other packages that are still out there.\"\n\nIsaac Figueroa, 26, said he and his brother heard sirens and helicopters early Wednesday and drove toward them, then cut through nearby woods on foot after they hit a police roadblock.\n\nFigueroa said they saw a silver or gray Jeep Cherokee that was pinned between black and white vehicles and \"looked like it had been rammed off the road.\" He said he saw police deploy a robot to go examine the Jeep.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who had earlier said whoever was responsible for the Austin bombings was \"obviously a very sick individual or individuals,\" tweeted, \"AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD. Great job by law enforcement and all concerned!\"\n\nThe suspect's death followed a day of rapid-fire developments in the case.\n\nOn Tuesday, a bomb inside a package exploded around 1 a.m. as it passed along a conveyer belt at a FedEx shipping center in Schertz, northeast of San Antonio and about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southwest of Austin. One worker reported ringing in her ears and was treated at the scene.\n\nLater in the morning, police sent a bomb squad to a FedEx facility outside the Austin airport to check on a suspicious package. Federal agencies and police later said that package had indeed contained an explosive that was successfully intercepted and that it, too, was tied to the other bombings.\n\nAuthorities also closed off an Austin-area FedEx store where they believe the bomb that exploded in Schertz was shipped. They roped off a large area around the shopping center in the enclave of Sunset Valley and were collecting evidence.\n\nThe Schertz blast came two days after a bombing wounded two men Sunday night in a quiet Austin neighborhood about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the FedEx store. It was triggered by a nearly invisible tripwire, suggesting a \"higher level of sophistication\" than agents saw in three package bombs previously left on doorsteps, according to Fred Milanowski, the agent in charge of the Houston division of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nAuthorities have not identified the two men who were hurt Sunday, saying only that they are in their 20s. But William Grote told The Associated Press that his grandson was one of them and that he had what appeared to be nails embedded in his knees.\n\nDuring an Oval Office meeting Tuesday, President Donald Trump said whoever is responsible for the bombings \"is obviously a very sick individual or individuals\" and that authorities are \"working to get to the bottom of it.\"",

Scott's announcement capped a wild -- and frightening day -- at Stoneman Douglas in Parkland.

Cruz's mother, Lynda Cruz, was planning to help him get a government ID. That, in turn, would allow him to buy guns. Cruz had told a classmate he had ingested gasoline, causing him to vomit, a report said. He had \"expressed\" threats to both himself and others, and had cut himself with a pencil sharpener.

Documents obtained by The Associated Press through a public-records request show that the Florida Department of Transportation in October 2016 advised Florida International University and its contractors to move one of the bridge's main support structures 11 feet (3 meters) north to the edge of a canal, widening the gap between the crossing's end supports and requiring some new structural design.\" Read more\n\nRESPONSIBILITY -- \"FDOT can't shirk its role in the bridge-collapse deaths -- or its responsibility to protect us,\" by Miami Herald's editorial board: Read more\n\nFAILURE -- \"'Innovative' FIU bridge was a modern take on an old design.

The bit of political theater played out during a meeting of the Florida Constitution Revision Commission, which is holding its meetings this week on the Senate floor. That venue usually plays host to politicians well-versed in procedural maneuvers. \"It was more like a meeting of our neighborhood association and less like one of the Florida Senate,\" said Commissioner Don Gaetz, a former Republican Senate president from Niceville. \"It's friendlier.

On Tuesday, Tallahassee lawyer Barry Richard said the tribe was not in a rush to extend a deal it forged in July with the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation. The deal spanned a forbearance period that will expire at the end of the month. \"The tribe agreed to the forbearance period because DBPR had agreed to go after the locations that were causing problems, and they've been satisfied with the results,\" Richard said. \"I think they want to see where they are now and how things could look in the future.\" Read more\n\nNO QUESTIONS THOUGH -- \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions to talk opioid response in Tallahassee,\" by Tampa Bay Times' Alex Leary: Attorney General Jeff Sessions will outline the administration's response to the opioid epidemic on Thursday, the Justice Department said.

                "title": "Washington's Most Powerful Anti-Pot Official Is Named Sessions. It's Not Who You Think.",
                "body": "Rep. Pete Sessions has quietly used his chairmanship of the House Rules Committee to stifle popular amendments that would protect legal marijuana.\n\nIn January, a year after he took office, Attorney General Jeff Sessions took his first shot at marijuana, repealing an Obama-era document that had established a hands-off attitude for U.S. attorneys in dozens of states that have legalized pot. Though long-expected, revoking the Cole Memo nonetheless caused anxiety throughout the financially galloping marijuana industry and confirmed for most observers that he was the chief antagonist of legal marijuana in Washington.\n\nBut while the nation's top law enforcement officer has made it abundantly clear over the years that he views marijuana as a scourge equal to heroin, it turns out the unofficial title of Washington's most powerful marijuana opponent belongs to someone else named Sessions: Pete, the longtime congressman from Texas' 32nd district in Dallas. No relation to the attorney general, Pete Sessions nevertheless shares the former Alabama senator's unforgiving attitudes toward all things cannabis.\n\n\"Marijuana is an addictive product, and the merchants of addiction make it that way,\" Pete Sessions said in January. \"They make it to where our people, our young people, become addicted to marijuana and keep going.\" In February, at an opioid summit at the University of Texas Southwestern, Rep. Sessions stretched scientific fact when he said, today's product is \"300 times more powerful\" than when he went to high school. (Later, his communications director confirmed that he meant three times more powerful.)\n\nWhat Pete Sessions has, however, that Jeff Sessions doesn't have is the power to change laws. Very quietly, but with implacable efficiency, Pete Sessions has used his position as the chair of the House Rules Committee to stymie or roll back amendments that protected legal marijuana in the 29 states that have approved it (30 states if you count Louisiana). States that have grown increasingly dependent on tax revenue from newly legal marijuana businesses, and investors who are pumping millions into an industry that is projected to hit $28 billion globally by 2024, have sought assurances that federal authorities wouldn't try to invoke national drug law that still classifies marijuana as one of the most serious of all illegal drugs. Short of changing federal drug law, legislators in the states with forms of legal pot have sought the next best protection: using the power of the purse to curtail enforcement. But Sessions, with the approval of House leadership, has thwarted his colleagues. He neutralized one amendment that sailed through with a comfortable bipartisan majority and smothered others that would pass if they were ever allowed to see the light of day.\n\nSo far, the only people who have complained are the legislators whose amendments he has torpedoed and pro-marijuana lobbyists. That criticism has never troubled Sessions in his 16-year career. But recent polling indicates that 83 percent of Texas voters now favor legalizing medical marijuana, and that seems to be feeding a nascent campaign to use Sessions' anti-marijuana influence against him in the 2018 midterm election. Even some Texas Republicans think his zealousness on the issue violates essential conservative principles of less government. \"He's got this personal viewpoint; he's just personally against it. And there's nothing that's going to change his mind,\" said Zoe Russell, of Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition (RAMP). \"That's the absolute worst of big government.\"\n\n***\n\nIn hindsight, it's easy to see the high-water mark of the legal marijuana movement in Congress. It was the summer of 2015, and legislators seemed to open the floodgates to yes votes on marijuana measures.\n\nThe year before, the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment had passed for the first time, after seven tries. As a floor amendment to an appropriations bill and not a full bill in its own right, the measure completely bypassed the formidable House Judiciary Committee, the longstanding cemetery for marijuana legalization efforts. The downside of this tactic was that it had to be reauthorized every year with the budget, but it didn't seem like it would be a problem. As more states went legal, support was broadening within Congress, and in 2015, it was reauthorized with 23 additional votes.\n\nWith legalization efforts advancing around the country, it seemed to nearly everyone that 2016 would be the last time the marijuana prohibitionists would control the chamber. But this optimism did not account for the power of Pete Sessions, who knew there was still a way to stop the inexorable march of marijuana legalization, even when the legalizers had the votes.\n\nThe turning point came on an issue that had nothing to do with marijuana. On May 19, 2016, a vote was held on a floor amendment meant to protect LGBT rights in the federal contracting process. The amendment had enough votes to pass, but House leadership kept the vote open long enough to flip a sufficient handful of votes to defeat it. Shouts of \"Shame!\" erupted from the House floor, and headlines referred to the aftermath as \"chaos.\" In a House Republican Conference meeting on June 8, members decided the way to avoid such embarrassments going forward was to use the Rules Committee to structure the appropriations process so that such \"poison pill\" amendments would be out of order. If the amendments couldn't be offered, there would be no votes and therefore no bad publicity. It was a complete reversal of House Speaker Paul Ryan's promise to operate the House under regular order. \"My goal as speaker is to return to what we call regular order... so that Congress works more smoothly, and more democratically,\" Ryan said in December 2015, a pledge that lasted all of six months. Now that Sessions has jammed up the Rules Committee for two years, Ryan's spokeswoman told POLITICO Magazine that, \"Chairman Sessions has run the committee in a fair manner while advancing a robust agenda and the priorities of this majority.\"\n\nPro-marijuana advocates didn't learn that their issue had been put on the blacklist until Tuesday night, June 21. That's when Sessions' committee ruled a marijuana banking amendment out of order. Perhaps it would have received more attention if everyone's attention had not turned to the party conventions and the 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats, for the first time ever, added a plank to their party's platform aimed at reforming the nation's marijuana laws. Meanwhile, Sessions killed at least three more marijuana amendments. One gave veterans better access to medical marijuana. Another was Rohrabacher-Farr, which could hardly be called a \"poison pill,\" since it had already passed the House twice. And the third was an amendment known as McClintock-Polis, named for Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.), which aimed to do for states that had legalized recreational marijuana what Rohrabacher-Farr had done for the medical marijuana states. McClintock-Polis had failed narrowly in 2015, but it was understood to have the votes to pass in 2016. Thanks to Sessions, it never got to the floor.\n\nThe only thing that has prevented Pete Sessions from completely wiping out protections for medical marijuana, and freeing Jeff Sessions' Department of Justice to execute the crackdown he seems to pine for, is Congress' own dysfunction. Because Congress could not agree on a budget, Rohrabacher-Farr has remained alive through a series of never-ending continuous resolutions. In addition, the Senate hasn't been quite so willing to stifle its members' wills on this issue; Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has proposed a companion amendment to Rohrabacher-Farr, which passed the Senate's appropriations committee by acclamation.\n\nAfter Jeff Sessions repealed the Cole Memo in January, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi demanded that Congress fix the damage caused by both Sessionses by approving the Rohrabacher-Farr/Leahy amendment, and even expanding it to protect state legal recreational marijuana programs, as the blacklisted McClintock-Polis amendment was designed to do. \"Congress must now take action to ensure that state law is respected, and that Americans who legally use marijuana are not subject to federal prosecution,\" Pelosi said in a statement on January 4. \"Democrats will continue to insist on bipartisan provisions in appropriations bills that protect Americans lawfully using medical marijuana. Congress should now consider expanding the provisions to cover those states that have decriminalized marijuana generally.\"\n\nThe question of whether the appropriations conference committee will approve the Senate version with the Leahy amendment or the House version that killed Rohrabacher-Farr remains to be answered. The current continuing resolution ends on Friday at midnight.\n\nDon Murphy, director of conservative outreach for the Marijuana Policy Project, bemoaned the fact that the Republican Party has surrendered ownership of marijuana reform as Democratic support for the issue gains steam: \"What had once been a GOP effort known simply as 'Rohrabacher' after [Republican Dana Rohrabacher's] decade-long sponsorship, will now be known as 'the Leahy Amendment.' It's a missed opportunity for the GOP.\"\n\nWhen he speaks publicly about marijuana, Pete Sessions often positions himself as a bulwark against just that kind of Republican accommodation, insisting even against mounting evidence to the contrary that marijuana is a gateway drug to the opioid epidemic. This is a viewpoint shared by Jeff Sessions but not by the American Society of Addiction Medicine, generally an anti-marijuana group, which acknowledges \"the observed drop in opioid overdose death rates in states where marijuana use is legal for medicinal purposes. One study found that states with 'medical marijuana' laws had a 24.8 percent lower average annual opioid overdose death rate compared to states without similar laws.\"\n\n***\n\nSince Pete Sessions halted congressional movement on marijuana legalization, the states have steamrolled ahead in perfect disregard of his personal beef with the plant. In November 2016, California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine approved full recreational use. Arkansas, Florida and North Dakota legalized medical marijuana by ballot measure, and Pennsylvania and Ohio approved medical marijuana by state legislation. In 2017, West Virginia became the 29th state to legalize medical marijuana. So far in 2018, Vermont implemented a full legal law, the first state to do so by state legislature. A legalization bill is currently working its way through the New Jersey legislature. In Michigan, full legalization is on the ballot in November, and voters in Missouri, Oklahoma and Utah will have the opportunity to vote their states into the medical marijuana club.\n\nThe signs that the Drug War is thawing even in deep-red Texas are hard to miss In 2015, the Texas legislature passed an extremely limited medical marijuana program that grants access to non-psychoactive CBD concentrates to Texans suffering from epilepsy. Given that the Drug Enforcement Administration still considers non-psychoactive CBD to be a drug with no medicinal value, Texas' tiptoe into the waters of medical marijuana legalization has been an act of civil disobedience against a federal drug enforcement policy that is staunchly defended by the likes of Pete Sessions. In Dallas County, where the majority of Sessions' constituents reside, police no longer arrest people caught with up to a quarter pound of marijuana, opting instead for a cite-and-release program meant to unclog the jails and judicial system, following the example of similar programs in San Antonio, Houston and Austin.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Sessions finds himself defending his congressional seat in 2018 in a district that Hillary Clinton won by nearly 2 percentage points just two years ago. The Cook Political Report rates the race as leans Republican, but does Sessions' opposition to marijuana law reform make him more vulnerable to a Democratic challenger in November? Some Republicans fear that medical marijuana might be an effective wedge issue that could steer Republican voters toward a Democrat who supports marijuana law reform at the national level.\n\n\"I'm a lifelong Republican and will certainly not be voting for [Sessions] ever again,\" Mark Zartler told POLITICO Magazine. Zartler and his family are residents of Sessions' district; they made news when they went public with a video showing them medicating their severely autistic daughter with medical marijuana, which is illegal under Texas and federal law. Their video has been viewed over 88 million times. Mark Zartler sees Sessions as the reason his family has been put in legal jeopardy. \"As you can imagine, he's not my favorite,\" Zartler told me.\n\nColin Allred and Lillian Salerno are the two candidates in the Democratic runoff election in May for the chance to run against Sessions in November. Neither Democrat has the word \"marijuana\" on their campaign websites. Yet when asked by POLITICO Magazine, both candidates spoke in favor of medical marijuana legalization at the federal level, and both pointed to Sessions as a part of the problem.\n\nSalerno said, \"The fact that Pete Sessions wants to deny sick kids, seniors and veterans access to the compassionate care they need by blocking medical marijuana is unconscionable. We demand new policy that stops the criminalization of communities of color, and allows states to generate revenue through regulation.\"\n\nAllred is on the same page: \"I support the use of medical marijuana as an alternative to the habit-forming opioids that have become a national crisis. This common-sense approach to alternative treatments has been opposed by Pete Sessions, and is something I will fight to expand.\"\n\nThese Democrats might be late to the pro-marijuana party, but Sessions has made so many enemies among the drug policy reform crowd that they are ready to support whichever Democrat emerges from the May runoff.\n\n\"Pete Sessions has made himself the No. 1 target of drug policy reformers in the 2018 general election,\" Don Murphy of MPP told POLITICO Magazine. \"Defeating Pete Sessions in 2018 will send a message to Washington that even the tone-deaf GOP can't miss.\"\n\nIn fact, Murphy's prediction appears to be taking shape in Texas.\n\n\"It doesn't matter which Democrat wins. Either way, we're going to un-elect him,\" said Rob Kampia, the former executive director of MPP. Kampia's new venture is the Marijuana Leadership Campaign and its companion Marijuana Leadership PAC. \"Our invitation-only launch meeting was held in Dallas,\" he told POLITICO Magazine, \"and I can safely say we'll be spending $500,000 on this singular congressional race.\"\n\nKampia and his crew will need every penny if they want to dislodge Sessions from the House Rules Committee, where he's been chairman since 2013, which makes this year his sixth, and theoretically final year, but a spokeswoman for Rep. Tom Cole, the Oklahoma Republican and vice chair of the Rules Committee, told POLITICO Magazine that Cole \"supports the reappointment of Chairman Sessions should the Speaker do so, and the Congressman [Cole] has no desire to seek the chairmanship himself.\"\n\nSessions had $1.2 million cash on hand on February 14, the end of the most recent reporting period, but that doesn't account for the last month's worth of spending to win his March 6 primary by nearly 59 points. He declined help from Ryan's Congressional Leadership Fund, which is a sign of confidence that Sessions feels his reelection is not in doubt, that he can handle this one himself.\n\nSo it's up to marijuana reform activists and whichever Democrat emerges from the runoff to take the chairmanship of the Rules Committee away from Pete Sessions by getting more votes in November. Kampia told POLITICO Magazine that the two stated goals of his Marijuana Leadership Campaign were \"to legalize medical marijuana in Texas and to unseat Congressman Pete Sessions.\"\n\n\"We're going to show them that we are the NRA of marijuana,\" he said.",

                "title": "The Cajun Democrat who could shake up the 2020 field",
                "body": "'I think he's a remarkable talent ... on the Bill Clinton, Barack Obama scale,' says one admirer of New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu.\n\nMitch Landrieu isn't, for the moment, getting ready to run for president. But that's not stopping the Democrat who led the rebuilding of New Orleans from speaking out against institutional racism and what he calls the \"nightmare loop\" that links Donald Trump to David Duke.\n\nWith a media tour for his new book, \"In the Shadow of Statues\" (out Tuesday), and after headlining this month's media-fest Gridiron Dinner in Washington, Landrieu knows he's kept people talking. Monday night on \"The Daily Show,\" he smiled through a long burst of applause when Trevor Noah pitched him on 2020. Ridiculous as he and everyone around him knows it is to think about a New Orleans mayor making a serious bid for the White House, they also see the unique profile he'd have in a huge Democratic field concentrated on the coasts -- the white Southern liberal who loves wrestling and musical theater, and looks like he could blend right in at a Trump rally.\n\nBarack Obama has taken note of Landrieu's record as mayor and a speech he gave last year on removing Confederate monuments. The former president has said privately that he could see the appeal of a bald white guy from Louisiana talking up progressive politics in a Cajun accent. Though Obama is far from signing up, some notable players in his orbit are daydreaming of finding the next unlikely superstar and making it happen.\n\nLandrieu sees the situation. He says he just doesn't necessarily see himself as the solution.\n\n\"The country's in a dark hour. My commitment has always been to do what I can to help,\" Landrieu said. \"You never say never. At the moment, I can't see a pathway.\"\n\nBut he's conspicuously not saying no.\n\nAnd he knows he's laying out what sounds like a platform. The subtitle of his book, a frank account of racism in America, is \"A White Southerner Confronts History.\" It includes tough words about the failures of politics to stop discrimination. In one passage, Landrieu points out that on the campaign trail, Ronald Reagan condemned the murders of civil rights workers, but that he then approved a budget that served pickled relish as a vegetable in poorer public schools.\n\nHe also knows, according to a person close to him, that running statewide in red Louisiana would likely be impossible after some of the decisions he's made and constituencies he's catered to as a strongly Democratic mayor. Also that his father, former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu, sometimes regrets not having run for president himself.\n\nLandrieu hasn't raised money or hired any consultants or conspicuously campaign-minded aides. But he does have his prominent cheerleaders with local roots, like Louisiana native and former interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile, who said he'd be \"a fantastic candidate.\"\n\n\"We all know had Hillary Clinton won, Mitch Landrieu would have been a candidate for several Cabinet appointments,\" Brazile said, stressing that she wasn't making an endorsement. \"But given the circumstances, I think it's important to keep his eyes open and see which way the wind will blow in 2020.\"\n\n\"It's one thing to run for president, and it's another thing for people to take you seriously. He clearly falls into the second category,\" said James Carville, the Clinton political guru. \"I think he's a remarkable talent ... on the Bill Clinton, Barack Obama scale. The more people see him, the more people will like him.\"\n\nThey're not the only ones.\n\n\"I think he could have a really strong appeal as somebody who would run entirely outside of the Washington, D.C., ecosystem, and I think there's a real hunger for that among Democrats. He fits that bill, and others do as well,\" said Mitch Stewart, Obama's Iowa field director in 2008 and battleground states director in 2012. \"In a field of 15 to 20 candidates, in the first couple of states, you don't need to get 50 percent. Can your posture, can your values as a candidate -- would 15 to 20 percent be enough to prove viability? The calculus is different than in 2008 and 2016.\"\n\nStewart added, \"He would be one of the few candidates who I think could appeal to the African-American community and the white working class.\"\n\nIn 2010, after moving his family back to New Orleans and feeling distraught at the state of the city, Carville talked Landrieu into a late entry into the mayor's race with a poll that showed he'd win easily, despite his three previous losses for the job.\n\nCarville said he'll try to be that convincing again.\n\n\"I'll do my best, because I'd like to see him run,\" he said.\n\nLandrieu's book tour is taking him all around the country, ahead of an enormous tricentennial bash in New Orleans just before his term ends in May.\n\n\"I think people in the country are thirsting for an answer for how we get out of where we are and get us to where we need to be,\" Landrieu said. \"This has less to do with me, than can we please find somebody to really run the country ... to get us out of this seemingly manufactured chaos that we're in and get us to some security.\"\n\nHe contrasted Trump's record with his own experience leading a city devastated by Hurricane Katrina and wracked by years of mismanagement that's now on the rise. New Orleans, Landrieu said, is \"a city that is ascendant that used to be descendant.\"\n\nLandrieu is spending his final year as mayor serving as president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, traveling the country as he leads a bipartisan rejection of the Trump administration's policies on infrastructure, immigration, health care and more. He said Washington needs to pay closer attention to the performance of mayors from both parties.\n\n\"The question we have to ask ourselves is why Washington is so stuck when you have all of this innovation going on,\" Landrieu said.\n\nBut Landrieu's big mission, and one that he said he doesn't need to run for president to pursue, is making people confront racism -- their own and the country's. That starts with Trump but goes much deeper, he said. Everything that America is going through now, he said, Louisiana has seen already.\n\n\"We can recognize it more clearly, and we hear dog whistles more acutely. I was trying to wake the country up to the fact this is not new,\" Landrieu said.\n\nIn the book, Landrieu traces Duke's rise through state politics in the 1980s and 1990s -- the two served alongside one another in the statehouse in Baton Rouge. Landrieu writes that Duke advanced by tapping into economic anxiety and got a pass on his racism from other Republicans who \"saw him as a slick operator of calculated expediency, but very few wanted to speak out against him.\"\n\nThe former Klansman, Landrieu writes, was regularly undercutting facts in an early version of \"fake news!\" A passage from a newsletter from Duke's National Association for the Advancement of White People, Landrieu writes, \"sounded a whole lot like 'Make America Great Again.'\"\n\n\"It seems so benign, but the word again gave the line its punch. Again fills African-Americans with dread. Exactly when were we great before? What are we going back to? And by the way, your great wasn't so great for me,\" Landrieu writes.\n\nLandrieu said he's going to take some time when his term ends to recover. He's been in office for 30 years straight, working his way up. He has five children, and he said he wants to earn a living.\n\nThe last section of his book makes a more direct case against Trump, weaving in his own personal history and quoting Robert F. Kennedy.\n\n\"Poverty is a form of violence, I believe. So is not having access to health care, or not having a real job,\" Landrieu writes. \"We all come to the table of democracy in the United States as equals. That's what makes America great.\"\n\nIf Landrieu decides to run, he'll have the rare luxury of not having a job -- either to distract him from the campaign or to trigger complaints that he's ignoring his work for the sake of his political ambitions. His admirers say Landrieu's background also gives him the advantage of being able to speak credibly to Trump voters.\n\n\"If he showed up somewhere, people would show up to hear what he has to say,\" Carville said. \"That's a huge thing. Not everybody crosses that threshold from Day One.\"",

                "title": "Breitbart's readership plunges",
                "body": "The onetime voice of the pro-Trump alt right struggles to find a niche without its driving force, Steve Bannon.\n\nBreitbart, the alt-right news site whose executive chairman Steve Bannon was pushed out in January after feuding with President Donald Trump, has lost about half its readership according to comScore, raising questions about its future.\n\nThe site dropped from 15 million unique visitors in October, per comScore, to 13.7 million in November, 9.9 million in December, 8.5 million in January and 7.8 million in February.\n\nIts comScore figure for January was down 51 percent from the same month a year earlier, and the February number was down 49 percent from 2017. Last month was the site's least trafficked since February 2015, four months before Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president.\n\nThere are several potential causes for Breitbart's troubles, including changes to Facebook's newsfeed algorithm, amped up investment in digital by Fox News, and the shifting status of Bannon. Once Trump's campaign chairman, White House strategist, and closest ally, Bannon left the administration in August and returned to Breitbart, only to be forced out by the site's board after he criticized Trump and his family in Michael Wolff's book \"Fire and Fury.\" Without its driving force, Breitbart has struggled to find a clear identity. And after a significantly diminished presence at this year's CPAC conference, there is a growing sense that its influence is on the wane.\n\n\"As a talk radio host, I haven't used a Breitbart story in at least six months,\" said conservative commentator Erick Erickson in an email. \"They have a lot of readers and lot of people reading by habit, even if not as many. But they seem less able to stimulate a conversation or move an agenda now.\"\n\nNeither Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow nor a spokesperson responded to requests for comment.\n\nBen Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who is now editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, said that the site is at a crossroads. \"They hitched their wagon to Trump, but more importantly, they hitched their wagon to Bannon,\" he said. \"And when Bannon left, what was the character of the site going to be? That was always a serious question.\"\n\nAs Bannon's star rose along with Trump, Breitbart benefited, said its former spokesman Kurt Bardella. \"At one point Breitbart was considered must-read status because it was thought of as one of the only places to get a window into what the president was thinking,\" Bardella said.\n\nBut with Bannon exiled from both the site and Trump's orbit, that's no longer the case. \"Fox News has supplanted Breitbart as having that banner,\" Bardella said.\n\nOver the last several months, Fox News has increased its investment in digital and saw strong traffic gains as a result. Before Fox News embarked in that direction last summer, its comScore number tended to be in the 70 or low 80 millions. Now, it's more regularly in the high 80s or low 90s.\n\nRob Faris, the research director at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, said that Breitbart's rise was in some ways facilitated by Fox News being slow to embrace Trump.\n\n\"A big part of Breitbart's success was that there was a niche to be filled that Fox News was not able to fill at that point,\" said Faris, who co-authored a study on the conservative media ecosystem during the election. But now, with Fox's primetime hosts having fully embraced the president, he says, \"The role, the importance of Breitbart is diminished.\"\n\n\"Fox News is the gorilla in the room,\" he said.\n\nWeb traffic numbers are often disputed, but other tracking firms beyond comScore have also reported Breitbart to be in decline. According to Amazon's Alexa analytics service, the site has fallen to 273rd in world rank, down 33 positions over the last three months. And SimilarWeb has the site's overall traffic down 22 percent since October.\n\nAside from Fox News, the site's audience remains much larger than most other conservative sites, like The Daily Caller and the Independent Journal Review.\n\nBreitbart appears to have been particularly hard hit by Facebook's January 12 announcement that it would scale back on posts from news organizations in users' feeds. In February, comScore reported some dip in traffic for sites across the political spectrum but an analysis by The Outline found that conservative sites were affected most. The study found that, though Breitbart was posting about 9 percent less content on Facebook, its engagement had dropped by nearly 28 percent.\n\n\"Other [conservative] sites are getting killed, other sites are really taking it on the chin,\" Shapiro said, suggesting that not all of Breitbart's problems are unique.\n\nBut Breitbart's decline in traffic comes at the same time that its advertising base has been decimated by a boycott campaign. Its number of direct advertisers has been slashed from around 250 at the beginning of 2017 to just 17 now, according to the advertising consulting firm, MediaRadar.\n\nAsked whether Breitbart is in trouble, MediaRadar CEO Todd Krizelman said, \"From an advertising perspective yes, very clearly.\" He cautioned, though, that it is impossible to know how much the site makes from other sources, like selling merchandise. The site also is backed by wealthy conservative donor Rebekah Mercer, though her father Robert has already disassociated himself from it.\n\nThe Mercers are also owners of Cambridge Analytica, the campaign-data firm that has been accused of mining user data from Facebook.\n\n\"I think there's always a possibility for turnaround with any of these sites,\" Shapiro said. \"There are broader questions about the entire news business model, obviously. You combine that with a site that's lost its editorial mission, and they're going to need to figure out who they are what they stand for.\"",

                "body": "President Donald Trump's plan to slap as much as $60 billion in tariffs on imported Chinese goods could eventually trigger a trade war that slams American farmers, according to a leading expert on the U.S.-China relationship.\n\nDavid Dollar, a Brookings Institution fellow and former U.S. Treasury envoy to Beijing, said in the latest POLITICO Money podcast that Trump misunderstands the nature of the U.S. trade relationship with China -- and that a trade war could badly damage the American economy.\n\n\"I think the argument that we are losing out to China -- that they are cheating everywhere -- I think that's overblown,\" he said. \"The administration focuses a lot on the imbalance in the relationship, and that's not really a very useful metric. The trade balance is largely a macroeconomic variable. In the case of the U.S., we don't save enough, so as a result we run a trade deficit.\"\n\nIf a trade war with China escalates, Dollar said, the American farm sector could be hit hardest.\n\n\"What you would find in a serious trade war is much reduced demand, including for U.S. agricultural products,\" he said. \"Farm prices would fall and maybe even collapse. You could definitely see the economy going into recession if the trade war were serious enough.\"\n\nCeleste Drake, trade and globalization policy specialist at the AFL-CIO, argues on the podcast that fears of a trade war are overblown and that tariffs are a useful weapon against China.\n\n\"We think that trade enforcement is always a good idea,\" she said. \"If you are going to have rules to try to establish a level playing field on trade, then they are not rules at all if you don't enforce them.\"",

                "title": "The woman behind the RNC's fundraising juggernaut",
                "body": "Ronna Romney McDaniel is smashing fundraising records for the Republican National Committee.\n\nIn February, the RNC chairwoman raised $12.8 million for the party - cranking up the total haul for the midterm cycle[RL1] to $157.7 million. The total cash-on-hand number for the RNC: $42.2 million. (Heading into the last midterm elections, in 2014, the RNC had just $10 million cash on hand.) McDaniel has already raised more money than any other chair in any party at this point in the cycle, according to her staff.\n\nIn the latest episode of POLITICO's Women Rule podcast, the RNC chairwoman opened up about her fervor for bringing in cash. \"I just love the challenge. I think it is the most amazing thing,\" she told POLITICO's Anna Palmer. \"I do love going into a meeting and thinking, How am I going to get [this money] -- what am I going to do to get this money?\"\n\nTypically a politician's most detested activity, McDaniel has turned to fundraising as her inroad into Beltway circles, where she says she wasn't a familiar face.\n\n\"I knew if I had money -- first of all, if you have money you have power, and if you have money you have a seat at the table,\" said McDaniel, who still spends half her week in her home state of Michigan for quality time with her family. \"If you focus on the fundraising and you do well there, then you get a lot of credibility in a town that didn't know who I was.\"\n\nMcDaniel has kept a relatively low profile in Washington, choosing to focus on the operations of the RNC over public appearances of TV interviews. Her relative anonymity in Washington was a conscious choice, despite her prominent political family -- her uncle is Mitt Romney, the onetime presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor.\n\nThere have been a lot of speculation and news reports that McDaniel downplayed her family background at the behest of President Donald Trump. Trump and the Mitt Romney had been at odds since the 2016 presidential election, when Romney refused to back the businessman for the White House as a \"matter of personal conscience.\"\n\nAs McDaniel tells it, her decision not to emphasize the Romney portion of her name was because of family reasons. \"Romney's still my middle name,\" she said. \"I didn't change my name, but I have emphasized the McDaniel more. And that's just learning to, because when I was Michigan chair I hadn't been in the public eye. We would go to dinners and I'd be introduced and they'd forget the McDaniel.\"\n\nWhat the RNC is doing with all its new cash is no secret: The party has exploded its field program to its largest ever (with about 300 permanent staffers already on the ground), expanded its data operations and funneled a chunk of its money toward special elections in the lead-up to November.\n\nMcDaniel says that her work shoring up funds for the party is, in part, because Republicans are bracing for losses at the polls.\n\nThe midterms, she acknowledged, \"historically are very difficult for a sitting president.\n\n\"Their first midterm, they usually lose seats,\" McDaniel said. \"We understand that, and so we've been preparing for that all year.\"\n\nThat hasn't stopped Trump from being involved in strategizing over the races, according to McDaniel.\n\n\"Most of our conversations are related to the midterms,\" she said. \"In some cases, we'll go through numbers. We take our data to the White House. He dials in. He wants to know. He's very focused on that. We'll talk about specific candidates, where we think that race will go, and what he can be doing to help.\"\n\nDespite the RNC's planning, it's still an open question what difference the president's endorsement will make to candidates in the midterm cycle. In two high-profile special elections this year - Alabama's U.S. Senate race and the race for Pennsylvania's 18 district - both candidates backed by Trump failed to clinch the seat.\n\nWhen asked about the loss in Alabama by Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct with young girls, McDaniel called the Senate candidate \"incredibly flawed.\"\n\n\"The allegations against him, as the president maintained, as we did, if they were proven true, were disqualifying,\" the RNC chairwoman said. \"I expect if he'd have been elected that there would have been an investigation.\"\n\nMcDaniel added: \"The voters need to be smart about who they're choosing, because even in the reddest of states, if you put a flawed candidate up, you can't get them across the finish line.\"",

                "title": "Top takeaways from the Illinois primary",
                "body": "The nation's second primary election produced a stunning result Tuesday -- little-known conservative state Rep. Jeanne Ives nearly upset GOP Governor Bruce Rauner. Even in defeat, Ives' performance raised serious questions about Rauner's ability to win reelection in November in a blue state with President Donald Trump serving as the backdrop.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, got the result the party establishment has long sought in the governor's race: J. B. Pritzker cruised to victory in his primary, putting a free-spending billionaire at the top of ticket in the general election.\n\nBut that wasn't the only closely watched Democratic race on the ballot. In a hard-fought primary viewed as a test of whether there's still a place in the Democratic Party for cultural conservatives -- especially those who oppose abortion rights -- veteran Democratic Congressman Dan Lipinski squeaked to victory over challenger Marie Newman, who was backed by major abortion rights and progressive groups.\n\nHere are POLITICO's five takeaways from the second primary election of 2018:\n\nThe Pritzker steamroller\n\nJ.B. Pritzker had to overcome unflattering FBI tapes of his private conversations, tax issues and party-machine taint but with the help of $70 million from his own personal fortune and a statewide infrastructure plan, Pritzker went on to crush the Democratic field.\n\nPritzker had long led in the polls in this six-way race, but few predicted he'd win by roughly 20 percentage points over credentialed challengers Daniel Biss and Chris Kennedy. While Pritzker spent heavily on TV advertising, he also built up a statewide ground game that he's already counting on to help him in November. \"I've seen the enthusiasm,\" Pritzker recently told POLITICO. \"I'm trying to make sure they show up on Tuesday, but I'm also trying to make sure they're ready for November.\"\n\nLipinski's Ace in the Hole\n\nIn the toughest fight of veteran Democratic Congressman Dan Lipinski's career, abortion opponents delivered critical support in the final days.\n\nLipinski's campaign was slow to respond to the assault waged by challenger Marie Newman, an abortion rights supporter who had the backing of a number of powerful progressive groups, including EMILY'S List and Planned Parenthood. Enter the Susan B. Anthony List -- a group that backs candidates who oppose abortion rights. For the first time in a decade, the SBA List list got involved on behalf of a congressional Democrat -- and they went all in for Lipinski. The group deployed 70 volunteers in the district for four days, targeting 17,000 voters who opposed abortion rights, including knocking on more than 26,000 doors. And the SBA List bundled money for Lipinski, sent two pieces of voter contact mail and produced digital ads on his behalf.\n\nIn a razor-close race where the two candidates were separated by less than 2,000 votes, they might have made the difference.\n\nBruce Rauner's in Big Trouble in November\n\nYes, it's a win. But it was a weak, lifeless victory -- an anemic performance from an incumbent governor who vastly outspent his competitor. In a solid blue state where he's already polling below President Trump, Rauner now must contend with a divided party as he squares off against a billionaire Democrat.\n\nRauner's poor showing is in part due to his dismissal of state Rep. Jeanne Ives as a \"fringe candidate.\" Rather than focusing on her, the governor pointed his campaign weaponry at Pritzker. Getting the GOP base motivated again to support him will be one challenge, but the herculean task will be bringing Ives' conservative supporters back into the fold in November.\n\nThe Chicago machine is still humming\n\nJ.B. Pritzker was criticized for being too close to the \"machine,\" the Chicago political organization powered by Democratic Party Leader Mike Madigan. So was Dan Lipinski and Kwame Raoul. Yet they all won -- Raoul captured the Democratic nomination for attorney general against a crowded field -- ensuring that the machine lives on and remains a force to be reckoned with.\n\nIt's not what it used to be, but the organization can still deliver. In Cook County, Board President Toni Preckwinkle easily held onto her post. And aside from boosting Raoul, the machine also thwarted one of its top foes in the AG race, Scott Drury -- he recently called Madigan \"probably a bigger bully than Trump.\" Despite receiving a $1 million campaign infusion just days ago, Drury's share of vote on Tuesday was in the single digits.\n\nThe machine did, however, suffer one big rebuke: the defeat of Cook County Democratic Party Chairman and County Assessor Joe Berrios, who fell decisively to newcomer Fritz Kaegi.\n\nDemocratic energy is surging\n\nDemocratic primary turnout was up across the state -- overall, it was triple what it was in 2014, according to the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nAnd turnout was 30 percent higher on Tuesday than in 2010, a more comparable primary election since there was a competitive Democratic primary that year. In an ominous sign, Republicans saw an estimated drop of 30 percent in turnout over 2014, which was a highly competitive primary where Rauner edged out three other top contenders.",

                "title": "Inside Israel's Secret Raid on Syria's Nuclear Reactor",
                "body": "Now the story can be told: The Mossad got lucky. In Iran and North Korea, the Americans might not.\n\nEven if President Donald Trump is able to reach an agreement with Kim Jong Un, with North Korea promising to freeze or even dismantle its nuclear program, there will always be uncertainty about possible cheating.\n\nJust ask Israel -- which, despite having one of the world's most competent and aggressive intelligence services, the Mossad -- nearly missed the fact that North Korea was helping build a nuclear reactor in next-door Syria, a country long viewed by Israel as a dangerous threat.\n\nThe American CIA missed it, too, and now, 11 years after Israeli air force jets bombed the clandestine Syrian facility, Israel's military censor is finally lifting the veil of secrecy and permitting locally based reporters to publish interviews with participants in the operation for the first time. We spoke with dozens of former cabinet ministers, including Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, as well as military and intelligence chiefs and commanders and even some of the pilots who took part in the operation. The codename for the Sept. 6, 2007, raid, conducted near the remote desert city of Deir ez-Zur: \"Outside the Box.\" Before today, Israel has never officially acknowledged its existence.\n\nYears later, Israeli spooks are still raising bitter questions about the CIA's intelligence failure. Former Mossad director Tamir Pardo asked in an interview with us: \"Where were the Americans? North Korea is a highly important target for them. And it still isn't clear whether [Syrian President Bashar] Assad was running the nuclear project, or was it the North Koreans?\" The former spy chief added that he has some doubts that Syria was going to keep the plutonium, or perhaps it was going to be shipped to North Korea as a supply of which the West would be unaware. \"This is a resounding failure by the Americans,\" Pardo said.\n\nPardo's questions raise another: If one of the best intelligence communities in the world, and certainly the most formidable in the Middle East, could be fooled by North Koreans and Syrians, what might the CIA be missing? That could be true in Korea, in Iran, or almost anywhere on Earth.\n\nThe Israeli air force raid on a secluded, unmarked building in northeastern Syria took place -- a few minutes after midnight between 5 and 6 of September. To attack deep in enemy territory is easy, but Israel's American-made F-15 and F-16 jets enjoyed protection by sophisticated electronic jamming that blinded Syria's air defenses, and they had no trouble dropping tons of explosives on the target and confirming visually that it had been flattened. (Photos, many provided by Israeli intelligence, were released by the CIA to Congress - and immediately leaked to the media in Washington.)\n\nThe Syrian facility was almost identical to the Yongbyon nuclear complex in North Korea that produced plutonium for nuclear bombs, according to Israeli intelligence officials, and it was only weeks away from beginning to produce highly radioactive materials.\n\nDeir ez-Zur, the largest city in eastern Syria, would be captured in 2014 by ISIS forces and then held by the Islamic militants for more than three years. Just imagine if ISIS had gotten its hands on plutonium and other parts designed to construct nuclear bombs. Israel's action - a difficult decision by then-Prime Minister Olmert, after he unsuccessfully asked President George W. Bush to bomb the building -prevented the world's most bloodthirsty terrorists from acquiring the world's most lethal weapons.\n\nIsraeli ministers and officials are proud of it. Olmert, who later resigned amid accusations of corruption, which eventually after being indicted by a court landed him in prison for 18 months, told us it was one of his most important and difficult decisions. Even his nemesis, then defense minister Ehud Barak, said in an interview: \"Olmert deserve full credit for the brazen decision.\"\n\nLifting the veil of secrecy also reveals an ego battle for credit between Israel's two largest intelligence agencies. \"The exposure of the reactor is one of the great achievements of Military Intelligence [the agency known by its Hebrew acronym, Aman] in particular, and of Israeli intelligence in general,\" said Brig. Gen. Shalom Dror, who in 2007 was a major in charge of Aman's research on Syria. Yet Pardo, who was deputy director of the Mossad at the time (and from 2011 through 2015 the spy agency's chief), differs: \"For years, Syria built a nuclear reactor under our noses, and we did not know about it for years. It was not built on the dark side of the moon, but in a neighboring country where we always thought we know almost everything.\"\n\nIsrael's highest ranking general at the time, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, recalled receiving reports on many Arab countries from Aman and the Mossad, but none linked the words \"Syria\" and \"nuclear\" in any serious way. \"Sure, suspicions arose, but there was no proof,\" continued Ashkenazi, who has since retired. \"And in intelligence work there were a lot of suspicions. Syrian nuclear was not a subject considered to be important.\"\n\nRam Ben-Barak, senior man in the Mossad for many years who was then head of one of its operations, told us: \"Anyone who says that he knew that Syria was building a nuclear reactor either doesn't know or isn't telling the truth. When we brought the information, it was a complete surprise. Until then, the assessment was maybe yes, maybe no -- that perhaps they were planning a nuclear project by the route of enriching uranium, and perhaps a reactor to produce plutonium. In short, we didn't know at all what to look for.\"\n\nThe fact that there was any attention paid to the possibility of a secret Syrian program at all was the result of a trauma suffered by Israeli intelligence near the end of 2003. Libya's dictator, the late Col. Muammar Gaddafi, publicly admitted that he had a nuclear weapons program. Western governments quickly discovered that the knowhow and materials had been sold to the Libyans by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the so-called father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, who later became a freelancer and made a fortune as a nuclear trafficker.\n\nIsrael's spy chiefs winced as they admitted they had made an error comparable to the 1973 war, when the Jewish state was taken by surprise by its neighbor's armies on Yom Kippur. Israeli intelligence had not completely ignored A.Q. Khan. They had strong evidence that he helped Iran launch its military, unacknowledged, nuclear ambitions. But they did not realize that his sales efforts had succeeded elsewhere.\n\nShabtai Shavit, who was the director of the Mossad in the 1990s, told us a few years ago that Israeli intelligence knew about Khan's travels in the Middle East - hawking his wares - but did not understand how the Pakistani engineer could provide a quick and relatively easy kit for starting the route toward a nuclear arsenal. \"If we had understood, I would have recommended that he be assassinated,\" Shavit said, \"and that would have been one of the few times that eliminating a person could have changed history.\"\n\nAfter the revelation that Gaddafi's Libya was dangerously advanced in its nuclear work, Israel's military intelligence chiefs ordered that every scrap of evidence that had been collected - but filed away without much analysis - be looked at again. Aman found reports of Khan's visits to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria. Because the first two countries were friends of the United States, it seemed highly unlikely they would pursue nuclear weapons. The agency doubled its focus on Syria, where President Bashar Assad had come to power in 2000 by default when his father died - because his elder brother, groomed for leadership, had perished in a car crash.\n\nIsraeli intelligence saw the new dictator, who had been working as an ophthalmologist in London, as having a borderline personality -- an inexperienced man who could be tempted to act recklessly or adventurously. Because his aspirations could be lethal and he sat on Israel's northeastern border, Aman commanders decided not to underestimate Assad.\n\n\"I had to explain to my people why I insisted on concerning ourselves with Syria,\" said a research head in the agency, retired Brig. Gen. Eli Ben-Meir, because the top topics at that time had been Iran and its proxy force in Lebanon, Hezbollah. Israel fought a war against the Lebanese Shiite militia in the summer of 2006 that was notably frightening due to the constant rain of rockets from Lebanon that compelled almost a million Israelis to descend to shelters or move temporarily to southern Israel.\n\nBen-Meir told us there were clues in Israel's deep and constant monitoring of Syria. Ships arrived from Asia with no apparent purpose. Trucks moved toward the east. Israel's intelligence liaisons asked friendly services, including the CIA, if they had noticed anything of a nuclear nature in Syria. The answer was negative.\n\nPardo's boss at the time, Meir Dagan (who was director of the Mossad from 2002 to 2011 and died two years ago) joined Chief of Staff Ashkenazi in asking Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for an extra budget specifically to look for a nuclear project in Syria. Aman's renowned Unit 8200 greatly increased its monitoring of all Syrian communications.\n\nIbrahim Othman, director of Syria's Atomic Energy Commission, was considered to be the man who had to know the secrets. He became a high-priority target for Israeli intelligence.\n\nAs reported elsewhere, Israel Mossad's operatives broke into rooms where he stayed in Europe, including an apartment Othman maintained in Vienna, Austria, near the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency -- and found a gold mine. Othman had left a digital device and all its data was sucked out and sent to Israeli intelligence laboratories.\n\nSurprisingly, because no one believed any vital information had been obtained, deciphering it was not a priority. The data was waiting on the laboratory's shelves a few days until it was finally deciphered. \"My intelligence officer entered my room,\" recalls Ben Barak, \"and showed me the photos taken from the phone.\" He added, smiling, \"Sometimes intelligence operations need luck.\"\n\nThe photos from Othman's device showed him in the company of some North Korean scientists and most importantly were shot inside the structure, which clearly revealed that it was a nuclear reactor to produce plutonium.\n\nThe photos were the \"smoking gun\" -- the ultimate evidence to corroborate Israel's suspicions. The information was rushed to Prime Minister Olmert, who approached U.S. President George W. Bush to ask him if the U.S. would do something about it. Bush said no, explaining that U.S. forces were fully engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan and that he didn't want to open a third front. Nevertheless, Bush didn't say anything about an Israeli raid. For Olmert, that was all he needed. He interpreted Bush's silence as a green light and instructed Lt.-General Ashkenazi to prepare an air strike.\n\nAfter the raid, Israel kept silent -- and so did Assad. Syria didn't want to admit it had violated its international commitments. Israel, for its part, figured out that if it said nothing in public, Assad would swallow his pride and not retaliate. Privately, Israeli leaders and chiefs of the military and intelligence contacted or met their allies in the West -- the U.S., UK, France, Germany -- and in the Arab world (Egypt and Jordan) to share with them the information behind the raid. Olmert also personally called Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Israel's calculation that Syria would not strike back proved correct, and the world seemed relieved that someone had removed a potentially serious threat to peace.\n\nBut to remove Iran's or North Korean nuclear threats will be a much more difficult task if President Trump decides to exercise the much-trumpeted military option.",

                "title": "White House plans China trade crackdown Thursday",
                "body": "The White House is preparing to announce on Thursday a plan to eventually hit China with tariffs and other trade restrictions, according to two administration officials.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is slated to outline the results of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's investigation into allegations that China violates U.S. intellectual property rights by forcing American companies to transfer valuable technology to Beijing.\n\nLighthizer's office has determined that the United States loses at least $30 billion a year to China's alleged forced technology transfers. As POLITICO reported last week, the administration is weighing a package of tariffs equivalent to that amount of Chinese imports or more.\n\nTrump's senior advisers have been debating which remedies to impose in response to the investigation for months, and they have drafted proposals for tariffs, investment restrictions and even visa limits aimed at China.\n\nBut it's unclear whether the president will unveil specific retaliatory measures Thursday. People familiar with the internal debate said there are still ongoing discussions about exactly which actions the administration should take. Trump could instead simply instruct key agencies to finalize the proposals in the coming weeks or months.\n\nThe timing of the Thursday announcement could slip, especially if a snowstorm shuts down much of Washington midweek. The White House declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nThe administration is seeking to target goods that are \"meaningful to China,\" especially products and technology Beijing is seeking to boost through the Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at growing its high-tech sectors, an administration official said.\n\nTwo sources briefed on the administration's planning said the White House is considering imposing tariffs on between $30 billion and $50 billion in Chinese imports. Those goods would be hit with one tariff rate across the board -- with the intention of blocking most of those imports from entering the U.S. market, the sources said. But administration officials said the final numbers are still in flux.\n\nThe U.S. trade actions might eventually bring China to the table to talk about American concerns with Beijing's industrial overcapacity, state subsidies and lack of market access for U.S. companies.\n\nStill unclear is whether the White House has any specific thresholds for progress on those issues and what China might do for the U.S. to reverse the tariffs or investment curbs, according to administration officials and outside advisers.\n\n\"It's a little bit of a red herring for the business community to be overly critical that there aren't clear off-ramps for China, because it's really unclear if the Chinese would even take them,\" said one outside adviser to the administration who has been briefed on the planning of the trade actions against China.\n\nThe adviser added that leaders gathered this week at China's National People's Congress, the country's rubber-stamping legislative body, appeared to \"quintuple down\" on their industrial policies geared toward elevating the country's economy.\n\nStill, the business community has urged congressional trade leaders to press Lighthizer, who is scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill this week, on what kind of outcome the administration hopes to achieve. Trump was granted the authority to impose the trade restrictions under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.\n\n\"The overall focus of the Section 301 investigation should be to bring China to the negotiating table for a meaningful resolution of specific, sector-by-sector issues with the ultimate goal of removing the offending practices and policies. Premature, unilateral sanctions alone are unlikely to achieve this objective,\" National Foreign Trade Council President Rufus Yerxa wrote in a letter sent Tuesday to Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees.\n\nThe expected 300-page report the administration is putting together as part of its probe into China's intellectual property and technology transfer policies makes some recommendations on what China should do to curb those practices, a source familiar with its contents said.\n\nBut the tariff action Trump is ready to move ahead with seems geared more toward gaining leverage against China than achieving a methodical engagement that U.S. businesses would prefer, said an administration official involved in the planning.\n\n\"There's a recognition that you have to punch a bully in the face,\" the official said. \"That's the best explanation of what's going on here.\"",

                "body": "TALLAHASSEE -- Responding to terrified parents of students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Gov. Rick Scott asked Broward County authorities to temporarily post an armed law enforcement officer at \"every point of entry\" at the school after a series of disturbing events in recent days.\n\nScott's announcement capped a wild -- and frightening day -- at Stoneman Douglas in Parkland. Two students were arrested for bringing knives to school in separate incidents, a deputy was suspended for sleeping on the job at the school and a third student was hospitalized under the Baker Act after posting menacing messages of himself, armed with a BB gun, on Snapchat while also using the gamer name NickCruz, a reference to the Feb. 14 shooter, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel.\n\nOn Monday, the shooter's 18-year-old brother, Zachary Cruz, was arrested at the school for trespassing.\n\nIt was only last month when police say shooter Nikolas Cruz, carrying an AR-15, shot and killed 17 people, including 14 students, in a Valentine's Day massacre. He wounded 17 others.\n\n\"Recent events at the school have demonstrated the need for additional security measures to be implemented,\" Scott wrote in his letter Tuesday to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel and Superintendent Robert Runcie. \"Parents, students and teachers have recently endured one of the worst tragedies in Florida history. They must be assured that every necessary step is being taken to increase safety and ensure no unauthorized people are allowed on campus.\"\n\nScott said parents of Stoneman Douglas students, including those whose children were killed Feb. 14, contacted him with serious concerns about security at the school.\n\nRyan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was killed last month, said he was especially alarmed at news that the shooter's younger brother had been caught trespassing on school grounds on Monday. Zachary Cruz told BSO detectives that he rode his skateboard onto the campus, ignoring orders by authorities to stay away from the school. He told BSO detectives that he had gone there to \"reflect on the school shooting and soak it in.\"\n\n\"It's a concern he came back to campus. Look what happened a month ago,\" said Petty. \"We're unclear why he came back and the buzz is he might have been here a few times. After what happened, we can't take any chances.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, BSO said they arrested a 10th-grade Stoneman Douglas student on a misdemeanor charge for making a threat on social media. The student, who was not identified because he's a juvenile, had posted disturbing photos on Snapchat that included one of the teen displaying a gun in his waistband. In another image, the teen is showing off bullets, according to BSO officials, who also said the photos contained \"threatening messages\" and that one was directed at \"a person named 'Josh.'\" BSO detectives said the teen was hospitalized under the Baker Act \"for being a threat to himself.\"\n\nPetty said he and at least five other families he knew of kept their kids home from school on Tuesday.\n\n\"As parents, you can't trust your child safety to law enforcement or the school,\" he said. \"That's an unfortunate lesson we learned.\"\n\nPetty said the families of the slain \"universally\" appreciated Scott for what he has done so far. He said the appreciation is bipartisan, and lauded Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch, who's \"always available and compassionate.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) reacted with incredulity to the report that a BSO deputy was suspended after being caught sleeping while on duty at Stoneman Douglas. \"Of all the schools in America, you would think this would be the safest one right now. This is so outrageous it's almost impossible to believe.\"",

Austin-Travis County EMS said there had been reports of at least one person injured, though it was not immediately clear how serious the injuries were.\n\nIt came as investigators who have pursued a suspected serial bomber terrorizing Austin for weeks uncovered what seemed like valuable new leads in the case.\n\nEven before the report of the Goodwill blast, it had already been a busy day for authorities. Before dawn Tuesday, a bomb inside a package exploded around 1 a.m. as it passed along a conveyer belt at a FedEx shipping center near San Antonio, causing minor injuries to a worker. The Austin Police Department, the FBI and other federal agencies confirmed that the package center blast was related to four previous ones that killed two people and seriously injured four others.\n\nThat explosion occurred at a FedEx facility in Schertz, just northeast of San Antonio and about 60 miles southwest of Austin.\n\nLater in the morning, police sent a bomb squad to a FedEx facility outside the Austin airport to check on a suspicious package that was reported around 6:20 a.m. Federal agencies and police later said that package had indeed contained an explosive that was successfully intercepted by authorities. They added that the intercepted package, too, was believed to be related to the other bombings.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities also closed off an Austin-area FedEx store where they believe the bomb that exploded was shipped to the distribution center. They roped off a large area around the shopping center in the enclave of Sunset Valley and were collecting evidence, including surveillance camera footage.\n\nThen, authorities closed off an Austin-area FedEx store where they believe the bomb that exploded was shipped to the distribution center -- roping off a large area around the shopping center in the enclave of Sunset Valley and were collecting evidence, including surveillance camera footage.\n\nRep.

                "body": "MIAMI -- Scott Fuhrman said he chuckled at the \"gall\" of Democratic congressional candidate Donna Shalala when her campaign emailed him an invite to her Wednesday campaign kickoff fundraiser in Miami.\n\nTwo years ago, Fuhrman ran for the same seat, but Shalala didn't contribute to her fellow Democrat. And she did something even worse for Fuhrman. So he let the campaign know it.\n\n\"You do know that she donated to my opponent, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, last cycle? Are you seriously asking me for money? GFY,\" Fuhrman emailed the campaign of Shalala.\n\nTurns out that Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring, isn't the only Florida Republican who received contributions from Shalala, who's the past executive director of the Clinton Foundation, former University of Miami president and served as former President Bill Clinton's health and human services secretary. And Fuhrman isn't the only Democrat to take\n\nnotice in Florida's 27th Congressional District. Seven others are running in the crowded primary for the seat, which is seen as one of the nation's most likely to flip from Republican control this year, and some are making a campaign issue of Shalala's GOP contributions.\n\nIn all, Shalala has personally contributed $21,500 to Florida Republicans running for office in Miami-Dade County, Tallahassee or Washington over the past decade. Her campaign notes that the money's a pittance compared to the nearly $230,000 she has personally contributed to Democrats nationally in her career.\n\n\"Questioning Donna Shalala's credentials as a Democrat is ridiculous on its face, as her name is synonymous with the Democratic Party,\" her campaign adviser, Fernand Amandi, said in a written statement.\n\n\"The voters in CD 27 know that Donna Shalala is one of America's most respected public servants precisely because of her track record of working across party lines to get things done, without ever sacrificing her principles as a Democratic stalwart,\" he said. \"Her pedigree as a Democrat is unassailable, just ask the three living Democratic Presidents that she's worked with and for.\"\n\nBut Fuhrman said Shalala is out of step with the modern Democratic Party, which is one reason he endorsed one of her opponents, state Rep. David Richardson (D-Miami Beach). The two men share a political adviser, Eric Johnson. Another former Fuhrman adviser, Ben Pollara, works for yet another Democratic candidate in the race, former Circuit Judge Mary Barzee Flores.\n\nWhen Fuhrman told the two campaigns about Shalala's fundraiser, they pulled her political contribution data and discovered 13 donors listed on Shalala's Wednesday night fundraiser gave $785,000 more to Republicans than Democrats. The donors are a who's who of political heavyweights in Miami, including Cesar L. Alvarez, senior chairman of the Greenberg Traurig law firm, powerhouse lawyer Dean Colson and Barbara Havenick, president and CEO of Magic City Casino/Flagler Greyhound Track. Many of them were connected to Shalala through UM.\n\nShalala and Alvarez also sat on a health consulting company board, MEDNAX, which contributed $4,875 in 2016 to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who's reviled by many Democrats. Barzee Flores' advisor, Pollara, said the contribution \"almost perfectly sums up the contrast of this race: Donna Shalala gave tens of thousands of dollars to elect anti-choice, pro-NRA Republicans, while Mary's nomination to the federal bench was blocked by one of the anti-choice, pro-NRA Republicans that Shalala helped fund: Marco Rubio.\"\n\nSimilarly, Richardson swiped at Shalala for \"contributing to right-wing Republicans who support the NRA, oppose a women's right to choose and LGBT rights.\"\n\nBut Shalala's campaign said she'll accept help from Republicans as well as Democrats. And she has no regrets for contributing $500 to Ros-Lehtinen in 2011 and 2014 and another $1,000 to Ros-Lehtinen in 2015 before Fuhrman ran against her.\n\n\"In the same way that Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen won election after election with strong bipartisan support, our campaign is proud to welcome the votes and contributions of Americans from all parties who want to send Secretary Shalala to Congress to stop the Trump agenda,\" the campaign said.\n\nSaid Fuhrman: \"I wish Donna well in her retirement with Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.\"",

The agency has said the expensive flights were necessary because of the high number of security threats Pruitt has received.\n\nThat $105,000 figure doesn't include an additional $58,000 Pruitt rang up on charter flights and a military jet to carry him and his staff from an event with President Donald Trump in Cincinnati to catch a connecting flight to Europe out of New York, according to previously released records.\n\nThe most expensive airfare listed in the new documents was a $16,217 trip in December to Morocco where Pruitt touted American natural gas exports. Pruitt missed a connecting flight and stayed overnight in Paris, and appears to have missed other two flights to Morocco before flying to Rabat on Monday, Dec. 11. He left the country two days later.\n\nThe travel information also shows Pruitt originally intended to travel to Australia from Aug. 31 through Sept. 8 to \"discuss best practices regarding the environmental operations\" within the country. But that trip to Sydney and Melbourne was eventually scrapped.\n\nIn a letter to Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the committee that requested the documents a month ago, EPA noted Pruitt and his family have been the targets of direct and implied threats.\n\nThe agency has approved the first-class flights \"on an individualized basis,\" the letter said.\n\n\"[As] the letter explains, EPA's Protective Service Detail identified specific ongoing threats associated with Administrator Pruitt's travel and shifted his class based on certain security protocols that require him to be near the front of the plane,\" EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said.\n\nThe committee said it is \"in the process of reviewing and evaluating the documents and information,\" which will determine its next steps.",

                "title": "Trump subjected to trifecta of sex-scandal lawsuits",
                "body": "The president, already dealing with the Russia probe, is at the center of litigation in two states related to allegations of affairs or harassment.\n\nAs a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to sue the slew of women accusing him of sexual misconduct. That never happened.\n\nBut more than a year after Trump took office, he finds himself the target instead, increasingly enmeshed in litigation related to pre-election efforts to contain stories about his alleged sexual affairs and improprieties -- a legal morass seemingly unrelated to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump's campaign's alleged collusion with Russia and the firing of FBI director James Comey, among other issues.\n\nJust Tuesday, former Playboy model Karen McDougal sued the publisher of the National Enquirer to escape an agreement that appears to have been aimed at bottling up her story of an affair with Trump. And a state court judge in New York rejected a bid by Trump's legal team to use presidential immunity to shut down a lawsuit from former \"Apprentice\" contestant Summer Zervos, who says Trump groped her and kissed her against her wishes.\n\nThose developments came amid an ongoing legal battle between Trump and adult film star Stormy Daniels, who claims to have had a sexual encounter with Trump over a decade ago. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is suing to void a non-disclosure agreement she agreed to exchange for a $130,000 payment just before the election. Trump's side is arguing that she owes more than $20 million for violating the terms of the deal.\n\nAll indications are the issue will not fade away. An interview with Daniels is set to air Sunday on \"60 Minutes.\" And Tuesday afternoon Daniels took to Twitter to rebut a critic who urged her to \"disappear.\"\n\n\"Technically I didn't sleep with the POTUS 12 years ago. There was no sleeping (hehe) and he was just a goofy reality TV star,\" she wrote. \"People DO care that he lied about it, had me bullied, broke laws to cover it up, etc. And PS...I am NOT going anywhere.\"\n\nThe lawyer who went to the Supreme Court in an unsuccessful effort to block a sexual harassment and defamation suit against President Bill Clinton, Robert Bennett, said he expects the litigation against Trump to keep building.\n\n\"More and more people are going to come out of the woodwork,\" Bennett told POLITICO. \"I think it proves I was right in my argument before the high court....These things are not isolated and once you say that a litigant can sue a president, you're opening a door to the very kind of thing that is now happening.\n\nIndeed, the judge assigned to Zervos' case cited that Clinton precedent Tuesday as she ruled that presidents enjoy no broad immunity from suit over their unofficial actions, whether those cases are filed in federal or state court.\n\n\"No one is above the law,\" New York Justice Jennifer Schecter wrote. \"There is absolutely no authority for dismissing or staying a civil action related to purely unofficial conduct because defendant is President of the United States.\"\n\nThe immediate question for Trump's team now is not whether they can wipe out the building pile of litigation, but how long they can keep it at bay.\n\nBennett remarked Tuesday that despite the 9-0 beating he ultimately took at the Supreme Court, he still considers the foray a success because it managed to stave off Paula Jones' suit until after the 1996 election.\n\n\"We won when the Supreme Court took the case, for this very reason,\" the veteran Washington lawyer said. \"Lloyd Cutler [the White House Counsel] and I broke out a bottle of champagne because we knew that before the 1996 election he would not be deposed....My mission really was to get the thing on hold until after the 1996 elections.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers may well be able to delay some of the litigation, like Zervos' suit. Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz said Tuesday he plans to file an appeal and to ask the judge to stay the case as the appeal goes forward.\n\n\"The more prominent, the more controversial the case is, the more pressure I think would be on the court to grant the stay, said Fordham law professor Benjamin Zipursky.\n\nZipursky said it is possible that as the number of suits involving Trump grows, the Supreme Court may consider weighing in, especially in light of criticism that its 1997 ruling understated the threat of a wave of litigation distracting a president from his duties.\n\n\"I don't think it's implausible, that if it keeps climbing through the courts that at the end the Supreme Court would be willing to take it,\" the professor said. \"It could take years.\"\n\nZervos' lawyers have indicated they plan to press to question Trump, regardless of what appeals his legal team may pursue. Her attorneys have already mocked the notion that Trump is too busy to face questioning in their case.\n\n\"We can take a deposition down to Mar-a-Lago in between him going to play golf,\" attorney Mariann Wang said at a December hearing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOne conservative lawyer who was part of Jones' legal team two decades ago praised Schecter's ruling Tuesday and predicted fact-gathering in the Zervos case will move forward.\n\n\"The decision's immunity holding is unimpeachably correct which strongly cuts against a stay pending appeal,\" George Conway, who was considered for several Trump administration jobs and is married to White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, wrote on Twitter. \"Justice Schecter did a nice job.\"\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said the flurry of civil lawsuits could be more threatening to Trump than the Russia probe.\n\n\"I would not be worried about obstruction,\" Turley said. \"Financial stuff, false statements and Stormy Daniels are the real big ones.\"\n\nBennett says the pile-up of sex-related litigation could prove even more distracting to Trump because of the nature of his personality.\n\n\"Bill Clinton was remarkable in his ability to compartmentalize things. Trump is not that way,\" the veteran D.C. attorney said. \"He takes to heart anything that anyone says about him....He must be stewing over these. Every person has their own personality and his is going to make this worse.\"",

                "body": "Walmart and other supermarkets in Puerto Rico were forced to throw out tons of perishable meat and produce after Hurricane Maria when their pleas for emergency fuel were ignored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to congressional investigators.\n\nThe retail giant and others reached out to FEMA officials repeatedly after the storm, seeking fuel to keep food refrigerated. They enlisted the help of Gov. Ricard Rosselló and other island officials, as well as members of Congress, to deliver emails, texts and in-person messages to FEMA. In one instance, a Puerto Rico official received an urgent email from Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) on Sept. 22 while the official was sitting in a meeting with FEMA.\n\n\"FYI I'm sitting with the FEMA rep right now so we are taking care of this,\" the Puerto Rico official wrote minutes after receiving the Gutierrez email.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Rep. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands) released details of the emails in a letter to the committee chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), on Tuesday. In the letter, they repeated a longstanding request for a subpoena to force the Department of Homeland Security to produce documents related to FEMA's disaster response.\n\n\"Senior officials at Walmart took extraordinary measures to try to convey their emergency requests to FEMA,\" Cummings and Plaskett wrote. \"FEMA did not respond to requests for fuel as tons of desperately needed food went bad.\"\n\nOn Sept. 25, a Walmart official said the company had two days' worth of generator fuel left at its distribution center on the island.\n\n\"It is critical that we keep that going in order to preserve our fresh inventory,\" the executive said in a text to a Puerto Rico official. \"If that goes down it could take weeks to replenish which would have a big negative impact on the island.\"\n\n\"Noted,\" the official responded. \"I do not know what is going on with communication in FEMA right now.\"\n\nBy Sept. 27, a week after Hurricane Maria made landfall, Rosselló personally intervened, asking FEMA Acting Regional Administrator John Rabin to get generator fuel to grocery stores \"immediately.\" The fuel never arrived.\n\nWalmart and other retailers were forced to throw out food even as people stood in line outside stores, according to the letter. \"It is unclear how many tons of perishable meat, dairy and produce were lost,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nIn October, Gowdy and Cummings asked DHS and FEMA to produce documents related to the storm response in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The agencies have since been \"stonewalling\" and have \"not produced a single email relating to the hurricanes in Puerto Rico,\" Cummings and Plaskett wrote.\n\n\"We reiterate our request that you issue a subpoena to compel DHS to produce all of the documents we originally requested,\" the lawmakers wrote.",

Circuit Court of Appeals precluded him from taking up cases that charged that the president was shirking his duties under the Presidential Records Act.\n\nThe Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act was originally enacted by Congress in 1974 in the aftermath of former President Richard Nixon's resignation. It was intended to shield presidential records by placing them in federal custody.\n\nThe Presidential Records Act was later enacted to mandate the preservation of records from the president's and vice president's offices while also making their ownership public.",

But he now is on the brink of leaving Congress well before the end of his term, which would allow him to dodge an Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of inappropriate office behavior.\n\nFarenthold has not made a final decision, but has spoken informally with several top Republicans about the possibility of stepping down. If he does resign, it could trigger a special election in his conservative Texas district, which runs from the coastal city of Corpus Christi to the outskirts of Austin.\n\nStacey Daniels, Farenthold's spokesman, said Tuesday afternoon, \"The Congressman has no plans to resign at this time.\"\n\nTales of allegations of misbehavior in Farenthold's office first surfaced late last year. Lauren Greene, a former aide to Farenthold, sued the Texas Republican for creating a hostile work environment, gender discrimination and sexual harassment. She said Farenthold told her he had fantasies and \"wet dreams\" about her. After complaining about the behavior, Greene said she was fired.\n\nCNN reported last year that Michael Rekola, another former aide to the Texan, told the Ethics Committee that Farenthold was verbally abusive to him.

                "title": "Trump can execute drug dealers already ",
                "body": "Under a capital punishment statute signed by Bill Clinton, drug dealers can be executed. But federal prosecutors have never used it.\n\nThe state execution of drug smugglers that President Donald Trump has pushed for as part of his plan to combat the opioid crisis is already legal under a 1994 law passed at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic.\n\nBut in 24 years, federal prosecutors have never once used it. They hardly need to, considering the draconian penalties already available for punishing convicted drug smugglers.\n\nSigned by President Bill Clinton, the 1994 death penalty statute was part of a clampdown on drug dealers in response to the crack epidemic, linked to a surge of crime and violence in American cities in the 1980s and 1990s. But it was a bridge too far even for zealous prosecutors because many believed it would be found to violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, said Ojmarrh Mitchell, a professor of statistics and criminology at the University of South Florida.\n\n\"In the absence of a direct link to a death, the constitutionality of death penalty prosecution is shaky at best,\" said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University.\n\nThe 1994 legislative package authorizes capital punishment against a defendant who directs a continuing criminal enterprise involving either large quantities of drugs or generating $20 million a year from the enterprise. It also includes 20-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug sales that result in overdose deaths. It has been used to execute drug kingpins for murders committed in the course of their business.\n\nAt the state level, meanwhile, at least 20 states have their own \"drug-induced homicide\" laws, which increasingly are used to prosecute opioid dealers whose drug sales result in accidental overdose deaths.\n\nBut in as many as half of the state homicide-by-drugs cases, the accused dealer is also the wife, husband, parent or friend of the victim -- and also a drug addict.\n\nThis points to the schizoid nature of a policy that seeks to boost treatment for drug users while lowering the boom on drug dealers. Often, say researchers and prosecutors, user and dealer are one and the same -- and neither knows the specific drug substances in play.\n\n\"The evil villain in this story is very hard to find,\" said John Roman, a drug policy researcher at NORC at the University of Chicago. \"The people who are convenient for arrest for the most part aren't that evil villain.\"\n\nIn its comment on a 2008 child rape case, the Supreme Court effectively removed drug smuggling per se as a capital crime, said Berman. \"It has never been pursued, and if it were pursued with Trump's urging, there would be extensive litigation that would go to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nTrump might have more luck convincing Congress to pass a law under the 1987 Tison v. Arizona case, in which the court approved the death penalty on the grounds of \"reckless indifference to human life,\" Berman said. That standard might apply, say, to a dealer wrangling pounds of carfentanil, which is 5,000 times as potent as a unit of heroin and which can kill in nearly molecular doses.\n\nBut most policy experts view harsh drug sentences as causing more harm than good by sending hundreds of thousands of small-time criminals to prison. The war on drugs has had no impact on drug prices, for instance.\n\n\"There were 15,000 drug offenders behind bars in 1980, and 500,000 today, but the price of heroin is at an all-time low, the price of cocaine is at an all-time low,\" says Mark Kleiman, a drug policy expert at New York University.\n\nThere are dealers who \"are in this to make money and don't care if they kill people in the process,\" and \"those people should be incarcerated,\" said Thomas Carr, director of the Washington/Baltimore High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, part of a White House-coordinated anti-drug effort.\n\nBut \"a lot of people buying or selling are not aware that they are buying fentanyl,\" Carr said. \"They think it's heroin.\"\n\nTrump invoked the death penalty six times during his remarks in New Hampshire, a state hit hard by the addiction crisis. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement later Monday that his Justice Department would \"continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.\"\n\nSessions has already pushed for harsher penalties for dealers, including by increasing charges for handling tiny amounts of fentanyl.\n\nIronically, however, prosecutions of drug use and trafficking declined in fiscal year 2017. This followed a trend begun in the Obama administration, which encouraged alternatives to prison time. Post-election reorganization of federal prosecutors' offices may have stymied Sessions, Berman said.\n\nIn one recent case, in December, federal prosecutors obtained a 30-year sentence against a Wellington, Fla., drug dealer whose client died after taking a mixture of heroin and fentanyl.\n\nJon Zibbell, a medical anthropologist at RTI International who regularly interviews opioid dealers and users, warned against a 1980s-style panic in response to fentanyl's lethality. A major new drug enforcement push could swell the prison population with low-level dealers without making a dent in supply -- just like the response to the crack epidemic, he said.\n\n\"There's this myth out there that dealers don't care if their users live or die,\" Zibbell said. \"I've never encountered that. I just think that fentanyl is a hard product to mix safely.\"\n\nState and federal prosecutors, under pressure from grief-stricken relatives of overdose victims, are pressing for harsh penalties against dealers, said Dave Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing the federal government could do to reduce deaths is to pressure China to end export of fentanyl, because that's what's killing people,\" he added.",

It is terrible when that happens on the playground,\" Trump said during a rare speaking appearance at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. \"And it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet.\"\n\nShe continued: \"We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media.\"\n\nThe first lady revisited the topic last September during her first trip to the United Nations, where she stressed that adults, \"by our own example,\" must lead in teaching children how to properly engage on the internet and on social media.",

                "body": "The Justice Department on Tuesday afternoon is briefing the House Judiciary Committee on the highly classified material that was used to craft a Republican memo alleging misconduct by senior FBI officials.\n\nThe memo, released in February by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, alleged that top FBI agents misled a federal court to obtain a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign aide in October 2016. The FBI and top Democrats have called the memo misleading, arguing that it omitted context to paint the FBI officials in a negative light.\n\nOnly a handful of lawmakers, though, have actually seen the highly classified intelligence that undergirded the GOP memo and a Democratic rebuttal also released last month. They include Reps. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), senior members of the House Intelligence Committee, as well as Reps. Bob Goodlatte (D-Va.) and Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the top Republican and Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nSchiff and Nadler argued in advance of the release of the GOP memo -- which was declassified by President Donald Trump -- that members of their committee should be given access to the underlying intelligence in order to determine the accuracy of the claims. But their demands were rebuffed at the time.\n\n\"Too many of our colleagues appear to be constructing their own version of history,\" Nadler wrote to Goodlatte in late January. \"Our members should have the benefit of access to the actual record without delay.\"\n\nThe briefing won't include access to the underlying documents themselves, according to a source familiar with the format, but will give lawmakers a chance to ask questions of top Justice Department officials about the underlying intelligence.\n\nThe briefing for Judiciary Committee members comes amid calls by Gowdy and Goodlatte for a special counsel to investigate the FBI's actions during the 2016 election, including its handling of its controversial surveillance program known as FISA.\n\n\"We believe that, in the case of certain decisions made and not made by the Department of Justice and FBI in 2016 and 2017, both an actual conflict of interest exists and separately, but equally significantly, the public interest requires the appointment of a Special Counsel,\" the GOP lawmakers wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this month.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee memo released by Republicans accused top FBI officials of obtaining a warrant to spy on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in October 2016 based on material included in a dossier compiled by former British intelligence agency Christopher Steele. The so-called Steele dossier described an intricate, years-long plot by the Russian government to cultivate a relationship with Trump and help him win the 2016 election. It also alleged Russians possessed compromising information about Trump that could be used as leverage.\n\nTrump and his allies in Congress have fiercely rejected the dossier as a fiction, and they've suggested that the FBI relied on the document without sufficient corroboration to obtain the authority to spy on Page. They also contend the FBI obtained its surveillance warrant without notifying a judge that Steele's work was underwritten by the campaign of Trump's rival Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, which hired the firm that contracted with Steele to produce the dossier.\n\nDemocrats, in their rebuttal memo, countered that the FBI did disclose the political origins of the dossier and followed standard protocol by omitting the name of the campaign and the firm, Fusion GPS, from its warrant application.",

                "title": "Former Playboy model sues for freedom to speak about Trump",
                "body": "A former Playboy model who claims she had a sexual relationship with Donald Trump sued the National Enquirer's parent company Tuesday seeking to void a contract that prevents her from speaking publicly about it.\n\nKaren McDougal, who filed her complaint against tabloid publisher American Media Inc. in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims that American Media executives and her own lawyer pressured her into accepting $150,000 in exchange for exclusive rights to the story of her romantic relationship with Trump, which she says took place more than a decade ago. The contract, finalized in 2016 after Trump had won the Republican nomination for president, also promised that McDougal would appear on two magazine covers and gave her a deal to write two years of feature articles.\n\n\"Ms. McDougal thought (naively) that such a deal could give her the best of all worlds--her private story could stay private, she could make some money, and she could revitalize her career,\" her lawsuit states. \"What she did not realize was that she would end up treated as a puppet by powerful men colluding to achieve their own financial and political ends.\"\n\nMcDougal is the second woman seeking to be released from hush-money deals that require them to keep quiet about affairs they had with Trump before he was elected president. The claims have prompted a federal inquiry into possible campaign finance violations and could pose a mounting legal threat to the president.\n\nThe suit claims that Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer and a former attorney for the Trump Organization, was secretly involved in crafting the agreement with American Media to keep details of McDougal's 10-month relationship with Trump out of the press at a critical time in the campaign.\n\nMcDougal, whose claims were the subject of a long article published in February by The New Yorker, also contends that the Enquirer had no intention of publishing her story and rather paid for the rights as part of a practice known as \"catch and kill\" intended to stop stories that cast Trump in a negative light from being published.\n\nDavid Pecker, chairman and chief executive officer of American Media, has called Trump a \"personal friend.\"\n\n\"AMI lied to me, made empty promises, and repeatedly intimidated and manipulated me,\" McDougal said in a written statement. \"I just want the opportunity to set the record straight and move on with my life, free from this company, its executives, and its lawyers.\" The lawsuit, which doesn't name Trump as a defendant, accuses American Media of fraud and asks the court to declare the agreement void.\n\nA spokesperson for American Media said Tuesday that McDougal was \"free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with the president.\"\n\n\"Karen signed a contract that gave AMI the editorial discretion to publish her life story, and she promised to write health and fitness columns and appear on the cover of two magazines,\" the spokesperson added. \"AMI has a valid contract with Karen and we look forward to reaching an amicable resolution satisfactory to her and to AMI.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to request for comment.\n\nMcDougal's lawsuit is the third legal complaint to center on Trump's behavior with women.\n\nFormer Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos last year accused Trump of sexually harassing her in 2007 and sued him for defamation. On Tuesday, a Manhattan Supreme Court judge allowed a defamation lawsuit against Trump to move forward. Justice Jennifer Schecter wrote that a \"sitting president is not immune from being sued in federal court for unofficial acts,\" citing precedent that led to President Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998.\n\nAnd McDougal's lawsuit lands just days before Stormy Daniels is scheduled to appear on 60 Minutes. Daniels, a porn actress whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, also had a relationship with Trump in 2006 and 2007. Two weeks before Trump was elected, Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 in exchange for her silence about the affair. Daniels filed suit earlier this month seeking to void that contract, naming Trump as a defendant.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission has opened an inquiry into Cohen's payment after government watchdog complaints that it could amount to an illegal campaign donation.",

                "body": "Facebook is launching the beginnings of a charm offensive in Washington as controversy builds over revelations that the social network's user data was improperly accessed by Trump-affiliated firm Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe company said it's sending staffers to brief a half dozen of Capitol Hill's most powerful committees this week, including the Intelligence, Commerce and Judiciary panels in both chambers. But the briefings may not be enough to satisfy the growing number of lawmakers who want Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg or Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to testify on the Hill.\n\n\"I want to know why this happened, and what's the extent of the damage, and how they're going to fix it moving forward,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Tuesday when asked about the briefings. Facebook executives, she added, \"aren't coming yet, but they better come.\"\n\n\"Eventually, Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify -- he needs to be subpoenaed if he won't do it voluntarily,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) \"They can begin with some staff people, but it's only the beginning.\"\n\nFacebook is confronting a firestorm of criticism for failing to prevent Cambridge Analytica from allegedly compiling and keeping a cache of data drawn from the social media profiles of some 50 million Americans. The social network has already faced months of blowback over fake news and Russian election meddling on its platform -- and is struggling to contain the fallout in Washington.\n\nThe company's problems appeared to deepen Monday after reports that its chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, will leave the company over internal conflicts about its approach to curbing Russian misinformation. (Both Facebook and Stamos said he remains engaged with his work but did not directly address the question of his departure.)\n\nMuch of the outrage is coming from Democrats, while key Republicans are mulling over how much they want to make an issue of the Facebook flap. Asked Tuesday if he intends to summon Zuckerberg, Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said, \"We'll see.\"\n\n\"We've got a questionnaire they're responding to and then a staff briefing and then we'll make a decision based on that. But I would say it's not outside the realm of possibility,\" Thune said.\n\nOver in the House, Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who detailed Cambridge Analytica's alleged misuse of the Facebook data, will meet with House Intel Democrats to discuss the situation, his attorney, Tamsin Allen, confirmed Tuesday. The panel's ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), had invited Wylie to brief Democrats earlier this week.\n\nAs Facebook's congressional outreach ramps up, the company is getting hit on another front in Washington: a new inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission. The agency plans to send the company a series of questions about the Cambridge Analytica issue, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nUnder a 2011 consent decree with the FTC, Facebook agreed to get express permission and notify users before sharing their data with third parties. The social network could face massive fines if the FTC determines it violated the terms of the agreement.\n\nThe agency declined to comment on whether it's investigating, but said, \"We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously as we did in 2012 in a privacy case involving Google.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica, which did voter analysis work for the Trump campaign, obtained the Facebook account information from academic Aleksandr Kogan, who in 2014 developed an app that harvested Facebook data for research. Facebook has suspended both Cambridge Analytica and Kogan as it looks into the firm's receipt, use and retention of the data.\n\n\"We remain strongly committed to protecting people's information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have,\" Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said in a statement.",

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who criticized Trump's attorney John Dowd for issuing a statement calling for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to end Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"If you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it,\" Gowdy, who is not seeking reelection, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nSanders called the response \"ridiculous\" given the prevalence of the Russia investigation over the past year.\n\n\"To pretend like going through this absurd process for over a year would not bring frustration seems a little ridiculous,\" Sanders told reporters. \"I don't think any individual, including members of Congress, would like it if they had been accused of taking their seat in Congress by doing something nefarious when they hadn't, particularly if it went on more than a year into their time in office.\"",

                "body": "Cynthia Nixon's first official day on the campaign trail got a little boost from the failing subway system that she has already made a central issue in her underdog fight to oust Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nAt about 10:45 a.m. Tuesday -- 15 minutes before she was scheduled to make her official campaign announcement one stop and a short walk away -- Nixon stood on the subway platform at Utica Avenue, looking around with resignation. She was having an experience common among New Yorkers these days: The 3 train that would take her to her final stop at Sutter Avenue was not running. In fact, two consecutive 3 trains had been pulled out of service, because of a sick passenger.\n\nOne woman got off a train coming from the other direction, talked a moment with Nixon, and told her, \"I'm voting for you, definitely.\"\n\nAside from picking up a vote, the delay also provided a convenient opening for Nixon in the attack she had in store moments later inside the Bethesda Healing Center, a small Pentecostal church in Brownsville where Nixon chose to officially kick off her campaign.\n\n\"I got here just in the nick of time. I allowed an hour and a half for what should have been a 30 minute ride -- Cuomo's MTA,\" she told a crowd of about 50 people. \"Three trains pulled out of service. We had to get off three trains. I'm glad I'm here. I'm glad you're all here.\"\n\nHer dig at Cuomo's handling of the subway system was just the beginning.\n\nOn her first full day as a candidate, Nixon launched into a blistering attack on Cuomo's tenure as New York's governor, calling him a fake Democrat who'd failed to live up to the promises he campaigned on when he first ran for office, and offering herself up as the alternative to his particular brand.\n\nIn a brief speech, delivered from behind a podium with a paper \"Cynthia for NY\" flyer tacked up to it, Nixon told the room that she'd voted for Cuomo eight years ago \"because I believed that he was a real Democrat.\"\n\nShe attacked his tacit approval for the IDC, a group of renegade Democrats who've conferenced with Senate Republicans for years. And she took aim at an obscure deal that has long haunted the Senate Democrats in Albany -- Cuomo's rumored bargain with Senate Republicans in 2010 to allow them to draw their own district maps, all but ensuring they'd stay in power in the state Senate for the next decade, despite an overwhelming Democratic enrollment advantage across the state.\n\nThat maneuver, Nixon said, suppressed \"Democratic voters, most especially Democratic voters of color.\"\n\n\"And with these two moves, Andrew Cuomo gave the Republican party in New York state the power to block almost all of our big Democratic legislative priorities,\" she said.\n\nShe questioned Cuomo's record as a centrist Democrat, who governed for much of his first term from the moderate, Clintonian wing of the Democratic party, maintaining close ties with major corporations and avoiding tax hikes.\n\nShe called his budgets \"inhumane\" and argued he'd ignored the state's infrastructure and mass transit needs.\n\nShe attacked him over his ethics, particularly the recent conviction of his former top aide Joe Percoco on federal corruption charges, calling Albany \"a cesspool.\"\n\n\"New York's eight years under the Cuomo administration have been an exercise in living with disappointment, dysfunction and dishonesty,\" she said. \"Andrew Cuomo promised to clean up Albany but instead he and his cronies have cleaned up for themselves. There is a reason that people close to Andrew Cuomo keep winding up under indictment for corruption. His right hand man Joe Percoco was just convicted of selling his office to the highest bidder.\"\n\nUnder Cuomo, she said the state had become even more unequal, with the gap between the incomes of the wealthy and the poor widening.\n\n\"Let me tell you about this kind of crushing inequality. This is not something that just happens by mistake. It comes from a choice. It comes from a choice to slash taxes for corporations and the super rich and slash services on everybody else,\" she said. \"And It's a choice we're used to being made by Republicans like Donald Trump. But for the past eight years it's a choice that has been made by our governor Andrew Cuomo.\"\n\n\"Since taking office Andrew Cuomo has given massive tax breaks to corporations and the super rich while he has decimated our infrastructure and starved our state, its cities and its rural areas of their most basic services,\" she said.\n\nNixon pledged to fund her campaign without taking corporate donations, drawing a stark contrast with Cuomo, who she said had built a \"$31 million war chest with the donations of millionaires, billionaires and corporations.\"\n\n\"Do you know how much of that came from small donors? 0.1 percent. If you're a regular person in New York, the chance that Andrew Cuomo is going to care about your concerns is exactly that -- 0.1 percent,\" she said.\n\nCuomo, she argued, has stymied the hopes of progressive Democrats across the state.\n\n\"We could have fully funded our public schools. We could have enacted campaign finance reform. We could have enacted the Women's Equality Agenda and the New York Dream Act. We could have fixed our subways, strengthened rent control and become a leader in renewable energy,\" she said.\n\n\"I am running for governor because I want these things for New York and New Yorkers. We want our state back. We want it to work again,\" she said. \"We are tired of corruption and dysfunction in Albany. We are tired of fake corporate Democrats who won't lift a finger unless their donors say it's OK.\"\n\nNixon was surrounded by a crush of cameras and reporters as she finished her speech, but a 59-year-old certified nursing assistant and New York Communities for Change activist from Ditmas Park named Winsome Pendergrass stopped her first, to talk about rising rents.\n\n\"We will fight for you girlfriend, we will pull for you girlfriend,\" Pendergrass said. \"But we're begging you, don't screw us over.\"\n\nPendergrass later told reporters she thought Nixon's candidacy was \"wonderful\" and \"a breath of fresh air.\"\n\nNixon took a handful of questions as she made her way out of the church. One was how she'd fix the subway system.\n\n\"We can't just find the money that's in the budget as it exists now,\" Nixon said. \"We need a dedicated stream of revenue to fund the subway.\"\n\nAsked if she supported congestion pricing or a millionaire's tax to fund the subway, ideas put forth by Cuomo and de Blasio, respectively, she replied, cryptically, \"I think both of those are good ideas.\"\n\nHer lack of experience in government? Not a problem, she said. \"It's time for an outsider.\"\n\nThe outsider label had already been deployed by the Cuomo team earlier in the day, giving Nixon a taste of the attacks she may face in the coming months.\n\nFormer New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, a surrogate for Cuomo, told the New York Post on Tuesday morning that Nixon's candidacy was \"a flight of fancy on her part,\" and attacked her as an \"unqualified lesbian.\"\n\n\"Cynthia Nixon was opposed to having a qualified lesbian become mayor of New York City. Now she wants to be an unqualified lesbian to be the governor of New York. You have to be qualified and have experience. She isn't qualified to be the governor,\" Quinn said.\n\n\"My being a lesbian or her being a lesbian has nothing to do with why we're running for office,\" Nixon responded when asked for comment Tuesday.\n\nIn the back of the room at the Bethesda Healing Center, 66-year old Norman Frazier, a Brownsville resident, said he'd decided to come to the campaign rollout after hearing about it Tuesday morning from people in the neighborhood. \"I heard on the news about her issues -- housing, homeless, education. I said 'I got to get out here.'\"\n\nAsked if he had voted for Cuomo for governor previously, Frazier said, \"Yes I did.\"\n\n\"That's why I'm so disappointed,\" he offered. \"And I feel like he threw us under the bus with the subway system, the housing system, the homeless system. So I am so disappointed in him.\"\n\nFrazier, who said he has lived in Brownsville for 50 years, said he thought Cuomo had been scarce in the neighborhood. \"I can't remember, as long as I've been in Brownsville, Cuomo coming to Brownsville.\"\n\nA spokesman for Cuomo's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

                "title": "If Trump Fires Mueller, Will He Reap the Whirlwind?",
                "body": "A constitutional crisis or just another Teflon Don moment? Ten political pundits weigh in.\n\nDonald Trump sure seems ready to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller -- even if White House lawyers insists it's the furthest thing from his mind. \"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" Trump tweeted on Saturday. \"It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\" A day later: \"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\"\n\nRepublicans took to the Sunday shows apparently concerned about where that tweetstorm could be headed. \"I mean, talking to my colleagues all along it was, you know, once he goes after Mueller, then we'll take action,\" Sen. Jeff Flake said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said Trump firing Mueller would \"be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\"\n\nBut would he really do it? And what political consequences would he face if he did? We rounded up a handful of political experts to answer that question, and they're just as confused as we are. Republicans and Democrats, Trump friend and Trump foe alike all agree, more or less, that firing Mueller should be a red line -- but they're not so sure it would be. Here's what they told us:\n\n***\n\n'Republicans will make some initial noise, but ultimately, do nothing.'\n\nAna Navarro is a Republican strategist and commentator.\n\nRepublicans have become the boys that cried wolf. Time and time again they have remained in complicit silence as Trump attacks American institutions, cyber-bullies the special counsel and law enforcement and one-by-one has fired the people standing in between him and Mueller.\n\nThe warnings on Sunday against such a move, from congressional Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Jeff Flake, ring hollow because the same congressional Republicans haven't acted on legislation that might actually protect the American people from obstruction of justice by their own president. These lawmakers would be a lot better off protecting the country and themselves from such an action by passing the Graham-Booker legislation, which would check the executive branch's ability to remove a special counsel and give an added layer of protection to a possible politically motivated, self-interested firing of Mueller.\n\nBut Congress hasn't acted on it. Even the bill's co-author, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, said in January that while he would \"be glad to pass it right now,\" he also didn't think it was necessary. This inaction tells us all we need to know about what the GOP will do if Trump fires Mueller -- make some initial noise, but ultimately, do nothing.\n\n'A House more willing to impeach, but a Senate less willing to convict.'\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \"The DMZ.\"\n\nThere's little reason to believe Republicans would abandon Trump if Mueller was fired. Trump and his allies have been disparaging the investigation as a political witch hunt from the start, which has successfully sullied Mueller's reputation among Republican base voters. In both the POLITICO/Morning Consult and the USA Today/Suffolk University poll, a strong plurality of Republicans distrust and disapprove of Mueller. These base voters won't flinch if Trump whacks Mueller, but they would punish any Republican officeholder open to impeachment and conviction.\n\nFiring Mueller would also supercharge the Democratic base; Democratic voters would not only be fired up for the election, they would be fired up for impeachment. But that's not all bad news for Trump: Several Democratic congresspeople up for re-election represent states and districts Trump won, including 10 senators and nine House members (including newly elected Conor Lamb). They and some other Democrats don't want the midterms to be a referendum on impeachment; they want to emphasize pocketbook issues. But impeachment talk could crowd everything else out. Perhaps that wouldn't stop a \"Blue Wave\" giving Democrats the House, but it could hamper the already uphill battle for Democrats to claim the Senate.\n\nThe net result could be a House more willing to impeach, but a Senate less willing to convict.\n\n'I haven't seen Republicans in Congress, as a whole, standing up to the president.'\n\nKatie Packer Beeson is a commentator and the founder of Burning Glass Consulting. She has managed several campaigns, from state legislative to presidential, and was the deputy campaign manager for the Mitt Romney campaign in 2012.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, I think most reasonable people would consider it to be obstruction of justice. And I hope that Republican leaders and members of Congress would see that as a red line and get serious about their own investigation.\n\nThat said, I haven't seen Republicans in Congress, as a whole, standing up to the president and his bullying, self-interested behavior in a way that gives him any pause. So I would be pleasantly surprised to see that happen.\n\nIf Congress abdicates its role in our system of checks and balances and acts only with partisan interest, then we may as well kiss our Constitution goodbye. I hope we're not there yet, but if Trump does fire Mueller, the political aftermath might tell us if we are.\n\n'Another FBI firing would make an obstruction of justice case more clear-cut than it was in Watergate.'\n\nDouglas Schoen is a political analyst and former adviser to President Bill Clinton.\n\nFiring Mueller would almost certainly lead to the impeachment of President Trump and a trial in the Senate where the chance of removal from office would be very real, because another FBI firing would make an obstruction of justice case more clear-cut than it was in Watergate.\n\nThe firing of Mueller would cross a red line for legislators of both parties, and I believe the consequences would be even direr than they were for former president Nixon when he fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in October 1973, which prompted the resignations of the attorney general and deputy attorney general. A week after those resignations, a plurality of Americans favored impeachment, and soon afterward, a number of impeachment resolutions were introduced in Congress.\n\nIt would mean a 1974-style blow in the 2018 midterm elections for the Republicans, and it would severely weaken President Trump's 2020 campaign, should he somehow stay in office until then.\n\n'I'm sure there are plenty of historians around the president who will remind him of the consequences.'\n\nFrank Luntz is a Republican pollster.\n\nWe saw what firing the special prosecutor and the attorney general did to Richard Nixon. I'm sure there are plenty of historians around the president who will remind him of the consequences.\n\n'The tidal wave of leaks from the FBI and intelligence community would be astounding.'\n\nRick Wilson is a GOP operative.\n\nIt's not a matter of if, but when, Trump fires Mueller, triggers the constitutional crisis that stains his presidential legacy forever and brings down the Republican majority.\n\nHere's what would happen immediately: nothing. The GOP would go into \"Furrowed Brows and Deep Concern\" mode, and pretend it didn't happen. Republicans fear Trump's tweets, Fox News and his base more than they revere the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution. I've said this before, and the joke is less of a joke and more of a caution at this point, but Trump could kill and eat a live baby on the South Lawn of the White House and the GOP caucus would shrug and say, \"Well, he's new at this. He's not a traditional politician.\"\n\nI think it would almost certainly make the 2018 election a referendum the GOP's support of Trump. We'd see a replay of the \"scandal turnover\" elections where one party was marked by political corruption and blown out of office.\n\nIn 1973, Republicans were screaming about fake news and witch hunts. In 1974, many of those same people were looking for jobs: The Republicans lost 48 House and 8 Senate seats that year, and Democrats made large gains in state legislatures. Twenty years later, in 1994, Democrats lost in a landslide in midterm races dominated by the issue of corruption. The GOP took that ride in 2006 in the wake of the Mark Foley congressional page scandal and the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal.\n\nWhat happens after the firing? Mueller is smart, and I presume he has a lot of the process set to continue on autopilot in the event that he gets taken off of it himself unexpectedly. Most of the FBI's work will continue regardless of whom the president fires.\n\nOh, and one thing Trump might not be anticipating as he considers the possibility of firing Mueller: The tidal wave of leaks from the FBI and intelligence community would be astounding.\n\n'It will be a lot like 1974 -- even without a presidential resignation.'\n\nMichael Kazin is the editor of Dissent.\n\nSince taking office, Trump's repeated attacks on anyone who alleges that the Russians may have helped him win the presidency -- or even that they tried -- have failed to dent his popularity among the large majority of Americans who voted for him. And hardly any Republican politicians (and no Fox hosts) have broken with him over his charges.\n\nWhy would this change if he fired Mueller? Unless the special counsel presents unimpeachable evidence of collusion, which seems doubtful, his firing may actually fire up Trump's core voters more than it alienates them. Most already think he is being hounded unfairly and like it when he fights back.\n\nOn the other hand, the controversy over the firing (depending when it occurs) will likely dominate politics until the midterm elections and make it impossible to pass any legislation of significance in the Senate if not the House. And because of it, Republicans will lose the House and quite a few governorships in the fall. It will be a lot like 1974 -- even without a presidential resignation.\n\n'All of this would only hurt GOP chances in the midterms.'\n\nScottie Nell Hughes is a political strategist and former surrogate for the Trump campaign.\n\nIf President Trump fired Mueller, vindication from the charges of Russian collusion in the court of public opinion would be almost inconceivable regardless of the truth. His opponents would cry obstruction, corruption and cover-up while doing everything they could to paint those aligned with President Trump as accomplices. Headlines, which could otherwise reflect the positive results of the Trump agenda, would be replaced with a sensationalized focus on the Russia investigation.\n\nAll of this would only hurt GOP chances in the midterms. Those who did survive would be too bruised or bitter to come to President Trump's defense after 2018.\n\nPresident Trump would do himself, the GOP and the country more of a favor by keeping Mueller but setting a reasonable time limit for the investigation to be completed.\n\n'We are already in a constitutional crisis.'\n\nSophia Nelson is author of E Pluribus One: Reclaiming Our Founders' Vision for a United America.\n\nWe are already in a constitutional crisis. The red line was crossed long ago.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, Congress will have no choice but to act and start impeachment proceedings. The president of the United States does not have unlimited power. We have a system of checks and balances that have worked for over 240 years. I hope that the Republican majority understands that it and it alone is the only thing that stands between \"we the people\" and tyranny.\n\n'Firing Mueller should come with serious consequences.'\n\nDonna Brazile is the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAll these attacks on Special Counsel Mueller are leading to something. Firing Mueller before this investigation is over should come with serious consequences.",

                "body": "A New York court denies a presidential immunity claim in a defamation suit by a former 'Apprentice' contestant.\n\nA New York judge has rejected a bid by President Donald Trump to dismiss a lawsuit relating to his alleged groping of Summer Zervos, a contestant on \"The Apprentice,\" in 2007.\n\nLawyers for Trump argued that he was immune from the suit in state court while serving as president, but Judge Jennifer Schechter ruled that there was \"absolutely no authority\" to justify tossing out litigation over \"unofficial conduct.\"\n\n\"No one is above the law,\" Schechter wrote in her 18-page decision. \"Nothing in the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution even suggests that the President cannot be called to account before a state court for wrongful conduct that bears no relationship to any federal executive responsibility.\"\n\nThe judge also declined an alternative request from Trump's attorneys that the case be put on hold until he left office.\n\n\"There are no compelling reasons for delaying plaintiff's day in court here,\" Schechter wrote.\n\nThe ruling raises the possibility that Trump could be ordered to submit to a deposition about his conduct toward Zervos and perhaps other women, as well.\n\nTrump's lawyer in the case, Marc Kasowitz, signaled on Tuesday that he would fight any such moves.\n\n\"We disagree with this decision, which is wrong as a matter of constitutional law,\" Kasowitz said in a statement. \"We intend to immediately appeal and will seek a stay of the case until this issue is finally determined.\"\n\nZervos' attorney, Gloria Allred, had no immediate comment on the decision.\n\nAt a news conference a few weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Zervos claimed that Trump groped her breast and repeatedly kissed her as she was seeking work opportunities a couple of years after being \"fired\" from \"The Apprentice,\" his reality show. She said she chose to speak out only after Trump's recorded comments to \"Access Hollywood\" emerged and he denied a flurry of charges from more than a dozen women.\n\nIn addition to the denial, the Trump campaign also released a statement from one of Zervos' cousins saying that she had \"nothing but glowing things\" to say about Trump in the years after her brief stint on the 2005 season of the show.\n\nThree days before Trump's inauguration last year, she sued him for defamation, alleging that her reputation was damaged when he insisted that her allegations were false.\n\nMany of the legal arguments on the immunity issue revolve around the U.S. Supreme Court's 1997 ruling in the sexual harassment and defamation suit brought against President Bill Clinton by Paula Jones, an Arkansas state employee when Clinton was governor. The justices ruled unanimously in that case that Clinton had no immunity from a civil suit filed in federal court over actions he took before becoming president.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court decision left open the question of whether state courts could be trusted to accommodate a president's unique duties and responsibilities.\n\nIn addition, a series of liberal commentators have argued that Clinton v. Jones was wrongly decided, because it gave short shrift to the ways civil lawsuits could be used to attempt to entangle a sitting president in time-consuming and distracting litigation. Trump's lawyers highlighted that critique in their brief, but the two-decade-old ruling remains the law of the land.",

                "title": "What Congress is fighting over in the $1.3 trillion spending bill",
                "body": "Congressional negotiators Tuesday were finishing up their haggling over a massive spending bill that will deliver $1.3 trillion across the government through the end of September.\n\nThe so-called omnibus, which Republican and Democratic leaders hope to finalize by Tuesday night, would provide a $143 billion spending boost in fiscal 2018 to both the Pentagon and domestic programs -- the largest increase in recent years.\n\nA vote on the more than 1,000-page bill is tentatively planned for Thursday in the House. But some details have already trickled out from lawmakers and aides.\n\nWhat's likely out:\n\n-- Gateway tunnel: The massive project under the Hudson River was expected to receive roughly $900 million. President Donald Trump has refused to back off his veto threat if the Gateway funds were included.\n\n-- Obamacare stabilization: A bipartisan group of lawmakers fought for money for programs like cost-sharing subsidies and reinsurance to help avoid huge insurance premium hikes this fall.\n\n-- Border wall: Republicans wanted to devote at least $1.6 billion to begin construction on Trump's border wall, though Trump had sought $18 billion. Democrats demanded other conditions.\n\n-- Sexual harassment overhaul: Both parties had once hoped to include a broadly bipartisan plan to overhaul Congress' antiquated workplace rules.\n\n-- DREAMers: GOP leaders demanded that any deportation relief for young undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, is kept out of the spending bill.\n\n-- Internet sales tax: Rep. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) pushed for a national sales tax on online retailers, though it has run into fierce conservative opposition.\n\n-- Border security: Republicans sought $1.6 billion for border enforcement provisions, such as funding boosts for immigration enforcement agents and detention beds. But Democrats want to freeze hiring of those enforcement officials in exchange for giving Trump more than $1 billion in border wall funding.\n\n-- Fix NICS: The bipartisan bill would offer financial incentives for federal and state authorities to comply with the U.S. criminal background check system. Conservatives have demanded an expansion of \"concealed carry\" laws alongside that measure.\n\n-- Flood insurance: Lawmakers want another short-term extension for the National Flood Insurance Program, which expires March 23.\n\n-- 'Grain glitch': House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) is pushing to fix a loophole in the GOP tax law that allows farmers to get big tax cuts by selling directly to co-ops. Democrats are demanding a low-income housing tax credit in exchange.\n\n-- FAA extension: Congress needs to pass another short-term extension for the FAA reauthorization, which expires on March 31.\n\n-- Johnson Amendment: Some Republicans want to scrap a provision in the tax code barring churches and other nonprofits from endorsing or opposing political candidates. Trump has repeatedly vowed to repeal it.\n\n-- California's dam project: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is pushing language to allow the Shasta Dam project to move forward over Gov. Jerry Brown's objections.\n\n-- Ex-Im Bank: Some Republicans want to lower the required threshold of members for the Export-Import Bank to approve large loans. The seven-member board has consistently lacked a quorum.\n\n-- Pension fix: A bipartisan group of senators, led by Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) have pushed for a pensions fix to ensure about 200,000 retirees are paid.",

Olson, one of the country's most high-profile and seasoned litigators, to join forces amid mounting challenges in the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to two people familiar with the discussions. ...\n\n\"Olson, 77, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration and has long been considered a legal superstar, would bring deeper ties to Department of Justice and more experience on landmark cases than any of Trump's current lawyers. Olson is said to be reviewing the offer while weighing potential conflicts with his clients at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, where he is a partner, one person close to him said.\" http://wapo.st/2G60baa\n\nTRUMP on his call with Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN: \"I had a call with President Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory. The call had also to do with the fact that we will probably get together in the not-too-distant future so that we can discuss arms, we can discuss the arms race ... And also to discuss Ukraine and Syria and North Korea and various other things.

Areas to the south are most likely to receive one to three inches. Especially from the Beltway and to the south and east, the snow may be mixed with sleet when the precipitation starts.\" http://wapo.st/2GL55Hv\n\nGOV'T FUNDING UPDATE ... The plan, as it stands at this moment, is for Republicans to post the massive $1.2 trillion omnibus spending bill late tonight, according to multiple sources involved in the talks. THE EARLIEST the House might vote on this bill is Thursday. This leaves very, very, very little room for error. Funding runs out Friday night.\n\nTHE WASHINGTON POST'S SEUNG MIN KIM asked SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TEXAS) about the complications of the House waiting until Thursday to act, per @frankthorp: \"CORNYN: 'Well, we'll be here this weekend'... Q: 'So does the govt shut down over the weekend?' CORNYN: 'No shutdowns, you heard it here first.'\"\n\n-- IF THE SENATE votes this weekend, they'll be in session in the Capitol with thousands of people marching on the Mall in D.C.\n\nABOUT THE NEGOTIATIONS ...\n\nSTICKING POINTS ... It depends who you talk to, but Republicans and Democrats see several issues as still \"open\" in negotiations. One is funding for the Gateway project -- the tunnel between New York and New Jersey. Trump wants to kill it, but SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER (D-N.Y.) is fighting for its inclusion. This isn't a partisan issue -- at least historically. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) and the majority of tri-state lawmakers have backed this project. The question is will the leadership dare Trump to veto this bill by leaving it in the bill.\n\n-- REPUBLICANS and DEMOCRATS are haggling over potential wall funding/DACA fix/interior enforcement.\n\n-- CO-OP TAX FIX: The tax overhaul earlier this year advantaged grain co-ops over private sellers. This was meant to get fixed in this government funding package, but has hit resistance from members of House and Senate leadership. Democrats want a fix for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit in exchange for a fix to the grain issue.\n\n-- GUNS: PAUL RYAN said he's in active negotiations over including \"Fix NICS\" -- a background check bill -- in the massive package. As is MITCH MCCONNELL. Democrats have always wanted something more than that.\n\n-- OPEN ISSUES: More money for wildfire stricken states, and an FAA extension.\n\nEVERYTHING IS IN FLUX at the moment. So some of this could change in the next 12 hours. CHUCK SCHUMER was meeting with NANCY PELOSI early in the noon hour.\n\nSTEP BACK ... It's Tuesday. We won't see the massive $1.2 trillion spending bill until tonight. Vote is on Thursday. Republicans took the majority in 2010, promising to keep legislative issues separate and give lawmakers three days to read bills.\n\nONE SENATE NO -- ABC's Mariam Khan (@MKhan47): \"Sen.

The Senate GOP campaign arm, which heard out the appeals, recently commissioned a survey to gauge the coal king's electoral strength and determine his staying power in the race. ...\n\n\"The talks underscore the intense pressure Republicans are under in the era of Trump, as they struggle to control insurgent figures with large grass-roots conservative followings.

Some of my fellow veterans grew deeply cynical about all military endeavors -- which I understand. Others, such as Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and many senior officials in the Trump administration, including the current secretary of defense, retained a faith in military power but developed intense antipathy toward Iran given its support for militias that killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers -- which I also understand.\n\n\"As for me, I developed what will probably be a lifelong suspicion of any moral justifications for initiating a conflict. Both contemporaneously and in retrospect, the best case for invading Iraq in 2003 was the moral case, even though the primary case concerned weapons Saddam turned out not to have. But the war's supporters made the moral case effectively: How could the United States allow a mad tyrant like Saddam Hussein to remain in power? The man gassed his own people!

                "title": "Senate Russia probe makes bipartisan pitch on election security",
                "body": "Leaders of both parties on Tuesday made a high-profile push to keep hackers and online trolls from skewing American democracy, offering the first major set of bipartisan suggestions to bolster the digital defenses protecting the country's electoral systems.\n\nThe recommendations -- the first set of findings from the Senate Intelligence Committee's yearlong investigation into Russia's 2016 election meddling and whether the Kremlin colluded with the Trump campaign on its efforts -- include establishing a voluntary state election security grant program, but does not suggest a specific dollar figure, a key sticking point for Democrats, who want Congress to allocates millions of dollars to help cash-strapped states upgrade outdated voting technology.\n\nTuesday's document does not include any judgment on whether Trump's team coordinated with Moscow on its disinformation campaign. Panel leaders have said they are still looking into that subject and will issue those findings at a later date.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the committee wanted to reveal its election security findings, given that the 2018 primary season is already underway -- with Illinois voting on Tuesday -- and the November midterm elections are rapidly approaching.\n\nThe election security recommendations steer clear of specific mandates or substantial policy changes, instead largely emphasizing overarching approaches or priorities. Among them are that the United States should signal that foreign election interference is a \"hostile act, and we will respond accordingly.\"\n\nOther suggestions include improving federal information sharing with states and election officials, as well as moving toward voting machines that have a paper backup, something cybersecurity experts have been demanding for years. Voters in several competitive states cast ballots in 2016 on electronic machines that leave no paper trail, making it difficult -- or potentially impossible -- to catch digital fiddling with vote tallies.\n\nNotably, one recommendation suggests a collaboration to develop voluntary cybersecurity guidelines with the Election Assistance Commission, an agency which some Republicans have pushed to eliminate entirely.\n\nThe mostly-hands off approach could reflect resistance from a number of states of federal help, fearing that they stand to lose their traditional election administration turf. In fact, the very first recommendation from the Senate panel is that \"States should remain firmly in the lead on running elections, and the Federal government should ensure they receive the necessary resources and information.\"\n\nThe committee's approach stands in stark contrast to a parallel House Intelligence Committee probe, which Republicans recently shuttered, announcing that they had found no evidence of collusion and contradicting the U.S. intelligence community's firm conclusion that Russia deployed its online meddlers to help Trump's candidacy.\n\nThe unilateral move outraged Democrats, who said investigators had left numerous stones unturned, including election security. In their own report, Democrats argued that the panel \"has only scratched the surface\" on figuring out how to better digitally defend the electoral system.\n\nIn the Senate, intelligence panel lawmakers have been able to retain a bipartisan approach to their investigation, as shown by Tuesday's press conference announcing their recommendations. The gathering included numerous lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe full committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday to discuss their voting security offerings.",

                "body": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is blocking a Senate-led deal to fix a glitch in the GOP's tax law that is desperately sought by lawmakers from agricultural states, according to four sources in both parties familiar with the matter.\n\nAg state Republicans are seeking to address the so-called \"grain glitch,\" which lowers tax bills for farmers that sell grain to cooperatives at the expense of other companies. But Democrats are demanding a price: An expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.\n\nMost Senate Republicans would be OK with that deal, but Ryan is not. His opposition could keep the grain fix out of the must-pass omnibus spending package due by Friday evening to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nA person close to Ryan said the grain glitch is \"still an issue we're fighting for\" and cautioned that just because Ryan rejected Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's latest offer doesn't mean they're finished negotiating.\n\n\"It's not a dead issue,\" the person said. \"We are negotiating the best agreement we can get on this.\"\n\nRyan told the House Republican conference Tuesday morning that it was one of a series of outstanding items that had yet to be ironed out.\n\nThe issue is an unintended consequence of the GOP's tax reform law passed last year. Democrats have largely vowed to resist minor changes to the law, but have been more willing to entertain a technical fix in this case, in part, because several Senate Democrats up for reelection this fall hail from rural states where agriculture is a key industry.\n\nA House source blamed a pair of rural state Republican senators for creating the problem in the first place. Sens. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and John Thune (R-S.D.) demanded the 20 percent deduction to co-ops in the tax bill, the source said. But they \"wrote the language to provide a much more generous benefit than intended,\" the source added, and \"it creates a huge competitive disadvantage for non co-op companies.\"",

                "body": "The Federal Trade Commission is launching an inquiry into Facebook in the wake of reports that Trump-linked Cambridge Analytica misused data from 50 million Facebook accounts, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe agency plans to send the company a series of questions in a letter shortly, the source said. Under a 2011 consent decree with the FTC, Facebook agreed to get express permission and notify users before sharing their data with third parties. Facebook could face massive fines if the FTC determines it violated the terms of the agreement.\n\nCambridge Analytica, which did voter analysis work for the Trump campaign, obtained the Facebook account information from academic Aleksandr Kogan, who in 2014 developed an app that harvested Facebook data for research. Facebook has suspended both Cambridge Analytica and Kogan as it looks into the firm's receipt, use and retention of the data.\n\n\"We remain strongly committed to protecting people's information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have,\" Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said in a statement.\n\nAn FTC spokeperson said, \"We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating,\" adding: \"We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously as we did in 2012 in a privacy case involving Google.\"",
