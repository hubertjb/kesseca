Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Ahead of the March for our Lives rally, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student David Hogg said the media's biggest mistake while covering the school's shooting was \"not giving black students a voice.\"\n\n\"My school is about 25 percent black, but the way we're covered doesn't reflect that.\" Hogg said during an Axios event Friday.Hogg, one of the core members of the #NeverAgain Movement, hasn't shied away from acknowledging his privilege. In fact, \"privilege\" came up in many of the speeches at Saturday's march in Washington, D.C.While taking the stage again -- this time before hundreds of thousands -- Hogg and other students made sure to include victims of gun violence from across other communities.'We share this stage'Read More\"We recognize that Parkland received more attention because of its affluence,\" Jaclyn Corin, a survivor of the Parkland shooting, said during her speech. \"But we share this stage today and forever with those communities who have always stared down the barrel of a gun.\" Corin brought Yolanda Renee King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s granddaughter, to the stage as her special surprise guest. 'It's not about race'Alex Wind, another Parkland shooting survivor, addressed how gun violence affects everyone in the US.\"It's not about race. It is not about your sex. It is not about ethnicity. It is not about gender. It is not about how much money you make,\" he said during his speech. \"What it comes down to is life or death.\"Aalayah Eastmond, another Parkland shooting survivor, spoke about how gun violence isn't something new, and must not be overlooked in urban communities.\"Yes I am a Parkland survivor and an MSD student,\" she said. \"But before this i was a regular black girl and after this I am still black and I am still regular, and I will fight for all of us.\"'I represent African-American women'Non-Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School also used their speeches to echo this point.Naomi Wadler, an elementary student from Virginia, said she was speaking on behalf of all of the \"African-American girls whose stories don't make the front page of every national newspaper.\"\"I represent the African-American women who are victims of gun violence,\" she said. \"Who are simply statistics instead of vibrant beautiful girls full of potential.\"The 11-year-old continued: \"I'm here to acknowledge their stories. To say they matter. To say their names. Because I can. And I was asked to be. For far too long, these names, these black girls and women, have been just numbers. I'm here to say never again for those girls too.\"Many on Twitter noticed -- and praised -- the Parkland students for sharing their moment in the spotlight with people of color.\n\nParkland students using their privilege to make space and pass the mic to black and brown students who have been fighting this fight with no media attention and a country that didn't listen is why this movement isn't just a moment. #MarchForOurLives -- rebecca k.

As of noon on Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan had not tweeted about the march. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida, said in a statement that he \"commend[s] those who today are peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights to march\" and noted that he \"respect[s] their views.\" The senator added, however, that he does not agree \"with all of the solutions they propose\" and that \"making a change requires finding common ground with those who hold opposing views.\" Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican who represents Florida's 26th Congressional District, expressed support for students participating in the march on Saturday, saying in a statement posted to Twitter that \"the young men and women of Parkland are a true inspiration for all of us.\"\n\nToday millions of activists across the country & in #FL26 will be participating in the #MarchForOurLives. @RepCurbelo is proud of what these young people have accomplished & hopes their demonstrations today will inspire more officials to support meaningful action in Congress - TC pic.twitter.com/lZLSasU0KY -- Rep.

On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 billion spending bill that aims to incentivize state and federal authorities to report more data to the country's background check system.Rubio credited the survivors of the shooting with having \"done more in five weeks on gun violence than has been done in 15 years\" in a recent interview with The Guardian. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN on Saturday that she believes the student-driven activism could be \"a tipping point.\" \"There's just this energy in the air,\" the Minnesota senator said of the demonstrations over the weekend, \"As you look out at the sun shining over what is expected to be well over 500,000 kids, they can ask questions that adults can't ask, like, 'Why can't I go to my school and be safe?'\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is part of Senate Democratic leadership, released a video in support of the students Saturday. \"Let me congratulate people from coast to coast who today are marching for our lives,\" the senator said in his recorded message. \"Let me especially thank young people at the high school in Parkland, Florida, who are dealing with their grief by standing up and fighting back to make sure that tragedies like they experienced never happen again.\" The March for Our Lives is a student-led demonstration to protest gun violence and call for stricter gun laws. \"No special interest group, no political agenda is more critical than timely passage of legislation to effectively address the gun violence issues that are rampant in our country,\" the March for Our Lives website states.",

It cites an October 2017 New York Times op-ed article, which in turn cites the Center for Responsive Politics.The march organizers get $1.05 by dividing their dollar figure by 3,140,167 public and private students it says are in Florida.A Washington Post examination of Federal Election Commission data, however, indicates that as far as donations go, Rubio has received only $4,950 from the NRA in his career, and returned a further $9,900.Shortly afterward, Rubio released a statement that said, in part:\"I do not agree with all of the solutions they propose, I respect their views and recognize that many Americans support certain gun bans.

She said she and her peers stood outside for 18 minutes, a minute longer than many schools around the country had planned to walkout.

Naomi noted the privilege she said, in that she was being heard, while many black women are not. She was at the march for them. \"For far too long these names, these black girls and women have been just numbers,\" Naomi told the crowd. \"I'm here to say 'never again' for those girls, too.\" \"People have said that I am too young to have these thoughts on my own,\" she continued. \"People have said that I am a tool of some nameless adult. It's not true.\" \"My friends and I might still be 11 and we might still be in elementary school, but we know. We know life isn't equal for everyone and we know what is right and wrong.\" Naomi and her peers also know, that in 7 years, they will also be able to vote, she said.Naomi repeated the words of author Toni Morrison: \"If there's a book that you want to read but it hasn't been written yet, you must be the one to write it.\" \"I urge everyone here and everyone who hears my voice to join me in telling the stories that aren't told. To honor the girls, the women of color who are murdered at disproportionate rates in this nation. I urge each of you to help me write the narrative for this world and understand, so that these girls and women are never forgotten.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nRandi Kaye is a CNN anchor and correspondent. You can follow her on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN)It's hard to imagine a mansion serving as a house of horrors. But that's exactly what it looked like inside of Christina Fay's Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, home last June, when 75 Great Danes -- yes, 75 -- were found in horrible conditions.\n\nThe charging documents I obtained lay out the disturbing details: sores on the legs, lesions covering the body, ear infections and conjunctivitis in their eyes. Some dogs had even gone blind. Many were forced to either lay down in or walk through feces and dangerously high ammonia levels. There was little light or ventilation, the documents say, and food and water was scarce. In the end, two puppies and two adult dogs had to be euthanized, according to the the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). Luckily, most survived, despite illness and horrendous injuries. The HSUS said that Fay was an unlicensed commercial dog breeder. They told me that \"conservatively there are about 10,000 puppy mills in the US with about 2,100 being licensed by USDA. But some of those other 8,000 (or more!) sometimes have a state ag dept license.\" Despite warnings, many of these unlicensed breeders continue to operate illegally.Read MoreTougher lawsIsn't it time we strengthen the animal welfare laws? Often, breeders like Fay are issued citations but continue to operate. The HSUS said Fay was warned in Maine but was able to simply pick up stakes and move her unlicensed operation to New Hampshire. No questions asked.Legislation must be passed to hold breeders accountable. And where is the United States Department of Agriculture in all of this? It doesn't even inspect dog breeders who sell to consumers in person, according to the LA Times. Luckily, a bipartisan bill has been introduced by New Hampshire state Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley, a Republican from Wolfeboro, that would strengthen penalties in cases of animal cruelty. As New Hampshire's Governor Chris Sununu has said, the bill would make sure that the \"horrendous treatment of the Great Danes from Wolfeboro never happens again.\" A New Hampshire jury convicted Fay in March on 17 misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty. In court, Fay's defense team insisted she provided the dogs with outstanding care, but the jury didn't buy it. A veterinarian testified in court that the conditions inside Fay's home were the worst she had ever seen in all her investigations of animal cruelty cases, according to the HSUS. One of the saddest things about this, as any dog or pet owner knows, is that dogs can't speak up for themselves. They were trapped in this House of Horrors, inside their kennels, with no way to ask for help. The woman raising them certainly wasn't looking out for them. We need more voices for the voiceless so heartbreaking situations like this don't continue to happen.Lindsay Hamrick, New Hampshire's Director for the Humane Society of the United States, described it like this: \"It was a horrendous environment. When I walked in, there was an overwhelming stench of feces and urine. We were sliding on the floor. The ammonia level was so high people were gagging and their eyes were watering.\"In addition to that, \"the dogs were covered in their own waste. They were walking in their own waste.\"Responsible breedersOf course there are legitimate breeders who are dedicated to finding loving homes for dogs out there. If you do choose to work with a breeder, just be sure to do your homework. I've always been a big proponent of adopting and rescuing dogs, which is why I went through a rescue group to adopt my golden retriever.In Fay's case, she seemed to only be looking to make a buck. Hamrick of HSUS is quick to point out, \"in cases that involve breeders, there is a financial component, and the demand for the puppies is driving that.\" How could anyone think this was okay? Fay had been operating under the radar of law enforcement in New Hampshire for two years, according to the HSUS. The Humane Society of the United States learned of the conditions at the woman's home from the Wolfeboro police department, which needed HSUS' help in caring for the dogs after they were removed from the home. \"I think the most frustrating part of this is that they were housed inside kennels. They don't get to choose to go out and get water or get their own food. They had to live with this feeling until law enforcement showed up. They were stuck,\" said Hamrick.In addition to the 75 dogs seized from the home in New Hampshire, another nine puppies that belonged to Fay were also seized from a local vet. So in all, this woman was responsible for 84 dogs. Of those, the HSUS said that 80 dogs are still under its care. After seizing the dogs, HSUS set up a makeshift shelter in New Hampshire to care for them and nurse them back to health. They hired staff and brought in volunteers. In all, HSUS said it has spent $1.3 million dollars rescuing these dogs. There's a chance that Fay will be asked to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution toward the care of these dogs, but in most cases the Humane Society never sees that money simply because these irresponsible breeders don't have the cash. Fay will be sentenced in the next month or so and could get a year in jail for each count, so she could see up to 17 years in jail. The good news is that HSUS is working with the New Hampshire state legislature to get comprehensive reform. The bill that was introduced by state Sen. Bradley puts the financial burden of caring for rescued animals on those responsible for the cruelty, rather than nonprofits and taxpayers. It passed the Senate and is now making its way to the House. Barring any appeals, the Great Danes who were rescued will likely be up for adoption in the next few months. I only hope they find loving forever homes.Meanwhile, it's important to note that this isn't the first case of an unlicensed breeder in the state of New Hampshire. HSUS said in the last year and a half there have been four cases similar to this. According to Hamrick, the state of New Hampshire \"is not adequately regulating folks who are breeding.\"\"They need more state oversight,\" Hamrick said. Amen to that.",

She got that.\"During the 2016 election, Clinton faced heavy scrutiny for using a private email server for government work while running the State Department.

Batten Professor of Public Policy at Davidson College. He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow and is the author of the forthcoming book \"My Brother Moochie: Regaining Dignity in the Midst of Crime, Poverty, and Racism in the American South\" (Other Press). Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are his own.\n\n(CNN)Police officers should not shoot people unless there is no other way to protect themselves or others from lethally dangerous situations. They should not needlessly escalate tensions during confrontations. They should treat the most vulnerable as caringly as they do those who have power. And when they misuse deadly force, and innocent civilians get hurt, they should admit wrongdoing, make amends and take real steps to prevent mistakes from reoccurring.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is all that black Americans have been asking for decades. Just this. It's why protesters gathered before a Sacramento Kings game after yet another unarmed young black man, Stephon Clark, was shot to death by police Sunday -- in his grandmother's backyard in Sacramento -- because they thought his cell phone was a gun. It's why some have been frustrated by how law enforcement officials have spoken about the serial bombings in Austin, when black residents were the first to be injured and killed.Their refusal to call Mark Anthony Conditt a terrorist is a shame. How can multiple bombs being planted and detonated not be considered a clear case of domestic terrorism? It's why the NFL and WNBA players kneel during the national anthem -- to highlight racial injustice -- and feel betrayed by those who deem their peaceful act un-American. They've been asking for equal treatment. That's all.And yet, some rejected the protests. All they hear is a steady stream of demands for everyone to better understand the stress that police officers feel during and after violent encounters, as though the feelings and perspectives of the people forced to stare down the barrel of a cop's gun don't matter. All they have gotten are juries who routinely say a cop made a \"reasonable\" decision to kill an unarmed man, and police officers who declare it uncouth to second-guess their fellow officers' decisions, and everyday Americans who demonize those who say such rationale is wrong, immoral and self-perpetuating.Read MoreIt is black and brown people who are more likely to have their days interrupted, and lives turned upside down, by encounters with police over things like jaywalking and driving. They must withstand those daily indignities or find themselves trapped in a veritable debtor's prison, as the Justice Department found in Ferguson, Missouri. And even though they know police officers sometimes plant guns or drugs or lie on the witness stand, they are the ones told to shut up and just trust a justice system that keeps delivering injustice upon injustice.Black people don't live in the world where white people live, where Officer Friendly always treats them with respect or gives their kids a pass or a second chance when they do the dumb things kids do. Or where violent acts are described as the work of an \"intense loner who grew up in a tight-knit, deeply religious family,\" as The New York Times described Conditt. Black people don't have the benefit of being described -- as were the recorded troubles of Conditt by Chief Brian Manley of the Austin Police Department -- as \"the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.\" Black people live in a world in which policies implemented to protect schools against mass shootings are often used against black students, even though black students are not in the cohort who usually commit such acts. Zero-tolerance polices have contributed to massive racial disparities in how students are disciplined. Mostly-black schools, with metal detectors and fences and other such things, have come to resemble prisons. That's why putting guns in the hands of teachers, as proposed by President Trump and planned in Florida, is a scarier prospect for black parents than even white parents who oppose such a move. Black people live in a world in which even the kids who grow up in the homes of millionaire black parents are subject to life outcomes and bouts with the criminal justice system at a rate like that felt by poor whites. Black people don't have the luxury of just trusting the police and other authorities, knowing that kind of trust has too frequently led to death and heartbreak. That's why they are angry, why they kneel, why they protest, why they scream. It's not because they are making excuses, but because they are facing a reality that others keep insisting doesn't exist.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger told CNN's Michael Smerconish that he believes Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich could be \"a great alternative\" to President Donald Trump if the President fails to deliver on his promises.\n\n\"People are going to judge the President before they go to the polls by his performance,\" Schwarzenegger, who is a Republican, said in an interview. \"If Trump does a great job, then there's no reason to replace him. But what I'm saying is that John Kasich is a great alternative should he (Trump) not perform, because we don't know yet. We are only one year into his term.\" The former California governor also lamented extreme partisanship in American politics and predicted \"independents are going to take over\" the Republicans and the Democrats because people \"are upset about the fact that the Democrats are too far to the left now and getting stuck in their ideology and Republicans are too far to the right.\" Schwarzenegger expressed concern that the Republican Party is not doing enough to appeal to voters, saying the party \"is dying, like the Titanic.\" But, he added, \"we don't have to go under completely. We don't have to wait for that moment. Let's change.\" Schwarzenegger said that the GOP should \"be more open\" and go back to the idea of acting as a \"big tent.\" Read MoreSchwarzenegger has previously talked up Kasich, who unsuccessfully vied for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. At a recent event in California, Schwarzenegger said that the Ohio governor's \"vision and inclusiveness is just what our nation needs.\" In his interview with CNN, Schwarzenegger said he told Kasich \"he should run in 2020,\" adding \"I think he should run against President Trump, and I think that he should go and show the American people an alternative.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)In the aftermath of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, the public's support for stricter gun laws shot up to levels not seen in 25 years.\n\nStudent survivors of the shooting have publicly called on Congress to pass such legislation and are now marching on Washington. In the face of this public outcry and with many voters telling pollsters it's going to be an important or major factor for them in the upcoming midterm elections, the Republican-led Congress and the Republican President have done very little to enact stricter gun control.So what's the disconnect? There's no obvious sign the public is actually punishing President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans for their inaction. Even as the majority of Americans disapprove of the job the President has done handling gun policy, his approval rating has not fallen in the wake of Parkland shooting. The shooting occurred on February 14. Looking at the average of all polls and adjusting for whether the pollster normally has results that are more or less favorable to the President, Trump's approval rating in the month before the murders at Parkland (i.e. January) was 40%. In the first full calendar month after Parkland (i.e. March), his approval rating is actually a point higher at 41%. That 41% is also a point above the average for his entire presidency of 40%. Read MoreThe President's approval rating over February and March of 2018 are the highest they've been in a very long time. In no month in the second half of 2017 did his approval rating ever top 40% for a month. He's now done it for two consecutive months (including February, during which the massacre at Parkland occurred). Contrast that to other monumental moments in this administration: Trump saw his ratings dip by three or four points on average after he fired FBI Director James Comey and during the debate over the unpopular Republican health care bill. Congressional Republicans too have seen no decline in their ratings. Although they still trail on the generic congressional ballot, an average of all surveys in March puts the Republican deficit at 8 percentage points. That's the same as it was in February and in January. All of which are equal to the long-term average since the beginning of the Trump presidency. All of which are also better than where Republicans were in December when they trailed by 11 percentage points on the generic congressional ballot. Just five years ago, when Congress didn't enact stricter gun laws following the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, congressional Republicans similarly didn't see their polling numbers take a hit and they went on to gain seats in the following year. Or go back 24 years ago, when Republicans might have actually been rewarded for mostly voting against the federal assault weapons ban that President Bill Clinton signed into law. In fact, Trump and Republicans might be at bigger risk of losing support if they were to support stricter gun legislation. A majority of those who support Trump oppose stricter gun legislation, and the GOP base could abandon him and Republicans who stray from that position. Democrats will certainly try in some races to use the lack of major gun legislation to attack Republicans in the fall campaigns. But it's possible that the salience of the gun message won't be as high in November as it was in the immediate aftermath of Parkland. We've already seen searches for gun control begin to tail off on Google. And for now, gun control is an issue that many people say is going to affect their vote, but that doesn't actually appear to be the case.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nRichard Barton is a doctoral student in government at Cornell University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN)March for Our Lives and other demonstrations that have students at the forefront protesting gun violence are showing the nation a new, formidable political force. These young people are eloquently and passionately demanding meaningful gun reforms, and developing the organizational capacity and resources required to effect real change.\n\nThe best way for them to use their growing political power is to advocate for the recruitment, training, funding and campaigning of Republican primary challengers who want to run on a pro-gun control platform.A recent CNN poll shows that Republican voters are starting to pull away from the GOP's traditional stance on guns. This indicates that many Republicans are willing to support new candidates. Moreover, some of these Republicans have the talent and ambition to run for elected office. They just need encouragement and support. Although many may believe that voting against all Republicans will get the nation closer to enacting gun control measures, Republicans -- not all or even most but a sizable minority -- are actually needed to do so.The Republican Party controls each branch of government. Even if Democrats win back control of the House and Senate in the November midterms -- and that is a big if -- they will still have to work with a Republican President and get at least 60 votes in the Senate. If Democrats do win back Congress and enact meaningful gun regulations, these reforms will be fleeting if the GOP simply repeals them once they regain power. And regardless of federal policy, state laws will continue to play a major role, and Republicans have unprecedented control of state governments.Read MoreSwift, meaningful and durable reform is only possible if gun control advocates can alter the electoral calculation for Republican politicians.To understand how students can help do this, we need to put our finger on the exact political problem. Why is the GOP so steadfast in its opposition to reasonable gun regulations? The National Rifle Association notoriously provides campaign contributions to the Republican Party, but donations are not the real source of the gun lobby's influence. The NRA largely controls the GOP on gun policy by mobilizing its members in Republican primary elections. The NRA closely monitors and grades legislators, and shares this information with members. If a Republican lawmaker supports gun control reforms -- or even wavers in opposition -- the NRA can send out an email that mobilizes mass opposition in the next primary. Imagine yourself as a typical Republican legislator under these political conditions. You invested a great deal of your own money and time to run for office and you really want to win re-election. You sincerely want to protect the Second Amendment, but in private you also recognize the need for some of the gun reforms staunchly opposed by the NRA. When it comes down to it, you know that voting for stricter gun laws will prompt a fiercely competitive primary election that can quickly snuff out your political ambitions. And you can be equally confident that no primary challenger will attack you for being too conservative on gun policy. Gun reform advocates need to change this electoral calculation. And they can by threatening incumbents though the nomination process. This has happened before in the Democratic Party.By the 1960s, a powerful alliance of unions and civil rights organizations reshaped the Democratic Party, from the bottom up, and made racial liberalism a core party commitment. However, during the 1970s, activists opposed to school integration policies weakened this commitment by supporting primary challengers. Anti-busing activists empowered House candidates to run competitive challenges against Democratic incumbents in states as diverse as Massachusetts, Michigan, Kentucky and Texas. These activists were diligent and persistent. For example, Rep. Louise Day Hicks, a Massachusetts Democrat, entered office on the anti-busing wave in 1970, but was challenged two years later by another-movement backed candidate, who criticized the congresswoman for being insufficiently committed to the anti-busing cause.Most of these movement candidates did not beat their incumbent opponent, but the threat was real, and the message was clear. The anti-busing movement neutralized powerful pro-integration forces in the party, and altered the electoral calculation for Democrats in Congress. Some congressional Democrats remained deeply committed to civil rights, but many others, including a young Joe Biden, abandoned earlier positions and supported a series of bills that tied the federal government's hand in enforcing integration policies.A similar effort can move the Republican Party to the center on gun policy. The gun control movement -- catalyzed by the students from Parkland, Florida -- should channel their energy and resources to play this supportive role for Republican office-seekers. This can include founding an organization that recruits and trains candidates, similar to Emily's List, which recruits and trains women, and forming a political action committee to spend money on their behalf. By recruiting, training and supporting sympathetic Republicans, gun reform advocates can neutralize the power of the NRA. Since legislators pay close attention to potential threats long before a primary election, mobilization influences legislative behavior almost immediately. Even if the pro-gun control Republicans can't win many primaries, their presence in the races is enough to make a difference. By recruiting and training candidates to run for the 2020 elections, and demonstrating the ability to fund and mobilize support for them, Republican legislators will defect well before their next primary. Gun control activists across the ideological spectrum should provide financial and organizational support to pro-gun control conservatives if they hope to achieve real change. This approach can pull the Republican Party back toward the center on gun policy and produce meaningful and durable reforms that may save many thousands of lives. Right now, students have the power to make this happen.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Ben Enwonwu etched himself into Nigerian history.\n\nHis painting of a Yoruba princess in \"Tutu\" is considered a national masterpiece, with copies of it hanging in Nigerian homes across the country. To much speculation, the sought-after original was lost for over 40 years. The renowned Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, told BBC's Radio 4 in 2013: \"This particular painting \"Tutu,\" the print, hung on every wall, of every middle class family in eastern Nigeria when I was growing up.\" So when the famous portrait was recently unearthed in a \"modest\" London flat and sold at auction for $1.6 million (February 28) -- four times its estimated price, it sparked huge interest in the art world and amongst buyers in Nigeria -- many had set up shop in a hotel in Lagos to make live bids. A story of a lost artwork and the exorbitant price these sort of pieces sell for is always likely to capture interest and imaginations. Read MoreBecause of the history of stolen and looted art from Africa, its reappearance also raises eyebrows for some in the art community. Nigerian visual artist, Victor Ehikhamenor, said to CNN: \"How did this work get to where it is?\" Bonham's auction house told CNN the previous owners father bought it, and before then it was last seen in 1975 at the Italian Cultural Institute in Nigeria.However, the story of the man himself goes beyond this story and the record breaking price (for a Nigerian modern artist) his artwork sold for. Enwonwu navigated the world's between British and Nigerian royalty. At the same time, his works, according to West African art expert Sylvester Ogbechie, became used in popular black liberation movements. Enwonwu is most revered for his paintings, but always referred to himself as a sculpture. Basically, his life was complex. But as Ogbechie said to CNN: \"He refused to be typecast as an African woodcarver.\" In essence, Enwonwu redefined what it meant to be an African artist. Who was Enwonwu?As well as paint and sculpt, Enwonwu wrote significantly about the challenges facing African artists. In a essay written in 1956, he penned his thoughts: \"(The African artist) faces the humiliation of having to listen to lectures on African art in foreign art galleries and museums.\"He visits foreign museums in order to see a collection of the art of his own country, and very often he is shown round the museum by European curators (page 178).\" In the spirit of the French Negritude movement (1930-50s), an attempt by African and Caribbean artists to promote the work of black people and history, Enwonwu believed in an international contemporary African art. He acknowledged that there were barriers preventing African artists playing an a central role in their practice, being often pigeon-holed and expected to produce traditional ethnographic, not modern and global, African art. Enwonwu's art historyWhile Enwonwu railed against the art culture at the time, his training was in established elite institutions. He was classically taught at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and attended Oxford University. Enwonwu quickly rose to international notoriety. \"He was pretty much one of the first African artists to achieve global fame,\" Ogbechie, who has written a book on Enwonwu's life, told CNN. He was celebrated for his figurative sculptures and paintings. Enwonwu painted with watercolors and carved abstract-inspired wood figures. \"You have to understand how important his fame was in the 1950s. Enwonwu was so famous that his successes were inserted into black struggles across the globe. African Americans were very much enamoured by the artist,\" Ogbechie said. Enwonwu's was also part of the modernist art movement of the mid-century. \"He's a modern artist who got training as a modern artist and moved in modernist art circles. He was very much interested in producing an artwork that framed the condition of modernity,\" Ogbechie said. But his style was varied and mixed. \"His early work is quite illustrative. Then later on it became a bit more broad and impressionistic. Some of his works from the 60s almost have a slightly cubist feel,\" Giles Peppiett, an expert in African art at Bonhams auction house in London, told CNN. His sitters included British royalty of the highest order. \"One of his most famous portraits was a bronze he did of her Majesty the Queen,\" Peppiett said. Influence in NigeriaEnwonwu made an impact in London, but his most influential works would be seen in his home country Nigeria.In the 1970s, Enwonwu was an Igbo artist living in a country reeling from a civil war that witnessed an estimated one to three million deaths. The Biafra movement, mainly made-up of Igbo people in southeastern Nigeria, fought to secede from Nigeria between 1967-70. The pro-Biafrans lost the war.It was significant for Nigerian society that Enwonwu, an Igbo, painted a Yoruba Ile-Ife princess, part of one of Nigeria's other major groups, in the aftermath of the war.\"It came from a time when Nigeria was fresh from the dramatic effects of the civil war and we were trying to reunite the country -- so it was very important,\" Enwonwu's son Oliver told CNN. The Nigerian state proceeded to initiate a reconciliation program to try to heal divisions. \"One of the things they wanted to start doing is to show Igbo people they are being reconstituted into the national body\" Ogbechie said. \"The Tutu paintings were absolutely vital to the process of national reconciliation in Nigeria.\"In the early 1970s, Enwonwu subsequently became a professor of art at the University of Ife, an academic center for the Yoruba people. It turns out that Enwonwu's legacy has lasted the test of time just as the tensions in southeastern Nigeria have. Some, like Biafran separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu, continue to call for a new state. The artistic work, though, did contribute to the growth of Nigerian art that continues to the present day. \"He gave respectability to art,\" Oliver Enwonwu said. A new generation of African artists His work influenced current contemporary artists in Nigeria, not least his son who heads up the Omenka Gallery in Lagos. \"I grew up smelling the oil paints and watching him chip away at blocks of wood. It was something which had been ingrained in my very fabric,\" Oliver said. Enwonwu certainly left his mark on history. \"He legitimized the idea of the artist as a viable practice among the Nigerian population,\" Ogbechie said. Contemporary Nigerian Artist Ehikhamenor thought the recent auction was positive for the visibility of African art, but showed the inequity that still exists: \"When you look at when he was practicing there are other artists which are not African, that are not Nigerian, that are not black whose works have sold twice, three, four times what we are talking about now.\"Enwonwu's work reached Nigerian society and future generations of artists, but, according to Ogbechie who knew him personally, he was a recluse.\"I managed to persuade him to attend some openings and he was very shocked by how deferential everybody was to him. He said he thought everybody hated him,\" Ogbechie told CNN. So who was Enwonwu? Perhaps, a quietly doubting, groundbreaking African artist.",

                "body": "(CNN)Survivors of the deadly shooting rampage at a Parkland, Florida, high school are set to lead thousands Saturday in a March for Our Lives on Washington, delivering their impassioned pleas for stricter gun control law to the nation.\n\nBuilding on the momentum of last week's National School Walkout, these members of a generation raised on gun violence have been rallying Americans around their cause while honoring the 17 students and faculty members killed on February 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The march starts at noon, with participants gathering on Pennsylvania Avenue near the US Capitol. Hundreds of sister marches also are planned across the country and around the world.One will be in Jonesboro, Arkansas, where 20 years ago Saturday two boys, 11 and 13, ambushed fellow students and teachers in a yard after setting off a fire alarm at Westside Middle School, killing five people.Read MoreFebruary's mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas, then the eighth school shooting of the year, moved the young survivors-turned-activists to push lawmakers to address gun violence in American schools with comprehensive gun control legislation, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \"They don't know what it's like to be 20 feet from an AR-15,\" Parkland survivor Alfonso Calderon, 16, told students at a Washington charter school this week, referring to US lawmakers. Calderon and other Marjory Stoneman Douglas survivors attended a #NeverAgain -- as their movement is known -- rally this week at Washington's Thurgood Marshall Academy, where two students were killed in separate neighborhood shootings during the last year. \"Every single day you wake up and it might be a thought in your head, 'I might die today,' \" Calderon told the students. \"I only had to go through it once. You guys go through it every single day. This isn't a discussion anymore. This is action because that's what we need.\"Some Parkland students also met congressional leaders this week at the US Capitol.\"No student should ever have to cover themselves with a deceased classmate to survive, but I was that student,\" shooting survivor Aalayah Eastmond said. \"And we can't only focus on school shootings though. Urban communities and low-income communities have always been hit with gun violence. I lost my uncle due to gun violence in Brooklyn 15 years ago, and nothing has changed. Columbine happened. Nothing changed. Sandy Hook happened. Nothing changed. Parkland happened. Nothing changed.\" The movement, started in the aftermath of the massacre with media appearances by student survivors such as Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez, has drawn celebrity support. Jennifer Hudson, Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Common and Lin-Manuel Miranda are expected to attend the march in Washington, according to the event's website. And celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney and Steven Spielberg each donated $500,000 last month to the march's fund.More than 800 other events are planned across the United States and in cities overseas Saturday, including London, Madrid, Paris, Tokyo and Seoul, according to the march website. On April 20, activists are calling for another national school walkout on the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting.\"In all honesty, they do not care if we do not get out and vote,\" Parkland student David Hogg said at Thurgood Marshall Academy, referring to politicians. \"If we do not stand up and make our voices heard as Americans, they will not take action.\"\n\nCNN's Dakin Andone contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A Pennsylvania school district has a different solution for tackling intruders: rocks.\n\nBuckets full of river stones have been placed in all classrooms at the Blue Mountain School District in Schuylkill County, Superintendent David Helsel said. If students at the rural school district can't evacuate during a shooting, they don't have to sit and wait. \"Protocol has been that students lie down, under desks and basically become passive targets on our classrooms,\" Helsel said. \"We decided to empower our students with tools of self-defense if needed.\"In a video posted online, the superintendent said the district decided to bring rocks to the classrooms after staff members took the active shooter response training, ALICE -- alert, lockdown, inform, counter and evacuate. Read MoreThe training taught them how to barricade doors with desks and chairs, and run away from gunfire. It also encouraged students to throw everything, from pencils to staplers, at potential shooters \"rather than wait passively\" for them \"to attack.\"\"At one time I just had the idea of river stone. They're the right size for hands, you can throw them very hard and they will create or cause pain, which can distract,\" Helsel told CNN affiliate WNEP.But they only see it as a last resort.\"We've learned many things from these tragedies over the years,\" Helsel said. \"One of them is that evacuating makes students the safest.\"And if students can't leave the building, they'll have their stones.\"We understand that a gun is much more deadly than a stone. It's our hope that we can somehow stop the ability of an armed intruder to enter our classrooms,\" he added.Parents appear to like the district's plan.\"At this point, we have to get creative, we have to protect our kids first and foremost, throwing rocks, it's an option,\" parent Dori Bornstein told the affiliate.",

                "title": "World wary as Trump turns to Bolton, Pompeo",
                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington and New York (CNN)President Donald Trump's decision to bring on John Bolton as national security adviser jolted the usually careful diplomatic world enough that a few unusually frank adjectives slipped out.\n\n\"Worrisome,\" said one South Korean official. Japan's foreign minister admitted he was \"a bit surprised.\" The famously hawkish Bolton will become part of a new trio advising and guiding Trump as he navigates unprecedented talks with North Korea, his possible departure from the Iran nuclear deal, and increased tension with Moscow and Beijing. Bolton, a former State Department official and ambassador to the UN, could be joined, pending confirmation, by Gina Haspel, a career CIA officer who has been nominated to lead the agency, and the current CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who has been tapped to lead the State Department Haspel remains something of a cipher to the public, but Pompeo's tenure as a lawmaker established him as a hardliner who advocated for bombing Iran even as negotiations on the international nuclear deal were ongoing. Read MoreThat history, along with Bolton's advocacy for military interventions in North Korea and Iran, his dismissal of diplomacy and disdain for international law, has led some to warn that Trump will now be surrounded by the most hardline team to shape US foreign policy in years. The world reacted with caution and some dismay. In one quarter, there was warm praise. But at the UN, the place where Bolton is perhaps best known because of his tenure as ambassador from 2005 to 2006, officials chose their words with extremely diplomatic care, with some issuing veiled warnings about the need to defend the institution and its cooperative, collaborative ideals. Richard Gowan, a UN analyst at Columbia University, had an explanation. \"The UN is in considerable trouble,\" Gowan said. \"Bolton does not merely dislike the UN. He knows the organization rather too well for comfort.\"\"A club for people to get together\"With Trump already pre-disposed to dislike the UN -- he referred to it as \"just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time\" -- Gowan said Bolton could deepen cuts the Trump administration has already made to its regular budget and peacekeeping operations and perhaps go even further.\"He will likely press [US Ambassador to the UN Nikki] Haley and Pompeo to find ways to weaken the UN quite drastically and decisively,\" Gowan said, \"rather than merely trimming its budgets.\"A UN Security Council diplomat hedged on Pompeo's impact at the State Department, but added, \"an appointment of John Bolton ... that would change the question.\"UN diplomats were more careful on the record. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric, who defended the institution against some of Bolton's broadsides in 2006, said Friday that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres \"had developed a very constructive and positive relationship\" with outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster. \"and he looks forward to continuing that relationship with Ambassador Bolton.\" Reporters asked Dujarric to respond to some of Bolton's more pointed criticisms of the UN. The lawyer and Fox News commentator has said there's \"no such thing\" as the United Nations, that if the headquarters lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a difference, and that it would be a mistake to grant validity to international law. \"Look, we will leave analysis of past statements to journalists and historians,\" Dujarric said. \"We're not going to speculate about the future, we're dealing with the present. And as I said, the secretary general looks forward to continuing the kind of relationship he had with the national security adviser with the new one.\"When asked about Bolton's appointment, Sigrid Kaag, the Netherlands' minister of foreign trade, told reporters that, \"we remained firmly anchored in multilateralism as a way to solve most burning and pertinent issues today, in the past, and in the future.\"UK Deputy Ambassador to the UN Jonathan Allen was asked if Bolton's appointment was going to test multilateralism, given his hostile views. \"The US and the UK have long been close allies and friends,\" Allen said without mentioning Bolton's name. \"That will continue and endure.\" Among Asian allies, dealing with an increasingly assertive China, the prospect of a trade war as Trump levies tariffs against Beijing, and an unpredictable North Korea, there was some concern. \"This is worrisome news,\" Kim Hack-yong, a conservative South Korean lawmaker who heads his parliament's national defense committee, told Reuters. Bolton's views on Pyongyang were most recently on display in a February 28 commentary that laid out what he called a \"perfectly legitimate\" case for a pre-emptive strike against North Korea. It used an example from 1837 as the basis for his justification and made no mention of the thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Koreans who would die in the event of a US military attack and North Korean reprisal. \"A bit surprised\"Kim was among many observers who worried about the repercussions if planned May talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un don't go well. \"If Bolton takes office and talks with North Korea go haywire and yield bad results, I don't know what we'll do then,\" Kim told Reuters. \"Any turns in a negative direction could mean all our work over the years to engage North Korea could turn to dust.\" Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said he was \"a bit surprised\" that former national security adviser H.R. McMaster was out, given that he'd just met him the week before in Washington. That said, Kono told the Japan Times that he didn't expect big changes given the \"complete agreement\" between Washington and Tokyo. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, offered the Japan Times a very careful and caveated assessment. \"We have been closely exchanging views with the US government, both between leaders and at the working level, so we don't think there will be any particular negative influence.\"There was no reaction from North Korea, which in 2003 felt free to blast Bolton as \"human scum\" and a \"bloodsucker.\" In 2006, Bolton was working with the Security Council on North Korea resolutions after illegal missile and nuclear tests. At one meeting the North Korea representative walked out on the Council, which Bolton compared to former Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev pounding his shoe on a desk in the General Assembly when upset. Middle Eastern reaction was clearly divided. Across the region, countries are waiting to see whether Trump will walk away from the nuclear deal with Iran on May 12, the day he has to continue to waive sanctions on Tehran or pull the IS out of the agreement. Trump has set that day as a deadline for US and European negotiators to find a way to change the deal. In Iran, the spokesman of the powerful Guardian Council pointed to Bolton's ties with a group that opposes the government in Tehran, and said it showed Washington's continued support for terrorist groups operating against Iran. \"Now the question is why Bolton has been assumed to a sensitive position,\" he wrote in a piece for the semi-official Fars News service. The Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar, aligned with the Shi'ite militant group and political movement Hezbollah, used the headline \"Zionist Hawk in the White House,\" to alert readers to Bolton's new job, Reuters reported. But in Israel, Bolton's ascension was greeted as happy news. Naftali Bennett, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, hailed Bolton as \"an extraordinary security expert, experienced diplomat and a stalwart friend of Israel.\"\n\nCNN's Olivia Kiely, Hande Atay Alam, Jennifer Hauser, Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.",

It's definitely sitting, and hoping and waiting,\" he said in an interview Thursday with CNN. He has good reason to worry.Last July, President Donald Trump sent a series of tweets announcing that \"After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.\" In August, the President followed up with a memo that essentially reversed Obama-era policies.But the memo was immediately challenged in the courts and so far has been blocked from going into effect -- for now. The courts have also declined to put on hold a January 1 deadline that would allow transgender recruits to enlist. Read MorePentagon issues guidance on admitting transgender service membersAs things stand, after January 1, Talbott can start the process of applying to enlist in the military.But he knows the legal road ahead could be bumpy. So far, the courts have ruled only on a preliminary basis.\"This whole process with the courts has been a roller coaster,\" Talbott said. \"We are doing well, but we are not out of the woods yet. I'm trying to stay wary, and I'm definitely nervous that we might hit another setback.\"Talbott's lawyer, Shannon Minter, the legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said, \"The clock is ticking, and every second we get closer to January 1, individuals like Nicolas whose lifelong dream is to serve our country are getting closer to realizing that dream.\"Lawyers for the government have argued that any appeals to Trump's August memorandum are premature, in part because the Department of Defense is still reviewing the President's order and has issued interim guidance that \"reaffirms that for now, no current service member will be involuntarily separated, discharged or denied re-enlistment solely on the basis of a gender dysphoria diagnosis or transgender status.\" A 2016 study by the Rand Corp. estimated the number of transgender individuals in the active component of the US military at 1,320 to 6,630, out of about 1.3 million service members. As for allowing new recruits, the government lawyers argued that the courts' decision to allow the January 1 deadline to stand \"dramatically alters a decades-long status quo, interferes with an ongoing study led by military experts and threatens military readiness.\"But so far, courts have ruled in favor of the challengers. A three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit noted in December that transgender people are \"already serving openly in the military.\"The court said the government had not shown \"that any training or medical demands associated with the accession of transgender troops -- all of whom must be medically stable for 18 months before entry (absent a waiver) -- are different in kind of degree from the demands associated with the retention of existing troops.\"\"In balancing the equities,\" the court ruled, \"it must be remembered that all plaintiffs seek during this litigation is to serve their nation with honor and dignity, volunteering to face extreme hardships, to endure lengthy deployments and separation from family and friends, and to willingly make the ultimate sacrifice of their lives if necessary to protect the nation, the people of the United States, and the Constitution against all who would attack them.\"A panel of judges on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to delay the January 1 deadline for now. Another challenge is pending in the 9th Circuit Court.Late Friday night, a DOJ spokesman said that the government would not appeal the New Year's Day deadline, but would wait instead for the Department of Defense to complete a review. \"The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks,\" a DOJ spokesperson said in a statement. \"So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD's study and will continue to defend the President's and Secretary of Defense's lawful authority in district court in the meantime.\"Talbott's hopes are high.He said that on Tuesday he plans to call the military recruiter he has been in touch with to schedule an appointment with the Military Entrance Processing Station. There he will have physical evaluations and take tests, the first steps in what he hopes will be his military career.He said he is wary that down the road his side might lose in courts, but for now he just wants the January 1 deadline to come and go without further delay.",

                "body": "Sandy Hook survivor joins Parkland students to say 'Enough'\n\nBy Randi Kaye, CNN\n\nUpdated 0124 GMT (0924 HKT) March 24, 2018\n\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nNewtown, Connecticut (CNN)Lauren Milgram has a mission. The sweet and funny, shy yet confident, 12-year-old will join an anticipated hundreds of thousands of people at the March for Our Lives in Washington on Saturday.\n\nThe screams for change by survivors of a school shooting are very personal for her. Because for almost half her life, Lauren has been a survivor, too. Back on December 14, 2012, Lauren was trapped inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, after a man shot his way inside the school. By the time it was over, the shooter had fired more than 150 rounds, and taken the lives of 26 people, including 20 children from kindergarten and first grade, and six adults.Lauren was a first-grader, just 6 years old. Her quick-thinking teacher crammed 15 students into a tiny bathroom off the classroom, saving all of their lives and her own.At home in Newtown, where her family was busy making signs for Saturday's march, Lauren says: \"I'm marching because I don't want this to happen to any other children. It shouldn't have happened, and we really do need more safety.\" Read MoreLauren lost many friends at school that day. Five and a half years later, she doesn't talk about it much, but she still remembers. The student still wears a heart necklace given to her by Daniel Barden, one of her classmates who was killed. Her mother, Erin Milgram, says, \"She wears it when she wants to think of him.\"Now a sixth grader, Lauren believes she can make a difference by marching on Washington. Like many others, she is inspired by the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas calling for gun control after their school in Parkland, Florida, became the scene of a massacre. \"It's amazing that the Parkland students are doing it already,\" she says. \"They're so ahead in this generation, at this age they're making such a big difference.\" Along with her parents and her 15-year-old brother, Dalton, who was in the fourth grade at Sandy Hook when the shooting occurred, Lauren is frustrated that so little has changed at the federal level regarding gun laws. Since 2015, there have been at least 167 school shootings in the United States.Years after Lauren was nearly killed, she can't understand why students aren't better protected from gunfire.\"We can't keep living like this,\" she says. \"It should've happened a long time ago... after all these shootings there really should have been change.\"She has kept up with the policy discussion, and worries about the suggested solution of arming teachers. \"Maybe if a teacher had a gun she could leave it on a table and a kid could see it on the table and take it.\"Come Saturday, this 12-year-old girl who loves to bake homemade strawberry cobbler and key lime pie, will be doing nothing of the sort. Instead, at 5 a.m., she'll board a bus in Newtown with her family, heading for Washington.Lauren's father, Eric Milgram, says it is time to move the country forward. \"These Parkland kids -- my hats off to them. My kids sadly weren't old enough to speak out. My son was in the fourth grade. Highest grade at Sandy Hook but not old enough. But we, as parents, I won't say that we failed them, but we were too polite to speak out.\"Her mother, Erin, agrees. \"We can speak out and make a difference, use a platform, and hopefully change people's minds ... this makes us feel like we're doing something when we go as a family,\" she says.Lauren is full of hope for her future and future generations. In the shadow of the US Capitol, she'll be raising her sign which reads '#Enough', mighty high for all to see.\n\nCNN's Rachel Schleifstein and Nora Neus contributed to this story.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)At least one investigation has been launched into how a senior adviser to Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin hired on a temporary basis ended up with a coveted job leading a Washington, DC, veterans hospital, CNN has learned.\n\nThe VA's Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection has opened an investigation into the issue, the agency said. In addition, a memo obtained by CNN shows the Office of Personnel Management has referred the case to the Office of Special Counsel.The revelations of the VA probe come after CNN obtained a memo suggesting that Lawrence B. Connell was acting as the shadow director of the Washington VA medical center while he was in a political senior adviser position during the presidential transition, and that multiple protocols were violated in officially appointing him to acting director months later. \"We cannot conclude this selection was free from political influence or other impropriety,\" the March 19 memo states. Read MoreThis is the latest in a string of problems plaguing Shulkin, who has been on thin ice with President Donald Trump for weeks, starting with an inspector general report that said he used taxpayer dollars to pay for part of a personal trip. Things only got worse when internal turmoil over how to run the VA spilled over to news reports that Shulkin wasn't speaking to key senior staff, who were actively lobbying to oust him. When reached for comment on Friday, Connell, who served over 30 years as an Army medical service officer, told CNN he \"had no clue\" that the hiring process might have not been properly followed.\"All I know is I applied for the job, I was the best-qualified candidate and that's all. Now they're saying Secretary Shulkin had undue influence -- he had nothing to do with it,\" Connell said. \"I don't know what happened behind the scenes with HR. This came as a bit of a shock.\"Roger French, who is a former personnel officer for the VA and worked there for more than 25 years, said the way Connell got the job was unfair.\"They had 17 top-notch people who have worked their way up through the positions, and they were passed over for Dr. Shulkin's special adviser,\" French said. \"You have top leadership in the VA subverting competitive principles.\"The VA stood behind Connell's credentials in a statement to CNN on Friday.\"Regardless of the circumstances related to his appointment, Larry Connell has performed phenomenally as the Washington DC VA Medical Center's director,\" the statement said. \"Connell continues to be a tremendous asset to VA, the facility and Veterans in the DC area. He has our full support and confidence.\"OPM and the Office of Special Counsel did not respond to questions from CNN.Connell was initially hired in early 2017 to serve in a temporary position as a political appointee at the VA -- a position that was intended to help the transition from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.This senior adviser position was supposed to last no more than 120 days, the memo says, but as the deadline approached, Connell was shifted into a permanent career position as senior executive staffer with the VA, a high-level job that is supposed to be filled after a field of competitive applicants are vetted and interviewed.The OPM memo says that the official in charge of making the recommendation for the position \"selected Mr. Connell without interviewing him or any of the other best qualified candidates.\" \"Mr. Connell stated in his resume and Technical Qualifications statement that he was personally selected/hand-picked by the Secretary of the VA,\" the memo states, although it's unclear which job he was referring to.In addition, the OPM memo says that Connell \"never performed the duties\" of the transitional position that he was supposed to be in for the first several months he worked at the VA. Instead, Connell was performing the duties of the DC Medical Center Director while he was technically still an adviser and political appointee.\"These actions give the appearance that improper preference or advantage was given to Mr. Connell,\" the memo states. \"Therefore, this case will be referred to the US Office of Special Counsel to determine if anyone involved in the recruitment and selection process may have committed a prohibited personnel practice.\"The US Office of Special Counsel is unrelated to the office of Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller.Problems at the DC hospitalShulkin announced last April that Connell was his pick for acting medical director of the Washington center after an interim VA inspector general report criticized the hospital. A VA statement at the time said, \"an acting director from outside the facility would allow leadership to concentrate on addressing the many challenges identified in the OIG report, without compromising the ongoing internal review.\"Connell said Shulkin asked him to take the acting job.\"Shulkin needed someone,\" Connell said. \"He knew I ran hospitals in the Army, and he said go over there. He knew it needed a fresh set of eyes.\"Connell's resume shows that he was Commander of the US Army Health Clinic in Stuttgart, Germany, overseeing a staff of 150, and was the Pacific Regional Medical Command in Honolulu, where he says he oversaw hospitals in Korea, Japan and Hawaii.Connell told CNN he didn't want it to look like \"someone unqualified was put over at the VA medical center. Nothing is further from the truth.\"A follow-up report this month from the inspector general found that the medical center has for years \"suffered a series of systemic and programmatic failures to consistently deliver timely and quality patient care,\" and heightening the potential for waste, fraud and abuse of government resources.VA Inspector General Michael Missal said \"failed leadership at multiple levels within VA that put patients and assets ... at unnecessary risk.\" Connell responded to CNN, saying, \"Everybody equates the IG report with me. You can't fix something like that place in 10 months. It was based on everything that happened prior to my arrival. I'm getting tied into the sins of the previous director.\"\n\nCNN's Juana Summers, Annie Grayer and Nelli Black contributed to this report.",

That is not true. I did not knowingly mislead or lie to investigators,\" McCabe said in an op-ed published by The Washington Post.

Set the headlines aside and give in to what draws you to this work. The country needs you,\" he wrote. McCabe was fired last week just days before he was set to retire.

Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel's work.\"Hours after it was announced McCabe had been fired, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to celebrate, where he wrote: \"Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\" In the piece posted Friday evening, McCabe also described how he learned of his firing, which he said was through a friend who called him after news reports broke that he had been let go. \"So, after two decades of public service, I found out that I had been fired in the most disembodied, impersonal way -- third-hand, based on a news account,\" McCabe said in the op-ed. \"Shortly after getting word, I noticed an email from a Justice Department official in my work account, telling me that I had been \"removed from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the civil service.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nGuangzhou, China (CNN)Five years on, Zhang Qimao still simmers with rage over what happened to her when she reported a sexual assault to the police.\n\nThe 42-year-old Chinese doctor describes a first date gone awry, when a man she'd met in an online dating chat group tried to force himself upon her in his car on the outskirts of the southern city of Guangzhou.\"He started touching me... then he started to take my clothes off and he took his clothes off -- he was trying to rape me.\" she said. \"I saw he had a knife and he was much stronger than me -- so I didn't dare to resist too much.\"She eventually talked him out of sex, but the damage was done. Zhang went to a local police station the following day.What happened next is why she feels compelled to tell her story again now, as the world responds to an increasingly global \"me too\" movement against sexual assault and harassment. Read More\"They just gave me a slip of paper, told me to go home and they'd get in touch,\" she said.Despite the bravery of some outspoken victims like Zhang, Chinese women are finding it difficult to organize a coherent movement. Authorities rarely take allegations of sexual assault seriously, they say, let alone harassment. And the challenges campaigners face include not just a patriarchal culture but also the ruling Communist Party, which frowns upon any citizen-led movements and censors discussion online. 'Have him buy you a necklace'A full week went by and Zhang says she heard nothing -- prompting her to return to the police station to demand action on her case. Only then did the police call in the suspect.\"After questioning him, an officer came out and told me, why don't you just have him buy you a necklace or something and drop this case,\" she said. \"After I told him that's impossible, the officer went back in and talked to the man again. He returned by saying the man was willing to marry me. I found it both ridiculous and infuriating.\"The Guangzhou police did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this case.The sense of neglect and humiliation Zhang said she experienced at the hands of police is why most Chinese victims remain silent -- and why ignorance and indifference on the topic still permeates Chinese society. A universal problemWhile surveys suggest that sexual assault and harassment is prevalent in China, the number of actual prosecutions is small. In a country with a population of 1.4 billion, only 43,000 people were prosecuted for \"crimes of violating women's personal rights\" from 2013 to 2017, according to the office of China's top prosecutor. These crimes range from trafficking, forced prostitution to rape.\"There are so few people prosecuted because there are only so few victims who report,\" said Sophina Huang Xueqin, a former journalist who has spoken out about sexual harassment in the workplace after experiencing it herself. \"To most victims, it's shame. They fear reputation damage and they want privacy.\" Some 70% of college students and graduates reported they had been sexually harassed, according to an 2017 online survey that received less than 7,000 responses. \"Obviously this is a problem in China,\" said Wei Tingting, an activist at the Guangzhou Gender and Sexuality Education Center, which conducted the survey.Wei has long fought to rectify the problem -- well before the current \"me too\" movement -- and paid a heavy price for her effort.In 2015, she was one of five prominent feminists jailed for more than a month when the authorities tried to thwart their campaign aimed at stopping sexual harassment.She and her fellow activists, who became known as the \"feminist five,\" were only released under intense international criticism and pressure. The group received support from leading US politicians such as Hillary Clinton.Wei's survey results are backed up by other studies. A survey of 416 female journalists by Huang, found that 84% had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace at least once. Social media played a large role, with 32% of respondents saying they had received emails, calls, sexual jokes and obscene pictures and videos from perpetrators. Zhang acknowledges that her willingness to share her story is partly due to her unique circumstances. Her older brother was a political dissident who died in suspicious circumstances in police custody, pitting the family against the authorities. Zhang feels she has little to lose by speaking out.

The Standing Committee has never seen a female member, nor is expected to have any included anytime soon. A government run overwhelmingly by men, activists say, is slow to address what's considered a \"female\" problem. They argue that is why there is no legal definition of sexual harassment or standardized way of reporting sexual assault in China. Related: Why China has so few female leadersState-run media have even published articles that claimed sexual assault isn't a problem in China in the wake of the \"me too\" movement.\"Chinese traditional values and conservative attitudes tend to safeguard women against inappropriate behavior,\" said a commentary published last October in the state-run China Daily newspaper after scandalous accounts of sexual assault involving Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein emerged. The government has also taken swift action to block the growing online discussion of the \"me too\" movement -- but creative online commentators have found a way around the suppression, using words for \"rice\" and \"bunny\" in Chinese (mi for rice and tu for bunny) that sound like \"me too\" in English.As a result, \"rice bunny\" become a trending hashtag, inspiring victims who feel buoyed by a sense of strength in numbers.\"People are becoming very brave to stand up about 'me too' and to speak about their stories,\" said Wei, the activist.Strength in speaking outPolice eventually dropped Zhang Qimao's case, telling her she had no proof. She was dejected, until she started speaking to other women in the social media group where she'd met her perpetrator. \"I asked around in the dating chat group, and some women told me that it wasn't the first time the man had done this,\" she said. \"But they were reluctant to come forward.\"So now she tells her story with a sense of determination and ownership, using her experience of assault to assault a status quo that she says must change.\"I hope to draw more attention to police handling of these cases and see police standardize procedures in dealing with such cases, so that more perpetrators can be brought to justice,\" she said.\"When you speak out, you become strong.\"\n\nEdited by Katie Hunt.

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Gold Star father Khizr Khan wrote a personal appeal to the Supreme Court on Friday to strike down President Donald Trump's travel ban, using his family's story to argue the ban is unconstitutional and \"desecrates\" his son's sacrifice.\n\nKnown for his impassioned speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Khan is a lawyer and the father of Capt. Humayun Khan, an Army captain who was killed when he moved to stop a car containing suicide bombers headed toward his base in Iraq, for which he was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star. Originally from Pakistan and a Muslim, Khan filed the legal brief on Friday because, in his view, Trump's travel ban \"not only desecrates Humayun Khan's service and sacrifice as a Muslim- American officer in the United States Army, but also violates Khizr Khan's own constitutional rights,\" his attorney wrote in the brief. The brief describes the Khan family's history and the service of Humayun Khan, mentioning as well Khan's speech at the DNC where he held up a pocket Constitution and emotionally asked Trump if he'd read it. The brief also notes Trump's comments on the campaign trail that he wanted to institute a \"Muslim ban,\" a key component of critics' arguments that the administration's travel ban is a thinly veiled attempt to target Muslims. Read More\"The taint of discrimination has not been washed away,\" the brief argues, saying the latest travel ban and its predecessors all flow from that original idea.\"The message is that Muslims are unwelcome outsiders,\" it continues. \"And that message has been received loud and clear -- not only by Muslims like Mr. Khan, but by those who have been denigrating and attacking Muslims with increasing frequency and vehemence since President Trump called for, and then began trying to implement, his unconstitutional Muslim Ban.\"\"The message is that Muslims are outsiders, regardless of the depth of their devotion to the Constitution, and despite paying the ultimate price to defend it. That message is painfully clear to Mr. Khan,\" the brief states. Khan's attorney, Dan Jackson, said the Gold Star father felt compelled to weigh in because of the impact of the travel ban on his son's legacy, and added Khan has a \"fierce devotion\" to the Constitution. \"I don't know anyone who respects our Constitution more, or has suffered greater loss for its defense, than Mr. Khan and his family,\" Jackson told CNN. \"I hope the Supreme Court heeds his plea that the court should consider the history and message of the Muslim Ban and Proclamation from the perspective of those, like Mr. Khan, on the receiving end of that discriminatory message.\" The justices are set to hear arguments in April concerning whether the travel ban violates immigration law as well as the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. Last year, the justices allowed the entire travel ban issued in September to go into effect pending appeal.Those arguments supplanted an earlier scheduled case, which the justices removed after the latest version of the travel ban was issued in September. The ban places varying levels of restrictions on foreign nationals from eight countries: Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nCNN's Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nKate Andersen Brower is a CNN contributor and the author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies\" and \"The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.\" This article is adapted, in part, from portions of those books . The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) A former Playboy model who alleges that she had an affair more than a decade ago with President Donald Trump apologized to Trump's wife, first lady Melania Trump, in an interview Thursday evening. Melania now shares the dubious distinction of being a publicly scorned first lady with one other woman: her husband's 2016 rival for the presidency and sworn enemy, former first lady Hillary Clinton.\n\nKaren McDougal told Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview on CNN on Thursday night that she'd had a sexual relationship with Donald Trump a decade ago, while Trump was married, and that she was \"sorry\" for what she had done to Trump's wife, Melania. \"What can you say except, I'm sorry?\" she said, adding, teary-eyed, \"I'm sorry. I wouldn't want it done to me.\" The White House has denied the affair allegations, which became public in a Wall Street Journal article before the presidential election; it detailed how the parent company of The National Enquirer had paid for McDougal's story and never published it.McDougal's apology, coupled with other, very public allegations from adult film star Stormy Daniels -- that she, too, had an affair with Trump -- have thrust the Trumps' marriage into the spotlight in a way we have not seen since the 1990s, when Bill Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky dominated the headlines.To be sure, many first ladies have had to endure their husband's infidelity, although they were carried out well below the radar. But that was before cable news and social media.Read MoreThe stories of rampant cheating by Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and others are so legendary that in a 1997 letter Monica Lewinsky sent to Bill Clinton pleading with him to see her, she even referred to Roosevelt's longtime mistress Lucy Mercer. \"Oh, and Handsome [Lewinsky's nickname for the president], remember FDR would never have turned down a visit with Lucy Mercer!\" Mercer, not Roosevelt's wife Eleanor, was by his side when he died in Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1945. And Jackie Kennedy knew her husband saw other women, but at the time there was a gentlemen's agreement in the press never to reveal it.Jackie suffered bouts of depression over her husband's philandering and once, when she was giving a reporter friend of hers from Paris Match a tour of the White House, she spotted a woman, whom she suspected was having an affair with her husband, sitting in his trusted secretary Evelyn Lincoln's office. Jackie turned to her friend and said, in French, \"This is the girl who supposedly is sleeping with my husband.\" But it was not until Hillary Clinton that a first lady would be forced to directly confront such embarrassing and hurtful public allegations of her husband's betrayal. This national -- global, really -- exposure went well beyond the the years of training Clinton possessed as first lady of Arkansas when her husband was governor.But it is all new for Melania, who does not like the spotlight.Bill Clinton's proclivities were no secret and were well-known in his inner circle and probably by his wife long before he won the presidency. During the 1992 presidential campaign, Hillary's close friend and adviser Susan Thomases issued a similar warning to the one a friend of JFK's delivered to him 36 years earlier. Thomases said: \"You're stupid enough to blow this whole Presidential thing over your d--k. And if that turns out to be true, buddy, I'm going home, and I'm taking people with me.\" But Clinton's past came back to haunt him in the White House. As I detailed in a 2016 book I wrote about first ladies, one overnight White House guest of the Clintons remembered hearing the phone ring in the hallway of the second floor residence around midnight. The president picked it up, and after a moment, slumped over and yelled, \"Oh s--t,\" and slammed the phone down. Clinton straightened himself up and continued entertaining his guests well into the early morning hours, as though nothing had happened. The next morning the house guests -- there were always house guests during the Clinton years -- got up and went to the sunny Solarium, with its floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Washington Monument and the Mall, to have a quiet breakfast. The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal were laid out on a table and right away they could see what had upset the president: Paula Jones had just filed a formal lawsuit accusing the president of making an unwanted sexual advance toward her when he was Arkansas governor and she worked in his office.Unlike Jackie, Hillary Clinton had no choice but to address her husband's philandering in a very public way. Like Pat Nixon during Watergate, Hillary Clinton stopped reading the newspapers at the height of the barrage and blamed others, in this case Republicans, for trying to bring down her husband. \"She worked out a resolution that worked for her,\" Thomases said. \"It was important for her to keep their marriage together.\" Shirley Sagawa, who at different times served as Hillary Clinton's domestic policy adviser and deputy chief of staff when she was first lady, said that Monica Lewinsky was a \"terrible distraction\" and that members of Hillary's inner circle were all \"very angry at the time....It was a very complicated time and she handled it all with such grace.\" Inside the walls of the residence, there was deep pain. Hillary had been through this before, even carefully choreographing camera angles during her first \"60 Minutes\" interview in 1992, when she sat beside her husband, who was asked difficult questions about an alleged 12-year affair he had with Gennifer Flowers.The biggest headline of the interview was not anything he said, however; it was when she broke from the script and said, \"I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.\" She had known about his cheating and she wasn't about to let it stand in the way of their chance to win the presidency. But like the Roosevelts before them, the political partnership and deep mutual affection kept the Clintons together. The same was true for the Kennedys. A week after their 10th wedding anniversary, Jackie wrote a letter to their friend Charley Bartlett, who had fixed them up. She told him she knew Jack would have been happy without being married but, without Jack, her life would have \"all been a wasteland, and I would have known it every step of the way.\" It remains to be seen if the bond between the Trumps is as strong.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)President Donald Trump announced on Friday that his administration will issue a new rule banning bump fire stocks, a gun accessory that makes it easier to fire rounds quickly from a semi-automatic weapon, mimicking automatic fire.\n\nThe announcement comes a day before large numbers of protesters are expected to descend on Washington, DC for \"March for Our Lives,\" a rally organized to push for stricter gun laws in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida last month. \"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period,\" Trump wrote. \"We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"Shortly after Trump's tweet, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department would clarify rules that define bump stocks within the definition of \"machine gun\" under federal law, a move that would ban the sale of such accessories.Trump directed his attorney general to propose changes that would ban bump stocks in February. The move came four months after a gunman in Las Vegas used a bump stock to fire down on concertgoers, killing 58 people, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.Read MoreRepublicans, in response to the Las Vegas shooting, blamed the Obama administration for the sale of bump stocks. \"Just a few moments ago I signed a memo directing the attorney general to propose regulations that ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns,\" Trump said at a Medal of Valor event at the White House in February. \"I expect these regulations to be finalized, Jeff, very soon,\" Trump added.On Friday, a Department of Justice statement said if the rule change is made, bump stocks and similar devices would be \"required to surrender, destroy or otherwise render the devices permanently inoperable.\" The public comment period on the rule is 90 days.\"After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress,\" Sessions said.This announcement is the near culmination in a process that has been ongoing for months. The initial proposal by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives drew more than 35,000 comments from the public, a number far more than usual, a sign of how contentious the issue has been.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time that Trump \"doesn't support use of those accessories.\"Though bump stocks were not used in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, they were one of the proposals Trump backed in the wake of the deadly shooting.The President, in a series of emotional events, also proposed arming teachers and school staff -- a suggestion that was quickly slammed by pro-gun control and education groups -- and making it easier for judges to rule someone unfit to own a gun.Trump will not in be in Washington on Saturday during the march, organized in part by students from the Parkland, Florida high school, to protest US gun laws and school shootings.Some lawmakers have questioned whether a rule through the ATF goes far enough to banning certain gun accessories.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nOffutt Airbase, Nebraska (CNN)If the unthinkable happens and a nuclear exchange between the US and North Korea or Russia happens, President Donald Trump will rely on a secure underground facility at a base in the middle of the United States to carry out his orders.\n\nAnd four-star Air Force Gen. John Hyten, the commander of US Strategic Command, would be at the center of it all.\"Our strategic responses are always ready to respond and everybody should know that,\" Hyten told CNN in an interview inside the highly secured 'Battle Deck' where he would oversee a nuclear response if the US is attacked or if Trump decides to launch a pre-emptive strike. \"That they are ready this minute -- under the ground, under the sea, in the air, we are ready to respond, and the adversaries of the world -- including Kim Jong Un -- have to know that.\"Hyten spoke earlier this month as CNN was granted exclusive access to Strategic Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base in eastern Nebraska.Hyten, who is in charge of the US nuclear arsenal, oversees a command of more than 184,000 military and civilian personnel -- all tasked with being on alert 24 hours a day, seven days a week in case of a ballistic missile attack on the US.Read MoreIf that moment arrives, Hyten has to be ready to move into action immediately.\"I have six computer screens in my office; they all go off,\" Hyten said. \"There is a verbal alarm that goes off, there is people telling me, there are about 10 different ways to make sure the commander knows that it is time to move.\"Keeping a constant eye around the globeBefore it gets to that point, the Global Operations Center, a highly secured facility buried many stories underground, is keeping a constant eye around the globe for missile launches and assessing whether they pose any threat to US territory.Whether it is another missile launch in North Korea or just the launching of a satellite somewhere in the world, the staff of this facility, led by a battle watch commander and a strike adviser, reacts quickly to launches on a nearly daily basis to determine whether Hyten, and anyone above him all the way up to the President, needs to be informed.While the facility was rendered unclassified for the brief time CNN was there, normal operations were running concurrently at a separate location nearby in order to maintain the security level required to carry out the mission of Strategic Command.And when the operations center sounded an alarm upon picking up signals of what were likely Russian missiles fired into Syria, the CNN team was immediately hustled out of the room while a launch assessment was made.Every time the alarm sounds, highly classified data detailing the threat is instantly sent to Hyten. In a real world emergency, Battle Watch Commander Col. Carolyn Bird and her staff in the operations center can get anyone from the secretary of defense to the President on the phone if needed.\"There is nobody we can't get ahold of,\" Bird said, adding that it would take only a short amount of time to determine if there was a real threat to the United States or its allies.And Hyten can rapidly brief the President on what is happening after rushing from his office to his command post.\"The pictures that we see on the screen will tell me exactly where the missile is, how high it is going, where the impact point is -- all of those things happen in a small number of minutes,\" Hyten said.If a missile is headed for the US, a secured black safe in the operations center is opened that holds the nuclear decision handbook -- a complete duplicate of the nuclear launch options that are also contained in the bag that always accompanies the president -- euphemistically known as the \"football.\"\"The president's football and our black book are duplicates,\" Bird said. \"They contain the same information in the same way so that we are talking off the same documents when we are discussing nuclear options.\"Bird and her strike adviser, Maj. Jared Dockendorf, who previously worked in missile silos that house US intercontinental ballistic missiles, are both extremely familiar with what is in the book.\"I study that on a daily basis and we also do training on a daily basis to refresh myself and the battle watch commander on what is in the black book,\" Dockendorf said.While Bird could not divulge the contents of the book, she said it was a \"thorough documentation of all of our options to present to the commander in chief,\" from Hyten, who would work with his staff to present the most relevant options in a real world event.Hyten, who has spoken with Trump about the very high stakes involved, believes the President is ready for the ultimate test any commander in chief might face.President Trump asks 'very hard questions'\"He asks me very hard questions. He wants to know exactly how it would work,\" Hyten said. \"The employment of military force is always a difficult decision for any President and there is no more difficult decision than the employment of nuclear weapons. That's why he asks so many questions.\"Hyten's role in a possible nuclear attack is so critical that Strategic Command maintains an aircraft on a nearby runway at the base for Hyten to be rushed to in order to carry out his mission, and advise the President on nuclear strike options from the air should the base itself come under attack.With Trump set to meet North Korean Kim Jong Un in the coming months, Hyten said his preference is always for a diplomatic solution, but he always keeps his eyes wide open despite the fact the North's last missile launch occurred almost four months ago.\"I'm confident [Kim] did not stop building things when he stopped launching things,\" he said. \"Now I can't go into the intelligence, but I have worked with rockets a long time. I know how long they take to build.\"And it is not just the nuclear domain that Hyten oversees. Strategic Command has missions in the space and cyber realms as well.\"I believe the strength of the future is when we can figure out how to bring all of those capabilities to bear against an adversary, and all of those capabilities provide deterrence and keep an adversary from taking a misstep,\" Hyten said.But he does spend a good amount of his time watching what Russia, China and other international actors say and do to develop their military capabilities and pushes to keep the United States ahead and ready for any eventuality.\"We have always been ahead of the world when it comes to those critical technologies, and we are today and everyone should know that,\" he said. \"The question is 10 years from now will we still be ahead, and that's what I am concerned about.\"In the end, though, Hyten's job is really about deterring any would-be adversary from deciding to launch an attack on the United States. \"If someone launches a nuclear weapon against us we launch one back,\" he said. \"They launch another we launch another, they launch two and we launch two. You are on this escalation ladder that ends up nowhere. The key is to stop that behavior before it gets bad.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Elgin, Illinois, police officers tried for more than an hour to get a woman they believed was suicidal and possibly armed with a steak knife out of her car on the side of Interstate 90, including threatening her with arrest.\n\nAuthorities say she refused, and at one point she set something on fire and threw it into the back seat. As smoke filled the car, police moved toward it to force her out. But she opened the door, choking on the smoke, and got out of the car as three gunshots rang out. Police say she had a knife in her left hand, but it's not clear in the video.Decynthia Clements, 34, was killed, and her family wants answers.Elgin Police Chief Jeff Swoboda is trying to provide some information with the release Thursday of about 30 hours of video from police body cameras at the scene. It's an effort to be transparent, he said in a news conference.\"We are trying to lead the way in what a transparent police department looks like,\" Swoboda told reporters. \"And what a transparent police department looks like is that you get in front of the cameras and you talk with the people before you have all the answers.\"Read MoreAn attorney for her family told CNN that Clements was emotionally disturbed and the situation should have been handled differently. The Illinois State Police is leading an investigation into the March 12 shooting, the police chief said. The Cook County state's attorney will review the case when it is completed, but the process is expected to take months, Swoboda said. The police department also will conduct an internal investigation to determine whether its policies were properly followed. At the news conference, police showed a video about 20 minutes long, compiled from different cameras and angles and meant to establish a narrative of the shooting. Clements' family watched the video before it was released Thursday, Swoboda told reporters.How the shooting unfolded In the footage, police are seen trying to get Clements to exit her vehicle, which is stopped on the shoulder of I-90 in Elgin, about 40 miles west of Chicago. She periodically tries to drive away, but her car is missing two tires and can be heard scraping against the pavement. As more officers arrive, one tells them he saw Clements with a steak knife and a \"white powdery substance\" on her hand, which he assumes to be crack cocaine.Officers discuss strategies to get Clements -- whom they believe to be suicidal -- out of the car. They repeatedly tell her she is under arrest, but she refuses to get out. Eventually police close the interstate as a safety precaution. Police continue to talk tactics. One officer says if Clements exits the vehicle with the knife, they will try to stop her. But if she has the knife to herself, he says, \"we're not going to end it for her.\" Officers discuss using multiple methods of nonlethal force, including Tasers and rubber bullets. At this point, Swoboda said, police have spent an hour on I-90 trying to get her out of the car. Officers pin Clements' vehicle between two squad cars in an attempt to keep her from leaving. But a sense of urgency takes over after she lights something on fire and throws it in the back seat of her vehicle, which begins filling with smoke. When a fire erupts inside the vehicle, officers decide to extract her from the car. One can be seen removing his Taser from its holster before several officers approach. From the body camera, the car door can be seen opening, and Clements is heard choking on smoke, billowing out of the top of the car. Officers again tell her to exit the vehicle, and Clements steps out and moves toward the officers, when one of them fires his weapon three times. Police say she was holding a knife.Clements was emotionally disturbed, family attorney saysAntonio Romanucci, an attorney for Clements' family, told CNN in an interview Friday that police had \"no reason\" to open fire.\"There was no evidence that police were in fear of their own bodily harm,\" Romanucci said, adding it's clear in the video that officers saw she was \"clearly emotionally disturbed.\" Romanucci believes the situation should have been handled differently, and that a crisis intervention team should have been on scene. \"Since they did not deal with this as a medical situation, they dealt with this as a militarized, police situation,\" he said. \"Because one officer perceived her as deadly threat, despite the plan not to kill her, with all those officers there, it was predetermined that she would die.\"Swoboda said in the Thursday news conference that one of the officers on scene led the department's hostage negotiation team until recently, and that a \"high percentage\" of Elgin police officers have crisis intervention training.\"The family is grieving right now,\" Romanucci told CNN. Clements, he said, will be buried Saturday. \"We hope the right thing is done,\" he said. \"We hope the investigation is transparent. And hope they find that this officer was not justified in using deadly force.\" Swoboda said his department wanted to begin the healing process and chose to release the video now, though he recognizes it will initially cause more pain for the family.\"It's cases like this though that also force some tough conversations,\" he said. \"And I want the community to know that the Elgin Police Department is ready to have those tough conversations.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)They're 911 calls that cover the spectrum of emotion.\n\nFear: \"The whole family, all scared, you know?\"Disbelief: \"Was that a typo? A really, really bad typo?\"Anger: \"Somebody needs to get their a-- whooped!\"The calls were placed to the Honolulu Police Department on January 13 -- the morning a phone text alert was mistakenly sent out, warning of an incoming ballistic missile threat to Hawaii.Read More\"Seek immediate shelter,\" it read, injecting panic into more than a million Hawaiians and tourists with its ominous tag line. \"This is not a drill.\"Honolulu police this week released 24 calls at the request of local media, calling them representative of 2,000-plus calls placed to dispatchers at the height of the confusion. CNN affiliate KHON posted the calls on its website.The state had already been on edge on the day of confusion, having undergone various missile drills after learning North Korea possessed a long-range missile that could reach Hawaii.After the alert went out at 8:07 a.m. local time, police dispatchers -- who were not responsible for the mistake -- were just as confused as the callers and were relying on the media for information.Several times, callers were instructed to watch CNN. \"At this time, we're trying to see on the news, like CNN, cause we just got the message, too, and we don't have any answers,\" a dispatcher told one caller two minutes after the alert went out.\"I don't own a TV, what should I do?\" the woman replied.\"OK, if anything... do you have radio access?\" the dispatcher asked. \"I don't know, no I don't,\" she said, sounding disoriented with confusion. \"I have just Internet. Should I go to a neighbor?\"\"Can you please? Cause we don't have the answer either because we just got the message too, just now, I'm sorry,\" the dispatcher said.By 8:15 a.m. -- eight minutes after the alert -- police dispatchers were finally warned of the mistake, which occurred when a state employee hit the wrong button during a planned drill.But it would be 30 minutes after that before the public would get that same information declaring a false alarm. In that time, many callers were still in the dark, hearing from dispatchers about the mistake for the first time.Caller: \"My hotel is under alert, is that true?\"Dispatcher: \"OK, that information is wrong. The information is wrong. That was a mistake. There is no danger.\"\"Yeah, they're idiots,\" another caller said, after being told of the state's error.Even after the public received its second alert -- the \"all clear\" at 8:45 a.m -- many 911 callers still appeared confused and afraid. Others simply vented in anger.Caller: \"North Korea could have landed their missiles in 20 minutes, everybody knows that!Dispatcher: \"I'm sorry, sir. I am so sorry...\"Caller: \"Well they need to get the system up and running much better than it is so people are not left hanging, not knowing what to do!\"Dispatcher: \"We were in the dark, too. I'm so sorry.\"Caller: \"911 should get tied to the televisions... nobody in the government of Hawaii is listening to this situation to make something happen! They're giving it mouth service, that's all, mouth service!\"The calls released by police fall into a 61-minute time span from that morning, during which operators were chastised (\"That's not an answer, there has to be an answer as to what happened!\"), served as counselors and even sounding boards for a wary public.Caller: \"It's not fun, you know, it's not fun. They got to find out who did that, you know?Dispatcher: \"Yes, they do. They do... they're going to find out.\"Caller: \"Go find out and go catch them, you know? Don't let them go.\"The state employee who pushed the wrong button during the drill was eventually fired. According to an investigating officer, he claimed not to know it was an exercise, even though five other employees in the room reported hearing \"exercise, exercise, exercise.\"Even as chaos was unfolding that morning in the police dispatch center, one operator managed to sum up the event while giving audience to a man who was unsure where to take shelter.\"It was like a wake-up call,\" she said.\"A wake-up call,\" the man agreed.\"Yeah, because what if it was real, right?\" the dispatcher said.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nLondon (CNN)One of the first uses of a trove of Facebook data on tens of millions of Americans that has thrown Facebook and Cambridge Analytica into crisis this week was in 2014 by a super PAC run by John Bolton, President Donald Trump's new national security adviser, two former Cambridge Analytica employees told CNN.\n\nThe Bolton super PAC and Cambridge Analytica signed a $454,700 contract in the summer of 2014. The contract, obtained by CNN, outlined how the data firm would provide the super PAC \"behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging.\" The contract stated that the data would be collected in accordance with the law.Psychographic profiles are used to predict people's interest, values, and opinions -- Cambridge Analytica used the predictions to target voters with advertising. The predictions were based on Facebook data that Cambridge University scientist Aleksandr Kogan sold to Cambridge Analytica, according to Christopher Wylie, who worked for the company in 2014, and another person who worked for the company but does not want to be named.Kogan told CNN that he provided Cambridge Analytica with data on 30 million Americans. Facebook said in doing so, Kogan lied to them and breached its policies. Kogan said he believed he was acting within Facebook's guidelines.Read MoreThe super PAC and Cambridge Analytica say they were unaware the data shared with them was in violation of Facebook policy.The Bolton PAC was one of the first beneficiaries of the data, both sources said, and Cambridge Analytica used the data to help produce ads for the super PAC. A spokesman for the super PAC denies knowing of any alleged impropriety by Cambridge Analytica.Bolton, a former US ambassador to the United Nations in the George W. Bush administration, was mulling a 2016 presidential bid when his super PAC hired Cambridge Analytica. In the 2014 midterms, the super PAC backed candidates including Republican Senate contenders Thom Tillis and Tom Cotton -- both of whom also hired Cambridge Analytica and went on to win their races. Documents provided to CNN show how the SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica's parent company, outlined how to target voters in Arkansas, where Cotton was running for US Senate in 2014. Entitled \"Arkansas Priority Persuasion Clusters,\" it split Arkansas voters into five groups and outlined what messaging would resonate with them. One ad by Bolton's super PAC for Cotton focused on patriotism, leadership and on the candidate's military service. Wylie said that ad was primarily targeted at \"cluster two\" of Arkansas voters, which consisted of males in their 40s to 60s who cared most about national security and the economy. Among the \"image guidelines\" outlined by SCL Group to appeal to this group was a picture of Cotton in military uniform -- similar pictures appeared in the ad. Another Bolton super PAC ad said \"our world is becoming an increasingly dangerous place,\" citing Iraq, Russia and ISIS, before asking \"what's next?\"In one example involving New Hampshire voters, a cluster of 35- to 55-year-olds, mostly female, was described as \"polite and concerned with remaining in the good graces of others.\" SCL Group suggested messages showing figures getting along well should be targeted at this group. Wylie said that messaging was designed to exploit people's \"mental vulnerabilities.\" Cambridge Analytica was the brainchild of conservative billionaire Robert Mercer and conservative activist Steve Bannon, who later helped run the Trump campaign and served as chief strategist in the White House. Federal Election Commission records show Bolton's super PAC paid Cambridge Analytica more than $340,000 during the 2014 midterm elections cycle. Mercer donate $1 million to the super PAC in that same period. The Mercers also donated to the Tillis and Cotton campaigns in 2014.Tillis said Cambridge Analytica played a \"relatively small part\" in his campaign when he spoke to reporters Tuesday. CNN has reached out to Cotton for comment. Data on Americans was gathered through a Facebook personality test app built by Kogan. The app not only gathered information from those who used it, but also from their Facebook friends. One point on an agenda that CNN obtained of a meeting between SCL and another contractor that worked for the Bolton PAC read, \"SCL able to harvest substantial and useful information on people from Facebook, with permission.\" Cambridge Analytica said when it learned a year later in 2015 that Facebook had determined that Kogan had breached Facebook's policies, Cambridge Analytica deleted the data Kogan had provided them.\n\nCNN's Curt Devine and Marshall Cohen contributed to this story.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)NFL defensive end Michael Bennett was indicted Friday in Houston on a charge of injury to the elderly in connection with an incident that occurred when he was a spectator at the 2017 Super Bowl, authorities said.\n\nThe Harris County district attorney's office said Bennett rushed the field when the game ended to congratulate his brother Martellus Bennett, who played for the winning New England Patriots. Bennett was told to use a different field entrance, but he pushed through the security detail, which included a 66-year-old paraplegic woman in a wheelchair, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a news conference. The woman suffered a sprained shoulder in the February 5, 2017, incident, Acevedo said. \"It's offensive to me that a man who's supposed to be an example, a professional athlete, thinks its OK to act like this,\" Acevedo said.Read MoreCNN has reached out to Bennett and his lawyer for comment but has not heard back.Harris County said the felony charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.Bennett was one of the most vocal NFL players in protesting the national anthem before games.He appeared on CNN and said he didn't understand why President Donald Trump would \"stoop so low\" as to say that NFL owners should fire players who protest.Bennett, 32, played with the Seattle Seahawks for five seasons and just signed a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. He played high school football in Houston and college ball at Texas A&M University.Acevedo said Bennett's lawyer has been notified. The chief said Bennett has not been arrested yet but should turn himself into police as soon as possible.When asked why it took more than a year to file charges against Bennett, Acevedo said police had to prioritize more serious crimes. Also, Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in August, he noted.Acevedo said an officer at the game witnessed Bennett pushing the woman but decided to check on the elderly woman rather than immediately arrest Bennett, whom he recognized.\"We knew who the suspect was,\" Acevedo said. \"We knew what he had done and we knew where to find him.\"The Philadelphia Eagles said in a statement Friday: \"We are aware of the situation involving Michael Bennett and are in the process of gathering more information. Because this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\"Last September, Bennett complained that police in Las Vegas unfairly singled him out, threatened him with a gun and detained him briefly after he attended a prizefight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor.Las Vegas authorities said officers were responding to a call of battery and assault with a gun that had turned into an active shooter situation and thought that Bennett might be involved. No charges were filed.\n\nCNN's Jill Martin and Leinz Vales contributed to this report.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A Tennessee man who was wrongfully imprisoned for 31 years has been awarded $1 million by the state.\n\nIn 1978, Lawrence McKinney was sentenced to 115 years in jail on rape and burglary charges. He was cleared of those charges in 2008 and was released from jail in 2009. At the time, the Tennessee Department of Corrections gave him $75 to start over. \"It's been a long road for Lawrence,\" said his attorney, Jack Lowery. The governor recently exonerated himSince his release, McKinney's been on a mission to clear his name. Before he could get the $1 million payout -- the maximum allowed under Tennessee law -- he needed a formal exoneration from the governor's office. But it wasn't easy. Read MoreIn 2016, the Tennessee Board of Parole unanimously decided not to recommend that McKinney receive clemency. \"After considering all of the evidence, the board did not find clear and convincing evidence of innocence and declined to recommend clemency in this matter,\" Melissa McDonald, a spokeswoman for the board, told CNN at the time. Fortunately for McKinney, 62, and his lawyers, the final call rested with Gov. Bill Haslam. And last December, five days before Christmas, Haslam went against the recommendation of the parole board and exonerated McKinney, Lowery said.On Wednesday, the Tennessee Board of Claims voted 7-0 to give McKinney the maximum $1 million payment. Members of the board said they wished they could give McKinney more. The $1 million will be split into an initial sum of $353,000, said Lowery, which will mostly go toward legal fees and a car for McKinney. The remaining $647,000 will be divvied up in monthly payments of $3,300.Lowery said the payment is guaranteed for a minimum of 10 years, and if McKinney dies, his wife -- who was his pen pal while in jail -- will continue to receive the monthly annuity. McKinney says he's happy to have the money. \"In my age, it helps me so I won't have to work so hard,\" he told CNN on Friday. \"In prison I had to work so hard for nothing.\"\"My blessings and praise go out to God,\" he added. \"And number two, my pastor. He's always been there for me and my church has always been behind me. But my wife has really been right hand. She has always been there for me.\" A 'humble man'John Hunn, McKinney's pastor, and his church have spent years working with McKinney to clear his name. \"He's so used to injustice,\" Hunn said, \"that I think he's really trying to get his head around what justice looks like.\" McKinney is a \"humble man\" who cares more about the time he has left in life than the amount of money to his name, Hunn told CNN. Lowery agreed.\"He hasn't shown as much interest in the money part of it,\" he said. \"He wanted his name cleared, and the amazing thing, he wasn't angry at anybody.\"McKinney said he doesn't hold any grudges about the years he was in jail. God, he said, took all of the anger out of his heart.\"If people paid attention to the situation that I went through, they'd see it's just a blessing,\" he said. Hunn said he was glad McKinney's story could positively impact so many people, and \"put a smile on peoples' faces.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nAaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and author of \"The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President.\" Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him @aarondmiller2. Richard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. From 2005-2015, he served as a member of the secretary of state's Office of Policy Planning. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\n(CNN)News that John Bolton will be Donald Trump's third national security adviser in 13 months has caused much hand-wringing, wailing and rending of garments among Washington's foreign policy elite. And with some justification: Add Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and you have two ideological hawks who seem to prefer shooting first abroad and asking questions later.\n\nStill, what makes these appointments somewhat confusing and odd is that when it comes to using military force, you have a risk-averse President and a similarly inclined secretary of defense, Gen. James Mattis. How this interaction will play out on the looming challenges of North Korea and Iran is both unpredictable and possibly dangerous. And whether the irascible and tough-minded John Bolton will keep his new seat -- or is a bright, shiny but temporary fix in the mind and mood swings of a mercurial President -- remains to be seen. Bombs away Bolton?With the appointment of Bolton and the nomination of Pompeo, Trump has surrounded himself with the toughest and most risk-ready national security team in recent memory. On paper, these appointments go well beyond any we've seen in past Republican administrations. Read MoreRonald Reagan, no dove, had his share of hard-line and hawkish conservatives, but all of them were capable of great flexibility and pragmatism. Bush 43 also surrounded himself with a group of pragmatic advisers (minus Dick Cheney, of course); and had it not been for been for 9/11, which brought out their worst instincts and eventually led the United States into a galactic blunder in Iraq, they might have remained that way. Bolton, on the other hand, has never met a rogue state that he didn't want to bomb. This was true of the American invasion of Iraq, one of the most disastrous decisions in the history of US foreign policy and one that he continues to defend. He has been a vocal and tireless champion of pre-emptive US military strikes against Iran and North Korea and advocated US military intervention in Syria's civil war. Like the President, he has shown nothing but disdain for diplomacy, because it requires compromises to be successful and is therefore anathema to Bolton's preternatural \"my way or the highway\" instincts and the winner-take-all Manichean world he lives in. There is nothing in his record to suggest that he will behave any differently. Still, in life and in government, where you stand depends on where you sit. Bolton is a classic bomb-thrower. He has made a second career issuing bombastic threats from the safety of the sidelines of Fox News. We can only hope that the responsibility of making recommendations to the President on life and death decisions will sober him up -- and he has said his job is to present the President with a variety of options. But the past is often prologue and nobody should bet their mortgages on a transformed John Bolton.Trump a moderate, really?The other reality is that neither Bolton nor Pompeo is president. For all of Trump's bluster, aggressive instincts and impetuousness, when it comes to the use of force he seems wary of risk, if the stakes involve getting the United States into another costly war and require investing resources to win the peace after the war is over.This impulse is evident in his limited retaliatory strike in April 2017 against a single Syrian airfield for the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons, his modest surge of troops to Afghanistan and his reluctance to strike Iran or the Assad regime in Syria. Trump seems instinctually to have the businessman's nose for not throwing good money after bad, and in the name of his own America First doctrine, he appears to want to cut back on the role of Washington as the world's policeman or enforcer. It's possible he could fall under Bolton's spell. But there's hope that he'd be inclined to ask some pretty tough questions before launching a risky and costly military campaign.Mattis to the rescue?The other countervailing force is James Mattis. Richard K. Betts, in \"Soldiers, Statesmen, and Cold War Crises,\" his classic work on military and civilian decision-making on the use of force, concluded that, contrary to popular perceptions, military leaders were not more aggressive than their civilian masters in advocating the use of force; he also showed that military advice has been most influential when it has argued against military intervention. Let's hope Betts is right. Despite his view that Iran is a mortal enemy of the United States, Mattis has opposed the use of force to kick Iranian forces out of Syria and urged Trump not to walk away from the Iran nuclear deal. On North Korea, he reportedly angered the President over his refusal to provide military options for pre-emptive attacks and has said that war between the United States and North Korea would have catastrophic consequences. Mattis will play an even more central role in decisions on war and peace, and he may be the last man standing between Trump and military action against North Korea and Iran. The challenge for Mattis is that with the departure of McMaster and Tillerson, the bureaucratic deck will be stacked against him. We can only hope that Trump continues to heed the advice of his generals and that Mattis doesn't quit.Bright, shiny objectsRonald Reagan went through six national security advisers, albeit in eight years. Trump is already on his third and has demonstrated his love of musical chairs. If he was reportedly turned off by Bolton's mustache during job interviews, imagine that mustache showing up to brief him every day. Bolton has a reputation for being irascible, inflexible and high-handed. He does not play well with others, and it may only be a matter of time before his shoot-from-the-lip style irritates the President or causes even more political headaches for the White House. Every President has the legitimate right to change his advisers and pick ones he's comfortable with. Trump has rolled the dice on this one -- choosing hard-liners at a time when America's greatest foreign policy challenges require not only toughness and resolve but wisdom, restraint, prudence and pragmatism, too.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)John Bolton, Donald Trump's pick to be the next national security adviser, has a decade-long history of associating with anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller.\n\nThe former UN ambassador wrote the foreword to Geller's 2010 book that she coauthored with fellow anti-Islam activist Robert Spencer titled \"The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America.\" Bolton also appeared twice on Geller's internet radio program \"Atlas on the Air\" and twice on her video blog.Geller is well-known for her inflammatory public comments about Muslims and Islam and has long peddled the conspiracy theory that Muslims are attempting to impose Sharia law in the US. She once ran an ad campaign in New York City with taglines like, \"It's not Islamophobia, it's Islamorealism\" and \"End all aid to Islamic countries.\"Geller emerged in 2010 as a leading opponent of the mosque and community center that was then planned for a site near Ground Zero in lower Manhattan. She also organized a \"Draw the Prophet\" contest in Garland, Texas, in May 2015. The contest, which occurred in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris that year and which Geller argued was an event in defense of free speech, was disrupted by two gunmen who attacked it and were ultimately shot dead.Geller has long been a booster of Bolton, dating back to at least 2005 when she strongly supported him as President George W. Bush's pick to be the US ambassador to the United Nations. Read MoreGeller declined to answer CNN's questions about her relationship with Bolton and instead asked for corrections on past CNN coverage of her. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Bolton did not respond to a request for comment. Bolton would make his first brief appearance on Geller's video blog in June 2006 while serving in the UN post, where he told Geller he was trying to keep UN bureaucrats from making decisions for the American people.Bolton appeared on Geller's \"Atlas on the Air\" Internet radio show in November 2007, speaking for nearly an hour to promote his book at time, though the interview evolved into a wide-ranging discussion on Bolton's worldview. Bolton agreed with Geller that the United Nations was an anti-Semitic institution. Geller also pressed Bolton on his thoughts on the alleged threat of \"creeping Sharia,\" a conspiracy that she and other anti-Muslim activists hold that Muslims in America are stealthily trying to implement religious law in the United States courts. Bolton answered, \"I don't see it as much as a threat in the United States as it is yours. Because I think in the United States, uh, we have made the melting pot into something that's unique in the world. And the melting pot means you can come from anywhere. You can come from any background, any ethnic group, any geo geographical region, any religion, any culture. And you can become an American. You don't have to lose your heritage, but you have to go through a process of assimilation.\"Bolton then said it was a problem in Europe, and that European courts were in a crisis because they don't know how to handle Muslims who argue \"Sharia should apply to Muslims and some other law should apply to everybody else.\"After Geller pushed the subject further, Bolton said it was a problem in parts of the United States as well. \"I think there are problems that we've seen in parts of the United States. I don't mean to say it doesn't exist, but I think we face a qualitatively different situation than the Europeans.\"Bolton said the question of Sharia law and rising Muslim demographics would be one that they would be faced with in the future.\"I think the Europeans are more at risk than we are. But uh, but I, I acknowledge this is a, this is a question we're going to have to face in the coming decades as well.\"In June 2008, Bolton again appeared on Geller's internet radio show, mostly to discuss past election and the upcoming election and Bush administration actions. In 2009, Bolton did a 23-minute long sit down appearance with Geller on her video blog where he said he disagreed with comments by Mitt Romney, in response to a question by Geller, that jihadism is not part of Islam. \"I didn't see the statements but, as the saying goes from the Franklin Roosevelt era, somebody said, 'not all Democrats are horse thieves, but all horse thieves are Democrats.' Taking that forward, the terrorists today are Islamic fundamentalists, that's where the threat lies, worldwide, and the worst threat of all, is obviously getting nuclear, chemical or biological weapons,\" Bolton said. \"I think Romney in 2008 did suffer by comparison on national security issues, I think that's why many Republicans supported John McCain or either Fred Thompson, so part of Romney's burden going forward, if in fact he runs again, is to demonstrate that he can handle not only the domestic economic issues, but foreign policy questions as well.\"In his 2010 foreword to Geller's book, Bolton wrote, \"This book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of Barack Obama as our first post-American president.\"In the book, Geller and Spencer argued that America and Europe face \"creeping Sharia\" and that \"Europe is committing slow cultural and demographic suicide.\" The authors paint a picture of Obama as unwilling to confront the country's problems because he was \"influenced and indoctrinated by many who despised America.\" Geller and Spencer's critique of Obama is closely intertwined with their fear of Sharia law infiltrating the United States. \"His statements about meeting the challenge of the global jihad, however, were a de facto form of submission, an implementation of a soft Sharia: the quiet and piecemeal implementation of Islamic laws that subjugate non-Muslims,\" they wrote.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsJust over 50% of Americans are registered as organ donorsThere are about 115,000 people currently waiting for an organ transplant in the US\n\n(CNN)Eighteen-year-old Nicholas Coats died Monday night after doctors said he was too sick to receive a lifesaving liver donation, his family said.\n\nCoats and his identical twin, Devin, of Slidell, Louisiana, were both diagnosed with a severe form of liver cirrhosis in March 2017. The cirrhosis was thought to be caused by a rare genetic mutation shared by the brothers, their mother said. \"It was not his fault, but ultimately, he paid the price because of it,\" said Margi Coats, the boys' mother. \"My son had big aspirations for life. He wanted to go to Texas A&M to go to engineering school. He was smart.\"Now, his life is cut short because of the lack of donors,\" she believes, \"and with the millions of people we have in this country, there's no sense in it.\"Devin was able to receive a liver transplant this year. However, Nick was deemed ineligible for a transplant at the time because his liver was not damaged enough to place him on the donor registry, Coats said. Read MoreWhile waiting for his liver condition to worsen, Nick developed angiosarcoma, an aggressive cancer of the blood vessels that probably originated in his damaged liver, his mother said.A match for Nick was found in February, but by that point, it was too late. Doctors would no longer proceed with the transplant due to the metastasized cancer, his mother said. Had the pool of available donors been larger, he may have been eligible for a transplant in time to save his life, she believes. \"From what I understand, they cannot give organs to somebody that's already fighting another disease. They want it to go to a healthy person,\" she added.\"So with his cancer, that kind of put him on the back burner.\"Nick died surrounded by his family and loved ones. His funeral is set for Wednesday.\"Nick requested to be placed outside by a garden in nature, and we have secured a place. It's a beautiful area, and I know that he would enjoy it,\" their mother said. After Nick's deaths, hundreds of people from across the country posted on the family's Facebook and GoFundMe pages to offer their condolences. \"I am so sorry, I pray for people to get on board and sign up for organ donation. God Bless you and your family. I know being on the list, getting on the list is hard. Waiting is hard. But to do it for two is unfair,\" one post said. \"My niece ... is 22 years old and my sister's only child. She has been waiting for a liver transplant as well,\" another person posted. Nick's death has inspired his mother to educate people -- especially teenagers -- about the societal benefits of becoming an organ donor.\"This could be you one day. This could be you needing a kidney; this could be you needing a heart,\" she said. \"Now I have a cause, I have a meaning, and it's something strong that I feel in my heart.\"Those interested in registering can sign up at organdonor.gov. More than 90% of Americans support organ donation, but just over 50% are signed up in the organ registry, according to Anne Paschke, public relations manager for the United States nonprofit United Network for Organ Sharing.According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, there are 114,951 candidates on organ transplant waiting lists in the United States. Of these, 83% are waiting for a kidney, 12% for a liver and 4% for a heart. \"The good news is that we had a record number of donors and transplants last year. About 95 people a day got a transplant,\" Paschke said. \"But that's not enough. About 20 people die [per day] waiting for an organ that doesn't come in time.\"Before his death, Nick asked that his body be used to help others like him.\"We were able to donate the cornea of his eyes, which I felt was a blessing,\" his mother said. \"I feel like now Nick continues to live; he's just living through the eyes of someone else.\"The experience also reminded Nick's mother of one of her favorite quotes, which she says has given her strength over the past few weeks: \" 'You can't take your organs to heaven, because heaven knows you need them here.'\"I think that's a beautiful ending to this whole situation,\" she added. \"Don't let anything go to waste.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)The day after a CNN interview with a former Playboy model who claims to have had a 10-month affair with her husband, first lady Melania Trump opted to leave President Donald Trump alone for the ride from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base.\n\nThe official White House schedule, released Thursday evening, stated the first couple would depart the White House together aboard Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews, but Mrs. Trump did not appear beside her husband. CNN reached out to the first lady's communications office for an explanation or comment on the change in plan but did not receive a response. On Monday, the first couple walked together across the South Lawn to Marine One, and then on to New Hampshire. A brief trip on the grass made for a moment between husband and wife, as Trump, with his arm around his wife's waist, caught Mrs. Trump as she fell -- in return, she placed her arm around him. However, on Friday, no such public display of affection. This week has been a busy one for the first lady, who gave remarks about the opioid crisis in New Hampshire as well as met with representatives from the internet to discuss kids and social media at the White House on Tuesday. Just this afternoon she delivered a speech at the State Department as part of the International Women of Courage awards' ceremony. On February 16, the day news first broke about Karen McDougal's alleged affair, Mrs. Trump took a previously unscheduled separate motorcade to Joint Base Andrews in the same manner as today. Read MoreAt the time, the first couple was headed to Florida to visit victims of the Parkland high school shooting. The first lady's communications director told CNN the last-minute divergence in travel to Andrews was due to Mrs. Trump's schedule. There has been heightened focus on the state of the Trumps' marriage as headlines about McDougal and porn star Stormy Daniels have plagued the White House since January. Mrs. Trump has not publicly commented on the topic. The Trumps are headed to Mar-a-Lago; the President plans to remain for the weekend and the first lady is slated to stay for at least a week while the couple's son has a scheduled spring break vacation from school.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Demonstrators in Sacramento marched Friday to California's Capitol during a second day of protests over the police-involved shooting death of Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man.\n\nThe crowd walked about a mile from the city's Tower Bridge to the steps of the seat of state government. They chanted \"Black lives matter\" and called out Clark's name. One of the march leaders told people to hold up their cellphones; police have said Clark had an object in his hand, but no weapon was found. \"It's just a cellphone,\" the man yelled out. \"I don't know how the hell it looks like a gun to anybody else.\"The shooting incident began Sunday after 9 p.m., when Sacramento officers responded to a report that a man had broken car windows and was hiding in a backyard. They pursued a man identified as Clark, who hopped a fence into his grandmother's property.Read MoreOfficials said two officers fired when they thought they saw a weapon.The crowd Friday stood on the steps outside the Capitol, decrying a police force the protesters called racist. They said there was no reason for police to open fire.\"Cells up, don't shoot,\" they screamed.'A phone is not a gun'Protesters the day before had marched into City Hall and onto an interstate highway as the mayor called for calm. They also went to an NBA arena and kept many fans from attending the Kings game against the Atlanta Hawks. At City Hall, demonstrators called for the arrest of the two officers and demanded to see police Chief Daniel Hahn as they marched into the building.The protest, which was organized by Black Lives Matter Sacramento, briefly spilled onto Interstate 5 after the group left City Hall. \"A phone is not a gun,\" protesters chanted. Police: Clark had an objectThe shooting was captured by the two officers' body cameras and a police helicopter; that footage was released on Wednesday in an effort to be transparent. On Sunday, officers fired 20 times at Clark, hitting him multiple times, police told CNN Sacramento affiliate KOVR. The two officers have since been placed on paid administrative leave amid a use of force investigation. The body camera videos show the brief encounter between police and Clark, lasting less than a minute, from the moment one of the officers yelled: \"Hey, show me your hands. Stop. Stop.\"Police said the officers entered the front yard and saw the suspect along the side of the home. Police said the man \"turned and advanced toward the officers while holding an object\" extended in front of him. \"Show me your hands!\" one of the officers yelled. \"Gun, gun, gun.\"Seconds later, officers opened fire as they took cover near a wall. As more police arrived at the scene, someone is heard asking, \"What did he have on him?\"An officer responded \"... something in his hands. It looked like a gun from our perspective.\"Clark's family members have disputed the police account. Clark's grandmother said she was inside the house when the shots were fired, and saw her grandson with an iPhone.\n\nCNN's Sonya Hamasaki, Madison Park, Stephanie Becker, Dave Alsup, Dan Simon, Amanda Jackson and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)President Donald Trump is expected to receive a recommendation from his National Security Council on Friday that he expel a yet-to-be-determined number of Russian diplomats from the US in response to the poisonings of a former spy and his daughter on UK soil, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN.\n\nThe decision to send that recommendation to the President comes after a high-level meeting at the White House on Wednesday during which the NSC drew up a range of options to take action against Russia, according to multiple State Department officials and a source familiar with the discussion.Ultimately, the outcome of that meeting was a recommendation that Trump should expel more Russian diplomats from the US -- an option several sources told CNN was the most severe response under consideration.If Trump decides to act on the NSC recommendation, it is expected to be soon -- possibly early next week, a source involved in the discussions said. Prior to Wednesday's meeting, one State Department source told CNN the move would be considered a \"very serious step,\" especially given the last round of tit-for-tat expulsions that have left both Russia and the US with significantly smaller diplomatic forces in each other's countries.Read MoreAccording to a source with knowledge of the discussions, it is believed that the US was waiting to see what members of the European Council would do -- and on Friday 10 European countries announced they would follow the United Kingdom's lead by also expelling Russian diplomats. A senior foreign diplomat told CNN that Germany, France, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Czech, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Ireland and several others will \"likely\" expel the Russians on Monday. The UK ordered 23 Russian diplomats back to Moscow last week after the country concluded that Russia was responsible for the poisonings. On Tuesday, one senior State Department official, speaking on background, supported the UK's own decision to kick out 23 Russian diplomats: \"We stand in solidarity with our Allies in the United Kingdom, and we fully supported the UK's decision to expel diplomats and take other actions to respond. The United States is considering a range of options to respond to this outrageous incident, both to demonstrate our solidarity with our Ally and to hold Russia accountable for its clear breach of international norms and agreements.\"Russia and the UK have been embroiled in a bitter diplomatic fight since Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, 33-year-old Yulia Skripal, were poisoned in the English cathedral city of Salisbury on March 4.The assault stoked British rage over what UK Prime Minister Theresa May called \"a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil.\"May has accused Russia of orchestrating the attack but Russian officials have repeatedly denied carrying out the poisoning.Russian President Vladimir Putin described the accusations as \"delirium\" on Sunday, in comments after winning another six years as president.\n\nCNN's Zachary Cohen contributed to this report",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)After threatening a veto via Twitter on Friday morning, President Donald Trump -- flanked by several of his favorite (for now) Cabinet secretaries -- announced he had signed the $1.3 trillion budget bill that will keep the government funded and open through September.\n\nTrump lambasted the so-called omnibus bill -- and pledged to never sign another piece of legislation like the one he was about to sign. Then he said he had signed it.Drama! I watched the theater and then went through the transcript in search of the most, well, Trumpian lines. And there were plenty. They're below -- in the order he said them.1. \"We're negotiating very long, very hard, but very quickly.\"Read MoreTrump is referring to trade here. And everyone knows the best kind of trade negotiating is the long, hard and quick kind. So say we all.2. \"They get together and they create a series of documents that nobody has been able to read because it was just done.\"On my third re-reading of this line, I am now pretty convinced Trump is talking about the legislative process that produced the omnibus. Still, \"a series of documents\" is a super weird way to refer to it.3. \"For the last eight years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security, hallowed our -- and they just -- if you look at what's taken out, they've hallowed our readiness as a military unit.\"The official White House transcript says \"hallowed.\" And he said \"hallowed.\" But, he had to mean \"hollowed,\" right? RIGHT?4. \"As crazy as it's been, as difficult as it's been, as much opposition to the military as we've had from the Democrats -- and it has been tremendous.\"This line deserves more attention than it will get. Trump is saying, flat out, that Democrats are opposed to the military.5. \"But we have tremendous opposition to creating, really, what will be the far -- by far, the strongest military that we've ever had. We've had that from the Democrats.\"Aaaaaaand, the classic Trump double down.6. \"There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill, but we were, in a sense, forced -- if we want to build our military -- we were forced to have.\"Kind of a backhanded compliment to the Republican leaders in the House and Senate who pushed this bad boy through, no?7. \"Nobody read it.\"Trump is 100% right on this front. The omnibus bill was filed Wednesday night and passed through the Senate minutes into Friday morning. It was 2,322 pages long.8. \"It became so big because we need to take care of our military, and because the Democrats, who don't believe in that, added things that they wanted in order to get their votes.\"So. The bill being so long is really bad. But, totally necessary because of the need to protect the military. And also because Democrats are, well, bad.9. \"We have to get rid of the filibuster rule.\"Mitch McConnell would like a word.10. \"We wanted to include DACA.\"Worth noting two things here. First, Trump is the one who ordered the end of DACA. Second, he did make a proposal to preserve the DACA program (and then some) in exchange for full funding for his border wall. 11. \"I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills.\"This will never happen. And that's the optimistic view. Because the Supreme Court has ruled that the line-item veto is unconstitutional.12. \"We have to get a lot of great legislation approved. And without the filibuster rule, it will happen just like magic.\"Like magic, you say?13. \"But national defense is a very important two words.\"Nailed it. Two words. For sure.14. \"You have to be able to see through the other side in order to see what's coming.\"So true. These opaque wall advocates are clueless!15. \"All records for defense.\" It's record-setting. I mean, the bill is bad. But still: records.16. \"We're spending a lot of money on nuclear -- our nuclear systems -- to upgrade and, in some cases, brand new, whether it's submarines -- nuclear submarines -- and others.\"My 6th grade English teacher just passed out.17. \"Total stealth. They're hard to find; they're hard to see. Therefore, they're hard to beat. It's very tough to beat a plane when you can't see it.\"Can't see it = can't beat it. Total. Stealth.18. \"The tanker aircraft is very important based on everything.\"[nods head knowingly] Yes, yes it is.19. \"We have a lot of offense that's been recently installed.\"The best defense is, of course, a good offense.20. \"You understand what that means; everybody does.\"[nods head warily]21. \"So when you look at all of these pages, a lot of that is devoted -- a lot -- to the military.\"But I thought the length of the bill was really bad?22. \"While we can be disappointed in some ways, we have to also know that there are a lot of strings pulling everybody in different directions.\"Many strings. Record numbers. Some of the best strings.23. \"It's a terrible problem, but this will be also -- this will be a record.\"He's talking here about money to deal with the problem of opioid addiction. But really he's talking about setting records.24. \"We looked at it to veto. I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about doing the veto.\"[narrator voice] He wasn't.25. \"I think the stock market is going to be great.\"Well, I'm convinced!26. \"And, look, it's time. It's time. \"Time to be done? OK!",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Fifteen years and a few days after the war began, the Iraq hawks are flying high again -- thanks mostly to President Donald Trump, who has called the invasion a mistake but on Thursday night made one of its leading proponents, John Bolton, his national security adviser.\n\nTrump couldn't have done it alone. His supporters on the right, along with the conservative \"Never Trump\" crowd, which never disowned Bolton's politics, get an assist here too. Same for the liberals who, in Trump opponents, reflexively see friends. Bush-era officials and commentators are increasingly cycling back into places of influence and power, in and outside government, sometimes as a top Trump White House officials and, in other cases, heroes in the \"resistance.\"The costs of the Iraq War are, by now, fairly well known, if not wholly understood. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis (some estimates put the number past a million), along with thousands of American service members were killed in the conflict. More will die as it rolls on into the second half of its second decade, with spin-offs like the deadly fight to bring down ISIS.Bolton, who takes over his new job next month, pushed for the initial invasion during his time, post-9/11, as President George W. Bush's under secretary of state for arms control and international security. After leaving the administration, he advocated for expanding the war into Iran and, in a 2015 interview, maintained that the 2011 decision to withdraw troops, made by President Barack Obama, was more damaging than the choice to send them there in the first place. Trump's choice to run the CIA, Gina Haspel, a longtime operative who ran a \"black site\" prison in Thailand in 2002 and later played a role in destroying taped evidence of agency interrogations, has also rattled cages in certain corners of Capitol Hill. Unlike Bolton, Haspel will face confirmation hearings -- giving senators a unique opportunity to pursue the truth in public. Read MoreWhat makes the current set of circumstances a little odd, if not shocking given his frequently bellicose pronouncements, is Trump's role in their revival. Had Jeb Bush been elected president in 2016 and made similar hires, there would have been criticism, for sure, but little surprise. Bush and his doomed campaign, during its short run, vigorously maintained the Republican Party line of the previous decade -- that his brother had \"kept us safe.\" He wasn't alone. It was always a weird claim to make, effectively setting aside the 9/11 attacks or implying that the clocks had been rewound to begin again the next day. In any event, the slain US troops never seemed to factor in, nor the tens of thousands of wounded.Trump, during the primary, hammered Bush over that characterization. On a debate stage in February 2016, the future president called the war \"a big, fat mistake\" and said the US invasion \"destabilized the Middle East.\" Trump also went where no GOP candidate, and most Democrats, dared not tread by challenging Bush administration apologists' argument that officials had not purposefully misled Americans but been led astray by \"faulty\" or bad intelligence.\"You call it whatever you want,\" Trump said, \"I want to tell you: They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.\"For all his conservative apostasies, Trump's attacks on the Bush family and the former president's security legacy were the one that Republican audiences, at least those who made it into the debates, were least likely to suffer. Trump was booed that night in South Carolina. But he didn't back off the argument, if only because it caused Jeb Bush, twisting and groaning all the way through, such clear discomfort. For some Republican voters, it was a catharsis. Others, like The Atlantic's David Frum, once a speechwriter for George W. Bush and promoter of the war, described the scene -- a rare public litigation of the Bush presidency -- as being like a drunken Thanksgiving, when \"the family members begin shouting what they really think of each other.\"\"Everything that was suppressed has been exposed, everything that went unsaid is being shouted aloud -- and all before a jeering live audience, as angry itself as any of the angry men on the platform,\" he wrote. Frum, like other Trump holdouts, excels at criticizing the President's table manners but tends to pull up short, for obvious reasons, when it comes to examining the roots of the politics that led to his rise and election.\n\nUS-UK intervention offered Iraq a better future. Whatever West's mistakes: sectarian war was a choice Iraqis made for themselves. -- David Frum (@davidfrum)\n\nJuly 6, 2016\n\nBut Bolton's return to prominence is not the sole province of Trump, his allies, and ideologically crosswise Republicans. When Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008, he made the decision not to insist on a reckoning over Iraq. The war was still going on, of course, and he was on the record for years voicing his opposition. An undertaking like that would've required expending untold political capital -- all he had and likely more.Bolton, of course, never questioned himself. He defended the war in Iraq and took every opportunity to make the case for opening new fronts, in countries like Iran and North Korea, always assuming in his plans would unfold precisely as he spelled them out.His elevation now, trading in a green room for the White House situation room, is an old kind of story. Consequences are conditional. This is a truism that transcends politics. For those perceived as talented, for the well-connected, there is always another angle -- or another job, someone willing to hire.If you're John Bolton, a slick talker and ardent ideologue who never concedes errors, the route back to prominence -- and power he could've only dreamed of 15 years ago -- is being traveled on the Trump Train. He isn't riding alone.",

Therefore, the agency is responsible for working with her to publish the details it can without risking classified operations -- a process others nominated for director have not had to go through in recent years.Following Trump's tweet, the agency has worked to quickly declassify bits and pieces about her career and personal life, passing them on to journalists, congressional overseers and, now, the public at large following the agency on social media: more than 2 million people on Twitter. Those details were largely the same as the ones delivered to Congress on Thursday, first reported by the Wall Street Journal and later CNN.Read MoreHaspel faces a tough fight to secure the nomination, with members of the Senate raising concerns over her involvement in the George W. Bush administration's controversial CIA detention and interrogation program.On Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein released a statement saying she saying she was \"very wary\" of Haspel.\"To promote someone so heavily involved in the torture program to the top position at the CIA, the agency responsible for one of the darkest chapters in our history, is a move that I'm very wary of,\" the California Democrat said in a statement.Feinstein's statement struck a markedly different tone than her initial comments praising Haspel's nomination.Also on Friday, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, sent Haspel a letter demanding she detail her role in detainee interrogations and the destruction of the CIA tapes, as well as asking whether she was ever \"in a position of authority to stop, or prevent the future employment of 'enhanced interrogation techniques.'\"Haspel is the first career CIA professional to be nominated as director in the social media age, after the agency joined Twitter and Facebook in 2014. There was no social media campaign when Pompeo was nominated, but the agency has regularly tweeted photos, videos and excerpts from conferences he has attended, television appearances he's made and statements he's issued.The effort to promote Haspel via social media represents a new approach, though the agency has fervently promoted photos of its canine recruits, or \"doggos,\" who were heavily covered in the press last September.\n\nCNN's Jeremy Herb and Barbara Starr contributed reporting",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Not to say TV loves the eccentric lives of billionaires, but two dramas about them will air opposite each other Sunday: \"Trust,\" an FX series that's the second iteration in the last four months of oil magnate J. Paul Getty's life; and \"Billions,\" the Showtime series about a hedge fund manager at war with New York's U.S. attorney.\n\nAlthough one show is based on fact and the other is reality-inspired fiction, they share a basic footprint in examining the corrupting influence of wealth, with \"Billions\" especially focused on the clash between private influence and those wielding public levers of power.Inevitably, \"Trust\" will be compared to \"All the Money in the World,\" the recent Ridley Scott movie about the kidnapping of Getty's grandson that became more memorable when Christopher Plummer was enlisted as a last-minute replacement for scandal-tarred Kevin Spacey.The series format, however, allows for a slow-motion look at the story that doesn't necessarily benefit the telling, examining what happened from a number of different characters' perspectives -- an idea that proves less enticing than that sounds.The first hour is considerably better than the next two, focusing on Getty, played with imperial splendor by Donald Sutherland. As the show begins, his son's suicide has left a void in Getty's succession plans, at the precise moment when grandson John Paul Getty III (Harris Dickinson) waltzes back into his life.Read More\" allowfullscreen>Mostly, Getty surrounds himself with hangers-on and sycophants, prodding what amounts to his royal court to debate who loves him the most. Getty, meanwhile, rages about his \"feckless progeny,\" especially compared to those bearing the names of other industrial titans, like Joe Kennedy.Unfortunately, \"Trust\" doesn't compound its interest over subsequent hours, which chronicle Paul's kidnapping, and the elder Getty -- unwilling to pay \"a single, solitary cent\" in ransom -- dispatching security chief Fletcher Chase (Brendan Fraser) to seek his release. Part of the problem involves having Fraser speak directly to the camera, perhaps intended to be more \"Fargo\"-esque, but which winds up feeling just plain goofy.\"Trust\" does boast a strong cast -- including Hilary Swank as Getty's daughter in law, little used in the early going -- and it's interesting to see how it differs from \"All the Money in the World.\" In tandem, they provide an example of how writers can work from the same basic set of facts and conjure two somewhat disparate treatments.Where \"Trust\" yields diminishing returns, \"Billions\" remains a shrewd investment, having ended its second season with a scintillating twist on the central cat-and-mouse game, and picking up pretty seamlessly where that left off.Without giving anything away, billionaire trader Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis) has been outmaneuvered by ambitious attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti), putting his company's future at risk. Still, Axelrod isn't lacking for resources, and despite having struck a blow against Axelrod -- at the expense of betraying those closest to him -- Rhoades isn't out of the woods either, with a shift in the regulatory climate among the potential challenges he faces.\" allowfullscreen>Once again, \"Billions\" distinguishes itself as an extremely smart, high-stakes chess match, where the principals play Monopoly with real buildings, and the combatants are so ruthlessly determined to win that they're blinded to, or simply ignore, the collateral damage.Both shows offer glimpses into lives of wealth and privilege, where money enables the principals to indulge their darkest fantasies but doesn't necessarily buy happiness or contentment.Even so, when it comes to dramatizing the lifestyles of the filthy rich, the one-two punch provided by \"Trust\" and \"Billions\" is a reminder that the ongoing fascination remains one of TV's most renewable resources.\"Trust\" and \"Billions\" season 3 premiere on March 25 at 10 p.m. on FX and Showtime, respectively.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)You know him as the face of CNN's morning lineup and Chris Cuomo, co-anchor of \"New Day,\" credits his fight for a \"good argument\" from his family.\n\nCuomo, the son of former New York governor, Mario Cuomo, and the brother of Andrew Cuomo, the current governor, spent much of his childhood moderating \"really hot and heavy discussions\" at the dinner table. \"It was great training for what I do now,\" Cuomo told David Axelrod on \"The Axe Files,\" a podcast from The University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. In the interview, Cuomo, 47, opened up about his relationship with his father, and how his upbringing in the shadows of politics shaped his career. \"I didn't know how much of who I am and what matters to me was tied to Pop, how reliant I was on him until he was gone,\" Cuomo said. Read MoreHere are four things we learned about Mario Cuomo from Chris Cuomo: 1. He embraced an underdog mentalityAs the son of Italian immigrants, Mario Cuomo, a first-generation American who grew up in Queens behind his family-run grocery store, was always worried about \"not being good enough.\" \"He was fired up by that, you know, that was his motivation. He was very much devoted to a feeling of being an underdog and less than, and he had contempt for people who thought he was less than,\" Cuomo said. The elder Cuomo lost his first few runs for public office in the 1970s, including a race for mayor of New York City in 1977. \"He was a fighter. He was an underdog and he believed in attacking the powerful. And that's really all you needed to know and you just have to understand how dedicated and active an opponent he would be,\" Chris Cuomo said. Mario Cuomo's big political break came in 1982 when, as New York's lieutenant governor, he won the Democratic nomination for Governor in an upset over New York Mayor Ed Koch. He went on to beat conservative millionaire Republican Lewis Lehrman.2. He did not want to be presidentMario Cuomo's keynote speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention speech brought him to national attention, and he was widely considered a front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president in both 1988 and 1992, but he declined to seek the nomination in both instances.\"Pop did not believe he should be President of the United States,\" Cuomo said, \"He made a very tortured argument about how 'I'm Governor and I can't do this job and that job at the same time,' but there was a facility to that argument that really betrayed the fact that the two things don't come together.\" Cuomo said \"maybe\" his father's immigrant mentality played a role in his decision to say no, but in the end, his father felt he was not a right fit for that level of office. \"It wasn't because he was Governor, it was because he didn't think he was good enough,\" Cuomo said. 3. He loved the law more than politicsMario Cuomo was also offered a seat to serve on the Supreme Court twice by President Bill Clinton but turned them both down. \"He loved the law a lot more than politics,\" Cuomo told Axelrod, \"His argument on that was you're only one of nine, you don't really get to lead as much and 'I could never speak about politics again and the way I want to,' and that was that.\" Cuomo revealed his father did give some serious thought to wanting to be on the Court of Appeals, the highest court in New York State.4. It was hard for him to get over his 1994 lossCuomo was defeated for a fourth term as governor by George Pataki in 1994, and subsequently retired from politics following that defeat. \"He lost in a race that he knew he was going to lose, that he knew he shouldn't have run,\" Cuomo told Axelrod. Cuomo acknowledged it took his father a while to get over the loss. \"It was devastating to him, that kind of rejection, where it mattered to him so much and he felt that that was his value in life,\" Cuomo said. NOTE: Chris Cuomo is set to take over CNN's 9pmET primetime slot on weeknights in the coming weeks.",

Marco Rubio, also of Florida, to introduce legislation that would encourage states to adopt \"red flag\" laws, which would give authorities power to seize guns from those who pose a threat to themselves or others.Rubio, who's been highly active in the gun debate since the Florida shooting, said Thursday at a news conference that his role is to legislate, rather than demonstrate.RELATED: 6 things Marco Rubio said at the CNN town hall that made news in the US gun debate\"I am a legislator,\" Rubio said. \"I pass public policy. Instead of marching, I should be acting, I should be passing laws,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean you can't also do a march. I know some legislators will do that. But that's what I've been focused on. That's what I'll continue to focus on. That's why we are here, to announce this, because when we get back this is going to be the one thing that I think we can do next.\"Republicans are largely keeping their distance from the rallies, though some are contributing in other ways. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who's in an extremely competitive district in Florida and who introduced a bill this week to raise the age requirement for rifles and shotguns, announced he's donating $2,500 to help pay for transportation for Parkland students to the march in Washington. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will also remain in Washington for the event Saturday, as well as dozens of other House Democrats, and several more will take part in events in their districts, according to her office. Pelosi encouraged members to wear orange at the rally -- a color affiliated with gun violence activism -- and change their social media profile photos to show the text #NeverAgain and #EndViolence.House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer will be in New Jersey for previously scheduled travel but his office said he plans to attend two sister events for \"March for Our Lives\" on Saturday while he's there.Meanwhile, close to a dozen Senate Democrats say they plan to be at the march in Washington or meet with students around the march. They include Nelson of Florida, Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Sens. Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan.And roughly 20 lawmakers have confirmed they're taking part in events or meeting with students in their home states on Saturday: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Sen Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, and Sen.

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin has spent the last six months attempting to do the impossible: find a solution inside the US Capitol to an immigration quagmire.\n\nStanding on a marble staircase just off the Senate floor, he lamented Thursday that one of his worst legislative fears had come true: after a brief shutdown over immigration, fits and starts of negotiations with the White House and more than one bipartisan bill, Congress would leave for the Easter recess without enshrining in law a program that has given individuals who entered the US illegally as children a chance to live, work and be educated in the United States without fear of deportation.\"We are one court decision away from hundreds of thousands of young people being deported,\" Durbin said on the floor as he attempted to force a vote on a bill to protect recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Donald Trump chose to end last year but is in limbo in the judicial system.The nuances, specificities, and friction points vary from issue to issue, but the ultimate reality is the same: While public support for fixing immigration and changing the country's gun control laws is high, members across the Capitol admit that Congress is unable -- and at times unwilling -- to lead social change. The body -- slow and precise -- doesn't act on moments of outrage, marches or walk outs. And while Congress was arguably not designed to react emotionally to the country's problems, the inaction on big-ticket items can give some constituents the impression that the Legislative Branch is not being responsive to its constituents. It instead waits, and at times, hopes, that the courts, the President and the state houses will do the work for them.Read More\"My philosophy is very simple,\" said Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia. \"Leaders must lead and we're not leading.\"But Trump also complained about how Congress operates Friday, as he signed a $1.3 trillion spending package.\"I looked very seriously at the veto,\" Trump said at the White House after signing the bill. \"I was thinking about doing the veto, but because of the incredible gains we've been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our thinking.\"Similarities between guns and immigrationImmigration wasn't the only thing left undone. Congress left Washington in the early hours of Friday morning with a long list of items left unfinished. Even their most basic role -- funding the government -- had taken the form of a monstrous $1.3 trillion spending package that they voted on just a little more than 24 hours after the 2,200-page bill was released.\"This whole budget process, it really is an embarrassment,\" Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy said. \"I've got a beagle and he drags stuff into the backyard every now and then and hides it under the porch. This looks like something my beagle's been keeping under the porch for about three days. It just makes no sense.\"Congress also left without passing legislation aimed at lowering health care insurance premiums after partisan disagreements over abortion-restriction language bogged down a near win. They also left without engaging in a serious floor debate on guns despite overwhelming public calls for one. Instead -- after a gunman in Parkland, Florida killed 17 people at a high school -- Congress agreed to tuck a few modest proposals inside the spending bill: funding school safety programs and giving state and federal agencies more money to enter data into the country's gun background checks system.If the country wanted a robust debate on guns, they got some behind-the-scenes negotiations, a side-effect members say of the tendency in Washington to legislate while always having one eye on the next election.\"We're much more risk averse than we have been in the past,\" Durbin said.It's not to say Congress does nothing every time. But, members lament -- despite some wins on banking legislation and sex trafficking in recent weeks -- Congress isn't in a position to tackle big problems -- at least on a bipartisan basis.On party line votes, Republicans have been able to accomplish goals. After failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last year, Republicans in the House and Senate passed a massive tax bill by Christmas that slashed the corporate tax rate, wiped out some loopholes and lowered taxes for many individuals, too. But those big-ticket items had to be done using an arcane process known as reconciliation, a kind of legislative short cut that allowed the Senate to pass the bill with just a simple majority instead of the usual 60 votes, meaning they didn't need a single Democratic vote.The Trump factorMembers have their own answers as to what is holding them back from sometimes even debating -- not to mention solving -- some of the country's most contentious issues. Members blame arcane Senate rules, leadership, polarization, fear, outside groups, long memories and short tempers.A spending bill was stalled in the Senate Thursday for hours, for example, because of a decades-old rivalry in Idaho where sitting senator Jim Risch, a Republican from Idaho, objected to a advancing a spending bill because it renamed a wilderness area for a late political rival.But members also blame Trump.\"It's tough. You just don't know where he's going to be. You don't know if you can rely on what you hear on one day. Is it going to change the next day? That makes it tougher,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona who will retire at the end of the year. \"Not all the blame is his, we can still bring these things up. ... My biggest gripe right now is that we defer too much to the President.\"Never was that clearer than on Friday morning when Trump left Capitol Hill scrambling after tweeting he was mulling vetoing the spending bill Congress had just stayed up late to pass the night before. He eventually signed the bill Friday afternoon.\n\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nBut Trump's inconsistencies are especially damaging for Congress when it comes to the social issues, the ones that are as much about cultural identity for Republican voters as they are about policy. On things like guns and immigration, it was always going to be Trump who could make the difference. He -- unlike no other lawmaker in Congress -- could stake out new positions and challenge traditional GOP orthodoxy, but he'd have to decide to spend some of his political capital as well as his time and focus.On guns, Democrats said the President had squandered an opportunity. Emerging from a bipartisan, televised meeting with Trump in February, they were downright elated. For one hour on live national television, Trump defied the National Rifle Association, called for expanding background checks, entertained Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein as she urged debate on an assault weapons ban, called out Republicans for cowering to the National Rifle Association and gave the House's Majority Whip Steve Scalise a dose of political reality that his idea to attach a background check fix bill to a conceal-carry reciprosity bill didn't stand a chance in the US Senate.Days and a few meetings with the NRA later, Trump stopped pushing so hard for those reforms.\"I'm frustrated, but not shocked,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut who has been a leader pushing for gun overhauls in Congress since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. \"It felt like the President was getting a little bit out far ahead of his skis in that meeting, and I didn't know walking out of that meeting that the NRA was coming in for another meeting, untelevised that night. That clearly changed the dynamic very quickly.\"Immigration solution continues to elude Congress On immigration, it's been a similar story.Trump ran on the promise of a deportation force and a Mexico-financed border wall. His base doesn't question his allegiance to the rule of law and they trust him in a way they never trusted President Barack Obama to secure the border. If anyone could give the Republican Party cover on immigration, it was Trump. Democrats had hoped that unique position would give Trump room to cut a deal on DACA. Instead, what they found was --in the words of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer -- working with Trump was like \"negotiating with Jell-O.\"\"I think there is a real fear amongst a large number of my Republican colleagues to cross the President, and yet the President's position on a lot of these issues is always a moving target,\" said Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner.Republicans blame Democrats for being intransigent and walking away from opportunities to add DACA into the spending bill, but Democrats say it's Trump they couldn't trust.Members on Capitol Hill often use shorthand to describe the two versions of Trump they know: \"Tuesday Trump\" vs \"Thursday Trump,\" a reference to two separate meetings Trump held with members of Congress in the span of a few short days back in January. In one, Trump signaled in a televised meeting an openness to finding resolution on DACA. In another, he privately rejected a bipartisan deal and referred to African countries as \"shitholes.\"RELATED: Did Trump say African countries were 'shitholes'? Here's a breakdown of conflicting memories of people in the meetingIn February, the administration rejected a second bipartisan attempt. This time, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell allowed the Senate to debate the issue. In the end, none of the proposals passed. The one with the most votes -- 54 -- included a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million DACA recipients in exchange for $25 billion in border security. It was cobbled together by a bipartisan group of lawmakers who'd negotiated the compromise over a hours-worth of meetings and Girl Scout cookies in Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins' office.Just hours after they announced it, the Trump administration blasted it with statements, tweets and an all-out campaign to stop it before it hit the floor.\"I think the administration lost a great opportunity to get wall funding, take care of the DACA recipients. They overreached and they lost so we're going to have another shot at this when the court rules, and if you overreach, you're going to lose,\" said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham.Immigration advocates like Juan Escalante, a DACA recipient and communications manager at America's Voice, said it's been hard to sit back and watch Congress wait for Trump while he waits anxiously to see if they'll be resolution.\"Unfortunately, the people who are elected to represent our interests were waiting for the President to tell them how to do their job,\" he said. Congress needs deadlinesIn the aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, the mood was different for a brief period on Capitol Hill. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, appeared on a CNN town hall and confessed he was rethinking past positions on guns. RELATED: 6 things Marco Rubio said at the CNN town hall that made news in the US gun debateRep. Brian Mast, a Republican from Florida, wrote an op-ed calling for a new ban on assault style weapons and Pat Toomey announced he was going to try and resurrect his legislation to expand background checks at gun shows and on internet sales. Trump was tweeting and demanding action from Congress daily. He wanted something and soon. But, even as thousands of students prepare to descend on Washington to march for changes to the country's gun laws this weekend, Congress has largely moved on.Public support is high, but most members haven't changed their minds. And unlike a spending bill you can fill with sweeteners to entice members to vote \"yes,\" there is no amount of money that will change decades-worth of identity politics overnight. There's no deadline forcing a vote any time soon and with an election looming, a debate carries more risks than it does a guarantee of substantive change.\"We had a DACA debate and we ended up with nothing to show for it,\" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said when asked why the Senate hadn't engaged in a robust floor debate on things like immigration and guns.An open debate would expose members on both sides of the aisle to tough, political votes just months before the midterm election.The Democratic Senate Whip Durbin told CNN that he believes the blame falls on both sides of the aisle when it comes to ducking.\"Particularly on the Republican side, If you tend to stray away from the party line, you could invite a very expensive primary,\" Durbin said. \"I haven't seen it as much on the Democrat side, but the fear of big money coming in and obliterating you has led many Democrats to try to avoid contentious debate or dangerous votes.\"On immigration, lawmakers told CNN that the courts have largely allowed Congress to stay silent on DACA since their last attempt. While tens of thousands of DACA recipients are left in limbo as they wait to see how their future unfolds, Congress has yet to feel the heat of the program actually ending.\"I don't know when we'll get\" a fix, Flake said. \"We just have to wait until the court rules and maybe that will force a deadline that forces us to come back, but without a deadline, it's tough to do. It's very difficult. It's difficult under the best of circumstances in an off (election) year.\"Members call for more votesMembers say if they could vote, they could tackle more.One of the leading complaints members expressed was that they don't vote. In part, in the Senate, voting takes time. Any one member can hold up and slow down the process.Floor time is precious and leaders aren't inclined to force votes that they don't already know stand a good chance of passing.Asked what he thought the problem was with Congress not being able to tackle major items very often, Kennedy, a senator who has only served just more than a year, said he thought the key obstacle was \"leadership on both sides of the aisle not letting senators be senators.\"\"I think leadership has the best of intentions. They do want to protect us, but we're all big boys and girls. We don't need protecting. I think most people would like to go back to having unlimited amendments and having a full discussion,\" Kennedy said. \"I know it will change some votes. Maybe not on the gut check issues, but on some of the nuances of it, It will change some votes.\"\"Even though my mind is made up on the assault weapons ban, I think most thinking people constantly test their assumptions against the arguments of their critics. I'm going to sit there and listen. I (probably) won't change my mind today, (probably) won't ever change my mind, but it's sure going to give me something to think about,\" Kennedy said.In the House, there are many more votes than in the Senate. But, some Republicans in swing districts, say they'd like to spend more time on some of the hot-button social issues to distinguish themselves from their party. Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania, says he'd be ready to engage in a gun debate on the House floor.\"The absence of those votes means that Democrats can paint me as conservative as some of my colleagues who would vote not support a bill I would like a DACA bill or some gun safety bills I would support,\" Costello said.But Costello doesn't blame leadership.\"I don't point the finger at the Speaker at all,\" Costello said. \"When we have messaging votes around here, everybody bitches about it and then when we don't have messaging votes, some people wish they did.\"But voting on even the most basic functions of government present loads of obstacles. The Senate's vote on their spending bill underscored just how intensive the process is.Before the votes on the omnibus, Sen. Bob Corker blasted the process that brought Congress to yet another early morning vote, calling it \"ridiculous\" and \"juvenile\". He berated the leadership for forcing a vote well after 10 p.m. ET at night.On the floor, before all of his colleagues, he demanded McConnell tell him what the hold up was.McConnell had spent most of his day trying to talk Risch and GOP Sen. Rand Paul out of delaying the bill and forcing the Senate to burn more than 30 hours debating a bill that everyone knew would pass anyway. This wasn't a politically contentious vote. This was a spending bill.\"My good friend from Tennessee knows that my principal responsibility is begging, pleading and cajoling, and I've been in continuous discussions, shall I say, with some of our members who are legitimately unhappy about one aspect or another, and spent a lot of time thinking over whether or not they wanted to expedite the process, and I must say after a long and intense day of such discussions with several of our members who had legitimate concerns, I'm relieved rather than depressed that we might be able to actually finish tonight,\" McConnell said.The most recent spending deal goes through September meaning Congress will have to do this again this again, a fact Trump used as a warning for the Hill.\"I said to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again.\"\n\nCNN's Ted Barrett, Phil Mattingly, Kristin Wilson and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.",

                "body": "Josh Campbell is a CNN law enforcement analyst, providing insight on crime, justice and national security issues. He previously served as a supervisory special agent with the FBI. Follow him on Twitter at @joshscampbell. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN)\"Steady and relax,\" I whispered as my cheek fused to the stock of my .22-caliber rifle, waiting for the shot to break and launch a round at 1,800 feet per second toward the paper target downrange.\n\nThis would be merely one of thousands of rounds I fired in youth shooting-club practices and competitions while growing up in rural Texas. While some kids spent the majority of their extracurricular time on the ball field or practicing music, my interest was firearms. If mastering challenges makes us better people, my formative years on the shooting range taught me countless lessons in self-control as I steadied a rifle, arrested my anxiety through controlled breathing and worked toward the goal of mechanical precision, round after round. Replicating that proficiency over and over was tangible evidence I was good at something. In shooting sports, as in life, one can always improve. When I started as a special agent trainee at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, I was once again reminded that learning is a lifetime endeavor. As I stood on the firing line, day in and day out, flanked by two hotshots who never seemed to miss their targets, I felt that same positive competitive spirit I had when I was a kid, and was again reminded how influential firearms had been in shaping and improving my character. Although I don't remember ever formally signing up to be a junior member of the National Rifle Association -- perhaps it was included in my shooting club membership -- I do remember receiving membership literature in the mail and proudly telling my friends. To me and my fellow shooting club members, the NRA represented a bond shared by firearms enthusiasts who appreciated responsible gun ownership.Read MoreBut it was never political. Today's NRA is simply unrecognizable from the days of the 1990s. If you were to ask me then -- when I was showing off my membership card -- if I could have predicted a day when the organization would find itself at odds with the friends and family members of shooting victims, I would have responded to the question with sheer bewilderment. Never would I have predicted seeing the NRA's chief spokesperson sickly accuse the press of loving mass shootings. What exactly happened to the organization? How did a group originally founded by responsible gun owners to promote marksmanship evolve into an entrenched political faction picking fights with high school students? I suspect that somewhere along the way the NRA was corrupted by political operatives who recognized the electoral benefits of peddling fear to its members. Although a sinister calculation, think of the political and financial benefits the organization would reap if it succeeded in convincing its members that they were under attack by a government seeking to rob them of their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Get like-minded leaders elected, and you ensure your continued existence. Convince members they are perpetually under the threat of physical attack -- which can only be countered with a gun -- and their fears will never subside. Although many have focused on NRA political contributions as proof of a corrupting influence, I think our primary focus should be less on donations to individual elected officials, and more on the organization's larger efforts to brainwash its members into voting en masse against candidates who support responsible gun reform.As Vox recently reported, while gun reform groups have often focused on matching the NRA's mammoth fundraising efforts, the larger threat the organization poses is actually its ability to mobilize voters. One tactic the organization uses to foment anxiety within its ranks is to perpetuate the notion that the government is attempting to seize the weapons of law-abiding citizens, and so any compromise would represent a slippery slope toward a total ban on firearms. For proof of the lucrative effect of fearmongering, look no further than the historical spike in gun sales after mass shootings, which I believe can only be explained by efforts of groups like the NRA to instill fear in their members to stock up on guns now before the government regulates them out of existence. Another favorite NRA technique is the \"whataboutism,\" usually reserved for conversations about the actions of Russian intelligence servicesSure, the San Bernardino attack involved a firearm, but what about the attackers' radical terrorist motivations? OK, so the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooter had an assault rifle, but what about the fact authorities may have failed to properly investigate him? These somersaults of logic and linguistics are creative, but they fail to admit that the common denominator in gun violence is the gun. Just as important as identifying how the NRA operates is focusing on the reason it engages in these tactics. The question NRA members should ask themselves is whether the organization exists to serve the interests of gun owners, or simply those of gun manufacturers.If the latter, the public would be right to watch the organization's efforts with suspicion and to be on guard for manipulation. As long as the organization continues to receive revenue from the sale of some gun purchases, it will be tough to convince a skeptical public of its purity. Fortunately, there is an antidote to the fearmongering: it is the hope generated in the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida, shooting by the thousands of students and responsible gun reform supporters who have determined enough is enough and the time for real action is now. These students have inspired a wave of public support and give many of us hope that we can agree on ridding our streets and schools of weapons of war without threatening our Second Amendment rights. For its part, the NRA can either get onboard, stop its vicious attacks on those working to save lives, and return to its roots, or it will find itself even further along the road to becoming a relic its former members once celebrated. Contrary to the NRA's current narrative, the path to sensible gun reform isn't a slippery slope, it's simply uncharted terrain. And with support from those around us, we can all take a step in the right direction without falling down.",

                "title": "Why you'll see a lot of 'evil eye' gloves at the March For Our Lives",
                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)When the March for Our Lives fills cities around the country this weekend, keep your eyes peeled for, well, eyes.\n\n\"Evil eyes\" are set to be a big symbol of the march, similar to the way pink pussy hats represented the Women's March last year. They're mostly expected to turn up on gloves, but watch for them on signs, t-shirts and in other forms. There's a seriously strong connection between \"evil eye\" gloves and pussy hats, and there's plenty of history and tradition behind the symbolism of the evil eye that can give some context to its newest role. They were started by the same woman who helped create 'Pussy Hats'Krista Suh is a feminist, crafter and activist who was one of the women behind the pussy hats that bedecked thousands of heads and became a cozy, yet powerful, symbol of resistance.Read MoreThe evil eye gloves are her idea, too. \"It came to me in a dream, just minutes before waking up - I had a dream of a protest, a huge peaceful crowd with their hands outstretched toward the sky -- each palm had a huge EYE drawn on it,\" she wrote on her blog. \"It was a Sea of Eyes.\"Suh explains that the vision stuck with her, and when the March For Our Lives began to take root, she knew her vision had a purpose. She asked fellow crafters and #NeverAgain activists to participate by knitting or making eye gloves, or donating towards the march's cause. Why eyes? \"Congress needs to know that the people are watching,\" Suh wrote. People have donated hundreds of pairs to the cause Suh and others who knit, sew, crochet or otherwise use their skills to produce things for causes call it \"craftivism,\" and it's not just about making cozy hats or gloves. When the pussy hat idea was being shared around social media before the Women's March, Suh's friend and fellow pussy hat creator Jayna Zweiman told CNN people used the concept to share their stories of sexual assault, to encourage survivors and activists, and to generally foster an idea of community and solidarity.So, to those who practice craftivism, making evil eye gloves is partially about the vision, but it's also about connecting with others who feel similarly moved and want to make a difference. To that end, Suh asked people on her website to make a pledge -- either to knit a pair to donate or wear, or donate to the March for Our Lives cause. On Suh's website, her original request for 438 pairs of gloves (to represent a statistic that claims 438 people killed or injured in school shootings since 2014) has been greatly exceeded. The pledge count now stands at more than 1,000 pairs, coming from all over the world.Patterns for the evil eye gloves are going around the internet, and some organizations have offered workshops and events for people to get together and create their own. Inevitably, the highly recognizable and replicable symbol has inspired some more consumerist urges, too. Suggestions for other evil eye paraphernalia abound on lifestyle sites and Pinterest boards, and evil eye gloves are currently a hot item on Etsy, sometimes selling for $30 or more. The 'evil eye' isn't necessarily evil Obviously, the evil eye has been around way longer -- millennia longer -- than the March For Our Lives. And while it may make an impact as a piece of modern activism, it's important to be aware of the ancient meanings and spiritual significance it holds. In Mediterranean and Western Asian cultures, the evil eye can be a source of malice and malady, maybe even a curse of sorts. It's sometimes religious, since the lore of the evil eye has threads in Christian, Jewish and Islamic literature, but it can also have more secular and generally spiritual connotations. So if the eye is evil, why do people wear it? Generally, actually wearing the evil eye as a talisman is thought to bring protection against its dangers. So when it is applied to something like the March For Our Lives, it is more than simply a symbol that someone is being watched. When worn, it can be protection for the wearer. When deployed as a symbol of change, resistance or dissatisfaction, it can be seen as a warning. An evil eye on a hand is already a very specific symbol Interestingly enough, an evil eye on a hand, like the evil eye gloves appear when worn, is its own ancient symbol. Often called the Hamsa hand or the Hand of the Goddess, it is a symbol of protection against the evil eye. It's a fairly trendy icon, so you've probably seen this symbol on jewelry or clothing. Since it represents a female entity protecting people from harm, many Women's March and March For Our Lives Activists may find the way it is represented on evil eye gloves to be particularly poetic.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)President Donald Trump argued Friday that Democrats have stood in the way of DACA recipients gaining permanent legal status, while casting Republicans as would-be saviors.\n\n\"The Republicans are with you, they want to get your situation taken care of,\" Trump said at the White House, as he complained about the $1.3 trillion spending bill program, speaking directly to recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \"The Democrats fought us, they just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill.\"But as Congress left town increasingly unlikely to pass any major immigration legislation before November's midterms, the White House has repeatedly rejected deals to fix DACA, the Obama-era policy he ended then implored Congress to save.Here's a timeline of DACA under Trump: September 5, 2017: Trump announced an end to the DACA program, which protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation. President Barack Obama instituted the work permits and protections in 2012. Read MoreSeptember 13: Trump has dinner with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi at the White House, after which the two Democrats say they agreed in broad strokes to a DACA-border security deal that doesn't include Trump's wall. Trump initially seems on the same page, then the White House and Republicans walk it back. Trump tweets about how \"good, educated and accomplished\" DACA recipients are.October 8: The White House unveils what it calls its priorities for a DACA deal, a laundry list of aggressive conservative immigration measures that Democrats and a handful of Republicans rejected as rife with poison pills. November 1: After a terrorist attack in New York City, Trump begins to emphasize ending the diversity visa lottery and family-based migration. November 2: Republican lawmakers meet with Trump at the White House and rule out attaching any DACA deal to year-end funding bill before a possible shutdown.December 21: Lawmakers pass government funding into the new year and leave town without a deal, despite Democrats' previous pledges to not go home without one. January 9: Trump holds bipartisan meeting at the White House that cameras televise for nearly an hour. He indicates multiple times he is willing to compromise on DACA, despite some contradictions within the meetings, and says \"when this group comes back -- hopefully with an agreement -- this group and others from the Senate, from the House, comes back with an agreement, I'm signing it.\" The so-called \"four pillars\" also come out of this meeting -- that a deal shall include DACA, family-based migration, the diversity lottery and border security.January 9: Federal court puts hold on Trump's plan to end DACA, ordering renewals of permits to continue but no new applications.January 11: After months of meetings, Democrat Dick Durbin and Republican Lindsey Graham go to the White House to propose to Trump a compromise worked out by their group of six bipartisan senators.

Publicly, the White House says they oppose a temporary fix. March 22: Congress passes an omnibus without DACA, virtually ensuring it will not be addressed before midterms. March 23: Trump signs the omnibus, rails on Democrats for, he says, not caring about DACA.\n\nCNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Thousands of people marched in cities across Poland on Friday in demonstrations against plans to tighten the country's already restrictive abortion laws.\n\nProtesters in Warsaw, many dressed in black, gathered outside parliament before marching through the capital to the headquarters of the ruling right-wing Law and Jusice (PiS) party, which is attempting to enact a staunchly anti-abortion bill for the second time in less than two years. Poland is home to the toughest abortion laws in Europe. The procedure is only legal in three cases: if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or if it endangers the life of the mother, or if the fetus is damaged. It is this third reason -- the most commonly cited -- that is the target of the latest proposals.In 2016, urged on by Catholic groups, PiS lawmakers attempted to impose a total ban on abortion. But the law, which threatened to imprison women seeking the procedure, and any doctor who performed it, was scrapped after tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest. The same women's groups that rallied then were back out in force on Friday, protesting as lawmakers debated the revised bill entitled \"Stop Abortion.\"Read MoreCrowds in Warsaw were scattered with placards reading: \"Girl Power,\" \"My body, my choice,\" and \"#CzarnyPiątek\" -- the hashtag for the movement: \"Black Friday.\"Over 200 nongovernmental organizations signed a public appeal to Polish lawmakers to reject the bill that they say \"will place women's health and lives at risk and violate Poland's international human rights obligations.\" \"If adopted, this legislation will further limit the already restricted grounds on which women can lawfully access abortion in Poland,\" the letter read.The Council of Europe's human rights commissioner Nils Muiznieks issued a similar warning to Warsaw on Friday.Lawmaker Kaja Godek, a member of the committee that spearheaded the bill, claims that the legislation would halt abortions for malformed fetuses, and \"represent the lives of three human beings every day,\" Agence France-Presse reported.Now, she wants doctors to stop prenatal screening to prevent what she calls \"eugenic abortion.\" \"The original idea behind prenatal tests has been completely distorted,\" she told lawmakers in January. \"Instead of treating and preparing parents and doctors to receive a child and help him, it makes it easier to choose extermination.\" More than 96% of Poles identify as Catholic and the issue of abortion is tied not only to religion and the country's resurgent nationalist politics, but also to its history as a formerly communist country. \"Under communism, due to a lack of access to contraception, abortion was widely practiced in Poland as a real means of contraception,\" said women's rights activist and former politician Barbara Nowacka. \"After the fall of communism, the law was tightened and now we face even more draconian measures.\" Critics of the bill, like Nowacka, are concerned what the bill will mean for women in Poland, many of whom are already traveling elsewhere in Europe for abortions.\"The underground will grow,\" she told CNN from her office in Warsaw. \"Abortion tourism. Women traveling to Czech Republic, Germany, UK and Ukraine, will grow again.\"\n\nAtika Shubert and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsStudy suggests the Maya were trading dogs in 400 BC from Ceibal in GuatemalaResearch also suggests they kept wild cats in captivityIt is the earliest evidence for animal management and trade in Mesoamerica\n\n(CNN)The Maya, a civilization that thrived in central America for almost two millennia, were skilled farmers, famed for developing highly technical irrigation systems, managing the tropical climate, and cultivating protein-heavy crops to feed their dense urban populations.\n\nBut they did not stop at squash, beans and maize. A new chemical analysis of animal bones found in a 3,000-year-old city in modern-day Guatemala provides the earliest picture yet of how the Mesoamerican civilization -- that stretched across Mexico, Guatemala and Belize and peaked between 250 and 900 AD -- bred and traded dogs, and may even have raised some for ceremonial purposes.It suggests that the Maya in the city of Ceibal kept big cats in captivity, and not only ate dogs but also transported them long distances as early as 400 BC. Read: Hidden tunnel could lead to Mayan 'entrance to the underworld'\"With Ancient Rome, Mesopotamia and China, we know that to build up their big civilizations they were moving animals around all the time, and it was part of their economic system,\" Ashley Sharpe, an archeologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute who led the research, tells CNN. Read More\"What I was trying to do was see how the Maya were using the dogs, and see if it was similar to how other big civilizations were managing animals.\"Bone analysisThe study, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed the bones of a number of species found at Ceibal, including deer, opossums, turkeys, tapirs, wild cats and dogs. High levels of carbon and nitrogen isotopes were found in the bone collagen of the dogs, turkeys and one of the wild cats, suggesting they ate mostly maize, and were therefore fed by humans. Almost all of the dogs at Ceibal were found to have died when they were about a year old. This is the typical slaughter age for most animals, and teamed with previous research indicating that the Maya ate dogs, it suggests a sophisticated system of meat management. Read: 1,500-year-old ruins shed light on Peru's mysterious Moche peopleDog breedsThe dog bones also indicate different breeds were present, and though Sharpe says the next step will be DNA analysis to determine how they looked, the current research confirms that breeds were used for different purposes. Some were eaten, whilst others were used as pets or for hunting.Read: Scientists unravel the mystery of the Roman 'gate to hell'Elizabeth Graham, a professor of Mesoamerican Archeology at University College London, considers this one of the study's most significant discoveries: \"that there are two kinds of dog,\" she says, \"the dog that's your pet, that you hunt with, that has fur, and the dogs that were fed maize and were hairless -- the ones that were raised for food.\" Maya ritualsSharpe says the study suggests that there was also a third, ceremonial purpose. Two of the dogs tested were found to be imported from the Guatemalan highlands, roughly 100 miles away. Unlike the local dogs, Sharpe says they were relatively old when they died, as their teeth were worn down and their bones had fused. They were buried in the city's ceremonial core, suggesting they might have been part of Mayan rituals. The same goes for the bones of a large cat, most probably a jaguar, discovered in Ceibal. \"It was fully grown, and from the isotopes it looks like it has eaten corn its whole life,\" says Sharpe. Since most wild cats do not eat corn naturally, it is likely it was being fed by humans, and therefore kept in captivity, she says. This assessment ties in with Mayan art, which often depicts kings holding jaguars or feline cubs.Graham agrees there is little doubt the Maya used jaguars for ceremonial purposes, but she is skeptical of the suggestion that dogs were used in rituals. There is little record of dogs in a ceremonial context, she says, besides feasting. Read: Ancient Greek masterpiece etched on a tiny gemstoneGraham's first thought was that dogs were transported to Ceibal from afar for breeding purposes -- because they required \"a dog that was good for breeding fat dogs,\" she says, adding that the burial location may just have been circumstance. \"The rulers all wore jaguar skins, there were jaguar skins on thrones, but I don't think anybody used a dog skin,\" says Graham.",

Circulating strains this season, which began in October, were a mix of A viruses (H3N2 and H1N1) and B viruses. Flu is a contagious respiratory illness with mild to severe symptoms that can sometimes lead to death. Generally, the H3N2 strain leads to more severe illness and more hospitalizations than B strains, according to the CDC.Yet parents might want to continue their vigilance with regard to younger children, CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund suggested.Read More\"We know that illness associated with influenza B can be just as severe as illness associated with influenza A,\" Nordlund said. \"We also know that influenza B tends to be more severe for younger children.\"The CDC recommends flu shots for the unvaccinated while strains continue to circulate. It is possible for people who've been sick with one strain of the flu to get a different strain in the same season.Though flu activity is declining, this second wave of influenza B cases is not unexpected, Nordlund said. \"We often see a wave of influenza B during seasons when influenza A H3N2 was the predominant virus earlier in the season. Unfortunately, we don't know what the influenza B wave will look like.\"We may see a smaller second wave of B than in past seasons, but \"we won't know until we have more data,\" Nordlund said. During the 11th week of the year, the overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive in laboratories decreased compared with last week. Still, for the week, 4,759 specimens tested positive for flu, bringing the season's total to 246,766 positive specimens.The CDC reported five additional flu-related pediatric deaths during week 11. In the 2017-18 season, 133 children have died.Among adults, 7.8% of all deaths reported for the week were pneumonia- and flu-related, the CDC reported, noting that these data are always two weeks delayed. This rate is only slightly higher than the 7.4% threshold that had been anticipated for the week.Nationwide, 2.7% of patients visiting their doctors complained of flu-like illness during week 11, just 0.5% higher than expected. The overall hospitalization rate for the season is now 93.5 per 100,000 population. Among 26,694 total hospitalizations reported, nearly 78% were associated with influenza A virus.",

I didn't even know what I was saying,\" the woman in the videos told Politico in a report Friday. \"I'm sorry ...

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsA provision in the instructions with the latest spending bill may open the door to gun researchSome advocates for gun research are optimistic, others skeptical\n\n(CNN)The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be back in the gun violence research business.\n\nThe agency mostly avoids the topic and has for the past two decades -- despite experts labeling gun violence a public health crisis. The potential for change comes in the form of a short sentence in the 152-page instructions accompanying the bipartisan omnibus spending bill that both houses of Congress passed this week. President Trump said he will sign it, sources said. On page 23, the instructions say, \"While appropriations language prohibits the CDC and other agencies from using appropriated funding to advocate or promote gun control, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has stated the CDC has the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun violence.\"It doesn't sound like much, and there is no money specifically budgeted for the research, but some experts say that even baby steps matter in this area. The \"injury prevention and control\" section of the bill describing funds for the Department of Health and Human Services states that nearly $650 million should fund programs in this area, more than double the current level of funding. However, more than $475.5 million of that should be dedicated to evidence-based opioid drug overdose prevention programs, it stipulates, and some will have to be spent researching traumatic brain injury, domestic violence and other programs. Read MoreSo will the new language drive the CDC to research gun violence? The agency \"awaits further guidance and direction from Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services,\" said spokeswoman Courtney Lenard of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Public gun violence research: A quick historyFor more than two decades, the agency has been gun-shy on gun research because of its interpretation of the Dickey Amendment. The amendment was part of the 1996 federal spending bill, added after significant NRA lobbying in the wake of a 1993 CDC-funded study that found having a gun in a home was associated with an increased risk of homicide in that home. The amendment doesn't explicitly ban federal research funds, but it says \"none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.\" The amendment had a chilling effect. Congress quickly reallocated the $2.6 million that had been set aside for firearms research to traumatic brain injury research. Much of the other government funding dried up. And private funding dwindled as well, studies showed. A study last year in the medical journal JAMA found that in relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the least-researched cause of death and the second-least funded cause of death, after falls. After the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre, President Barack Obama signed an executive order directing the CDC to do more gun research, but no significant research came out of it, according to experts.After the shootings at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in February, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was asked at a congressional hearing whether his agency would conduct more gun violence research. Azar replied that he did not interpret the Dickey Amendment as restricting gun research. \"My understanding is that the rider does not in any way impede our research mission. It is simply about advocacy,\" he said.When pressed on whether his agency would \"be proactive\" on gun research, Azar responded, \"we certainly will.\"Gun research advocates' reactionsOn the surface, the sentence in the new spending bill seems to reflect this change. Some who have advocated Congress for more gun research are cautiously optimistic and others cynical.\"I don't see how or why this changes anything, so I don't think it will make any difference at all,\" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"I would love to be proven wrong in this assessment.\" He added that this is not something that only the CDC should be doing; the National Institutes of Health should also be doing gun violence research, he said, but it does not. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-New Jersey, said, \"Last year, we saw two of the five deadliest shootings in the history of the United States. Children are being killed at schools, in churches, at concerts and on streets all across America. It's a big deal that, just this week, Republicans are finally allowing the CDC to research the causes of gun violence.\"It's a sign that the efforts of the brave students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas are having a profound impact on our national dialogue,\" he said. \"These students have shown more courage against the NRA than Republican-led Congresses have shown in 25 years. I think the tide is finally turning against the gun lobby.\"Rep. Alcee Hastings, a Democrat from Florida who has also advocated for gun control efforts, is concerned that the language doesn't go far enough.\"While I am hopeful that the language in the Omnibus will encourage the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to conduct research into the gun violence epidemic, the language is tepid and may perpetuate the chilling effect that the so-called Dickey Amendment has had on gun violence research since 1996. Congress must make it explicitly clear to the CDC that they may engage in this research and that they ought to start without delay,\" Hastings said in a statement. He added that Congress needs to put money behind it, or else \"telling the CDC they can proceed with their research is nothing more than lip service.\" Gun policy expert Daniel Webster is also concerned. \"I view the recent development as a cynical nod to critics of who want CDC to fund gun-related research while inserting language into the spending bill that is actually more restrictive than what the current law says,\" Webster, the Bloomberg Professor of American Health at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email. He says that although the spending bill includes funds to extend the CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System to all 50 states, it does not address some of the biggest research gaps.He's also concerned that the language adds limits on the CDC that mean it could only research the causes of gun violence. \"Funding could not examine solutions, especially no solution that threatens the status quo on gun commerce and ownership.\" Hemenway's concern is more general: \"I'm afraid this is doing nothing and pretending to do something so they can claim they are doing something when they are really doing nothing.\"Talk is cheap. What is their actions? Did they put money in the CDC budget for firearms research? Did they put money into (the National Institutes of Health) budget for research? Did they abolish the Dickey Amendment? No. No. No. No. No.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nNic Robertson is CNN's international diplomatic editor. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\nA senior member of the Saudi royal family recently told me that word around the royal palaces is that President Trump pays attention when business is in the offing.The full impact of what he meant has only just started to sink in.Certainly it was clear last May during Trump's inaugural overseas trip to Riyadh, where he proudly announced huge arms deals worth more than $100 billion.The message was clear: a boon for the US economy and the President delivering on his campaign promise to bring jobs to America.His communications team said there would be tens of thousands of jobs created, thanks to the signatures Trump was collecting from the Saudi leadership.Read MoreThis week, Saudi Arabia's leader-in-waiting, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, paid Trump a return visit, with the President once again reeling off the list of deals they're doing.Sitting side by side with the Crown Prince in the Oval Office, Trump wielded a huge check.\"$3 billion ... $533 million ... $525 million ... that's peanuts for you,\" he said looking at MBS. The Crown Prince was grinning and shaking his head. Trump continued: \"$880 million ... $645 million ... $6 billion ... that's for frigates.\" This is the Trump-only show Rebranding Autocrats Anonymous By the time Trump got to HIS second card, MBS was looking quite uncomfortable.Trump continued reeling off a laundry list of arms sales, claiming that all these deals meant \"over 40,000 jobs,\" before tantalizingly touting deals next worth $700 billion next year.Later, a source with knowledge of the meeting told me MBS felt humiliated by Trump. MBS, he said, wasn't expecting to have the huge cards, detailing billions of dollars of business deals dangled under his nose. It's not the publicity he came to Washington to get.His public DC pitch is all about how he is changing Saudi Arabia, turning it into a more palatable ally, reforming Saudi society for the better, empowering women, employing the country's youth, making it an easier place to do business and weaning it off hydrocarbons.His visit to London two weeks ago was a trial run for his DC trip. According to a source familiar with the trip, about $1.4 million was spent on advertisements, on billboards in London, proclaiming \"He [MBS] is opening Saudi Arabia to the world.\" The message: at 32 MBS is young and in a hurry.Saudi officials I've met who work with him describe him as a human dynamo, consuming spreadsheets and Powerpoints, spitting facts and figures, setting a high bar for everyone in his employment and expecting results pronto.On his DC agenda is thrusting Saudi out of hydrocarbon dependency and fast-forwarding it to a nuclear-powered future. He wants US nuclear power plants and a generation of engineers and technicians educated to run them.It is part of his much-hyped 2030 vision for the renewal of the desert Kingdom.However, his public relations blitz in London and DC is not sticking the way he might hope. He is dogged, not just by Saudi's past, but also by its present.Questions asked in the UK Parliament highlighted how far he still has to go to clean Saudi's image.Opposition MP's questioned whether the government should be hosting MBS, considering his and Saudi Arabia's role in the war in Yemen.So to have Trump reel off the latest additions to the desert Kingdom's weapons arsenal is to annihilate MBS's carefully curated narrative of a country under change for good, instead casting him as an old-style leader, capable of flexing his military muscle.But there are a raft of other reasons MBS isn't shedding Saudi's old image of a cultural backwater, typified by a society stuck in outdated attitudes and practices governed by mega-rich princes.His recent corruption crackdown, jailing royals and business leaders in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, is the most glaring.Officials say the exercise stuffed the Saudi coffers with about $100 billion of looted state monies, but nevertheless, it was widely interpreted as MBS consolidating power. The sudden incarcerations -- which included the unexplained death of one detainee -- unnerved potential investors, the very people the shiny, new Saudi image is supposed to entice.After he is done in DC, MBS will go on a week-long US tour, meeting business leaders trying to put the sparkle back on the high-priced PR sheen he's paid for.But before he leaves the nation's capital and the world's most powerful man, there will be one conversation he is sure to have with Trump: what to do about Iran.Beyond doubt, MBS and most Saudis like Trump's anti-Iranian rhetoric. For them, he is an American President who is much more in tune with their interests than President Obama was. Both leaders read Iran's actions in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and beyond as a threat to regional stability. Both have talked openly about curbing Iran's growing military clout.Trump's dislike for the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran aligns neatly with MBS's views.In a recent interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" MBS said that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia will want one too.His brother, Khalid bin Salman, his Ambassador to DC, had this on-air conversation with Wolf Blitzer earlier in the week, raising questions about what Saudi may do with the nuclear technology it wants.Salman: \"We think the deal [JCPOA] needs to be fixed. We are on autopilot headed toward a mountain. We need to fix the deal now, not to face the consequences later.\" Blitzer: \"The Crown Prince says Saudi Arabia doesn't want to develop nuclear weapons, but it would if the Iranians achieved that. Explain your position on that.\"Salman: \"We'll do whatever it takes to protect our citizens, our people and our country. \" MBS and his brother may be getting closer to what they want on Iran. This week Trump fired his Secretary of State, who had become a brake on the President's impulse to exit the Iran deal.But a new wrinkle in the Saudi-US relationship could be emerging, one that if true could dent MBS's desire for an image makeover more than Yemen, more perhaps even than 9/11.An article in the New York Times detailed an investigation suggesting that Saudi Arabia sought to buy influence at the White House.If true it would be illegal, and so far the White House has yet to comment.It's caused me to reconsider precisely what the senior Saudi royal meant when he told me about their read of Trump. Did he really mean that in Trump, they saw a President willing to barter US foreign policy for a few bucks -- potentially at the cost of US national security interests?",

                "body": "Football's first 'Raumdeuter': The making of Thomas Mueller\n\nBy Matias Grez, CNN\n\nUpdated 2031 GMT (0431 HKT) March 13, 2018\n\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Thomas Mueller's style of play was considered so unorthodox, the German footballer coined a new word to describe it: \"Raumdeuter.\"\n\nNot long after the 2010 World Cup, when asked in an interview how he would best explain his position and role on the pitch, Mueller's reply was simple and concise.Roughly translating as \"space investigator,\" it attempts to capture the sometimes intangible qualities Mueller brings to Bayern Munich and the German national team.Not blessed with blistering pace or explosive power, two traits often deemed essential in the modern game, Mueller's advantage comes from intelligence and movement, exploiting spaces most players don't even see.\"I'm a player that makes many runs off the ball, hurting the opponent's defense,\" Mueller tells Copa90. Read More\"Football is always a mix between pass play and run play, you've got to make intelligent runs without getting impatient and, of course, always work on the finish during practice.\"READ: Leading TV football pundit suspended for spitting at fansREAD: Greek league suspended after PAOK club president invades pitch with gunBeginningsWhen Mueller was 10 years old, Bayern Munich held a tournament called the Mercure Cup in the vicinity of the city, searching for talented kids in the area.A scout from the club was there to watch and Mueller, by his own admission, played \"pretty well\" for his team.Already an avid Bayern fan as a kid, Mueller was adamant this opportunity wasn't going to pass him by.\"Mum, we really need to go,\" he recalls telling her. \"I have a trial!\"Later that same year, in July 2000, Mueller received his first official playing membership at Bayern and admits his first training session came as a bit of a shock.\"I thought I was pretty decent,\" he says. \"But I came to Bayern and realized that: 'Oh, there are other great players on this planet.'\"Mueller believes the academy experience forms the basis of any footballer's professional career. He says sacrifices will always need to be made, but players shouldn't forget why they first started playing the sport.\"Here (the academy), everybody is together and the conditions are great, all players, all trainers, working together on a daily basis, to improve every player,\" he says.\"You have to give up a few things and even suffer a bit, but you must never lose the fun of it.\"Managers, both at Bayern and the German national team, have been and gone in Mueller's time, but he has always remained a key figure on the pitch.The 28-year-old, who is modest and endearingly down to earth, attributes this to his attitude, something which has never changed since his days in Bayern's youth system.\"I had many trainers and got along with all of them as I was someone who always wanted to win and was willing to put in the effort,\" he says. \"That's why we never had any issues.\"There is no single word that sums up everything, but a combination of ambition and discipline with the joy for football and life in general. \"You've got to find a good balance between team spirit and egoism. The rest just happens.\"READ: Footballer misses his club's next game to help leukaemia patientREAD: Paris Saint-Germain fall short despite $484 million summer investmentBayern Munich academyMueller describes the privilege of playing in Bayern's youth system as \"definitively something special.\"He returns to that word again -- \"special\" -- when recalling his debut for the club's reserve team, which currently plies its trade in the German fourth tier.\"Although we lost, when I came on I scored straight away and it feels good to impress the new coach a bit,\" he says .\"Every year you have the pressure to make it into the next better team and, naturally, at some point when I was 16 or 17, I played for the Youth National Team ... and you think: 'How far can I get?' \"But that is all in the stars, in the future.\"Though hard work and commitment are undoubtedly the cornerstones of any successful professional career, Mueller realizes that luck also plays a part. \"You've got to be able to achieve top performance at the right time, on the right day,\" he says. Mueller was given his Bundesliga debut a month shy of his 19th birthday by German coach Jurgen Klinsmann, but says he barely has any memory of that day as he \"only played 10 minutes.\"The early memory he cherishes more than any other is his first goal for Bayern, which came in the 7-1 demolition of Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League.Demonstrating the \"Raumdeuter\"' qualities that would later go on to define him, Mueller somehow found space, just two yards from goal, in a crowded box of 15 players.He tapped the ball into the empty net, just 20 minutes after coming on, to complete the rout of the Portuguese side.\"It was obviously pure euphoria,\" he says. \"You don't forget that any time soon.\"Bayern Munich go into Wednesday's second leg of their Champions League round of 16 clash against Besiktas with an insurmountable 5-0 advantage.Mueller, who scored one goal and assisted another in the first leg demolition in Munich, is chasing his second European Cup.But with multiple Bundesliga titles and Champions League and World Cup winners' medals around his neck, his status as a legend of German football is already confirmed. Mueller now looks to impart some of his wisdom on the next generation of Bayern players.\"With this business, when you look at the academy, the pressure on the young players in pretty big,\" he says. \"\"You want to be a role model to them because everybody who lives here at the academy, plays and trains here, is someone special and has a big chance to make it to the top. \"For FC Bayern, it's very important that in the future that players from their own youth academy are able to climb the ladder.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Veteran Washington attorney Joseph diGenova's role as part of President Donald Trump's legal team is still in question, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nDiGenova's hiring was announced on Monday by Jay Sekulow, counsel to the President. DiGenova, along with his wife and law partner, Victoria Toensing, had a Thursday meeting with the President, the sources said. Even so, diGenova's role, as well as that of Toensing who is also in discussions about joining the team, are in flux. One source said no one has been officially hired.The Thursday meeting was the first time the husband-and-wife legal team met with the President since the Monday announcement. One source said that while Trump liked their message, the President is not convinced they are right for the legal jobs. On Monday, after word that diGenova was coming on board, Sekulow said in a statement, \"Former US Attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week. I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.\"A source familiar with the plans said on Monday that diGenova's role was to engage with the media and actively defend the President.Read MoreBut there is concern about conflicts for both diGenova and Toensing, according to two sources. The two run a small firm and there is a question if diGenova can reasonably claim a lack of conflict when his wife represents clients like Mark Corrallo, who has spoken to special counsel Robert Mueller's team about how the President and his team responded to the revelations regarding the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials had with a group of Russians. Toensing also represents former Trump campaign national co-chair Sam Clovis, who has faced scrutiny for his connection to campaign foreign policy team member George Papadopoulos, two sources said. NBC News reported Clovis talked to the special counsel. Toensing has asked her clients to sign waivers regarding the conflicts, CNN is told by one person familiar with the matter, but that may not be sufficient to assuage the concerns.DiGenova and Toensing declined to comment. The White House did not comment.John Dowd, who resigned Thursday as the President's lead lawyer to handle the special counsel's investigation, raised the conflict issue to the legal team before he quit, the sources said.There are discussions with other attorneys to take Dowd's role, sources said. Dowd had been negotiating with Mueller's office over a potential interview with the President.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Friday toughened her stance against Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump's pick to be CIA director, saying she was \"very wary\" of promoting someone to run the agency who was involved in the George W. Bush administration's controversial CIA detention and interrogation program.\n\n\"To promote someone so heavily involved in the torture program to the top position at the CIA, the agency responsible for one of the darkest chapters in our history, is a move that I'm very wary of,\" the California Democrat said in a statement.The California Democrat's statement Friday struck a markedly different tone than her initial comments praising Haspel, who is currently the deputy CIA director and, if confirmed, would be the first woman to run the agency.It's a sign that Feinstein, who is facing a challenger from her left in her reelection campaign, looks less likely to back Haspel's confirmation.Haspel, who has spent 33 years in the CIA, was in charge of a \"black site\" in Thailand in 2002 during the harsh interrogations of detainees, although she was not in charge when al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded at least 83 times.Read MoreRELATED: California Democrats deny Sen. Feinstein an endorsementHaspel was also chief of staff for Jose Rodriguez, director of the CIA's National Clandestine Service, when he ordered the destruction of recordings of CIA interrogations in 2005.Those episodes have stirred up opposition to Haspel among some Democrats and at least one Republican, and the Trump administration is gearing up for a bruising confirmation battle.Sen. John McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, sent Haspel a letter Friday demanding she detail her role in detainee interrogations and the destruction of the CIA tapes, as well as asking whether she was ever \"in a position of authority to stop, or prevent the future employment of 'enhanced interrogation techniques.'\"McCain is an important voice for Republicans, even with his absence from Washington while he battles cancer, and Feinstein could become a key vote for Democrats.As chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee from 2009 through 2014, Feinstein spearheaded the panel's scathing 6,700-page report on the Bush-era interrogation program, which concluded that the use of tactics like waterboarding was not effective at obtaining accurate information or gaining cooperation from detainees.But when Haspel was picked to succeed Mike Pompeo as CIA director earlier this month, Feinstein praised Haspel's record in her year as deputy director and said the two have discussed the issue of torture at length.\"I have spent some time with her,\" Feinstein said at the time. \"We have had dinner together. We have talked. Everything I know is that she has been a good deputy director of the CIA.\"Her comments sparked criticism from the left, including from her opponent within her own party Kevin de León.\"This should be an easy call. Not only should she be a NO vote on Trump's CIA pick, she should also be a leading voice rallying all Dems against this nomination,\" de León tweeted.The White House has also pointed to Feinstein's remarks, with press secretary Sarah Sanders suggesting during a briefing last week that Feinstein backed Haspel's nomination, though she quickly corrected herself.Last week, Feinstein sent a letter to the CIA demanding the declassification of Haspel's records. And in her statement Friday, Feinstein specified there was a difference between praising Haspel's record as deputy director and supporting her to run the CIA.\"Her experience may have served her well as deputy, but the top position is another matter entirely,\" Feinstein said.",

Luke Messer, a leading primary foe who voted for it.Later, he tweeted his criticism of the bill, saying it \"did not include the priorities\" of Trump and Hoosiers.\n\nYesterday, I voted NO on the $1.3 trillion Omnibus.

Jim Renacci, is hitting Renacci on the spending bill -- even though Renacci voted against it. Gibbons' argument is that Renacci, as a House Budget Committee member, is responsible for the product. \"The budget bill that just passed spends money we don't have, fails to fund the wall, but does fund Planned Parenthood. Jim Renacci can't hide his failure and ineffectiveness behind a 'no' vote on the floor,\" Gibbons said. \"If he can't get the job done in the House, how can he ask us to vote for him for the Senate?\"Gibbons on Friday morning retweeted Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who tweeted: \"I agree @realDonaldTrump should veto this sad excuse for legislation because it's $1.3 trillion in spending that (almost) no one read.\"",

Dowd's resignation came amid growing disagreements with Trump over the response to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. That afternoon, Trump directed the US trade representative to level tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese imports following a seven-month investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property theft. In addition to the tariffs, the US also plans to impose new investment restrictions and take action against China at the World Trade Organization, and the Treasury Department will also propose additional measures.

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Deep inside the 2,232 pages of text that make up the newly passed $1.3 trillion bill to keep the federal government open is a direct message to President Donald Trump: Russia needs to be punished.\n\nThe so-called omnibus spending bill, which the Senate passed just after midnight early Friday morning, includes measures that bar a host of federal agencies from engaging with Russia and sanctions the country for a vast series of grievances.The bill is the latest attempt by Congress to take a harder stance on Russia than what the White House has been willing, so far, to take. Trump reluctantly signed a bill sanctioning Russia in August after both houses of Congress overwhelmingly passed the measure. The Trump administration blew through two key deadlines in the bill, though, and just this month announced new sanctions against Russia that were meant to be rolled out in January.Rep. Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee, said \"with the appropriations bill, bipartisan majorities are once again sending the President tough new measures to push back on Russia and shore up our election system against future interference.\"\"The President continues to resist the clear intent of Congress that we want Putin to face consequences for his aggressive and illegal activities,\" Engel said. \"It's time that the White House listens to Congress and uses the tools we've provided.\"Read MoreThe new bill is chock full of messages to Russia.One section bars money from funding a program that Russia participates in by stating money should \"not be used for officials of the central government of Russia.\"Another section punishes Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea by barring funds from going to support any countries that back the annexation, and directs Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to push Americans on certain financial boards to disallow funds from flowing to programs supportive of Russia's annexation.In a five-page section titled \"Countering Russian Influence and Aggression,\" appropriators flatly outlaw any federal money going to the Russian government and approves $250 million to the Countering Russian Influence Fund, a program that works for boost the \"capacity of law enforcement and security forces in country in Europe and Eurasia\" and looks to deepen ties to anti-Russia allies.\"None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be made available for assistance for the central Government of the Russian Federation,\" reads the section, which excoriates Russia for seeking to destabilize Ukraine, annexing Crimea and occupying Georgian territories like Abkhazia and South Ossetia.Multiple White House officials did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the anti-Russia language in the bill.Massive spending bills like the one just passed by Congress often has numerous provisions and pet projects dropped in to appease certain powerful members. But the inclusion of new sanctions on Russia come at a time when lawmakers on both sides worry that Trump, whose administration has been shrouded in the ongoing inquiry into the country's meddling in the 2016 election, has failed to adequately punish the country.Critics of Trump's handling of Russia most recently slammed the President for congratulating Putin on his reelection to another six-year term as President, an election that experts and watchers called a sham.\"Calling him wouldn't have been high on my list,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said after the call. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said \"an American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.\"The news that Trump congratulated Putin was compounded by the fact that, according to The Washington Post, Trump's briefing materials urged him -- in all caps -- not to congratulate the Russia leader. Trump did it anyway, and later told reporters that he applauded Putin.Although White House aides have said Trump plans to sign the omnibus bill before the government shutdowns on Friday at midnight, Trump tweeted on Friday morning that he was considering vetoing the bill because it doesn't fully fund the border wall he has long promised.\"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,\" he wrote.Trump, according to a White House official, is fuming about the spending bill, particularly how news reports on it are noting that his immigration priorities won't be fully funded in the agreements.\"He doesn't like it,\" the official said.\n\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

He always told me he loved me,\" McDougal replied.Didn't keep evidence of relationshipCooper asked McDougal if she kept any text messages, photographs or videos as proof of her and Trump's alleged affair.\"Let me just say this, if you're in a loving relationship, do you try and collect evidence?\" she said.She said the only thing she kept was a daily journal, which she shared with CNN, claiming it documented the time she saw Trump.'I voted for Donald'McDougal said she is a \"die-hard Republican\" and voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.The former Playboy model at first didn't want to come forward with her story.\"I voted for the President,\" she said. \"I voted for Donald. Why would I want to damage him? That's my party, Republican Party. That's my president. I did not want to damage him or hurt him in any way, shape or form, but I also didn't want to put out the story because I didn't want my reputation to be damaged.\"'It's not me' lying about affairMcDougal was asked what she thought of former Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks' denial that McDougal and Trump had an affair.\"I think somebody's lying, and I can tell you it's not me,\" McDougal said. \"It's a little hurtful, but at the same time I have to understand, like, if he were to have told Hope that he didn't do it, I guess I understand, because he's trying to protect his family, his image, things like that.\"\"But it was definitely a little like, 'Wow, you're going to lie about that? OK.'\"McDougal entered agreement, but now thinks it was more to protect Trump McDougal said she entered the deal with American Media Inc. thinking that it was a \"win-win\" situation for her.She wouldn't have her story about her alleged affair with Trump go public and she could launch a new career writing health and fitness columns. \"I'm an older model now. They wanted to make something a new start. You know, they promised me all these wonderful, beautiful things,\" she said, adding, \"I get to work, and my story doesn't have to come out.\"But after signing the agreement in August 2016, McDougal accused the company of \"not fulfilling what they promised me\" and only paying her about half of the $150,000 they owe her.McDougal said she offered to give the money back \"just to have my story rights back.\"When asked if she now thinks the company wanted to protect Trump, McDougal said, \"I'm assuming so, yes.\"She also said at one point American Media CEO and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who considers himself a friend of Trump's, thanked her for her loyalty.Trump on the Access Hollywood tape 'not the man that I knew'\n\nFormer Playboy model McDougal on Trump's \"Access Hollywood\" tape: \"Not the man that I knew\" https://t.co/xjzeDwyHyi https://t.co/Pf6izrZDjg -- Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nCooper asked McDougal what she thought when she heard the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that surfaced during the 2016 campaign, in which Trump could be heard boasting about grabbing women's genitals.\"I was disgusted. I had not seen that in him at all,\" McDougal said. \"Like when our relationship was going on, I didn't see that side of him at all.\"She continued, \"That's not the man that I knew.\" McDougal added that she was troubled when women came forward during the campaign with accusations of sexual harassment and assault against Trump.\"I was kind of mortified. I was like, 'Wow, is he capable of that?' Because I didn't see that,\" she said.Says 'sorry' to Melania, regrets that Trump was marriedMcDougal said she now knows the alleged affair was \"wrong\" and claims she's returned to her roots of her faith and is attending church.\"When I look back, where I was back then, I know it's wrong. Like I'm really sorry for that. I know it's the wrong thing to do,\" she told Cooper. \"Back in that day, I was a different girl.\"McDougal told Cooper she knew Trump was married to Melania, but she never brought it up during their alleged affair.\"Obviously, there's a reason I don't bring her up, because I felt guilty about it,\" McDougal said, adding that she never knew for sure whether Melania was aware of their affair.\n\nFormer Playboy model Karen McDougal's message to Melania Trump on alleged: \"I'm sorry ...

I wouldn't want it done to me. I'm sorry.\"McDougal told Cooper, \"The only regret I have about the relationship that I had with Donald was the fact that he was married. If he weren't married, I wouldn't have any regrets because he treated me very kind. He was very respectful. As I told you, it was a good relationship while it happened.\"Expects retaliation for speaking outMcDougal thinks she could face retaliation for speaking to CNN in the form of a \"big lawsuit\" against her or \"financial ruin.\"\"Am I scared? Like, do I feel threatened? Absolutely,\" McDougal said. \"But I feel I had to protect myself. I had to stand up for myself.\"\"I'm quite mad at that. I'm angry,\" McDougal said of her contract with American Media. \"I feel taken advantage of in a sense. And I just want the right to be made. I want it to be right.\"McDougal said she filed the lawsuit because she wants her \"life rights back.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)George Clooney wrote an open letter to the survivors of the Parkland school shooting, praising them for making him \"proud of his country again.\"\n\nThe letter was published on Friday in The Guardian's website, where student journalists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are guest editing the newspaper's online coverage of the March for Our Lives event on Saturday. In an editor's note published with the letter, Emma Dowd, Lauren Newman and Rebecca Schneid, co-editors-in-chief of the school paper Eagle Eye, said they reached out to a number of politicians and celebrities for interviews, including George Clooney and his wife Amal, who donated $500,000 to support the march. \"They turned us down on the interview, but we loved the letter George sent us back,\" the three students wrote. In the letter, Clooney thanked them for what they are doing to promote safer gun laws, saying, \"Amal and I stand behind you, in support of you, in gratitude to you.\"Read More\"Amal and I are 100% behind you and will be marching in DC on the 24th, but we both feel very strongly that this is your march. Your moment,\" Clooney wrote. \"Young people are taking it to the adults and that has been your most effective tool. The fact that no adults will speak on the stage in DC is a powerful message to the world that if we can't do something about gun violence then you will. The issue is going to be this, anyone you ask would feel proud to be interviewed by you but it's so much more effective if it's young people.\"Related: What you should know about the March for Our LivesThe Guardian on Friday said they invited the students to serve as guest editors for the next 48 hours and the students appear to be taking full advantage of the opportunity to make themselves heard on gun control issues. \"We hope to use the Guardian's platform to heighten awareness of the issue of gun control and school safety to such an extent that the federal government can no longer ignore us,\" they said in their editor's note. March for Our Lives is an event created and organized by #NeverAgain, a group of students who survived the February 14 shooting that claimed 17 lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, is helping the students plan and coordinate the event.The main march will be held in Washington, D.C., with more than 800 related events taking place around the world.Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg are among the other celebrities who have donated $500,000 each in support of the march.Event organizers have also raised more than $3 million through a GoFundMe campaign that was launched a few days after the shooting.",

And it appears that many of our top music artists do a lot of unhealthy endorsements. A study released Monday by NYU Langone Medical Center ranked a singer or group's popularity with teens and then looked at the type of foods and drinks they endorsed. Researchers say it's the first to apply a rigorous nutritional analysis to the review of dozens of advertisements by music stars over a 14-year period. The study found that 71% of the promoted beverages were sugary drinks, and 80% of the foods were nutrient-poor. There were no endorsements for fruits, vegetables or whole grains, and only one food product with a healthy score: pistachios. Read MoreWho were the top celebrity endorsers? Justin Timberlake recorded the \"I'm Lovin' It\" jingle for McDonald's and got a hit out of the deal. He's also endorsed Pepsi Regular.Maroon 5, headed by singer Adam Levine, wrote a song for Coca-Cola and one for Snapple, which nutritionists say can be as sugar-laden as a soda.Will.i.am had endorsements for Doritos, Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper and Pepsi.And Baauer, best known for trap music like \"Harlem Shake,\" led the pack with endorsements for Hot Pockets, Red Bull, Dr Pepper, A&W Restaurants and Pepsi.According to the study, $2 billion a year is spent by food and drink companies on youth-targeted ads. It's estimated that children see 4,700 ads each year while teens view 5,900.\"These celebrity endorsement deals are often worth millions of dollars each, suggesting companies find them critical for promoting products,\" said lead study author Marie Bragg, a faculty member at the NYU College of Global Public Health. \"Food advertising leads to overeating, and the food industry spends $1.8 billion per year marketing to youth alone.\"While many food and beverage companies have taken voluntary pledges not to target children under 12, Bragg said, teens are not included in that effort, but they should be, she said.\"The popularity of music celebrities among adolescents makes them uniquely poised to serve as positive role models,\" study co-author Alysa N. Miller added. \"Celebrities should be aware that their endorsements could exacerbate society's struggle with obesity, and they should endorse healthy products instead.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)In the last 16 days, President Donald Trump has replaced his top economic adviser, his top foreign policy adviser and his top national security adviser.\n\nLet me repeat that: In the last 16 days, President Donald Trump has replaced his top economic adviser, his top foreign policy adviser and his top national security adviser.Here's the timeline:March 7: Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council, announces his resignationMarch 13: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is fired via TwitterMarch 22: National security adviser H.R. McMaster resignsThere's two things worth noting about that slew of changes: 1) They come in the first 14 months of Trump's presidency and 2) They represent a wholesale policy pivot from the people who were moved out.Read MoreThis would be a lot of change in critical positions for any president at any time during their tenure. Let's say that a president had just won a second term and made this series of changes. It would be a BIG deal. He's changing things up as he gets ready for the challenges of a second term! He's bringing in fresh blood to get done what he couldn't get done in the first four years! And so on.But this isn't a president overhauling his team as he preps for a second term. This is a president who has been in office for just over 14 months or, to be exact, 427 days.In most White Houses, your senior policy people -- head of the NEC, secretary of state, etc. -- are just beginning to settle into their jobs at this point of your term. They have launched -- or are preparing to launch -- the one or two major initiatives they and the president have agreed upon as goals for a first term.In the Trump White House, those people are now out. And not just out, but replaced by people who, in several instances, have radically different views on major issues.Start with Cohn. He resigned after losing an internal fight with the President (and the protectionist element within the White House) over instituting a series of tariffs. Cohn opposed such a move. Trump did it anyway. Cohn resigned. While Trump replaced Cohn with Larry Kudlow, another free trade proponent, it appears to be under the assurance that Kudlow won't get in Trump's way on tariffs and broader trade policy.\"[Kudlow] wouldn't have taken the job just to be a thorn in the President's side,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Thursday.Tillerson, who regularly disagreed with Trump on a variety of issues -- most notably Russia -- will be replaced by Mike Pompeo. Pompeo has risen up the ranks in Trumpworld thanks to his consistent loyalty to Trump. In announcing Pompeo's selection, Trump made a point of noting that he and the former Kansas Congressman are \"always on the same wavelength.\" And finally, the switch of McMaster for Bolton. While Bolton said Thursday that his past views have no bearing on how he will execute his new job as national security adviser, those past views represent a huge change from the more traditional Republican foreign policy views espoused by McMaster.\"The replacement of H.R. McMaster as national security adviser with Amb. John Bolton is not merely a changing of the guard,\" said Frank Gaffney, the head of the Center for Security Policy, who among other things repeatedly suggested President Barack Obama may be a Muslim. \"It is a sea-change, one that holds promise of allowing Mr. Trump to accomplish his national security and foreign policy objectives, rather than endlessly contend with them being sabotaged by his own insubordinate subordinates.\"Indeed. Bolton has, among other things, advocated for the bombing of both Iran and North Korea. He was also one of the staunchest supporters of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a decision Trump insists he opposed at the time. (He didn't.)Broadly speaking, these moves represent Trump pushing out people with whom he has clashed or who stand up to him on matters of policy and replacing them with people who are much more likely to rubberstamp whatever policy decisions he makes -- whether it contradicts his past views or looks (or is) misguided. The new team has been chosen for their willingness to carry out the whims and wishes of the President. But that Trump has done so this early in his administration -- and over a two-week period -- remains totally remarkable. You are talking about a full-scale re-engineering of a good chunk of your top advisers less than 500 days into your presidency. What does that say about your original picks? (Remember, too, that McMaster was the second national security adviser for Trump, following the firing of Michael Flynn.) What does it say about your policy convictions or priorities if you are willing to change horses before you even get to the stream? And, most importantly, what does it say about where we go from here?",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nPeter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of \"United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.\"\n\n(CNN)The departure of Lt. Gen H.R. McMaster from the White House removes one of the most capable public servants in the Trump administration, a war hero in both US wars in Iraq whose doctorate became \"Dereliction of Duty,\" an influential best-seller that excoriated the generals who waged the Vietnam War for not providing President Lyndon B. Johnson with unvarnished military advice.\n\nAt least McMaster wasn't fired by tweet, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was last week. Tillerson first learned of his defenestration via the President's preferred mode of communication. McMaster was allowed to resign and received an effusive statement of thanks from Donald Trump for his more than three decades of military service. Given all the abrupt firings of White House officials, this is the Trump administration's version of a golden parachute.Undercutting Trump's public eulogy for his departing national security adviser, for many months White House officials had told reporters on background that McMaster was on the way out because the three-star general's briefing style grated on Trump. This resulted in a steady drip-drip of stories that McMaster was headed out the door. It's hardly surprising that Trump objected to McMaster's briefings because the President says he already knows all he needs to know and relies on his gut alone to make decisions. Read MoreAs Trump claimed during the election campaign, \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me.\" No need for a general's briefing then.Trump also told Fox News that the many unfilled senior positions at the State Department didn't affect the conduct of foreign policy because \"I'm the only one that matters.\" No need for informed briefings then. The removal of Tillerson and McMaster is being framed by anonymous White House officials as a necessary reshuffle as Trump gears up for his meeting with Kim Jung Un, the first-ever such encounter between a US president and a North Korean leader, a meeting slated for late May. This rationale makes little sense because in The Wall Street Journal only last month newly appointed national security adviser John Bolton argued forcefully for a unilateral American military strike against North Korea. It's the same type of argument that Bolton had advocated in the run-up to the Iraq War, which had the dubious honor of marking its 15th anniversary this week. Bolton also publicly called for the bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities three years ago on the grounds that \"time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.\"His longstanding advocacy for pre-emptive wars is reminiscent of Talleyrand's quip when the Bourbons were restored to power after the French Revolution, \"They have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.\" Bolton is also among the most vocal and influential advocates for tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, which does exactly what would likely emerge from any possible deal with the North Koreans: They would dial back their nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions against them. As recently as Tuesday, Bolton described the Iran deal as a \"strategic debacle\" on Fox. This is not the well-informed view of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who testified in October that the Iran nuclear deal is in American national security interests. In short, it's hard to imagine a worse negotiator to sit across the table from the North Koreans than Bolton. Russian rouletteIt's not just McMaster's style that rubbed Trump the wrong way: They also have important, substantive differences about how they see the world. Take Russia: In December the Trump administration released its national security strategy, a dense 55-page document supervised by McMaster that focused heavily on Russian aggression against neighboring states and its efforts to undermine Western democracies. These are actions that Trump barely acknowledges, while he repeatedly embraces Russia's apparent President for life, Vladimir Putin. A month before the release of his own administration's national security strategy, Trump said of Putin, in regard to the 2016 US election, \"He said he didn't meddle. ... Every time he sees me, he says, 'I didn't do that,' And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.\" By contrast, the national strategy stated that Russia is \"using information tools in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies. ... Russia uses information operations as part of its offensive cyber efforts to influence public opinion across the globe. Its influence campaigns blend covert intelligence operations and false online personas with state-funded media. ...\"McMaster publicly endorsed this analysis last month at the Munich Security Conference when he said of the just-handed down American indictments of 13 Russians allegedly involved in meddling in the 2016 presidential election, \"The evidence is now really incontrovertible.\" This reference to evidence of Russian electoral meddling was swiftly and publicly rebuked by Trump, who tweeted, \"General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems.\" After that public dressing-down it was clear that McMaster's days at the White House were numbered -- a case of not if he was going, but when. Sarah Sanders, who has turned into the \"Baghdad Bob\" of the Trump administration, tweeted only a week ago that she \"just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster -- contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC.\" In fairness to Sanders, she can only repeat what the President tells her. Summoning the shade of Sanders' Nixonian predecessor, Ron Ziegler, her tweet is now no longer an \"operative\" statement.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)The Trump administration alleged Friday that Iranian government-linked hackers broke into the accounts of roughly 8,000 professors at hundreds of US and foreign universities, as well as private companies and government entities, to steal massive amounts of data and intellectual property.\n\nThe indictment unveiled by the Department of Justice on Friday directly links the individuals charged with the hacks to the Iranian government, saying the perpetrators were working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other government clients.Along with the charges, the Treasury Department designated the nine Iranians and the company they worked for, the Mabna Institute, for sanctions.The move from the Justice Department and Treasury follows other US efforts to indict foreign government-linked cyberattackers, including special counsel Robert Mueller's indictment of Russian operatives for meddling in the 2016 US election, and the Obama administration's indictment of Chinese military members for the government-sponsored hacking of US companies.It also comes at a time of tension with Iran, long an adversary of the US. As President Donald Trump reshuffles his national security and diplomacy team, including firing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, experts speculate Trump may be laying the groundwork to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated, though Iran's cyber efforts were not part of that deal. Read MoreAccording to the charges, which include conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, wire fraud, unauthorized access of a computer and aggravated identity theft and could carry a maximum sentence of upwards of four decades in prison, the nine alleged hackers carried out a sophisticated worldwide campaign since at least 2013 to pull off their cyberheist of more than 30 terabytes of academic data and other sensitive information.The indictment alleges the Mabna Institute targeted more than 100,000 professors worldwide and succeeded in compromising 8,000 of them, spread across 144 US-based universities and 176 foreign universities. In their crosshairs were various types of intellectual property, including academic journals, dissertations and electronic books. To break into the accounts, the sophisticated campaign started by studying each target in a reconnaissance phase, then using that information to send specialized emails to the targets that appeared to come from other university professors expressing interest in a recently published work, with links to other research that were actually links to malicious websites that would mimic the professor's login page and steal his or her login information and use it to access their accounts. The hackers also allegedly broke into the accounts of employees of US government and non-governmental entities, including the Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the states of Hawaii and Indiana, Indiana's Department of Education, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children's Fund. Once inside, the hackers allegedly stole the entire email inbox. Other victims included employees of 36 US-based companies and 11 companies outside the US in a wide range of industries, including academic publishers, media and entertainment entities, a law firm, tech companies, and consulting and marketing firms.The tactic for the private-sector and governmental hacks was much less sophisticated, according to the indictment. The hackers allegedly used \"password spraying\": They collected email addresses they could find on the internet and then simply tried common passwords on those accounts, stealing email inboxes if they managed to get in. It is unlikely that any of the individuals named in the indictment will ever see the inside of a US jail or courtroom. It is also unlikely that foreign governments without extradition treaties with the US would give up their citizens to stand trial, and once the indictment is unsealed, the individuals named in it are unlikely to travel to countries that could extradite them to the US.Still, federal prosecutors hope that by exposing the hacking operations, they can deter the behavior and make clear their ability to trace it back to its source.\n\nCNN's Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)The Republican National Committee spent over $424,000 at Trump properties in the first two months of 2018, according to Federal Election Commission documents.\n\nIn just February, according to FEC documents made public Tuesday, the RNC spent more than $271,000 on venue rental and catering at Trump properties in Florida and Washington, DC. FEC filings also show that starting in September 2017, the RNC has paid $37,000 monthly to rent space in Trump Tower for the Trump campaign, totaling over $225,000 so far. The $271,000 is about 86% of the committee's entire spending on venue rental and catering for the month, and more than the committee has spent in a single month at a Trump property since the beginning of 2017. Overall, 14% of RNC spending on venue rental and catering has gone to Trump properties since the beginning of 2017.After he was elected President, Donald Trump placed his business into a trust controlled by his adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric, but did not liquidate his holdings or let an independent manager handle the trust without his knowledge -- the approach favored by past presidents and by ethics experts because it separates the president's personal profit motive from his decisions on behalf of the government.Read MoreThe arrangement has drawn criticism from ethics watchdogs, who say it allows for the appearance of a conflict of interest.An RNC official said donors enjoy visiting Trump properties, and also pointed to security, convenience and price as factors in the committee's decision-making. The official added that Trump properties are often cheaper to rent than other venues, noting that the FEC demands the RNC receive market rates.RNC spending at Trump properties in 2018 is up significantly from the previous year; the committee spent just over $222,000 on venue rental and catering at Trump properties in all of 2017. More than half of that spending came at a single July 2017 event at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC (for which the hotel was paid $121,250).The RNC spending at Trump properties in February is also up from recent months. Excluding Trump Tower rent, the committee spent about $44,500 in December 2017, $79,000 in January and $271,000 in February at Trump properties. Almost all of the February spending came from two events at Trump's Doral golf club in Florida and another event at the Trump hotel in DC.Since the beginning of 2017, the RNC has spent nearly $800,000 at Trump properties, including the monthly rental payments and the spending on venue rental and catering.FEC records also show that the RNC has paid John Pence, Vice President Mike Pence's nephew, over $7,000 a month since September for his work on the Trump campaign, where he serves as a deputy executive director.The RNC has also made several payments to Parscale Strategies LLC, the company belonging to Trump's 2020 campaign manager,Brad Parscale.Parscale's company received a series of $15,000 fees from the RNC throughout the summer of 2017, totaling $60,000. From November through the end of February 2018, the RNC paid the firm more than $2.5 million.In addition to the spending at Trump properties and Trump-linked consulting firms, CNN reported that the RNC spent more than $230,000 in August of last year to cover some of President Trump's legal fees associated with the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In addition to the RNC's spending, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party's official campaign arm, spent just over $1,500 at Trump properties in February, FEC filings show.The RNC raised $12.8 million in February and entered March with over $42 million in cash on hand.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)\"Barry\" invites comparisons to \"Get Shorty,\" focusing as it does on a hit man who's suddenly and somewhat inexplicably bitten by the acting bug. But this HBO series from Bill Hader and \"Silicon Valley's\" Alec Berg turns into something more interesting, a bittersweet dramedy that's uncomfortably funny and simultaneously dark and tense.\n\nReflecting a serious departure from his \"Saturday Night Live\" antics, Hader brings an understated quality to the title role, playing a guy who's good at killing people, just not very fulfilled by it. So when a job in L.A. brings him into contact with an acting class presided over by the eccentric Gene Cousineau (a simply wonderful Henry Winkler), Barry decides to hang around, quickly becoming enamored with Sally (Sarah Goldberg), whose struggling-actress shtick is practically a show unto itself. (At one point, she tells Barry he needs to deal with his \"toxic masculinity\" issues.)Of course, Barry's decision to embark on this new late-in-life career path comes with its share of baggage, starting with the ruthless, gun-toting Chechens of whom he's run afoul. His behavior is also a mystery to his handler and sort-of friend Fuches (Stephen Root), who doesn't want to risk messing up their profitable relationship.\" allowfullscreen>Part of \"Barry's\" kick comes from seeing those striving on the periphery of Hollywood -- with all the attendant self-absorption and insecurity -- through its title character's eyes. Even Barry seems confused by his unexpected longing to be part of this world, which both excites and mystifies him.Hader (who also directed a number of the episodes) brings a sense of menace to Barry -- including his dead-eyed stares when Gene tries to motivate him by pushing his buttons -- but also a sense of emptiness, which gets beyond the cliché baked into the premise of what HBO is cheekily promoting as a \"hit show.\" It also helps that the producers have done a savvy job casting around the margins, including the aforementioned Root and Glenn Fleshler (\"True Detective\") as the head of the Chechen gang.Read MoreSomewhat awkwardly paired with \"Silicon Valley,\" \"Barry\" has a distinctive feel that isn't neatly pigeon-holed. Still, HBO made all eight episodes of the first season available, and when it's over, there's genuine curiosity about what might come next.That isn't automatically the prescription for a \"hit,\" but in TV terms, it's a pretty good sign that where it matters, \"Barry's\" aim is true.\"Barry\" premieres March 25 at 10:30 p.m. on HBO.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nMichael D'Antonio is author of the book, \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN)In this, the era of Trump, it is no surprise that the former Playboy model who told of an affair with the man who became president has shown herself to be more honest, empathetic, courageous, and decent than the President of the United States.\n\nKaren McDougal established her bravery as soon as she agreed to sit down for an extensive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. Given Trump's penchant for character assassination, she knew what she might face and yet felt secure in telling her story. Contrast McDougal's choice with the President's consistent avoidance of meaningful encounters with the press. Over a year has passed since he held a real press conference, which suggests he's afraid to do what McDougal did for more than an hour of questions that included excruciating queries such as whether Trump wore condoms -- she said he didn't -- and about how she felt meeting his wife and four adult children when her affair with him was ongoing.\"Deep inside there was a lot of guilt,\" said McDougal, expressing the kind of honest shame Trump has never shown despite scandals involving porn actress Stormy Daniels, his own bragging about grabbing women by their genitals and claims of sexual harassment by more than a dozen women.The President's spokespeople have denied that he had affairs with McDougal and Daniels, and they have denied the claims of sexual harassment.Read MoreBy now the world is accustomed to Trump's lies -- it was 2,000 as of January, according to the Washington Post -- but the interview suggested a new low when it comes to his depraved indifference toward his family. As photos and McDougal's account indicate, Trump introduced his mistress to his wife, months after she gave birth, and had them both pose with others for the cameras. Also in the picture, snapped at the Playboy mansion, was his eldest daughter Ivanka. McDougal also recalled that the proud father compared her to his child and concluded they were both beautiful.Despicable as the Playboy mansion episode was, it was matched by Trump's behavior at a Lake Tahoe golf tournament where, according to the accusers, he separately had sex with both McDougal and Daniels.Somehow, busy as he was, Trump also managed to attract the attention of other porn stars who were in attendance and, he reported to McDougal, wanted to be photographed with him.What can be said about the married father of five, including an infant son at the time, who would be so brazen in his behavior? If the allegations are true, at every turn he seemed compelled to put his duplicity in the faces of people whom he supposedly loved. Was he looking for a thrill? Indulging a sadistic streak? Trying to prove something to himself?What about McDougal? As a model who took her clothes off for money, she is regarded -- in some circles -- as categorically immoral. The same could be said for Ms. Daniels. But in this time, when our President exhibits such consistent disregard for so many norms, their forthrightness has been admirable in contrast.In her interview, McDougal's humanity shone through when she expressed regret for her affair and her eyes filled with tears when she said she was sorry for the pain she caused Melania Trump. One wonders if the President sheds any tears when he considers what he has done to the dignity of the office he has degraded.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nLittleton, Colorado (CNN)The massacre at Columbine High School shocked a nation, and seemingly every student and teacher in it.\n\nAs schools and legislators struggled to come to terms with the unthinkable, one teacher in Muskegon, Michigan, thought to make a traditional Native American dreamcatcher to catch Columbine's bad dreams after its collective nightmare.That teacher, Debra Gutowski, and her class sent it as a gift.\"Our hopes and dreams for it at that time were the same we have today,\" she told CNN. \"For these shootings to stop.\"But since Columbine in the spring of 1999, the dreamcatcher has been passed from school to school. Read MoreEach time, it meets a community devastated by tragedy, but bent on honoring those lost, by preventing the next school shooting. On March 16, the dreamcatcher passed to Parkland, Florida, and the Marjory Stoneman Douglas community, where 17 were killed by a gunman last month.Columbine: Filling his son' shoesEven in his worst nightmare, Tom Mauser would never have dreamed what happened on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. On that day, Mauser recalls getting the news of his son's death in agonizing bits and pieces. He went to sleep that night still praying his son Daniel was alive, but knowing deep down, that he was almost certainly not. \"I broke down completely, crying down in the basement. My wife heard me upstairs,\" he recalls in a tone of voice that betrays he's told this story many times before. But when asked about his son, a deep sigh suggests that talking about him hasn't gotten much easier. \"Oh boy,\" he said, pausing before explaining, \"I think he would be a medical researcher, trying to solve problems with illnesses. That's what he was leaning towards doing and I think he'd be great at,\" he said of Daniel.A few days after the shooting, when Mauser's home was so full of floral arrangements that it looked and smelled like a funeral home, he suddenly knew what he had to do. A friend told him the National Rifle Association was, by coincidence, about to hold its national convention in nearby Denver.\"I thought back to the question that Daniel asked me about two weeks before he was killed,\" Mauser says. \"Dad, did you know there were loopholes in the Brady Bill?\" the boy had asked after a discussion with members of the debate team about the law that had mandated background checks for gun purchases except those sold at gun shows or online. \"Daniel asked me that question and then he was killed with a gun that was purchased through one of those loopholes,\" Mauser said. \"I know why those loopholes are there. It's the NRA. Their convention is here. I've got to speak out.\"Two days later, he found himself reluctantly addressing thousands of protesters. He had found a clear purpose, and plenty of supporters to help him.\"That gun-show loophole that existed in Colorado and in many states, we took that issue on first and we fixed it,\" he said of a statewide vote that took place after legislative inaction.Now dressed in a brown jacket over a plaid shirt with blue jeans, Mauser looks like any man his age, with one exception: his shoes. The lace-up skateboard sneakers are the same ones Daniel was wearing when he was killed. \"I'd like to think that by stepping into his shoes that I am doing what he would want me to do,\" he said. Thanks in part to Mauser's work, Colorado now requires nearly universal background checks and has limited the size of magazines to 15 rounds. But even Mauser knows that gun control alone won't cure America's school shooting plague. \"No, we have to do a number of things to deal with the gun violence problem, and we're going to have to compromise, we're going to have to sit down and talk this out, and not scream at each other the way we are right now,\" he said. Progress requires seeing things from someone else's shoes. Red Lake: Glass, then a plan for change shatteredSix years after Columbine, the dreamcatcher was taken to Red Lake High School, on an Ojibwe reservation in northern Minnesota, after a student shot and killed five students, a teacher and an unarmed security guard. Missy Dodds was a math teacher, holding seventh-period study hall, when the shots rang out. She had locked the door to her classroom and turned off the lights when the armed student showed up outside her door, which had a floor-length glass panel next to it. \"I looked up and I just so happened to see the 'aha' moment in his eyes when he goes like -- I can shoot this glass out,\" Dodds told CNN in her noticeably misplaced Southern accent. She remembers three or four shots and then the sound of crunching glass as he walked into her room. \"He just started shooting and just went down the line. And when he got to me there was nothing left in his gun.\"One brave student, Jeff May, was shot in the face after he attacked the shooter with a pencil. He survived. After that, the shooter took off down the hallway, leaving a shotgun on the floor. Dodds never picked it up. She froze. Proof, she says that being armed that day might not have helped. \"But that's me, there are other [teachers] that are trained,\" she said, adding that the question of arming teachers should be left up to each school. After the attack, Dodds tried and failed to convince state lawmakers to consider shatterproof glass in schools, something she says would have saved lives at Red Lake. \"I was literally blown off,\" she said of her trip to the state capital, St. Paul. Dodds is still mad about what happened at her school. But she sees more clearly now how the system failed, and how the shooter, her former student, reached a breaking point. \"He lost his parents. He had told others he wanted to kill himself. Nobody seemed to care,\" she said. \"No human being should have to go through what that poor kid went through.\"Dodds quit teaching the following year, and struggled to regain any sense of normalcy. Many of her former students dropped out, one attempted suicide twice. Few made it through college. Dodds revisited her classroom the day of the shooting to help identify bodies. Since then, she has often revisited that scene in her mind. Thirteen years later, she still struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and pain she knows will never fully go away. \"There's been a lot of days when I haven't felt lucky. It's a burden I have to live with.\"Sandy Hook: Seeking hands and hearts and minds Red Lake kept the dreamcatcher for seven years. And then came the pre-Christmas 2012 massacre of the first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.Michele Gay lost her 7-year-old daughter, Josephine, that day. Like Tom Mauser's experience at Columbine, it took many hours to get the worst news of her life confirmed.\"My oldest daughter just couldn't accept it,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"It just couldn't be. You know, she was sure that it was a misunderstanding.\"But for Gay, the conversation was never going to be about guns. She even talked about it with her husband as he was trying to get back to Newtown in the very first hours after the shooting, before they knew Josephine was killed.\"He said 'everyone's going to go right to gun control,'\" she said, \"That's going to be where this conversation goes. And I remember just being surprised, like 'No, no, you know surely people will understand that there's a lot more to this than that conversation.'\"Gay, who now lives in suburban Baltimore, still cannot believe that the killer could send up so many red flags and yet have easy access to guns. But she has always focused on every other issue that could have prevented the carnage.In 2013, a group of Sandy Hook parents fought for months to push lawmakers to enact sweeping gun control legislation. Gay was not among them. She supports having the conversation about guns, but she's clear that there's no \"easy button\" to prevent school shootings. She founded Safe and Sound Schools with another Sandy Hook mother, Alissa Parker. The pair, along with a network of survivors and experts consult with school administrators and help them create a customized safety strategy. No idea is off the table, even arming teachers. \"I know there are communities there that are doing it and doing it well,\" she said. \"[But for] most of the communities that we're working with, there are so many other solutions that are less invasive, less expensive, less time intensive that they can employ before they even have to look at arming teachers.\"Gay's apolitical approach is by design. \"If we go in and we start mentioning hot button issues or political arguments we suddenly divide the room in half. We lose half of the hands, and half of the hearts, and half of the minds that we need dedicated to the safety of the community.\"The feathers of the dreamcatcher are meant to let good dreams through -- dreams that one day, the dreamcatcher will stay put, and that would be fine with Michele Gay. \"I really believe that it's possible that we could stop passing that dreamcatcher around. Or I wouldn't be involved in this,\" she said.From Sandy Hook, the dreamcatcher was given to Marysville-Pilchuck High School in Washington and then to Townville Elementary in South Carolina. On March 16, Townville presented the dreamcatcher to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. But students there chose only to accept it for 17 seconds: one for each of the victims killed at their school. Then, they gave it back.\"I think their decision was very powerful,\" said Joanne Avery, the school superintendent for Townville, who presented the dreamcatcher along with the school principal.Stopping the journey of the dreamcatcher, they hope, will just be a precursor to ending school shootings.\n\nThis story was reported by Scott McLean in Littleton, Colorado; Bemidji, Minnesota; and Baltimore, Maryland.

They quickly became the faces of a national conversation on gun control, and now they are lobbying lawmakers for more restrictive gun laws. Small groups of students will meet Friday morning with members of Congress, while others will head to the Newseum to discuss their experiences in the Valentine's Day shooting.Later, some will attend a vigil at the National Cathedral and a concert headlined by the rock band Fall Out Boy.\"This is a time for action.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nVatican City (CNN)Nour Essa landed on Lesbos in a refugee boat and left on the jumbo jet of a Pope.\n\nOne minute, this microbiologist was holding her toddler amid squalor in one of the most miserable refugee camps in Europe. The next minute, she was eating off Vatican china on a flight to freedom and a new life in Rome. The miraculous twist of fate for one Syrian family is a rare glimpse of hope in seven years of civil war, the brutal rise of ISIS and millions of resulting refugees. But as she learns to love pasta and speak Italian, Essa is also a political symbol, created by the Vatican and one of the most liberal and globally engaged Holy Fathers in generations.Read More'The globalization of indifference'The Syrian war was just 2 years old when Pope Francis took power. Europe was feeling the crush of asylum seekers from Syria and North African migrants, an influx that reshaped communities from Spain to Sweden, spreading a fever of anti-immigrant rage in its wake.While he was elected in large part to tackle internal Vatican scandals, Francis used his first official trip outside Rome to hold a Mass for the desperate and displaced, and to take a stand on the issue tearing Europe apart.Off the tiny Sicilian island of Lampedusa, he laid a wreath atop the watery graveyard where hundreds have drowned trying to cross from North Africa.From an altar built from the remnants of refugee boats, Francis railed against \"the globalization of indifference.\" While the message sent shock waves through EU capitals, anti-immigrant sentiments only intensified in the first few years of his papacy. By late 2015, when Donald Trump suggested a Muslim travel ban and then began winning primaries in early 2016 with promises of a border wall, the Pope decided to make a grand statement.With the help of a group called the Community of Sant'Egidio, he would fly the papal plane to Lesbos, Greece, bless a camp packed with refugees and bring a dozen back to Rome. As the plan was hatched and Greek officials were sworn to secrecy, Essa and her family were among the thousands crammed into tented camps built to hold hundreds. Their home outside Damascus had been bombed to rubble, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces were trying to force her husband, Hasan, to join the war. \"We did not want to participate in the killing of our brothers,\" Essa explains.So they gambled their savings on one human trafficker after another, crossing Turkey and voyaging to Lesbos, only to discover that they'd traded one hell for another. The Greek government had just announced a plan to send most refugees back to Turkey and their escape funds were nearly gone. But just as despair was taking hold, Daniela Pompei of the Community of Sant'Egidio walked over and asked the question that would change their lives. \"Would you like to leave this place for Italy tomorrow?\" she asked them. \"You would be on the same plane as the Pope. You have to decide right now.\"\"It was fantastic,\" Essa says, recalling that miracle flight with her family and nine other Muslim refugees. \"[Pope Francis] is a real human being. An example to leaders of all religions.\"Welcome the stranger? Not everyone agreesBut while his message to welcome strangers with Christ-like grace plays well to the faithful at St. Peter's, it's antithetical to the views of Europe's increasingly powerful right-wing leaders. Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's far-right League party, made huge gains in the March 4 election with calls to round up and deport migrants and segregate public transportation.\"Italians are very welcoming people, but they have taken the brunt of the immigration -- especially from North Africa -- in the last few years,\" says Thomas D. Williams, a former priest and Rome bureau chief for the right-wing website Breitbart. \"They do listen to the Pope when he says you should be Christian and welcome the stranger. But they also see a situation where you reach a critical mass and you say, 'We don't know how much more of this we can do.'\" In the United States, Pope Francis' example has mobilized some American Catholics to push back against the Trump agenda on the Mexican border. Sister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, says she sees between 50-100 people cross the Texas border in either direction every day. She says they're not \"rapists,\" as President Trump described when announcing his candidacy, but families with few good choices, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement squads ramp up raids and deportations. \"Respecting life comes in how we treat immigrants and how we respect the integrity of the family,\" she says standing in St. Peter's Square after a blessing by Pope Francis. \"So when you want to separate a family -- a mother from their kids -- it doesn't make sense. We feel encouraged that we're doing the right thing, and that [the Pope's] message is a sense of strength for us.\"Back at the Community of Sant'Egidio language school, Essa hugs Pompei, the woman who helped save her from the camp on Lesbos. Her Italian is impressive, she has a job in a hospital now and her little boy is in school. \"Italians have been taught to fear the immigrant,\" Pompei says with an arm around Essa. \"But Pope John Paul II said in his first address 'Be not afraid.' Pope Francis is helping us live this truth every day.\"",

McMaster, served as the President George W. Bush's undersecretary for arms control from 2001 to 2005 before becoming US ambassador to the United Nations. In his State Department role, Bolton drew accusations that he had manipulated intelligence on weapons of mass destruction before the Iraq War, kept information from Secretary of State Colin Powell and was abusive to subordinates with differing views at the agency. Bolton said in a 2015 interview that he believed the decision to leave Iraq was a worse decision that invading it.Duckworth lost both of her legs in 2004 when her Blackhawk helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.

Around the World:\n\nIn France, April 1st is called \"Poisson d'Avril.\" Read MoreFrench children fool their friends by taping a paper fish to their friends' backs. When the \"young fool\" discovers this trick, the prankster yells \"Poisson d'Avril!\" In Scotland, April Fools' lasts two days. Victims of pranks are called gowks (cuckoo birds). The second day is known as Taily Day, and pranks involving the backside are played. Supposedly, it is the origin of \"kick me\" signs.In England and Canada, pranks are only played in the morning of April 1st.Memorable Pranks:\n\nEarly 1950s - The BBC runs a \"news\" item about the spaghetti harvest in Switzerland. 1985 - Sports Illustrated runs a 14-page story by George Plimpton about a Mets pitching phenom named Sidd Finch. The reclusive, skinny Finch has a 168-mph fastball (which he credits to meditations in Tibet) and a host of quirks including carrying a French horn at all times and wearing only one hiking boot while pitching. 1986-present - Press releases for the [non-existent] New York City April Fools' Day Parade have been issued every year since 1986.1996 - Taco Bell Corp. runs a full-page ad in several major newspapers claiming it has purchased the Liberty Bell and is renaming it the \"Taco Liberty Bell.\" 2004 - The National Public Radio show \"All Things Considered\" runs a story about the post offices' new 'portable zip codes' program. Based on people being able to keep their phone number even if they moved, the program was designed to represent \"a citizen's place in the demographic, rather than geographic, landscape.\"2008 - The BBC runs a video clip of flying penguins as part of a story for its series \"Miracles of Evolution.\" The presenter explains that the penguins escaped the cold, harsh Antarctic weather by flying to the tropical rainforests of South America. April 1, 2010 - The National Republican Senatorial Committee releases a parody web video celebrating President Barack Obama as \"truly the greatest president ever\" and that he has \"kept all his promises.\"April 1, 2013 - The Guardian announces the launch of its own augmented reality device, Guardian Goggles, which will \"beam its journalism directly into the wearer's visual field, enabling users to see the world through the Guardian's eyes at all times.\"April 1, 2016 - Google introduces \"Mic Drop,\" a Gmail feature that enables users to send emails with an animated gif depicting a minion dropping a microphone.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsJudo's rules have changed for this year with two Waza-ari scores meaning IpponChanges were first made to move away from wrestling and secure its Olympic spotFormer world champion Neil Adams argues it has made the sport the best it's ever been\n\n(CNN)It's a sport rooted in ancient traditions, but judo has earned a reputation for ripping up the rule book.\n\nJudo, as has become customary, marked the start of a new year by issuing the latest changes to its code of dos and don'ts.They are alterations that have left some fans frustrated. One Twitter user posted \"please don't change the rules for a while,\" while a Facebook commentator described the latest tweaks as \"a terrible change.\"Follow @cnnsport But former world champion and two-time Olympic medalist Neil Adams believes the ongoing rule changes have made judo \"the best it's ever been.\"Adams contends the International Judo Federation (IJF) has acted to prevent judo becoming too similar to traditional wrestling, particularly given the Olympic Games already has Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling events. Read MoreOver the years, slowly but surely, the rules have been altered to the betterment of the sport, according to Adams, although he accepts that it has divided judokas along stylistic lines.\"Obviously the wrestlers weren't happy but it's appealed to the traditionalists, who have embraced it,\" he tells CNN. \"Of course, you'll never get everyone agreeing 100% but these have for the most part been changes for the better.\"With the breakdown of the Soviet Union, there was a growth in the number of different wrestling styles coming into judo.\"The International Olympic Committee were a little bit concerned that it already had freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, and they didn't need another one.\"The initial changes stopped that and what it effectively did was ensure the sport's Olympic future.\"Vladimir Barta, the head sport director at the International Judo Federation, admitted distancing judo from wrestling was part of the ongoing push to change the rules, although he says there were no external influences on the IJF.\"We never felt any pressure from the IOC concerning judo in the Olympic program. In fact, we have even more now - for the first time judo will have a mixed team event in the Olympic Games in 2020,\" he said.Barta also argues the thinking was to increase the intensity of a contest, encouraging scoring rather than tactics and encouraging judoka to go on the offensive.Legends of Judo: Mongolian icon Tubshinbayar NaidanTokyo targetOf the latest resultant changes for 2018 -- brought into place to ensure they are well and truly part of the sport in time for the Tokyo Olympics in two years' time -- the biggest is to Waza-ari scores.A Waza-ari is awarded when a judoka pins their opponent for more than 10 seconds but fewer than 20 seconds, or executes a successful throw without the full force or control to merit Ippon.Under the changes, there has been a reversion back to the old rule where two Waza-aris equate to Ippon, a move which ends the contest between two judoka.In recent years, players could keep on racking up Waza-aris without the contest being ended. Now, Waza-ari will also be awarded for inferior throws previously deemed worthy of Yuko -- the third highest score in judo.Of that modification, Adams says: \"I thought personally the way it was with Waza-aris was pretty exciting but a lot of coaches and fighters felt differently and so that rule is back by popular demand. The International Judo Federation can't be accused of not listening to feedback as it's reacted to that.\"Adams had a key role to play in those changes within the Referees' Commission, as the IJF looks to make sure the new rules are embraced and refereed in the same way across the board globally.As part of the changes, contests will no longer be ended by penalty scores (shidos) in Golden Score. The alterations have been made, according to IJF president Marius L. Vizer, to \"make our sport a modern one, outstanding and understandable for everyone.\" He added: \"I'm convinced the new elements of the rules and judo method will be a great benefit for the judo family, spectators, partners and media.\"And if Adams is to be believed, the previous changes have already improved judo as a spectator sport.READ: Meet supercoach Kosei Inoue\"Another big thing behind it [the changes] is rewarding positivity and not negativity,\" he adds. \"Referees, coaches and players know that negativity is punished.\"Imagine the frustration of watching a football match where one team just defends and doesn't do anything else. It's not great to watch. In judo, the rules are done to make sure such negativity doesn't happen.What do you make of the latest changes to judo's rules? Have your say on CNN Sport's Facebook page\"People always go for the path of least resistance and, with the way the rules were previously, people could be coached to win by the easiest way possible and that was negatively. The changes have altered that, and it's certainly better from a spectator's point of view.\"",

For a start there's the irrepressible Andres Iniesta, who is still at the heart of Spain's midfield, pulling the strings, conjuring sublime assists. \"It's amazing to play with him,\" says Villa, 36. \"You have a feeling he doesn't see you but he sees you. He knows where you are. You need to be ready always.\"Who do you think will win the World Cup? Have your say on our Facebook page.The strikersLopetegui may not be able to call on Villa, scorer of 59 international goals, but the manager does have Diego Costa and Alvaro Morata at his disposal. Both strikers have not been in top form this season -- after a promising start to his debut season at Chelsea, Morata's form has fizzled out of late and he has scored just 13 goals in 38 games, though he did score in Chelsea's 2-1 FA Cup victory over Leicester on Sunday.The former Real player has been left out of March's friendlies, against Germany and Argentina, but Atletico Madrid's Costa is in the squad and the former Chelsea man knows how to score goals. ExperienceThough a number of Spain's golden generation have retied key, experienced players still remain. Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos is as fearsome in defense as ever and against Germany on Friday the captain will make his 150th appearance for La Roja. Between the sticks they have Manchester United talisman David de Gea, while in David Sillva Spain possess one of the standout performers in this season's English Premier League.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)John Bolton said on Thursday that his past policy statements are \"behind me\" and that, after taking over next month as President Donald Trump's national security adviser, \"The important thing is what the President says and the advice I give him.\"\n\nBut Bolton's history of provocative, often bellicose pronouncements, typically in the form of calls to bomb countries like Iran and North Korea -- along with his unwavering support, before and after, for the 2003 invasion of Iraq -- are impossible to pass off, especially as Trump considers tearing up the Iran nuclear deal and prepares for talks with Pyongyang. What follows is a small sampling of Bolton's rhetoric, dating back to the post-9/11 period. Back then, while working in the Bush administration, Bolton made the case at home and abroad that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and that the US role in the aftermath of regime change in Iraq would be \"fairly minimal.\" Trump, by the way, has pointed to his own opposition to the Iraq war as evidence of his smarts. Bolton also publicly accused Cuba of providing \"dual-use biotechnology to other rogue states.\" Years later, after leaving his post as ambassador to the UN, he pushed to expand the Iraq War into Iran. More recently, he's pushed for unilateral strikes in Iran and North Korea, while casting doubt on Russia's role in 2016 election-related hacking.He made the case last month for striking North Korea 'first'Read MoreCiting preemptive strikes by Israel on Syrian (2007) and Iraqi (1981) reactor sites, Bolton in February of this year -- less than four weeks ago -- made a case in the Wall Street Journal for a potential US attack on North Korea: \"Pre-emption opponents argue that action is not justified because Pyongyang does not constitute an 'imminent threat.' They are wrong. The threat is imminent, and the case against pre-emption rests on the misinterpretation of a standard that derives from prenuclear, pre-ballistic-missile times. Given the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute. That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation.\"He suggested election hacking was a 'false flag operation' designed to frame the RussiansIn December 2016, Bolton said he wasn't convinced the Russian had a role in pre-election hacking.\"It's not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation. The question that has to be asked is, why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary's server but their dumb intelligence services against the election?\"He seems to have changed his mind; is now advocating heavy retaliationIn an opinion piece filed after special counsel Robert Mueller returned indictments alleging conspiracy to defraud the US against a group of Russian nationals, Bolton wrote:\"One way to (deter Russia) is to engage in a retaliatory cyber campaign against Russia. This effort should not be proportional to what we have just experienced. It should be decidedly disproportionate. The lesson we want Russia (or anyone else) to learn is that the costs to them from future cyberattacks against the United States will be so high that they will simply consign all their cyberwarfare plans to their computer memories to gather electronic dust.\"He said a diplomatic option for dealing with North Korea was to 'end the regime'Asked by a Fox News host if there were any \"diplomatic options\" remaining in the nuclear standoff with North Korea, Bolton suggested this:Bolton: \"I think the only diplomatic option left is to end the regime in North Korea by effectively having the South take it over. You've got to argue with China--\"Fox News host Trish Regan: \"That's not really diplomatic! (Laughing) As far as they're concerned.\"Bolton: \"Well, that's their problem, not ours. Anybody who thinks that more diplomacy with North Korea, more sanctions, whether against North Korea, or an effort to apply sanctions against China, is just giving North Korea more time to increase its nuclear arsenal...\"He compared -- to laughter and cheers -- former President Barack Obama to a 'Muslim king'In a speech to the American Freedom Alliance conference in August 2016, Bolton drew applause when he said this of Obama at the beginning of a speech on Muslim countries and their politics:\"King Abdullah of Jordan, who is not simply the Muslim king of a Muslim country, unlike our president... (laughter and cheers) ... King Abdullah and other political leaders in the Middle East have said this is a civil war within Islam.\"He desperately wants to scuttle the Iran nuclear dealIn Janaury of this year, again in the Wall Street Journal, he argued that the administration take more forceful steps to break the terms of the pact:\"Spending the next 120 days negotiating with ourselves will leave the West mired in stasis. Mr. Trump correctly sees Mr. Obama's deal as a massive strategic blunder, but his advisers have inexplicably persuaded him not to withdraw. Last fall, deciding whether to reimpose sanctions and decertify the deal under the Corker-Cardin legislation, the administration also opted to keep the door open to 'fixes' -- a punt on third down. Let's hope Friday's decision is not another punt.\"He also touched on a common theme in his writing, going back at least to former President George W. Bush's \"Axis of Evil\" speech, that connects Iran and North Korea: \"Little is known, at least publicly, about longstanding Iranian-North Korean cooperation on nuclear and ballistic-missile technology. It is foolish to play down Tehran's threat because of Pyongyang's provocations. They are two sides of the same coin.\"He took -- and seems to take -- the 'Axis of Evil' line literallyRewind to August 2002 and remarks made during talks between the North and South Koreans, when Bolton defended the expression and insisted \"it was factually correct.'' This is from the New York Times report:\"In a strongly worded speech, the official, John R. Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control, cited what he said was 'a hard connection between these regimes -- an \"axis\" along which flow dangerous weapons and dangerous technology.'\"He argued in favor of Brexit, touting the UK's strong negotiating handAhead of the Brexit vote in 2016, Bolton wrote in the New York Daily News that the UK would enter potential EU exit negotiations with the upper hand. (Things have been somewhat more difficult than he figured.):\"EU stalwarts like German Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble have tried to scare Britain by proposing obnoxious exit terms. The rhetoric is hollow bluster. The advantages of free trade and easy movement of goods and financial resources between Europe and Britain, whether or not the latter remains part of the former, will dictate that Britain and the EU negotiate Brexit terms that are mutually advantageous. ... There is an inherent economic risk in abandoning arrangements and institutions built up over time. But in the sweep of European history, the EU is a newcomer. It makes sense for Britain exit now rather than wait until disaster strikes.\"Before the deal was done, he wrote an op-ed calling on the US to bomb IranShortly before the framework of the Iran nuclear deal was set in place, Bolton wrote a piece headlined, \"To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran.\" He even considered outsourcing the job to Israel:\"Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed. ... An attack need not destroy all of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, but by breaking key links in the nuclear-fuel cycle, it could set back its program by three to five years. The United States could do a thorough job of destruction, but Israel alone can do what's necessary. Such action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran's opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran.\"He (still) believes leaving Iraq was a worse decision than invading itBolton became Bush's under secretary of state for arms control and international security in May of 2001 and remained in the job for about four years, during which time the US invaded Iraq under false pretenses, before taking over as ambassador the United Nations via recess appointment. Asked in 2015 about the decision to go to war, here's what he told the Washington Examiner: \"I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct. I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces. The people who say, oh things would have been much better if you didn't overthrow Saddam miss the point that today's Middle East does not flow totally and unchangeably from the decision to overthrow Saddam alone.\"He wanted to bomb Iran during the Iraq warIn 2008, Bolton called for strikes inside Iran as part of a bid to cut off Tehran's aid to insurgents in Iraq. Asked by a Fox News host what he thought would \"happen next\" if the US attacked, he downplayed the potential for widening the war: \"I think the Iranians need to look very carefully at what risk they would run if they were to escalate. The idea here is not to have much larger hostilities, but to stop the Iranians from engaging in the hostilities that they're already doing against us inside Iraq. And they're doing much the same by aiding the Taliban in Afghanistan. So this is not provocative or preemptive, this is entirely responsive on our part.\"He downplayed the short- and long-term dangers of war in IraqIn the run-up to the Iraq invasion he made the case for regime change to the BBC. Here's one of his arguments in favor:\"I think the Iraqi people would be unique in history if they didn't welcome the overthrow of this dictatorial regime. And Iraqi opposition leaders of a variety of positions and views are discussing now what will happen after Saddam Hussein. I expect that the American role actually will be fairly minimal. I think we'll have an important security role. I think concluding the destruction of the weapons of mass destruction themselves will be important. But I think fundamentally the recreation of a hopefully democratic Iraqi government -- that must rest with the Iraqis.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Seven days before national security adviser H.R. McMaster \"resigned,\" President Donald Trump insisted that reports that McMaster was on his way out as part of a broader staff shakeup were totally and completely wrong.\n\n\"The story was very false,\" Trump said last Thursday in response to a slew of reports -- including by CNN -- that, in the wake of the removal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, more changes were coming, with a focus on McMaster. \"They wrote a story about staff changes that was very false,\" said Trump. \"It was a very false story ... a very exaggerated and false story.\"Except that it wasn't.Later that same Thursday -- in the wake of even more reports that Trump had decided it was time for McMaster, specifically, to go, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders took to Twitter to push back.Read More\"Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster -- contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC,\" she tweeted.The following day, which was exactly one week ago today, at her daily press briefing, Sanders was pressed on her tweet and the reports about McMaster. Here's how she responded (I am excerpting her answer in full because it's a wow):\"I -- again, like I said last night, and I'll echo it again, I spoke directly to the President last night. He asked me to pass that message along to General McMaster. I know the two of them have been in meetings today. Whether or not that came up, I don't know.\"But again, our focus is not on a lot of the news stories that you guys would like us to be focused on, but we're actually focused on what the American people want us to do, and that's to come here and do our jobs.\"General McMaster is a dedicated public servant, and he is here not focused on the news stories that many of you are writing, but on some really big issues: things like North Korea; things like Russia; things like Iran. That's what he's doing, and that's what we're going to continue to be focused on every single day that we show up for work.\"That also wasn't true.And this is hardly the first time the White House has cried \"fake news\" about a story of staff turmoil that later -- and not even much later -- wound up being 100% accurate.On Saturday March 10, The New York Times wrote a story detailing unrest within Trump's legal team and reporting on the possibility of Emmet T. Flood, a lawyer on Bill Clinton's team during his impeachment, signing on to help Trump. The piece contained these lines: \"But there have been signs in recent months that Mr. Trump may be looking to shake up his legal team and change his approach to Mr. Mueller's investigation.\"At 10:41 am on Sunday March 11, Trump launched into this pair of tweets: \"The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and ... have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access.\"Not true. Again.Eight days after the original New York Times report, Trump brought Joseph di Genova, a lawyer and conservative talking head, onto his legal team. Three days after that -- aka Thursday -- John Dowd resigned as Trump's top personal lawyer.We've long known of President Trump's casual disregard for the truth. In the course of his first year in office, he said more than 2,000 -- 2,000! -- things that were all or mostly false, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker.\"The President is not a fact-based president,\" acknowledged Newsmax CEO (and Trump confidante) Chris Ruddy on Thursday. \"He is a salesman. He is probably the greatest salesman the country has ever produced. ... Having known him for many years, when I hear him say something that I take as an exaggeration, I see it as a rhetorical device.\"But there's a very fine line between exaggerating and just plain old lying. And Trump seems to stray across it fairly frequently.What the events of the past 10 days should remind us of is that anything and everything that comes from this president and this White House -- especially denials of so-called \"fake news\" -- needs to be looked at very, very skeptically. In fact, their track record suggests that we should not assume that what the White House is saying on virtually anything is based on take-it-to-the-bank facts and reality.Which is a very scary proposition.",

Six surviving whales had been returned to the sea as of 7.00 p.m local time (7.00 a.m. ET), Western Australia's Parks and Wildlife Service said.\"Unfortunately, most of the whales beached themselves on dry land overnight and have not survived,\" Incident Controller Jeremy Chick said.Chick said moving the whales by nightfall was logistically challenging because of the rocky beach terrain and rough seas.

Melissa Lay, manager of the Hamelin Bay Holiday Park, told Reuters on Friday that it was the second mass stranding she had seen during her 15 years in the area. \"There are some that are still alive but barely,\" Lay said. \"The last time it happened, none survived.\"Short-finned pilot whales have a dark coloring with a pink underbelly and are known to inhabit tropical and subtropical waters. Authorities said it was not uncommon for migrating short-finned pilots to get stranded. The largest mass stranding of whales in Western Austraila took place in 1996, when 320 long-finned pilot whales stranded themselves in the coastal town of Dunsborough.The incident prompted authorities to issue a shark alert over concerns the carcasses could attract the predators to the shoreline. It remains unclear why whales and other marine mammals get stranded, but experts say it can be a combination of factors, from old age, illness or injury to accidental navigation errors.\"The strong social bonding of some species of whales can cause mass strandings,\" Project Jonah, a New Zealand-based whale charity, told CNN last year.\"One of the most common patterns with mass strandings is that one or two whales will initially strand. These animals will send out distress signals and members from their pod may attempt to help or mill slightly offshore. A receding tide will then catch these animals out and soon the whole pod will become stranded.\"",

However, some in the game say there is more to slow play than the self-absorption of millionaire golfers terrified of making mistakes.\"There are times when it's unpalatable, horrible to watch,\" says Englishman Eddie Pepperell, who won his maiden European Tour title in Doha last month. \"I saw a couple of clips of Kevin Na, and that wasn't cool. And what JB Holmes did was disrespectful. But the reality is, an acceptable amount of time for a three-ball depends on the toughness and length of the course.\"READ: Tiger Woods sparks 181% TV audience boost Horses for coursesOn top of that, he argues, the modern golfer is more analytical than in previous eras.\"I played with a teenager in a pro-am, and he was taking ages over his shots,\" says Pepperell. \"I said to my caddie, 'It's our fault that this young lad is taking this long. He's been told that it's the right thing to do.'\"But, says Pepperell, if he backed off every time he had a negative thought, he'd take six hours every round. \"We're human beings, we have negative thoughts, you've just got to get on with it,\" he says. On the flip side, weekend warriors boasting of how quickly they play compared to the pros are not taking tournament venues into account, according to Pepperell's European Tour colleague Laurie Canter.\"I'm not saying there aren't slow players, but it makes me laugh when I read tweets from 15-handicappers saying, 'It takes me two-and-a-half-hours to get around my local course,'\" says Canter.\"That may be, but put them on our courses, make them finish every hole, and then see how long their round would take.\"He points out that as well as layouts getting longer, the whole infrastructure around modern courses, often designed to be played in a buggy, can also have an impact. \"I played a course a couple of years ago that had four-minute walks from greens to tees on every hole. That's an extra hour of play, and it all adds up,\" he says.Slow play or poor play?Often slow play is just a manifestation of poor play, particularly among high handicappers, and Canter is cautious of draconian measures.\"Are you going to penalize players for playing poorly?\" asks the 27-year-old. \"And it's going to happen more at majors, because of the extra challenge of major golf courses. I've played two (British) Opens, and both times it took an incredible amount of time to play my rounds.\"The argument that pro golfers are playing for vast sums of money -- or, indeed, their futures on tour -- and therefore have every right to take their time is anathema to some.But others empathize with Australia's former world No.1 Jason Day when he said he had no intention of speeding up his play, and that he's \"got to get back to what makes me good. If that means I have to back off five times, I'm going to back off five times\".'Important shots'Players deemed to be slow are warned and \"put on the clock\" by officials -- if they then fail to speed up they are given a one-shot penalty.But despite the stigma attached, the PGA Tour has only penalized two players since 1995 (Miguel Angel Carballo and Brian Campbell were docked a shot at the Zurich Classic last year, although that was in a team event, in which their timings were combined). And many players have stated that nothing will change unless shots start being docked from serial offenders.But both Pepperell and Canter worry that such a system would be devilishly difficult to implement without causing controversy.\"How are you going to implement a policy that makes slow players play faster without penalizing the faster players who occasionally take longer over a shot because it's particularly challenging?\" says Canter.\"Think about one of the most iconic shots of all time, Tiger Woods' chip-in at the 16th at Augusta in 2005: it took him two-and-a-half minutes to play that shot. Imagine if a referee had come out, looking important and brandishing a yellow card in the middle of his pre-shot routine. That's not realistic.\"JB Holmes took way too long, but that might be one of his most important shots of the season.\"'Keep it flowing'Pepperell says there are some simple tweaks that would speed things up, such as being ready to play when it's your turn or hitting before it's your turn if your partner isn't ready.\"It doesn't matter who plays when, let's just keep it flowing,\" says Pepperell, who also thinks the etiquette around avoiding other players' putting lines could be looked at to reduce the length of time spent on greens.Pepperell and Canter are divided on green books -- diagrams depicting the contours on the putting surfaces; the former thinks their banning would make rounds quicker, the latter thinks it might make them longer, because certain players' minds would be even more muddled without them.And Canter thinks it is up to the players to \"take responsibility\" and police themselves, with the help of the on-course referees.\"A catalog could be built up on certain players. Maybe then slow players would say, 'My peers have a problem, so I've adjusted my routine accordingly,'\" he says.\"I'm not sure it's right slagging off players for isolated incidents. We could go through the archive and find lots of incredible shots that were well over the time limit, by lots of different players. That's part of the drama.\"'Society has changed'Pepperell and Canter agree that golf is never going to be anything but a slow, cerebral spectacle, but they both say it can be made into a sexier product, given funkier television coverage and with tournaments married to other forms of entertainment -- for example, the Made in Denmark event in Himmerland doubles as a music festival.But Pepperell believes that if we all just looked at the slow play debate from a different angle, \"we might just chill out a little bit.\" \"Take the Shot Clock Masters [which will be played for the first time in Austria in June],\" says Pepperell. \"If you limit players to 40 seconds per shot, what's the best that's going to happen? We get around in three-and-a-half hours? That's still a long time. \"Golf is always going to take a long time, unless you fundamentally change the way it is played, like Twenty20 cricket.\"But I wouldn't advocate that. Golf's been around for centuries, it's society that's changed. Should golf react to the changing pace of life, or does it acknowledge that we live in a state of flux, and there might come a time when people want to slow down again and get away from the stresses of life?\"I understand why golf's appeal is diminishing, because young people's attention spans are shorter -- including mine -- and people want things here and now. But will it always be that way? I hope not.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nEthan Tussey is an assistant professor of film and media at Georgia State University. His book, \"The Procrastination Economy: The Big Business of Downtime,\" (NYU Press, 2018) details the social and economic value of mobile device use. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN)In a nation as divided as ours, it is difficult to find a topic that most people agree on -- but concern regarding our (over)use of cellphones is one of them.\n\nIt's important to remember that though new technologies have often inspired moral panic, they bend to social and economic will. Cultural critics of the 1700s thought that books were uncontrollable escapist temptations that would cause people to retreat from public life. And, in the 1800s, the telegraph inspired fears that the use of abbreviations to reduce the costs of messages would ruin the nuance of language. Similarly, contemporary critics have called smartphones, \"toxic,\" \"addicting,\" \"sleep depriving,\" and \"empathy killing.\" This concern is hardly surprising, given just how much we engage with our phones -- approximately 80 times a day. But while we reach for our phones quite frequently, most of those interactions are brief exchanges.Indeed, we are most likely to reach for our mobile devices in our in-between moments -- while waiting, commuting or taking a break. Remove the technology from the equation and ask yourself how often you have clicked a pen, fidgeted with scrapes of paper, doodled, read a newspaper or magazine, or daydreamed before the arrival of cellphones, and suddenly those numbers are not quite as ominous.Read MoreOur phones provide a greater range of on-demand entertainment and communication opportunities than previous public diversions. Research shows that instead of making us more isolated in public space, mobile devices actually make us more likely to linger and socialize.Our phones are a valuable resource for facilitating conversation and are more likely to function as a social stimulator than as an escape from those around you. Let's take commuting, as an example. Posted \"codes of conduct\" and respect for privacy have long made plane, train and bus trips solitary and isolating experiences. But, recently, I conducted a study of mass transit riders and discovered that their commute had become a key moment for socializing via their mobile devices. Over 70% of the commuters surveyed reported using their smartphones to check in with friends and family via text message and social media platforms. In other words, mobile devices transform the commute into a much-needed opportunity for social connection and creativity, thanks to digital tool kits like GIF databases, emoji keyboards, Snapchat filters, sharable content and even discreet flirtation apps designed to digitally catch the eye of a fellow rider. In addition to the commute, I studied mobile device use at the workplace and found that co-workers enjoyed on-demand streaming platforms and YouTube \"media snacks\" in ways that were more meaningful and customizable than the breakroom television. Employees took their breaks together without concern for the broadcast schedule.Instead, they gathered together around a mobile phone and accessed on-demand content that they all enjoyed as a reward for completing a task. And employees also used their mobile devices as a quick reference tool when they were discussing popular culture around the watercooler. Out-of-the-loop colleagues were able to join the conversation thanks to a text-messaged link that provided an example of the topic under discussion. Like the commute and the break room, waiting rooms are public spaces that mobile phones have transformed. Waiting rooms have long been a reminder of social hierarchies, as those with money and power rarely wait. The rest of us can assert the value of our time through the use of mobile games. Mobile games (or casual games) are simplistic, consisting of repetitive actions performed over time in small increments without end. People can earn incredible scores, achievements, and even virtual cities in their downtimeCommunities have developed that celebrate the achievements within mobile games, and special rewards are given for the creativity they display. In these communities, the games become the shared culture that bring people together and keep them socializing online for years. But the benefits of mobile devices extend far beyond commutes, offices and waiting areas -- they apply to living rooms, too.Typically, the person who controlled the remote dictated the evening's entertainment. Mobile screens provide options for those who are forbidden from touching the remote and may just keep the family all in the same room. Mobile devices also multiply the entertainment options and even offer mobile apps that act as competing remotes to stealthily change the channel at commercial breaks.Mobile phone users are not the only ones capitalizing on these in-between moments, though.Technology companies and entertainment studios have created a \"procrastination economy\" designed to monetize this downtime. I developed this term to describe the mobile apps, streaming video content and software designs that target consumer's in-between moments spent on mobile devices. We need to pay attention to the design of algorithms, subscriptions services and micropayment structures that attempt to channel our mobile device use into transactions, because mobile devices have made our in-between moments as valuable to brands and advertisers as they have to harried multitaskers. For our children, mobile phone etiquette and awareness of the procrastination economy should be taught by parents, educators and mentors in the same ways we teach social graces, civics and professionalism. I'm inspired by research that calls for us to emphasize the opportunities these technologies offer instead of reverting to the same tired finger-wagging. And there is already positive momentum in this direction. Technology companies and regulators are beginning to think about the design of software ethically and to develop guidelines that make networked communication productive instead of predatory. These conversations and adjustments are familiar as they accompany all new technologies.Discussion and debate about the \"proper\" way to use mobile phones is important, but reasonable conversation about the technology must account for context. Doing so will alert us to the fact that mobile devices have made our downtime the new prime time.",

The nationalist community in Northern Ireland sees the British as occupiers and wants their rule in the country to end.Read MoreThere is personal history too -- Queen Elizabeth's cousin, Louis Mountbatten, was assassinated by the Provisional IRA (Irish Republican Army) in 1979, using a bomb planted in his fishing boat. Three others died in the same explosion.Around 3,500 lives were lost in the decades-long conflict between pro- and anti-British forces. Although the violence largely came to an end with the Good Friday peace deal in 1998, suspicions between the opposing groups remained.When the Queen visited Northern Ireland in 2012 -- following a tour of the Republic of Ireland the previous year -- and shook hands with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, it was seen as a symbolic gesture towards peace.Prince Harry made his own visit to Northern Ireland in September last year, when he launched the peace-building initiative being celebrated Friday and visited Hillsborough Castle, the official residence of the royal family in the province. His visit with Markle comes less than two months before their wedding in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle near London on May 19. The couple is inviting more than 2,600 people, many of them ordinary members of the public from across the UK, to watch the arrival of the bride and groom and their guests.Kensington Palace has also released details about the invitations and the cake, which will be made by London-based pastry chef Claire Ptak.",

To reinforce its position, Beijing has reclaimed land and constructed military assets on a series of reefs in the Spratly and Paracel island chains in the South China Sea.In October 2017, the US Navy destroyer USS Chafee also sailed close to the Paracels, provoking a stern reaction from the Chinese Defense Ministry. \"(We are) firmly opposed to such flaunting of force and promotion of militarization in the region by the US, which could easily trigger accidents at sea and in the air,\" it said in a statement at the time.On Friday, the Chinese Navy announced it would hold live fire drills in the South China Sea at an undisclosed date and location.According to state media, the navy will hold the drills \"in the near future\" but didn't elaborate further on their timing or what they would entail. \"The purpose is to test and improve the training level of the troops and comprehensively improve the ability to win,\" state media said.The drills do \"not target any particular country,\" the report added.For many years the South China Sea has been considered an international flashpoint, as the US and China attempt to assert their influence in the region.But the ongoing nuclear crisis in North Korea and a distracted US government under President Donald Trump has diverted attention from the area, allowing the Chinese government to tighten its hold.\"The Chinese continue to pace with their long-term strategy to gain de facto control over the sea lanes in the South China Sea. And what changed is the United States stopped paying attention,\" Michael Fuchs, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told CNN in December.",

(You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n\nWhite HouseAnother whirlwind day of comings and goings in Donald Trump's world. Trump dumped national security adviser H.R. McMaster and will replace him with John Bolton, an ex-US ambassador and Fox News analyst whose hawkish views align more closely with the President's. But that wasn't the only big shakeup for Team Trump. Earlier in the day John Dowd -- Trump's lead personal lawyer in the Russia investigation -- quit, reportedly after clashing with the President over strategy. Yes, it's hard to keep up with who's in and who's out of the Trump White House. Luckily for you we've updated this chart.And then to top everything off, ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal sat down with CNN's Anderson Copper for an exclusive interview where she alleged having an affair with Trump a decade ago. Don't forget that Stormy Daniels' potentially blockbuster \"60 Minutes\" interview airs Sunday. CNN's Stephen Collinson says this \"gathering storm of televised allegations\" is testing the President's vow to stay silent on the subject.TariffsRead MoreSounds like the much-feared trade war is on between the US and China. After President Trump announced new tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, China's Commerce Ministry said it might slap tariffs on $3 billion worth of US imports. The financial markets don't like any of this. The Dow plummeted 724 points after Trump's announcement, and Asian stock markets were down sharply this morning as well.Sacramento protestsThe Sacramento Kings beat the Atlanta Hawks in an NBA game, but they did it in front of an almost-empty arena, after Black Lives Matter protests blocked entrances. They were protesting the death of Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by police in his grandmother's backyard. Police thought Clark had a gun, but only a cell phone was found on him. Police and the team made the decsion to stop admitting people into the game as hundreds of demonstrators linked arms and chanted \"Join us or go home\" at basketball fans.Government fundingLooks like lawmakers have avoided yet another government shutdown. The Senate passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill early this morning; the House passed it earlier on Thursday. President Trump is expected to sign it before a midnight Friday deadline. The legislation keeps the government open through the end of September. It increases funding for the military and domestic priorities. Lots of conservative Republicans complained about the price tag, and Democrats fumed about the lack of a DACA fix, but the bill had enough bipartisan support to get over the finish line.School shootingsA teen girl injured in this week's Maryland high school shooting will be taken off of life support. Jaelynn Willey was one of two students hurt when a fellow student -- who had a prior relationship with Willey -- opened fire in a hallway at Great Mills High School. The shooter was shot by a school resource officer and later died.Meanwhile, when students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School return to class after spring break, they'll have to wear clear backpacks. It's all part of an effort to ramp up security at the school where a gunman killed 17 people last month. Many students from the school will be in Washington tomorrow for the March for Our Lives protest.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsAbout 10% of the US population are true sugar addictsReducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds and improve your health\n\n(CNN)If you've read about the latest wellness trends, you may have entertained the idea of a diet detox.\n\nBut whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating. In fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar. But there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin. \"Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old,\" said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of \"The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great.\" \"What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging.\" Read MoreSugar addiction Here's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. \"People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar,\" Alpert said. \"We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more.\" About 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, research suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs. One of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff. \"People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night,\" Alpert said. How to sugar detox: Going cold turkey for three daysThe good news is that even if you're not a true sugar \"addict,\" by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance. \"There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets,\" Lustig said.Children can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days, every aspect of their metabolic health improved -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed. But going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.\"Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clichéd and not effective,\" Alpert said. \"It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers.\"What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate,\" she said. \"They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to.\"So for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. \"You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats.\" For example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.Though they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. \"These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is,\" Alpert said. Consuming artificial sweeteners causes \"you not only (to) store more fat,\" Lustig explained, \"you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage.\"How to sugar detox: When an apple tastes like candyOnce the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple. \"By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy,\" Alpert said. \"The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again.\" Starting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. \"Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster,\" Alpert said. You can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too. During week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash.For week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day.\"Week three should be quite livable,\" Alpert said.Week four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week. \"You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier,\" Alpert said. \"I want people living. Week four is the way to do it.\"Week four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. \"Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one,\" Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days. \"The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life,\" Alpert said.\n\nE-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: Giving up sugar is easier than you think with these 5 healthy cookbooksBenefits and cautions with slashing sugarDetoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. \"We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction,\" Alpert said. \"Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser!\" Participants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings. \"I have lost approximately 40 pounds following the sugar detox,\" said Diane, who preferred not to share her last name. She has been on the plan for approximately two years.\"I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes.\" Diane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. \"This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal.\"There are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive. \"Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue,\" Alpert said. Lustig found that the children in his study experienced anxiety and irritability during the first five days of eliminating sugar and caffeine, though it eventually subsided. \"If you feel bad, stop and have a piece of fruit. But if you can push through and stay well-hydrated, you can really break your cycle of sugar addiction,\" Alpert said.It's important to note that the plan may not be appropriate for diabetics, extreme athletes or anyone taking medication to control blood sugar. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.Finally, before starting a sugar detox, enlist the help of friends and/or family members for support. \"You need people around you to help you be successful,\" Lustig said. \"The whole family has to do it together.\"\n\nLisa Drayer is a nutritionist, author and health journalist.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsExperiencing an allergic reaction is a risk factor for developing depression Antihistamines can also contribute to sleep disturbances and grogginessAllergy shots are the only long-term option for nixing the symptoms of allergies\n\nThis story was originally published on CNN.com in 2011.\n\n(CNN)You know spring has sprung when hundreds of people daily turn to Twitter to vent about their itchy eyes, dripping nose and uncontrollable sneezing and coughing.\n\nSeasonal allergies, which affect about 36 million Americans, aren't just an annoyance; many doctors agree that there is a real connection between allergies and mood.\"'Cranky' is really the best word for it,\" said Katie Ingram, 30, of Alexandria, Virginia, a triathlete who has seasonal allergies. \"I take a lot of medication for it, and that makes me sleepy. And I can't do a lot of the things that I like to do outside, so that makes me cranky. ... The wheezing part of it makes me feel tired.\"In some people, such annoyances are more serious. Research has shown that there is about a 50% increase in the risk for depression in a person suffering allergies, and if you've been seen by an allergist, that about triples the likelihood of having depression, said Dr. Paul Marshall, neuropsychologist at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis.Those are correlations found in scientific studies, but they don't show that allergies cause clinical depression. In practice, allergy-connected mood changes usually boil down to mild depressive symptoms, like feeling sad, lethargic and fatigued, Marshall said. Some people say they're more likely to cry during the allergy season. Allergies could make symptoms even worse in a person with clinical depression, experts say.Read More\"It's important for people to understand that experiencing allergies can affect their mood,\" Marshall said.That's not to say that all people with allergies have depression or that all people with depression have allergies. But experiencing allergic reactions does seem to be a risk factor for developing depression -- not necessarily the emotional side of the condition but more physiological symptoms such as low energy.But is all of this in spite of the use of antihistamines or because of it? And is it the actual allergic reaction that causes these symptoms or just the sleep disturbances and general discomfort? The biological responseAn allergic reaction is an immune response that releases cytokines, protein molecules used in communication between cells. When they signal the brain, they induce the feelings of sickness, or being \"mentally drained,\" that often accompany the flu. This cytokine release isn't as powerful in allergies, but it's still present, Marshall said.A 2002 study Marshall led, published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, found that allergic reactions to ragweed pollen cause \"significant fatigue and mood changes\" in at least some patients. Research that Marshall collaborated on in 2000 found that such reactions could cause slowed speed of cognitive processing.Dr. Teodor Postolache at the University of Maryland led a review published in 2008 of the association between suicidal indicators and allergies. Postolache's group noted a peak in suicide rates from April to June and the dramatic environmental change of pollen that occurs during that time. The researchers found correlations between depression measurements and allergy symptoms in relation to the seasonal severity of tree pollen. In women, the association is stronger between allergy, depression and suicide than in men, perhaps because allergy and depression are more common in women anyway.Postolache's group has also explored cytokines that may be involved in triggering fatigue, hypothesizing that the allergic reaction is the direct biological cause of low mood.This parallels what happens when stress gets you down too, Marshall says. A side effect?Alternatively, low moods during allergy season could be situational -- the result of all the sneezing or side effects from medication.Studies show that people don't perform as well at school because of allergic reactions, and adults' performance at work suffers, says allergist Dr. Robert Overholt of Knoxville, Tennessee. These problems could exacerbate depressive symptoms, he said. That, combined with sleep disturbance, could make people feel unwell. Overholt doesn't believe the allergic response inherently triggers depression but says it could circumstantially make existing depression worse.\"It would jump onto depression but wouldn't be the cause,\" he said.Antihistamines themselves can also contribute to sleep disturbances and grogginess, he said.Side effects of allergy medications can contribute to irregular sleeping patterns that increase irritability. The major antihistamines in pill form are now sold over the counter -- Allegra, Claritin and Zyrtec -- but they help only with sneezing, unless specified as the \"decongestant\" form. The added decongestant benefits come with a price, though. The same chemicals that ease your throat could lead to insomnia, put more stress on the heart and lead to prostate problems in some men, Overholt said.Erik Fisher, a clinical psychologist in Atlanta, sees more people fatigued this time of year but isn't flooded with patients with allergy-fueled depression. He does see that allergies wear patients down, though.\"Once you realize what's causing your moods, it helps people feel less stressed out,\" Fisher said.Children in particular are more susceptible to vast swings in moods and behaviors related to allergies because their bodies are more sensitive, Fisher said. In some kids, when allergies overwhelm the system, they have more temper tantrums and a harder time getting to sleep.The bottom line, though, is that people shouldn't blame their allergies for deeper emotional issues, says Dr. Michael Silverman, assistant professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Even if some people have a direct mood response from allergies, that's not always the best explanation for feeling down.\"There's so much stigma associated with mood disturbance and anxiety that patients try to grab on to anything they can to explain what's going on,\" he said. \"Allergies could be aggravating a problem in their lives they don't want to deal with.\" What to do?Several types of medications are available to treat allergy symptoms, including pills, liquids, inhalers, nasal sprays, eye drops, skin creams and shots. Most work by modulating the body's response to the perpetrating allergen, either by blocking histamine -- a chemical released by the immune system during an allergic reaction -- or by reducing inflammation through the use of steroids, according to the Mayo Clinic. Some are also combined with a decongestant, such as pseudoephedrine, to relieve nasal and sinus congestion. Many allergy sufferers also find relief in over-the-counter products such as the neti pot and other nasal rinses for sinus problems.But the only way to get more complete, prolonged relief from allergies is to undergo desensitization or \"allergy shots,\" Overholt said. After an initial test to see what specific plants affect the patient, a doctor would administer small doses of the offending pollen or other substance under the skin over the course of three to five years.At the end of that time, protection from allergies lasts another three to five years on average, with some people coming out allergy-free for life and others getting relief for only a year or two.Ingram is considering allergy shots. In the meantime, she vacuums every day, takes more showers, washes the sheets more and keeps the windows closed. Her husband, who doesn't have allergies, brushes the dogs more in the spring.\"My allergies are so bad right now, I would happily claw my eyeballs out with toothpicks to make that feeling go away,\" Ingram wrote on her blog.\n\nCNN's Mark Lieber contributed to this report.",

And nowhere cool is accessible,\" said Perez, who uses a wheelchair.Once she's up there, though, the 33-year-old comedian feels right at home. \"It feels so powerful to be on stage,\" she said. \"Life is hard for everyone. To participate in something that makes people laugh -- there's nothing like it.\" But life for Perez wasn't always funny. Growing up in Los Angeles, she struggled with depression and eating disorders. Then, Perez moved to San Francisco to attend San Francisco State University, where a tragic accident changed her life.Read MoreBefore that, she was living a glamorous urban lifestyle, \"running around the hills of San Francisco in 3-inch-high heels and drinking cosmopolitans.\"One day, Perez was crossing the street to catch a Muni streetcar. She suddenly found herself in the streetcar's path. It didn't stop.\"By the time it stopped, the wheels were above my legs,\" she said.When two firefighters arrived, they started asking her questions. \" 'Can you feel your hands? Can you feel your shoulders?' Once they got to my feet, I started to freak out a little bit because I couldn't feel them,\" she said. The impact also shattered her pelvis and ruptured her bladder. When she woke up in the hospital, her mother was sitting next to her.\"The first words she said to me were, 'Danielle, you don't have any feet.' \" Adjusting to life in a wheelchairPerez was 20 years old. Her legs were amputated below the knee, and she spent the next month recovering in the hospital. \"I was in such denial about the reality. I just wanted to go and hang out with my friends. I just wanted to be normal,\" she recalled. At first, that denial helped Perez move forward. \"It allowed me to get out of the house, learn how to drive,\" she said. \"But it also delayed that healing process of knowing that people are gonna treat you differently. And some things are going to be harder.\"Like wearing prosthetics. Perez had trouble using them after having skin grafts on her legs. \"I got very depressed after that, and I gained a lot of weight.\"Making people laughBut three years ago, she found healing in an unlikely place: a comedy club. Her best friend's roommate was a standup comedian. Perez and her friend started going to his shows. \"By the third one, I was like, 'I could do this,' \" she said. \"It's that insane hubris that every person who starts standup comedy has to have. Where you think, 'Oh, that's not hard.' \"Perez took a comedy class and started going to open mics.\"I went to my first open mic at this crappy little Hollywood coffee shop, and people laughed at my jokes. And I just fell in love with it.\"Perez uses her experiences as material for her comedy routines. \"It's about my life, my family, my friends, dating,\" she said. \"I talk about the accident. I talk about my depression. ... We are all complex people, so when people see that and relate to it, it's great.\" When she performs her comedy routine, she doesn't care about what people think of her. \"When I go on stage, I'm just worried about 'are these jokes funny?' not 'what do they think about my disability?' \" she said.'The Price Is Right'In 2015, Perez was thrust into the spotlight after she appeared on an episode of \"The Price Is Right.\" Her prizes: a treadmill and a walk-in sauna. \"If you're having a crazy reaction to that, that's also the reaction the Internet had, because that video went viral,\" she said.\n\nwhen you win a treadmill on national TV, but you have no feet @DrewFromTV @PriceIsRight pic.twitter.com/NlqTG1HJPT -- Danielle Perez (@DivaDelux)\n\nMay 5, 2015\n\nShe was interviewed by news networks around the world and appeared as a guest on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\"People keep asking me what I'm gonna do with (the treadmill). And I said, 'I guess I'll just do what everyone else does and just use it as a piece of furniture,' \" she told Kimmel. That exposure helped Perez get her name out and build a fan base. \"At shows, people are like, 'Oh, it's that girl from \"The Price Is Right.\" ' \"Now, Perez performs in comedy clubs all over Los Angeles. She's come a long way since that accident 13 years ago.\"Standup comedy has helped me heal because it's really given me purpose,\" she said. \"What I try to convey is that it's OK to be yourself.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsChoosing a fasting regimen that best suits your lifestyle, your health history and your ability to sustain it High-volume foods such as soups can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods\n\n(CNN)\"Intermittent fasting,\" a dieting approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and abstaining from food, has been trending in diet circles. This is in part because reports claim that celebrities such as Beyonce, Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck and Nicole Kidman are doing it but also because increasingly more research reveals that the eating pattern may promote weight loss and improve overall health.\n\nThe method is not appropriate for everyone, however, particularly pregnant women and those with medical conditions such as diabetes or eating disorders. And though studies are promising, it remains to be seen if this type of eating can become a sustainable lifestyle habit instead of a drop-a-dress-size-in-a-week fad. \"The jury is still out, especially on how healthy, sustainable and realistic this approach is,\" said Samantha Heller, a registered dietitian and senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health in New York. \"Eating very low calories, or none, on alternate days feels punitive to many and may exacerbate an already difficult and complex relationship someone has with food.\"If you are still hoping to give intermittent fasting a try, there are some things to consider that can increase your chances of reaching your goals. Also, be sure to check with your doctor before starting a fasting regimen.Pick the level of fasting you can handleRead MoreThe appeal of intermittent fasting may be related to its simplicity, as it seems to require less effort than restricting calories every day. But there are different approaches to the eating pattern that vary in intensity. One regimen known as time-restricted feeding advises consuming all of your calories within a range of three to 12 hours a day, whereas an approach known as the \"5:2\" diet advises eating 500 to 600 calories for two days of the week and eating whatever you want on the other five days. A third, much more stringent type of regimen involves alternating 24-hour fasting periods (in which no foods or calorie-containing beverages are consumed) with non-fasting days, during which anything can be eaten in any amount. Though time-restricted feeding might not seem that different from a typical eating day, especially if you tend to skip breakfast, alternate-day fasting may cause intense hunger on fasting days and can be much more challenging to sustain.\"People who are accustomed to eating regularly scheduled meals or suffer from 'head hunger' may find alternate-day fasting extremely difficult,\" said Kristen Smith, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Head hunger is the desire to eat when you are not physically hungry but are triggered to eat by emotions and social factors.For the greatest success, Smith recommends choosing a fasting regimen that best suits your lifestyle, your health history and your ability to sustain fasting. For example, alternate-day fasting may not be appropriate for someone with an active job that requires manual labor or a job that centers around food, such as a chef.Focus on protein and fiber-rich foods on semi-fasting daysProtein and fiber-rich foods will keep you feeling full and satisfied, which is important when calories are strictly limited. Healthy fats such as nuts and peanut butter can also curb hunger but provide a lot of calories for a small portion size.If you are limiting your calories to about 500 to 600 per day, you might focus on one or two mini meals and snacks. Smith recommends a small piece of grilled salmon with half a cup of steamed veggies, grilled chicken over spaghetti squash, an egg-white omelet with veggies or black beans with a cup of veggies. For snacks, she favors fat-free plain Greek yogurt, two cups of plain popcorn, a cup of raw veggie sticks or a medium piece of fruit.High-volume foods such as soups may also help on semi-fasting days, as they can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods. Additionally, meal replacement bars may provide a convenient option, especially if you don't feel like preparing food on fasting days. Don't gorge on non-fasting daysOur bodies want to keep us alive. If we are consuming very few calories on certain days, when we do eat, our bodies are going to do everything they can to encourage us to eat a lot because they don't know when the next meal will be available, Heller explained. \"We also feel that as a reward for sticking to 500 calories or less, we are allowed and 'deserve' to eat large portions of whatever we want,\" she said. That kind of reward can bring unintended consequences. \"Overdoing it on a non-fasting day and eating excessive calories may actually lead to consuming an amount of calories you would consume in two days and defeat the purpose of a fasting day,\" Smith said. In other words, having pancakes with bacon for breakfast, a fried chicken sandwich for lunch and a cheeseburger with fries for dinner on a non-fasting day can stall weight loss and prevent you from reaching your goals.Don't go overboard with exercise on fasting daysStrenuous exercise, such as cycling, running, high-impact aerobics and weight lifting, is not advised on fasting days because the body does not have the fuel available to sustain rigorous activity, Heller explained. If you want to do some form of physical activity on those days, Smith recommends sticking with walking, stretching or gentle yoga.Drink enough waterIf you decide to avoid food for any length of time, adequate hydration is important and should be maintained. \"On a fasting day, someone may be more likely to become dehydrated because they aren't eating regularly scheduled meals, which is a common time people hydrate,\" Smith said. Foods such as fruits, vegetables and broth-based soups contain significant amounts of water and can help you stay hydrated. Those fasting should be cautious with caffeine-containing beverages, as they may contribute to dehydration, Smith said.Know when to stop If you experience lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches,difficulty concentrating or any other symptoms that regularly interfere with your daily functioning, you should stop fasting.\"If any of these symptoms occur, it might be a good time to meet with a registered dietitian to discuss other dietary interventions that might be better suited for you,\" Smith said.\n\nLisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor.",

The other two firefighters are in stable condition with non-life-threatening injuries, Helfrich said.

Michael Davidson, 37, died of injuries while fighting a fire that broke out in the cellar of a building, which was unoccupied at the time, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said in a press conference. The building, which was built in 1920, had been used earlier to film a movie, authorities said. The fire spread rapidly and continued to advance, forcing firefighters to back out of the building. During that time, Davidson got separated from the rest of the unit, Nigro said. After searching for him, Davidson was found unconscious. Despite efforts by firefighters, EMS and the hospital, they were unable to revive him. Davidson had served with the FDNY for 15 years and was cited for bravery on four separate occasions, according to the fire department's Facebook post. He is survived by his wife and four children.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A huge, swirling pile of trash in the Pacific Ocean is growing faster than expected and is now three times the size of France.\n\nAccording to a three-year study published in Scientific Reports Friday, the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 square kilometers in size and up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates.Ghost nets, or discarded fishing nets, make up almost half the 80,000 metric tons of garbage floating at sea, and researchers believe that around 20% of the total was dragged into the water by the 2011 Japanese tsunami.The study -- conducted by an international team of scientists with The Ocean Cleanup Foundation, six universities and an aerial sensor company -- utilized two aircraft surveys and 30 vessels to cross the debris field. Along with nets to survey and collect trash, researchers used two six-meter-wide devices to measure medium to large-sized objects. An aircraft was also fitted with advanced sensors to collect 3D scans of the ocean garbage. They ended up collecting a total of 1.2 million plastic samples and scanned more than 300 square kilometers of ocean surface.Read MoreThe bulk of the pile is made up of larger objects while only 8% of the mass is microplastics, or pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in size.\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Chief Scientist Julia Reisser said in a statement. \"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.'The Trash Isles'The patch is so big that last fall environmentalists called on the United Nations to declare the Great Pacific Garbage Patch a country, called \"The Trash Isles,\" complete with its own passport and currency, called debris. They even solicited 200,000 people to become citizens, including celebrities Sir David Attenborough, Chris Hemsworth and Gal Gadot. Their first citizen was \"former US vice president and environmentalist Al Gore.Research scientist Britta Denise Hardesty, who wasn't involved in this study, said while discarded nets may make up almost half of the findings, the problem may be more nuanced.Hardesty was part of an earlier study published in Marine Policy in October that also found that discarded fishing gear make up a significant amount of global marine plastic pollution. It's estimated 640,000 tons of fishing gear is lost to the marine environment each year. \"lt's not fair to just blame it on the fishermen or the top 20 countries for mismanaging waste,\" said Hardesty, principal research scientist for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. \"Instead we need to look at the true value and cost of plastics, and factor in the costs of livelihood and tourism.\" The Great Pacific Garbage Patch was first discovered in 1997 by oceanographer Charles Moore when he sailed home to Southern California after finishing the Transpacific Yacht Race, from California to Hawaii. \"I was confronted, as far as the eye could see, with the sight of plastic,\" wrote Moore about his discovery in Natural History. \"In the week it took to cross the subtropical high, no matter what time of day I looked, plastic debris was floating everywhere: bottles, bottle caps, wrappers, fragments.\"As for slowing down the onslaught of ocean garbage, Hardesty says we all can help.\"Plastic pollution in the ocean is visible and trackable,\" said Hardesty. \"We can definitely make a difference in how we vote with our pocketbook and think about each decision we make, whether we take our own bags to the supermarkets, refuse straws, bring our own coffee cups, accept single-use items or think about mindful alternatives.\"",

                "body": "Austin, Texas (CNN)The Austin bomber showed no remorse in a 25-minute \"matter-of-fact\" confession video that he recorded hours before he blew himself up, Texas Rep. Michael McCaul said.\n\nMark Anthony Conditt, 23, planted a series of explosive devices in the state capital, killing two people and terrorizing the city for 19 days this month. On Wednesday, he ended his deadly spree after he detonated one of his homemade devices inside his SUV. Since then, more details have emerged about the bomber, the type of bombs he used and how he was finally cornered. The bomber's mistakeA security camera at a FedEx store south of Austin caught Conditt's red SUV on video, McCaul said.Read MoreThe bomber went to the store on Sunday and made the mistake of parking within view of a surveillance camera that captured the vehicle's license plates, the congressman said.Surveillance photos from the mail delivery office in Sunset Valley showed Conditt wearing a baseball cap, blond wig and pink gloves as he brought two packages to the store. Investigators used cellphone technology to track down Conditt on Wednesday and to confirm that he had been to all of the bombing locations, McCaul said.Conditt had a list of addresses, McCaul confirmed, but it's unclear whether they were potential targets. Law enforcement has cleared those sites, he said.Austin's weeks of 'collective fear'Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the city's \"collective fear and anxiety\" was growing as the bomber carried the string of bombings.\"There was feeling that there was not much that we could do. There was a collective helplessness,\" Adler said Thursday at a City Council meeting.\"Our community was beginning to fray,\" he added.Austin police is asking the public to \"remain vigilant and report anything suspicious.\" Some have been breathing a sigh of relief since Conditt's death; others are still shaken up. Narcisa Velasco had rushed to help a friend, a 75-year-old woman who was severely injured on March 12 after picking up a package in front of a southeast Austin home. The sight of her blood and wounds, and the chaotic scene of nails, batteries and other debris from the bomb is haunting Velasco and her family members, some of whom also witnessed the aftermath of the explosion.\"We are sleeping with all the lights on,\" she said. The victimsThe lives of Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason were cut short when explosive packages arrived on their doorsteps in Austin, Texas.The first blast on March 2 killed House, a 39-year-old father who worked as a project manager for Texas Quarries.On March 12, Mason was killed when he brought a package indoors to open it and it exploded, police said. The 17-year-old high school student played bass in a youth orchestra, and was taking college classes.Both men were African-American. Among the injured were an African-American woman and one Hispanic woman.Prior to Conditt's death, authorities believed the bombings could be racially motivated. But police said Wednesday that Conditt did not mention anything in his video confession about terror or hate.\"I know everybody is interested in a motive and understanding why. And we're never going to be able to put a (rationale) behind these acts.\" In a statement, Mason's family thanked law enforcement saying they felt that Mason has \"received justice.\"\"The most recent chain of events have brought some sense of closure that our beloved has received justice, and we are prayerful that we can now start to move forward with our lives,\" the statement obtained by CNN affiliate KEYE states.Search of bomber's houseFederal agents searched Conditt's home in Pflugerville for almost two days, cautiously removing explosive materials and looking for clues that could point to a reason for the bombings.Investigators found components for making similar bombs to the ones that exploded in the past few weeks, but no finished bombs were spotted, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.The devices that exploded in Austin and near San Antonio were pipe bombs with batteries and smokeless powder and were constructed with materials found in a hardware or sporting goods store, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.The bombs had distinctive shrapnel inside. Some had \"mousetrap\" switches and others had \"clothespin\" switches, the source said.Two of Conditt's roommates were detained and questioned by police. One of them was released hours after Conditt's death, but the other was free to go until Thursday afternoon, police said.They were not arrested, and neither roommate was publicly identified.\n\nCNN's Tristan Smith reported from Austin, Texas, and CNN's Nicole Chavez reported and wrote in Atlanta.

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nHong Kong (CNN)The US and China hit each other with billions of dollars in tariffs this week as the two countries edge closer to a trade war, a dramatic shift in a relationship which seemed to be growing stronger under President Donald Trump as he relied on Beijing for help with North Korea.\n\n\"China does not want a trade war, but China is not afraid of a trade war,\" the country's commerce ministry said in a statement Friday. \"We are confident in our capability to face up to any challenge.\"That's a marked departure from November, when Chinese state media hailed Trump after his visit to Beijing, and the US leader remarked he had \"very good\" chemistry with President Xi Jinping.That Trump seems willing to risk a trade war with China just weeks before what's set to be a history-making meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, shows how sidelined Xi's become in efforts to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.The point is underlined by the Trump's appointment Thursday of John Bolton as national security adviser, a longtime hawk who has promoted a military response to North Korea, an option repeatedly denounced by China.Read More'Sea change' in policyWhile candidate Trump was highly critical of China, even accusing the country of \"raping\" the US on trade, as President he took a very different tack. On his visit to Beijing last year, he said he gave China \"great credit\" for its trade policies. \"I don't blame China, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens,\" he said.At the time, many analysts put this shift in attitude down to personal rapport between Trump and Xi, and Washington's desire for China's assistance in tackling the North Korea issue which has dogged Trump since his election. Trump prefaced his trade action this week by insisting he views China as a \"friend\" and said he has \"tremendous respect\" for Xi. \"They are helping us a lot in North Korea,\" Trump said. \"But we have a trade deficit ... there are many different ways of looking at it, but no matter which way you look at it, it is the largest trade deficit of any country in the history of the world.\"Euan Graham, Director of the International Security Program at Australia's Lowy Institute, told CNN the \"administration's China policy was very narrowly framed around North Korea to start with.\" But he pointed to a gradual shift in attitude, in particular a new US national security strategy classifying China and Russia as \"revisionist powers,\" a move that was denounced by Beijing as demonstrating \"Cold War mentality.\" \"That's a sea change which goes beyond the President's whims on policy,\" he said. \"It's reflective of a broader pushback which includes not just the security but also increasingly business leaders, though that does not mean there is widespread support for tariffs.\" China 'sidelined' on North KoreaWhile Trump and many of his supporters have been critics of China in the past, the fact he was willing to risk relations with Beijing would appear to show a shift in thinking in Washington on China's importance on the North Korea issue. Since the reopening of diplomatic relations between South and North Korea in January, with Pyongyang participating in the Winter Olympics and inviting President Moon Jae-in to North Korea, analysts say Seoul has been in the driving seat on engagement policy.Kim has never met Xi, and relations between Pyongyang and Beijing have been strained since the death of the North Korean leader's father, Kim Jong Il, and subsequent execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who was widely seen as China's man in Pyongyang. In recent months, Graham said, China has become \"diplomatically sidelined from the process because the South Koreans have successfully regained the initiative.\" \"China was in a rather good position (previously), in that it was sort of a win-win,\" he added. \"If North Korea came to heel, China could take credit for it, if North Korea misbehaved that took the attention away from China's own strategic challenges in the South China Sea and the Taiwan straits. Now it's not looking so rosy for China on that front.\"China's sidelining comes as a potential breakthrough with North Korea seems more likely than at any point in years, with Moon and Kim expected to meet next month -- the first time Kim has met a foreign head of state -- with the potential for a Trump-Kim summit in May. But while analysts agreed a trade dispute between the US and China did not risk negotiations, new uncertainty has been raised over the talks with the appointment by Trump of arch North Korea hawk John Bolton as national security adviser. As recently as February, Bolton wrote an op-ed arguing the \"legal case for striking North Korea first,\" and he responded to the news of a potential summit with Pyongyang by asking, \"how do you know that the North Korean regime is lying? Answer: Their lips are moving.\" Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said Bolton was a \"profoundly irresponsible\" choice. \"Trump has made the denuclearization of North Korea his signature foreign-policy initiative,\" he wrote Tuesday. \"Bolton is best known for making counterproliferation the handmaiden of war and regime change. Naming him (national security adviser) is just wild. Doing so now is even wilder.\" Graham predicted Bolton's hardline thinking \"increases the likelihood that the summit will be sabotaged in some way or that the North Koreans now get cold feet.\" Bad timing for Xi?A potential trade war with the US, which could have massive ramifications for China domestically, comes just as Xi was riding high, having begun his second term as President with an option to rule for life. Analysts had warned that Xi's new absolute power could leave him exposed were the country to face economic or other shocks, as unlike under the previous collective leadership system, there is no one else to bear the blame. \"If 'consolidation of power' was a precondition for implementing his reform program and leading the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, that condition has now been met and he needs to deliver,\" Jon Sullivan, director of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham, told CNN last month. \"And, if he doesn't deliver and refuses to go quietly, well that's a scenario we've seen play out in other regimes many times before.\"Trade war with the US could provide a dangerous challenge to Xi, but it could also be spun to his benefit, said Andrew Polk, co-founder of Trivium China, a Beijing-based consultancy. \"Xi and Trump are both playing to domestic audiences, and he has a mandate to look tough just like Trump does,\" he said. \"He can use use this as a rallying cry to get people behind his leadership ... because this is clear aggression from an outside power, it almost plays into Xi's hands domestically.\" Trump's well-known capriciousness may also help Beijing's avoid public opprobrium for any potential ramifications should things escalate. \"He is an unpredictable force, they don't even really have to propagandize it,\" Polk said. \"From a messaging standpoint it plays very well for them.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nPrenzlau, Germany (CNN)The German clinic where Dr. Janusz Rudzinski works looks more like a country manor than a hospital, less than an hour's drive from Poland, where many of his patients come from. On a bright winter day, he checks in on \"Anja,\" who's just woken up.\n\nCNN is not using her real name because the medical procedure she's had is illegal back home in Poland: an abortion. \"Basically, as a woman, you have no rights when it comes to reproductive rights,\" Anja says matter-of-factly, sitting up in her hospital gown. \"Because in my country it's illegal to undergo this procedure.\" Poland has some of the most restrictive laws in Europe when it comes to abortion. An estimated 80,000 Polish women a year go abroad or seek illegal abortions at home, according to Polish women's rights groups. The procedure is legal in only three cases: if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or if it endangers the life of the mother. Now, the government is pushing through a new bill targeting the third and -- most commonly cited -- reason for abortion: damage to the fetus. Read MoreLawmaker Kaja Godek has spearheaded getting the bill through parliament. Now, she wants doctors to stop prenatal screening to prevent what she calls \"eugenic abortion.\" \"The original idea behind prenatal tests has been completely distorted,\" she told lawmakers in January. \"Instead of treating and preparing parents and doctors to receive a child and help him, it makes it easier to choose extermination.\" More than 96% of Poles identify as Catholic and the issue of abortion here is tied not only to religion and the country's resurgent nationalist politics, but also to its history as a formerly communist country. \"Under communism, due to a lack of access to contraception, abortion was widely practiced in Poland as a real means of contraception,\" explains women's rights activist and former politician Barbara Nowacka. \"After the fall of communism, the law was tightened and now we face even more draconian measures.\" In 2015, the Law and Justice Party gained control of the government, ushering in a staunchly Catholic and nationalist agenda. Its lawmakers, urged on by Catholic groups, attempted to impose a total ban on abortion, drafting a law that threatened to imprison women seeking abortions and any doctor who performed the procedure. Tens of thousands took to the streets in protest, unifying women's groups in Poland and prompting protesting women to walk out of Sunday Masses across the country. While the government was forced to retract the proposed law, a new bill was introduced earlier this year, aimed at chipping away at the existing abortion law by eliminating one of the few ways women can legally seek an abortion. Lawmakers will debate this bill on Friday. Women's groups are planning for street protests in 50 cities across the country. Amnesty International says \"solidarity demonstrations\" will take place in other major European cities. For critics of the bill, like Nowacka, the concern is not just the impact on women, but how it will affect doctors, who will fear being prosecuted. \"The underground will grow. Abortion tourism. Women traveling to Czech Republic, Germany, UK and Ukraine, will grow again,\" she told CNN from her office in Warsaw. \"What will have even more impact is that doctors are now afraid to send their patients for prenatal exams and scans.\" Across the border in Germany, Rudzinski says he gets roughly six Polish patients a week at his clinic, in various stages of pregnancy, seeking an abortion. Half, he says, come to him after botched abortion attempts. He recalled one particularly difficult case.''A woman called me, saying she has no money and couldn't travel but needs an abortion,\" Rudzinski said. \"She had stuck a wire inside her womb but now had a 40 degrees [Celsius] fever with extreme pain. She called asking me what to do. I told her: You may have sepsis, you need to go to hospital immediately or you will die.\" For many patients here, Rudzinksi and his clinic are not the first choice. Anja says she attempted to order an abortion pill online from an Indian supplier, but it didn't show up. \"Lately, the Polish post hasn't been delivering them,\" she explains. \"They never arrived. By that time, it was several weeks gone. I knew I had to take another step and find a place to undergo the procedure.\" Rudzinski was recommended to Anja through an underground network of women's rights groups, and she says she's happy to have the procedure with a doctor who can speak her language. Anja already has an 11-month-old daughter with her husband. They plan to travel back to Poland after an overnight stay. She says she wants to have more children in the future but not right now. She also says that after this experience, she doesn't want her little girl to grow up in Poland. Her advice for Polish women seeking an abortion? \"I say just go for it and leave this country and travel,\" she says. \"Get this procedure the way it should be done. Not underground. Do not risk your health.\"",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)The question now is whether President Donald Trump can hold his tongue -- or his tweets -- amid a gathering storm of televised allegations and court gambits about his sexual conduct.\n\nStunning comments in an exclusive CNN interview by former Playboy model Karen McDougal on Thursday put the unusual seeming vow of silence Trump has observed about a trio of civil cases to which he is linked to its most critical test -- and raised the issue of how he will respond.McDougal's interview with Anderson Cooper ratcheted up already intense personal and legal pressure on Trump, and his position will only get more uncomfortable with a blockbuster CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview with adult film star Stormy Daniels on Sunday.A campaign of media appearances and legal moves by the two women, and a third, former \"Apprentice\" contestant Summer Zervos, leaves Trump in the unaccustomed position of watching mutely as his image is tarnished on television.The President and White House aides have denied the allegations by all three of the women.Read MoreBut normally, Trump would leap on Twitter or use a public event to castigate anyone who took a shot at him. After all, he's feuded with everyone from Hillary Clinton to Meryl Streep and Colin Kaepernick to Joe Biden, who took to the airwaves to rebuke him.Despite vowing to sue all the women who had accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct once the 2016 election was over, Trump has done no such thing, leaving his lawyers fighting a rearguard action against a wave of accusations in court.Trump's natural inclination to return fire to any slight or accusation broadcast on cable news was sorely tested by the content of Thursday's interview.McDougal told Cooper that she and Trump had had sex \"many dozens\" of times, that he upset her by offering money after the first time they were intimate and that they met many times over a 10-month period more than a decade ago.She also said she had been in love with Trump, and saw a loving side of the former reality star in private that was at odds with his tough public image.McDougal is suing American Media Inc., the company she said quashed her story about the alleged affair in a tabloid maneuver known as \"catch and kill.\"The company previously told CNN in a statement that McDougal \"has been free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with President Trump since 2016\" and that American Media had not \"silenced\" her.But McDougal told Cooper that she wanted her life rights to her story back because she did not benefit from promises for a series of columns and a modeling contract in the company's magazines. She also said she had initially been attracted to selling her story for financial reasons.\"I feel like the contract is illegal, I feel like ... I was lied to (by) everybody involved in this deal,\" McDougal told Cooper, denying that she had wanted to damage Trump and saying she is a Republican who voted for him in 2016.\"I want to share my truth because everyone else is talking about my truth. I need to share my story. ... I've never talked, since the day it happened. I have refused to speak publicly, privately even. My friends know, my family know, but nobody else knows. I wanted to keep it quiet. But now that it's out, I need to control it.\"Risks of Trump's deepening legal woesThe thickening legal morass around the President involving the three sex-related lawsuits threatens to deepen his legal exposure and add to the incessant chaos that whirls around the White House. While it is unclear whether the various suits have merit, if they are allowed to go forward they could eventually force the President to provide depositions. Given his demonstrated tendency not to always tell the truth he would potentially risk perjuring himself under oath, thereby taking a case from the civil to the criminal realm.And, legal experts say, the answers to questions raised in a deposition could open fresh avenues for legal inquiry and potential vulnerabilities for Trump.The personal scandals now raging around the President come at a moment when sources say he is furious that the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller is edging closer and closer to his family, including their financial histories, and the Oval Office.Tensions over the Russia investigation are likely to significantly escalate next month, when fired FBI Director James Comey embarks on a book tour, after warning the President that when he tells his story the American people will be able to judge \"who is honorable and who is not.\"Then there is the potential personal impact on the President of the flurry of explicit, embarrassing stories dominating news coverage, as well as the risk that they could strain his marriage. CNN contacted first lady Melania Trump's office for comment about the interview but there was no immediate response.Getting tough on MuellerWhile the President has skipped past multiple scandals and dramas that would have felled a normal politician and his most loyal supporters have remained faithful to him, it's possible the personal scandals could have an impact on some voters in a midterm election year.Trump's silence on the cases surrounding his alleged sexual conduct contrasts with the newly aggressive strategy he's rolling out against Mueller, amid turmoil in his legal team and the resignation of his top lawyer handling that matter, John Dowd, on Thursday.After months of avoiding direct attacks on Mueller, Trump targeted the special counsel in a tweetstorm last weekend and signed up an aggressive new lawyer, Joseph diGenova, to join his team.It's unclear how Trump's proactive strategy on the Mueller front will play out. But it is likely in his best interests not to indulge any temptation to engage with McDougal, Daniels or another woman who has claimed that he behaved inappropriately toward her, Zervos.That's because his instinct to attack has already significantly exacerbated his legal exposure on the Zervos case -- on which the statue of limitations had passed. Trump's claims that his accusers were liars allowed the Zervos legal team to resuscitate her allegations in a defamation suit.Further interventions by Trump could play into the hands of accusers and their lawyers who are are turning up the heat on the President with legal moves and media appearances.Daniels, who is trying to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement preventing her speaking about an alleged affair with the former real estate tycoon more than a decade ago, has taken to taunting Trump on Twitter.And her lawyer is warning that her case is one issue that the President -- who has taken steps to assert control over his legal strategy on the Mueller probe and on his administration with a string of personnel moves -- cannot control.\"The President may be able to fire Mueller, but he can't fire me and he can't fire my client,\" Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Daniels, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday.\n\nCNN's Kate Bennett contributed to this story",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)European Union leaders have sided with the United Kingdom in its worsening diplomatic dispute with Russia over the poisoning of a former Russian double agent, saying it's \"highly likely\" Moscow is behind the attack.\n\nAfter meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May in Brussels, the European Council released a statement condemning the attack \"in the strongest possible terms.\" It said it \"agrees with the United Kingdom government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible,\" adding that \"there is no plausible alternative explanation.\"\"We stand in unqualified solidarity with the United Kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to our shared security,\" the statement said.Former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were both exposed to a nerve agent on March 4 in the English city of Salisbury and remain in a critical condition in hospital.Read MoreAccording to the United Kingdom, they were exposed to a Soviet-era nerve agent known as Novichok, a colorless, odorless and tasteless liquid described as one of the world's most sophisticated and deadly chemical weapons.\n\n#EUCO agrees with UK government that highly likely Russia is responsible for #SalisburyAttack and that there is no other plausible explanation. -- Donald Tusk (@eucopresident)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nRussia has furiously denied claims it was involved in the attack, sparking a diplomatic crisis between the two countries. On Thursday, Russia's ambassador to the United Kingdom Alexander Yakovenko hinted at possible British involvement in the poisoning.Speaking at the Russian Embassy in London on Thursday, Yakovenko questioned how British authorities could have so quickly determined the type of poison used in the attack.\"Could it mean that it's highly likely that the British authorities already had this nerve agent in their chemical lab in Porton Down, which is the largest secret military facility in the UK that has been dealing with chemical weapons?\" Yakovenko said.Police officer released from hospitalTechnical experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons have been in Salisbury this week, collecting samples for further analysis.On Thursday, a British court ruled they could take blood samples from Sergei and Yulia Skripal to check against the analysis performed by Porton Down's research laboratory.\"The precise effect of their exposure on their long-term health remains unclear, albeit medical tests indicate that their mental capacity might be compromised to an unknown and so far unascertained degree,\" Judge David Williams wrote in his judgment allowing access to the Skripals.Court documents quoted an unidentified doctor as saying the Skirpals were both heavily sedated and unable to communicate, and that it was not possible to assess to what extent either would be able to regain mental capacity.A total of 21 people received medical attention after the incident, including Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who was released from hospital Thursday, according to a statement from Wiltshire Police.Bailey, who became critically ill after being exposed to the nerve agent, said in a statement that he'd been overwhelmed with messages of support from other officers and the public. \"I understand why there is attention on me, but all I have done is represent every police officer who goes out there every day and puts their life at risk,\" he said.'Brazen and reckless attack'Top government officials in Russia and the United Kingdom have been exchanging barbs for weeks over the poisoning and who should be held responsible.Speaking to reporters as she arrived in Brussels Thursday, May said Russia had staged a \"brazen and reckless attack\" against her country.\"It's clear that the Russian threat does not respect borders and indeed the incident in Salisbury was part of a pattern of Russian aggression against Europe and its near neighbors,\" she said.But Russian President Putin said on Sunday claims Russia was behind the attack were \"delirium and nonsense.\"\"If it was military grade agent, they would have died on the spot, obviously,\" said Putin, speaking at party headquarters in Moscow. \"Russia does not have any such agents, we destroyed it all.\"Separately on Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson compared Russia's promotion of the upcoming World Cup to Adolf Hitler's use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics.Russian ambassador Yakovenko said the remarks were \"unacceptable and totally irresponsible.\"The European Council said Thursday member states would have to coordinate on how to proceed following the attack, including what the consequences should be for Russia going forward.\"The use of chemical weapons, including the use of any toxic chemicals as weapons under any circumstances, is completely unacceptable, must be systematically and rigorously condemned and constitutes a security threat to us all,\" the council's statement said.\n\nCNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this article.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)As Congress raced toward another spending deadline, most were watching Sen. Rand Paul's objections to a proposed spending plan. But another Republican was creating more headaches for GOP leaders: Sen. James Risch of Idaho.\n\nIt all started Thursday afternoon, when Risch approached Senate Republican leadership visibly angered about a provision in the spending bill -- the re-naming of White Clouds Wilderness preserve in Idaho. The spending bill, which many consider the last major piece of legislation of the year and includes plenty of legislation beyond funding the government, includes a provision from Idaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson re-naming the preserve the \"Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilderness\" preserve, after the former Democratic Idaho governor and Interior secretary under President Jimmy Carter.As to what, in an old political rivalry, could've led to such a visceral response by Risch, aides in both parties were still trying to figure out what had occurred. At one point, a 2008 profile of Risch's political rise began circulating that recounted Risch's time as the majority leader in the Idaho state senate when Andrus, who died last year, was governor. The Idaho Statesman profile noted Risch \"clashed with Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus, particularly over education funding in the 1980s.\"CNN has reached out to Risch's office for comment and has not yet received a response. Read MoreRisch wasn't just serious about his problems with the name, he was willing to object to any vote on the bill in the near term, the sources said. As the night moved on, aides began scrambling to find a path forward. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and senior Republican staff was dealing almost entirely with Risch's issue, trying to figure out a path forward, despite the widespread attention to Paul's issue. At around 10:30 p.m. ET, as this drama was playing out on the floor, Risch and McConnell stood in front of each other talking sternly. Risch's arms motioned up and down and he could be heard from the press gallery telling the leader, \"I'm not going to consent to do anything.\" McConnell spent time putting out this fire meaning he was unable to watch his beloved Kentucky Wildcats play in the Sweet 16. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnseota Democrat, went from group to group of senators, showing them a picture of Andrus from a Wikipedia page on her iPhone and talking about the issue. There were meetings with staff and the senator in the cloakroom, just off the Senate floor. That led to a meeting in Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's office. Finally, a phone call to House Speaker Paul Ryan to lay out exactly how to get the name changed or removed. The solution, which was quietly and quickly approved on the Senate floor by unanimous consent, was in the form of an enrollment correction to the omnibus, which the House will consider at a later date. Within just a few minutes, Risch agreed to move ahead with a change to the omnibus.Earlier Thursday, Cecil Andrus' daughter, Tracy, praised the effort to add the governor's name to the wilderness area.\"Dad viewed the White Clouds as one of Idaho's crown jewels,\" Tracy Andrus told the Idaho Statesman. \"To receive this, he would have been honored and humbled.\"The Andrus family, she added, will be \"eternally grateful to Rep. Simpson for making this happen.\"\n\nCNN's Ted Barrett, Kristin Wilson and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

                "body": "MOSCOW -- On the eve of Russia's presidential election, thousands of Muscovites are gyrating in a packed concert hall; hands raised high, heads nodding to the beat.\n\nThey've come to see hip-hop quartet Kasta, who've hit the stage with an explosive set spanning a 20-plus-year catalogue. They drop the 2017 anthem \"Skrepy\" -- a term President Vladimir Putin's used in a speech about a large safety pin that could hold the nation together. The crowd knows the track well.\n\nThe following evening, at a victory rally for Putin in Manezhnaya Square, rapper Timati takes the stage for a one-song appearance before a crowd of 35,000.\n\nHe performs a love song, \"Road to the Airport,\" dedicated to the 8 million young people who voted for the first time. The song's lyrics -- \"Is this love or just sex?\" -- speak to a romantic relationship that might have run its course.\n\nIn the song's video, Timati plays a man who leaves one girlfriend for another, giving her a diamond-encrusted ring before the pair drives off to an LA sunset in a white Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe two performances illustrate the deepening rift in the genre. Russian rap has always required a certain amount of reading between the lines, but old-school rappers say newer generations of artists are absorbed by flashy lifestyles.\n\nIn a basement recording studio in central Moscow, Ptaha, real name David Nuriev, is laying down bars about keeping it real.\n\nPtaha isn't just an old-school hip-hop puritan lamenting the loss of the golden age of Russian rap -- a genre that first found its footing after the Iron Curtain fell in 1991.\n\nHe says many of Russia's newer rappers have forgone an interest in societal issues; they're either too busy navel-gazing at a superficial reality that's been packaged to them as Russia 2.0, or they're afraid to speak out.\n\nAnd it's changing Russia's rap landscape.\n\n\"They are so apolitical it gets to the point where they couldn't care less. They are afraid to say anything in case this might be misinterpreted, misevaluated, misunderstood.\"\n\nAlthough Russian rap emerged nearly a decade after it had taken off in America, it's since become mainstream, having evolved from its US roots. From mid-2013 to 2017, the number of Russians listening to rap music doubled, with the genre now one of the most popular for under 30-year-olds, according to Russia's Yandex Music. The big stars sell out stadiums in minutes and rap battles go viral within days.\n\nSome of Russia's most established rappers such as Kasta, Noize MC or Oxxxymiron have been widely praised for their intricate use of the Russian language -- their tongue-twisting lyrics a Rubik's Cube of euphemisms for listeners to unpack.\n\nLast summer, one hyped battle video between Oxxxymiron and his opponent Slava KPSS accumulated 15 million views in three days, even causing a brief political fracas, with Russia's main opposition leader Alexei Navalny celebrating the battle on Facebook as \"postmodern poetry,\" while a ruling-party parliamentarian used derogatory slang equating the rappers to low-class criminals. To date, it's had 32.5 million views.\n\nBut Ptaha says those rappers are an anomaly and that the rap scene is dominated by newcomers who lack depth -- their tunes a reflection of a society suffering from collective amnesia about the past.\n\nStereotypical tropes of cash, money and misogyny sell, but Ptaha says they sidestep the ugly parts of Russian society.\n\n\"We speak of chains and sneakers. We don't talk about major things rap was meant for. We don't speak about important things, about changes in our lives, which is getting worse while we are silent. At some point you'll understand that you've got sneakers, golden chains and armed people around you, but you've simply become a target to be robbed and killed and there's nothing you can do about it any more.\"\n\n\"We are losing the components for which we loved rap to begin with,\" he says.\n\nIn the mid-'90s, Russia's rap scene mirrored the cultural changes of the post-Soviet era. Pioneering artists like Kasta used the medium to talk freely about a newly opened world, one where free sex, consumerism and partying were topics to explore. But they also rapped about society's woes -- an explosion of easily available drugs, the rise of neo-fascist gangs and an economy in ruins.\n\nPtaha experienced that turbulent time. As a teenager who fled war in his native Azerbaijan, he suffered homelessness, battled in frequent street wars and witnessed ordered murders go uninvestigated.\n\n\"Social moments appealed to me. In (US hip-hop outfit) Public Enemy I liked their fight, their protest. I liked Ice-T's story.\"\n\n\"As any child living in Russia, I was not a stranger to the gangster story... We listened to very harsh rap and tried to behave as gangsters.\"\n\nPtaha is one of few Russian rappers who've straddled two political systems during their lifetimes. Many younger rappers (and their audiences) have grown up in a free-market Russia.\n\nPutin, who has dominated political life in Russia for 18 years, has been largely credited with forging a new national identity out of the ashes of Russia's messy transition from communism to capitalism.\n\nBut along with those perceived gains, press freedoms tightened, LGBTQ rights are nearly non-existent and safeguards for women and minorities have fallen into the shadows. The state dominates the economy, and bureaucracy pervades many aspects of daily life.\n\nThose political shifts have affected rap's evolution as well.\n\nIn 2009, rap got Putin's official stamp of approval following his appearance on the \"Battle for Respect\" TV show. After two terms as president, the then-prime minister applauded rappers for bringing societal issues to the forefront, saying that although the street rap was rough, they'd brought a certain \"Russian charm\" to it.\n\nDuring Putin's 2012 presidential campaign, rapper Timati filmed a commercial in support of the candidate and was invited to Putin's post-election party, where the two were photographed holding up a victory sign. Today, Timati is one of Russia's best-known rappers, with several clothing and production companies.\n\nOther, newer artists, like Ivan Dryomin, 20, who raps under the name Face, have used ultranationalist themes in their work. In the video for his song \"I'm Dropping the West,\" he rides on a large bear (a well-known Putin trope), humps the Empire State building, raps on a burning American flag and shuffles around the screen clad in Gucci clothing as Capital Hill burns in the background. In a February interview with Dazed magazine, Face said the video was meant to \"exaggerate and mock Russian pseudo-patriotism.\"\n\nManagement for both Timati and Face did not respond to CNN's requests for interviews.\n\nAndrey Nikitin, editor-in-chief of the Flow, an online publication about music, argues that rap generally hasn't been a politicized genre in Russia and that rappers have always seized the best opportunity for themselves.\n\nTake Timati, for example: \"At certain points supporting Putin has become part of his image. But a couple of years before that, he had a track called 'Questions' where he critiqued him.\"\n\n\"I don't remember rappers speaking against the war (in Chechnya) or any other timely social issue. They would be just as successful making their statement in their neighbor's kitchens -- but on the other side, it's the musing of young people who just simply don't have mature political views.\"\n\nBut Ivan Smekalin, 31, co-owner of the DiG record shop, says he recalls a time when rap was almost defined by social protest.\n\nInside his shop in a trendy Moscow neighborhood, Smekalin plays an '90s record from Bad Balance, one of Russia's hip-hop pioneers.\n\n\"You listen to the lyrics of these bands -- and you can't understand what they want to say. It's a Russian poetic tradition -- that's why the lyrics are so difficult sometimes,\" he says.\n\nWhen rap moved to the mainstream in Russia there was a parallel movement to challenge those ideas, Smekalin says, but he doesn't think it's happening anymore.\n\nLike Ptaka, Smekalin cites a generational divide.\n\nYoung people born into Putin's Russia know nothing else. Life, compared to their parents' generation, is far better.\n\n\"They just want to have money, spend money and all this consumerism stuff. They just want to have fun. Not only young rappers here but all the young people in their 20s - they just want to hang out and chill.\"\n\nThose were turbulent times, he says.\n\n\"Political fiascos were rife and politics were raw -- people could see these problems out in the open more easily. But now, Russian politics is different.\"\n\nPeople can't see what's happening because the propaganda has become more streamlined, Smekalin argues.\n\n\"You can think that everything is fine here -- you don't see garbage all over the street, there's lots of cafes and parks. That is why I think lots of young people can't catch what the government is doing -- it's polished.\"\n\nSo is some of the rap.\n\nAt the Kasta concert, budding photographer Ilya Elin, a full decade younger than Smekalin, describes why the group's old-school dedication to social lyricism is important to him. It's shaped his worldview.\n\nWhile packing up his camera equipment backstage, Elin explains that Kasta's acerbic lyrics are an antidote to a political system that doesn't speak to him.\n\nDiscouraged by the \"inevitability\" of Putin's fourth term in office, Elin said he wouldn't be voting the next day, going instead to photograph another band.\n\n\"There are many strange things happening in the country now and in one way or another they are disapproved by people. The best way to show that is through music, because there is very little that can be said through print media.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)John Bolton promised President Donald Trump that \"he wouldn't start any wars\" if he were hired to be the third national security adviser at the White House in just 14 months -- a claim that generated skepticism across Washington.\n\nBolton, a hawkish neoconservative, has advocated war with Iran and a pre-emptive strike on North Korea, and remains an unapologetic supporter of the Iraq War despite the flawed intelligence used to justify the US invasion. So the claim that Bolton would avoid conflict, described to CNN by a source familiar with negotiations between the President and the former ambassador to the UN, raised eyebrows when news broke Thursday that Trump was ousting H.R. McMaster and replacing him with the 69-year-old Baltimore native.For many, the concern is that the appointment of Bolton -- exactly the kind of advocate for US overseas intervention that Trump pilloried on the campaign trail -- marks a belligerent turn for the Trump administration that could doom attempts to save the Iran nuclear deal, increase the possibility of a clash with North Korea and ratchet up tensions with Moscow.Bolton drew praise from some Republican senators, including South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, who said the Yale law school graduate will do \"an outstanding job,\" but a veterans group called the appointment \"frightening\" and advocacy groups warned that Trump was assembling a \"war cabinet.\" Read MoreThe anxiety is as much about Bolton's track record -- a disdain for diplomacy, a thirst for military adventures and accusations that he manipulated intelligence in the lead-up to the Iraq War -- as it is about the role that he will now play in shaping US foreign policy. The national security adviser's job is to act as a synthesizer of security issues across the administration, coordinating and summarizing for the commander in chief the various policy suggestions that come from the Pentagon, the State Department and other agencies. A national security adviser offers his or her own analysis, and then conveys the president's policy decisions back down the chain and makes sure they're carried out.But many express doubt that Bolton is wired to put aside his own views and offer the kind of impartial summary of diverse policy views that would help a president weigh all options, instead of emphasizing the more hawkish positions he prefers. \"I think my long-standing hope for a fix to the Iran deal just died,\" Mark Dubowitz, the CEO of Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a longtime critic of the international pact, tweeted Thursday. \"Time of death: Afternoon of March 22, 2018. Now what?\"Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said, \"Ambassador Bolton's stated positions on today's major issues, most notably North Korea's and Iran's nuclear programs, are overly aggressive at best and downright dangerous at worst.\"\"Let there be no mistake -- there is no war for regime change, anywhere, that John Bolton wasn't for,\" said Jon Soltz, an Iraq War veteran who serves as chair of VoteVets. \"We are undoubtedly closer to a war in Korea now, and a war with Iran, with John Bolton as national security adviser and with Mike Pompeo as the nominee for secretary of state.\"Some foreign policy analysts reported that the concern extends to US allies. \"I've spent the past week in Seoul and Tokyo,\" Abraham Denmark, director of the Asia Program at the Kissinger Institute, said in a tweet. \"One question they raised repeatedly was if Bolton will be appointed\" as national security adviser. This question, Denmark said, was \"always asked with a mix of incredulity and dread. Asian allies will worry this indicates diplomacy is a farce and that military action is more likely.\"\n\nI've spent the past week in Seoul and Tokyo. One question they raised repeatedly was if Bolton will be appointed APNSA. Always asked with a mix of incredulity and dread.\n\nAsian allies will worry this indicates diplomacy is a farce and that military action is more likely. -- Abraham M. Denmark (@AbeDenmark)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nA rumpled dresser with a walrus mustache and a cantankerous manner, Bolton was in the running to be Trump's secretary of state and since then has made visits to the West Wing every few months to discuss foreign policy and national security.He'll start his new job on April 9 with deep experience, having served in the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Along the way, though, he drew accusations that he had manipulated intelligence on weapons of mass destruction before the Iraq War, kept information from Secretary of State Colin Powell and was abusive to subordinates with differing views at the State Department, where he served as the undersecretary for arms control.Among neoconservatives, Bolton is admired for his dismissal of the UN and his promotion of the US as the world's sole significant power. To that end, many see a welcome rigor ahead in the way the Trump administration will approach potential talks with North Korea and ongoing skirmishes with Russia, which intelligence officials say continues to try to interfere in US elections.Harry J. Kazianis, director of Defense Studies at The Center for the National Interest, said Bolton's hire \"is bad news for those who were hoping the Iran deal would somehow survive. That deal is RIP as of right now.\"Kazianis also sees an unyielding approach to North Korea and the planned summit meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un in May. \"Bolton will not tolerate any sort of games from Pyongyang,\" Kazianis said, referring to Pyongyang's pattern of demanding economic concessions in exchange for talks. \"If the North Koreans ask for bribes or incentives to talk, look for the administration to snap to an even harder line -- think maximum pressure on steroids,\" he said.And on Russia, despite Trump's repeated conciliatory tone toward President Vladmir Putin, Kazianis predicts that, \"the appointment of John Bolton might be Moscow's worst nightmare.\" Bolton himself spent Thursday insisting through intermediaries and in an interview with Fox News, where he has worked as a commentator, that while he has strong views, he would channel only the President's wishes and \"absolutely go along with Trump.\"In the interview with Fox, Bolton said his past comments are now \"behind me\" and what matters is \"what the President says.\"\n\nCNN's Elise Labott, Kaitlan Collins and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Protesters marched into City Hall in Sacramento, California, and onto an interstate highway Thursday as the mayor called for calm after police killed an unarmed black man they believed had a gun.\n\nSacramento police said the two officers fired at Stephon Clark, killing the 22-year-old, who was in his grandmother's backyard after a chase. Investigators said they did not find a weapon, only a cellphone. Protesters called for the arrest of the two officers and demanded to see police Chief Daniel Hahn as they marched into City Hall. The protest, which was organized by Black Lives Matter Sacramento, briefly spilled onto Interstate 5 after the group left City Hall. \"A phone is not a gun,\" protesters chanted.\n\nProtestors chanting inside city hall #Sacramento #StephonClark pic.twitter.com/dOasbmGXwR -- Lemor Abrams (@LemorAbrams)\n\nMarch 22, 2018\n\nLess than an hour before the protest, Mayor Darrell Steinberg said Clark's death warrants a thorough review of the shooting, and of police policies and procedures. Read More\"It is vital that we give voice to the pain in our community, especially the African-American community,\" the mayor said.Steinberg said, \"I feel the community's anguish.\" He called for the public not to rush to judgment until an investigation is completed. \"Emotions are understandably high. People are anguished,\" he said. \"I understand it and we understand it. I urge our community to remain peaceful.\"The incident began on Sunday after 9 p.m., when Sacramento officers responded to a report that a man had broken car windows and was hiding in a backyard. They pursued a man who hopped a fence into the grandmother's property.The shooting was captured by the two officers' body cameras and a police helicopter; that footage was released on Wednesday.Steinberg said officials release police body camera footage earlier to the public since the fatal shooting in 2016 of Joseph Mann, a mentally ill man. Officers fatally shot Mann after they tried to run him down in their cruiser. Police were responding to 911 calls of a man armed with a gun and knife, according to recordings released by police. Mann did not have a gun but held a knife.He had mental health and drug problems, his family said. On the day of his death, he could be seen on the police videos acting bizarrely and making strange gestures as he walked in the street. The Sacramento County District Attorney's Office said the officers were justified in shooting Mann to defend themselves and protect the public, according to a memorandum. Mann and his family reached a $719,000 settlement with the city last February, CNN affiliate KTXL reported. The two officers fired 18 times at Mann, according to the memorandum. On Sunday, officers fired 20 times at Clark, hitting him multiple times, police told CNN affiliate KOVR. The body camera videos show the brief encounter between police and Clark, lasting less than a minute, from the moment one of the officers yelled: \"Hey, show me your hands. Stop. Stop.\"Police said the officers entered the front yard and saw the suspect along the side of the home. Police said the man \"turned and advanced toward the officers while holding an object\" extended in front of him. \"Show me your hands!\" one of the officers yelled. \"Gun, gun, gun.\"Seconds later, officers opened fire as they took cover near a wall. As more police arrived at the scene, someone is heard asking \"What did he have on him?\"An officer responded \"... something in his hands. It looked like a gun from our perspective.\"Clark's family members have disputed the police account. Clark's grandmother said she was inside the house when the shots were fired, and saw her grandson with an iPhone. Stevante Clark, Stephon's brother, said the two often stayed at their grandmother's house. \"They said he had a gun. Then they said he had a crowbar. Then they said he had a toolbar,\" Stevante Clark said on HLN. \"What is a toolbar?\"\"If you lie to me once, I know you'll lie to me again.\"He said his brother was a father of two. He was stylish and got regular manicures and pedicures. \"He was like Ric Flair,\" his brother said, referring to the stylish wrestler. \"He was an entrepreneur. He would make money selling shoes ... playing online for video games.\"\n\nCNN's Eric Levenson and Madison Park contributed to this report.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nJames A. Gagliano is a CNN law enforcement analyst and a retired FBI supervisory special agent. He also serves as an adjunct assistant professor at St. John's University in Queens, New York. Follow him on Twitter: @JamesAGagliano. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN)The Austin, Texas, serial bomber, 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt, was, according to Austin Police Chief Brian Manley, a \"very troubled young man.\"\n\nBy every measure of investigative and tactical resolution metrics, Manley and his department did a masterful job of working closely with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- more commonly known as ATF -- to identify and track down the diabolical mastermind of six detonated devices that killed two people, in addition to himself, and injured five. Yet many have criticized Manley's genteel and ostensibly well-intentioned description of the bomber, who began his reign of terror with targeted bomb package deliveries in largely minority neighborhoods.Police have recovered an apparent cellphone \"confession\" following a dramatic confrontation with the killer that resulted in him initiating an explosive device that took his life and injured a SWAT operator. We have yet to see the recorded message transcript, but Manley described it thusly:\"He does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate ... it is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.\"This attempt at an understated characterization of the killer has resulted in some debate in media circles and on social media platforms. The Washington Post directly confronted the debate with the headline: \"Austin bomber: 'Challenged young man' or 'terrorist'?\"Read MoreHowever, it would be unfair to presume that Manley was selectively characterizing the assassin in less condemnatory prose because he was white. When law enforcement officials brief the media in the midst of an ongoing investigation, they must purposely be curt and circumspect in their language and word choice. And in addressing the question posed by the Post's provocative headline, it's important we define precisely what \"implicit bias\" refers to -- the \"attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions and decisions in an unconscious manner.\"Any person who commits the type of atrocities that this bomber has is a deranged, depraved sociopath. He clearly exhibited extreme anti-social behavior, seemingly bereft of conscience. One needs no medical degree to make this clinical assessment. Let's also acknowledge that we exist in binary \"pick a side\" times. And the side you adhere to tends to assume the absolute worst about the other. Ergo, statements by law enforcement -- instruments of the state -- are certainly, and deservedly, scrutinized to the nth degree. But should we assume the chief's statement as an indication that white reprobates are treated differently, as a product of implicit bias, than a person of color would be in the commission of the same offense?Well, over the past couple of days, internet content has proliferated highlighting a cascading selection of paint swatches: lighter the hue, you are \"mentally ill\" -- a \"challenged young man,\" perhaps. Dare you possess a darker skin pigmentation, you'll be damned as a \"terrorist.\"Is this a fair characterization of society's perceptions? It has been my experience over a quarter-century of law enforcement experience that criminal motivations in mass killings often come down to these narrowly defined motivations: terrorism, hate, mental issues, anarchy, or a pursuit of the \"rectification\" of grievances and grudges.And yes, often times there is overlap. Certainly, anyone who elects to end innocent lives has mental issues. But let's explore some of the motivations I enumerated above.Terrorism, by the standard the FBI employs, is related to the unlawful employment of violence or intimidation in the pursuit of specific aims.When someone is identified as a \"jihadist\" -- via social media platforms or written \"manifestos\" discovered in the wake of their shootings, bombings, or vehicular assaults -- this makes for a fairly simple designation.This should also apply -- but often doesn't -- in the wake of a neo-Nazi or white supremacist assault or murder of innocents. The only salient differentiation is related to citizenship. US citizenship characterizes one a \"domestic terrorist,\" while those hailing from another country are labeled \"international terrorists.\"What some have justifiably decried is the current President's haste and almost demonstrable glee in rushing to Twitter-characterize a jihadi attack as \"terrorism,\" contrasted to his reference to the Austin bomber as \"a very, very sick individual\"And defining something as a \"hate crime\" is a delicate endeavor as well. The definition is often referred to as criminal activity motivated by animus toward a person's race, sexuality, religion or creed. But it is predicated on a necessary absolutism in gauging motive and may dangerously infringe on freedom of thought and expression.As an experienced law enforcement professional, I have always ascribed to psychoanalyst Theodor Reik's \"third ear\" listening technique that champions a gleaning of deeper layers of meaning in communication forms. So when Austin police initially surmised that the bomber's motivation may have been to \"cause mayhem and death,\" my third ear intuited this may have been the work of an anarchist. After all, the purpose of anarchy is to sow chaos and disorder. It could also be fairly concluded that the original three package bombs were addressed to and delivered to homes on the east side of Austin in predominantly minority neighborhoods. Law enforcement could easily conclude that this might have been the work of a white supremacist. The fourth bomb, a tripwire switch, victim-activated device detonated on the west side of Austin injured two white males and was viewed as a target of opportunity bomb. Police have yet to identify the addressees on two packages shipped to a FedEx distribution facility in Schertz. If those packages -- one that detonated and another that was recovered intact -- were also addressed to minority residences, we very well could be closer to determining this serial bomber was directing his violence at persons of color -- making it a possible hate crime. Motive determination is an imprecise science and the pursuit of it must remain free of an investigator's own internal prejudices. Rush to judgments should never be a condition of a fair, impartial, and unbiased process.And sadly, the results of its pursuit don't always end with a neat, satisfactory and complete conclusion. So, investigators, internet sleuths and US presidents alike should always endeavor to check their implicit biases at the door when seeking to weigh in on complex motivations. As some things just aren't so black and white.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump's pick to be CIA director, grew up on US Air Force bases overseas, is a fan of Johnny Cash and had her first day in the CIA's Counterterrorism Center on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nShe was born in Ashland, Kentucky, the oldest of five children, is an avid Kentucky Wildcats basketball fan and dreamed of going to West Point before she ultimately embarked on a 33-year CIA career that could culminate in her becoming the first female director of the agency.Those were some of the biographical details the CIA provided to Congress on Thursday to better introduce -- and humanize -- the nominee to senators amid opposition from some Democrats and at least one Republican for her role in the George W. Bush administration's controversial detention and interrogation program.Haspel's biography is largely unknown because of her lengthy undercover career.Her extended bio, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes as the Trump administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee are in discussions about how much of her record should be declassified as part of the confirmation process. She's been on Capitol Hill this week making her initial rounds meeting with the committee and with senators, ahead of a confirmation process that has not been scheduled because she hasn't yet been formally nominated for the role.Read MoreHaspel's confirmation is shaping up to be a bruising fight, as senators are demanding details about her role at a \"black site\" in Thailand in 2002.Haspel, who is currently deputy CIA director, was not at the black site during the brutal interrogation and waterboarding of al-Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah, a detail several news outlets had reported incorrectly following her nomination, but she later ran the site after he was transferred and when other prisoners were interrogated using harsh tactics critics say are torture.Senators also want to know her role in the CIA's destruction of tapes from interrogation sessions of terrorism detainees. Those episodes are not included in the CIA's two-page biography, which was obtained by CNN. The CIA declined to comment Thursday.The bio emphasizes Haspel's long career of service, which began before she joined the CIA.It says Haspel wanted to go to West Point, and her father had to tell her at the time that the Army academy did not admit women. After she graduated from the University of Louisville -- while remaining a fan of the rival Wildcats -- she worked as a contractor with the 10th Special Forces Group at Fort Devens in Massachusetts.She then applied to join the CIA, with a love of foreign languages and a desire \"to be part of something bigger than just me,\" the bio quotes her as saying. Her first job was as a case officer in Africa, an experience she is quoted as describing as \"right out of a spy novel.\"She received the George H.W. Bush Award for Excellence in Counterterrorism while working overseas when she received word that two terrorists linked to an embassy bombing were coming to the country and she put together the operation that led to their arrest.Haspel requested a transfer to the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, the bio says, and her first day on the job was September 11, 2001. \"She walked in amid the commotion, sat down at a computer, and got to work. She didn't let up for three years, often working seven days a week,\" the biography says.The end of the bio mentions her affinity for Johnny Cash, noting her office has a number of overseas mementos, along with a 5-foot-tall poster of the country music legend \"as a symbol of American individualism.\"\n\nCNN's Jenna McLaughlin contributed to this report.",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A number of independent Russian media outlets have boycotted the State Duma, the country's lower chamber of parliament, amid a sex scandal involving a senior lawmaker.\n\nThe Duma's ethics committee on Wednesday cleared Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma's committee on foreign affairs, of multiple allegations of sexual harassment.CNN was unable to reach Slutsky for comment.Three female journalists have accused Slutsky of behaving inappropriately toward them, saying he tried to grope and kiss them against their will. They've come forward in a climate in which sexual harassment is widespread, and the #MeToo movement is roundly mocked by members of parliament.Read MoreCNN spoke with Ekaterina Kotrikadze, one of the women who has openly accused Slutsky of misconduct. \"My story is, as it appears, one of many stories from female journalists covering the Duma,\" Kotrikadze, now deputy chief editor of New York-based RTVI television, told CNN. \"He [Slutsky] invited me into his office and closed the door. Without any words or discussion, he pushed me to the wall and tried to kiss me and tried to touch me,\" said Kotrikadze, who was working for a Georgian television station at the time. \"After that I went back to Georgia, not even thinking about declaring something publicly because the times were different. I thought that it was my fault.\" Kotrikadze broke her silence last month after two female journalists spoke out anonymously about similar incidents with Slutsky in an article on the website of Dozhd (TV Rain), an independent broadcaster. \"Very brave women journalists in Moscow are doing the right thing,\" Kotrikadze said. Slutsky has denied the allegations, writing on Facebook on February 23: \"Attempts to make Slutsky into a Russian Harvey Weinstein look like a cheap and crude provocation ... and are bound to fail.\"Russian media reacts The decision to exonerate Slutsky has sparked outrage among Russian media, with a number of outlets pulling their reporters from the lower house of parliament. Moscow-based radio station Ekho Moskvy announced on Thursday that it would stop sending its journalists to the Duma, as they deemed it an unsafe place to work. The station was joined by news agency RBC, TV Rain and RTVI channel in recalling reporters entirely. Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin responded in kind by revoking their accreditation. Both Kommersant newspaper and Lenta.ru website said in company statements that they were breaking off all ties with Slutsky. The newspaper Vedomosti said its reporters won't work with Slutsky or any of the members of Duma's Ethics Committee in the future. Speaking with reporters in a daily conference call on Thursday, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, repeatedly batted away questions about the chairman. \"Does the case of the ethical and moral behavior of the deputy Slutsky interest the Kremlin at all?\" a reporter with Bloomberg asked, following a series of questions by Kommersant and Meduza online newspaper. \"Are the norms of behavior that were considered normal in the Duma also considered normal in the Kremlin?\" Peskov refused to comment. 'They aren't going to leave this alone' While she wasn't surprised by the committee's decision, Kotrikadze said she was shocked by the language that lawmakers used in delivering the verdict. \"I was astonished by the tone and the words and attitude demonstrated yesterday,\" Kotrikadze said. \"They were trying to attack the journalists, including myself. They called us liars, they called this a political campaign timed before the elections in Russia.\" Committee members said the timing of the complaints, which coincided with the Russian presidential election campaign, signaled \"selectivity\" on the part of the female journalists and suggested that their steps had been staged, Russia's state-run news agency Tass reported.But she was heartened by the response from other media outlets, who have banded together. \"I really think that the reaction of my colleagues, and lots of Russian media outlets, is the best thing I could imagine. This is the first time in Russian history that the journalists have not obeyed the decision of the state,\" she said. \"They aren't going to leave this alone.\"\n\nCNN's Nathan Hodge contributed to this report from Moscow.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)It's in a mother's nature to help her children, but one group of moms is doing what it can to help students across the nation.\n\nEleven mothers from metro Washington, D.C. banded together to find free housing for students coming to March For Our Lives on Saturday. The march is a student-led demonstration for school safety and stricter gun safety laws, created after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting in Florida killed 17 people in February.These moms know students have the march planning under control, so they created March For Our Lives Lodging to support their efforts.\"We're moms and it's natural for us to help kids to address their logistics challenges and their other challenges, so it was a natural place for us to contribute,\" said Deanna Troust, one of the co-founders of March For Our Lives Lodging. \"I think moms are pretty good at recognizing it's not about us, which is a critical part of our effort. Moms are just here to help.\"The group's goal is to eliminate any barriers to students attending, whether it's cost or not having a place to stay, Troust said.Read More\"You can't just go and book a hotel room when you're underage. And it's a fortune to stay in a hotel here,\" the mother of two said. \"There's a lot of support for these kids. A lot of [them] have chaperones but some don't.\"It all started with one tweetElizabeth Andrews sent out a tweet on February 18 saying she would help find free lodging for kids coming to the march, thinking nothing would happen. She only had 28 followers and she rarely tweeted.\"Nobody ever liked one of my tweets. I took a gym class and two hours later I had almost 1,000 likes. It was just crazy,\" the mother of an 18-year-old said.\n\n#MarchForOurLives As a DC resident and mother of a high schooler, I'll help to find free lodging for kids and their families coming to this March. -- Elizabeth Andrews (@EbethinDC)\n\nFebruary 18, 2018\n\nAndrews was overwhelmed by the volume of responses. A student from Iowa State asked where she and others from her dorm could stay. A mother from California sought a place for her and her two children. The rest of the messages came from her own community, with people across Washington offering to open up their homes to marchers for free.Andrews said she's never been \"a joiner\" and never enlisted in the PTA. But the one little tweet became something she couldn't ignore.\"I felt like I really had to do something. I could never live with myself if I didn't do something,\" the corporate tax lawyer said.She text messaged Troust, her friend of 20-plus years, \"'Oh my gosh, there's enough energy around this,'\" Troust said. \"We thought maybe this is something we can do. We're all moms and we're used to doing logistics for kids.\"As Andrews began researching, she realized there was a real need for an organization that provides housing. \"I looked for a group who does lodging for this and I realized there wasn't one,\" she said.Andrews and Troust, a strategic communications expert, joined forces with a few other mothers they knew. And Andrews connected with other mothers wanting to help via social media, bringing the group to 11.The women met up in late February and within a week or so, they launched a website, social media pages and assigned themselves roles. It was the first time many of them had met in person.Matching 500 guests based on the best fitThe group shared the registration page with PTA networks, churches and local community groups to spread the word. Local and national media reports about their efforts helped too.Registrations for guests and potential hosts flooded the March For Our Lives Lodging website. The group matched more than 500 visitors with hosts. And, more than 1,600 people offered up their homes until the registrations were capped on Wednesday. \"It's the most intense level of volunteering that you can do. You open your home to someone, have them stay there and have meals with them,\" Troust said. \"It's a very high level of involvement that all these people were wanting to do without question.\"The mothers created a spreadsheet to match guests and hosts, as well as a Slack channel to stay organized with all the requests.Two members of the all-mother team worked to match guests with the right host families. Some homes took in a couple students traveling together, while larger groups were sometimes split up between a few houses on the same block, Troust explained.Organizers called guests to learn more about them and see if there were parts of town they preferred in a \"hands-on process,\" she added. And hosts weighed in if they already had children of their own that may get along well with a certain type of guest. \"They're having the experience of meeting someone they don't know and finding common ground on an issue,\" Troust said. Some of the guests will be attending the march alongside their host families.Before a guest and a host were even accepted, part of the team went through the registrant's social media profile to make sure the person is who they say they are. After conversing with the guest, the team connected them to a potential host, who took it from there. Andrews also created a terms and conditions form for people to sign off on.The detailed planning and the idea that mothers are helping students find places to stay afford a certain level of trust in the parents of the guests.A group of Oregon teens are flying to Washington by themselves to attend the march. After they registered on the website, one of their mothers was relieved to speak with one of the lodging organizers.\"The mom was just over the moon at being to connect to someone, that we talked to her,\" Troust said. \"She suddenly felt comfortable because she was talking to someone for real.\"March For Our Lives Lodging is also the \"preferred lodging provider\" for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas alumni association, said Andrews. However, many of the MSD students are traveling to and from Washington in the same day, so they don't need lodging.Other groups around town had similar goals to match marchers with free housing. A few of those host collectors merged their lists into the March For Our Lives Lodging database. DC Teens Action, a student-led group from Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, Maryland, ran their own operation to find hundreds of students places to stay.\"We're about supporting kids and making peoples' lives better. This is not a competitive thing,\" Troust said. \"The more the merrier.\"Hosts who weren't matched are helping in other waysThe number of people who volunteered to take in students was three times the student housing demand. Troust said the group has found other ways for the hosts who didn't get guests to participate.These people are hosting potlucks and sign-making parties the night before the march. Other people have offered to fetch students from the airport or bus station. All of these will be opportunities for locals to connect with the marchers.Some of these people have said, \"'We're thankful that you're doing this. Do you need money? Can I make dinner for a host family? Can I pick up people from the bus station or the airport?' I've never seen anything like it. It restores your faith in humanity,\" said Andrews.In the final stretch before the march, Julia Beck of the lodging group is making snack bags for the marchers. Volunteers will deliver the sustenance to students on the day of the march.\"Now we're enriching the experience,\" Troust said. \"We found a lot of people places to stay and now we're trying to make it as good as it can be.\"'I'm hopeful with this group of kids'The momentum brought forth by the MSD students behind #NeverAgain and now the March For Our Lives has given Andrews and the other mothers a lot of hope.\"I think that I'm hopeful that with this group of kids, it really is a tipping point,\" Andrews said. \"It just feels like it's going to keep going.\"She says the March For Our Lives has also reinvigorated a network of people in Washington who are willing to help.\"There's been a lot of negativity in this town lately, and for the past 18 months. We don't always see it but there's this community that's here and ready to reach out,\" Andrews said.When the march is over, Andrews said she and others will be thinking about \"how to keep this positivity engaged.\"Troust said she feels \"blessed\" to see how their lodging matching program grew and she sees potential.\"We could do more of this. It could be a platform. Maybe for a different event, or issue or different city,\" she said. \"It seems as if we're onto something in terms of connecting people.\"",

The two committees had requested 1.2 million pages of documents from the Justice Department, Goodlatte's office said.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Democrats are touting that the massive new spending bill will now allow the federal government to conduct gun violence research, but Republicans argue such research was never prevented in the first place.\n\nSo who's right? Well, basically both sides. A 'chilling effect' In 1996, Congress removed $2.6 million -- the amount the Centers for Disease Control spent on gun research the year prior -- from the CDC's budget and passed the so-called Dickey Amendment, named after the late Republican Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas. Critics of the amendment say it ultimately lead to the Centers for Disease Control halting gun violence research.The legislation stated: \"None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.\"Read MoreDickey, in an op-ed with former CDC official Mark Rosenberg for The Washington Post in 2012, described himself as the \"point person\" for the National Rifle Association in Congress when the amendment was passed and said the legislation \"sent a chilling message\" to the CDC, which had sponsored multiple studies on gun violence in the decade prior. While the government still did limited amounts of research after the amendment, it's true that the legislation had the \"chilling\" effect that Dickey mentioned, as it sparked a self-imposed ban on gun research at the CDC, whose leaders cited a lack of funds. Even when President Barack Obama ordered the CDC to conduct research after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the agency still held back.Before he passed away last year, Dickey reversed his position from 1996 and urged the government to carry out research on gun violence. Once former enemies in the gun control debate, Dickey and Rosenberg -- who was in charge of gun research at the CDC from 1993-2000 -- teamed up to champion the same message: There's no reason why the government couldn't spend money on research to prevent gun violence, just like it spends millions to prevent traffic deaths.\"We were on opposite sides of the heated battle 16 years ago, but we are in strong agreement now that scientific research should be conducted into preventing firearm injuries and that ways to prevent firearm deaths can be found without encroaching on the rights of legitimate gun owners,\" they wrote in the 2012 op-ed.Amid a spate of mass shootings in the past decade, Democrats have been calling for a full repeal of the Dickey Amendment to send a message back to the CDC to resume research. The powerful National Rifle Association, however, has long supported the amendment and argued that the amendment itself didn't prevent gun violence research -- only advocacy -- and therefore didn't need any changes. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also argued at a recent congressional hearing -- which took place after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting -- that the Dickey Amendment did not prohibit research.\"My understanding is that the rider does not in any way impede our research mission. It is simply about advocacy,\" he said. When pressed again on whether he would \"actively speak out\" and \"be proactive on the research initiative\" as it relates to guns, Azar responded that \"we certainly will.\"\"We are in the science business and the evidence-generating business,\" he added. \"So I will certainly have our agencies working in this field, as they do across the whole broad spectrum.\"A clarification Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a freshman Democrat from a Florida swing district, formally introduced the latest language on the CDC and declared its adoption in the massive funding bill as a \"major breakthrough\" on Twitter. \"It's a victory for our country & children. Our work to stop gun violence will continue,\" she wrote.The legislation does not repeal the Dickey Amendment, but in a concession to Democrats, it offers what one Republican aide described as a \"clarification.\" The bill still says the CDC can't use taxpayer funds to promote gun control, but it also refers to Azar's comments stating the CDC can still conduct research. \"While appropriations language prohibits the CDC and other agencies from using appropriated funding to advocate or promote gun control, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has stated the CDC has the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun violence,\" the bill states.By codifying the secretary's comments into report language for a bill that's expected to become the law of the land, the remarks gain additional legal significance than simply a committee statement. This strategy also allows both side of the aisle to argue they won, so to speak. Republicans don't appear as though they're promoting gun research -- by saying it was already legal -- while Democrats can argue it was a modest victory because the language is more explicit and sets a precedent any subsequent HHS official would need to follow.A spokeswoman for the NRA, Jennifer Baker, maintained the spending bill changes nothing about the Dickey Amendment.\"Not a single word in the amendment changed the prohibition on using taxpayer dollars to advocate for gun control,\" she said. \"It's never been prohibited. I guess for folks who can't read or do not understand the English language, it helps them understand.\"Sean Kirkendall, director of policy at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said he expects the clarification in the spending bill to have a \"dramatic impact\" in the world of gun violence research, saying it should remove concerns of backlash from Congress at the CDC. \"It further signals and lets those folks know there's nothing to fear.\"He described the 1996 amendment as the initial freeze and Dickey's reversal on his position in recent years, coupled with Democrats calling attention to the amendment's effect, as efforts to chip away at the iceberg. \"We're no longer really in the Ice Age when it comes to this,\" he said.Meanwhile, Democrats on Capitol Hill are hopeful that the clarification will spur the CDC into action.\"Proud of the progress to set aside the research ban imposed by the #DickeyAmendment to allow the @CDCgov to research gun violence in America,\" tweeted Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat.\"This is long overdue,\" tweeted Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat.Meanwhile, some described it as a modest victory in the overall gun control battle. \"That's good,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, while referring to the language. \"But these are baby steps when we need real reform.\"\n\nCNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report.",

Randazza is a First Amendment attorney and managing partner of the Randazza Legal Group. Follow him on Twitter @marcorandazza, and read his academic publications here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN)A Scottish comedian was literally convicted of a crime for making a joke.\n\nMark Meechan, of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, was found guilty in Airdrie Sheriff Court of a \"hate crime\" on Monday. His \"hate crime?\" His girlfriend constantly annoyed him by saying how cute her dog was. He wanted to annoy her back, so he filmed himself teaching her little pug, Buddha, to raise his paw any time he said \"Sieg Heil.\" He also put the dog in front of a TV playing Adolf Hitler speaking at the 1936 Olympics and asked the dog, \"Do you want to gas the Jews?\" Meechan posted the video on YouTube with the title \"M8 Yer Dugs a Nazi,\" -- Scottish for \"mate, your dog is a Nazi.\" At the end of the video, he clearly says that he is not racist, but just wanted to annoy his girlfriend. Sheriff Derek O'Carroll said in court: \"The accused knew that the material was offensive and knew why it was offensive. He would have known it was grossly offensive to many Jewish people.\" Certainly, it is offensive to many people (\"It is grossly offensive. It stuns me that anyone should think it is a joke,\" Ephraim Borowski, director of the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities, told the court).Read MoreBut in a society that reveres free speech, that has to be beside the point. The best humor is transgressive. From Lenny Bruce to George Carlin to Dave Chappelle to Sarah Silverman to Chris Rock, the best humorists have used that rich spice shaved off from the fruit of painful or taboo subjects to craft their humorous commentary.Whether it is about the cuteness of a pug, or how foolish Hitler himself may look when addressing a canine audience, humor and discomfort must often hold hands. Break that bond and we are left with third grade knock-knock jokes and \"take my wife, please\" level humor. Despite hearing from Meechan that the video was merely a joke, and he had no intent to offend anyone (aside from his poor girlfriend), he was found guilty of \"being grossly offensive,\" which is a violation of Section 127 of the UK Communications Act, which prohibits \"grossly offensive, indecent, obscene, or menacing\" electronic communications.In a free country, the worst punishment would likely be his girlfriend yelling at him. But this happened in the United Kingdom, a place where political correctness has completely run amok. Because his actions \"caused offense,\" he now faces up to six months in prison. It can't happen here on this side of the Atlantic, you say? You would be wrong. Our neighbors to the north in Canada have certainly caught this loathsome disease. What we should all call \"protected speech\" has resulted in prosecution. For example, Canadian political gadfly Ezra Levant republished \"Mohammed cartoons,\" in Canada after they sparked unrest in Europe. Levant stated that since the cartoons were newsworthy, it was his right to republish them. However, in 2006 he faced a complaint before the Alberta Human Rights Commission for doing so. (The case drew wide press coverage; the head of the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada ultimately dropped the complaint.) Could the United States descend into such madness? Not under the First Amendment, as I interpret it. However, this kind of craziness does not collectively spread over society all at once -- it comes to us incrementally. And, we are moving in the wrong direction -- if you think less freedom is the \"wrong direction.\" Had Meechan been a college student in the United States, it is a virtual certainty that he would have been disciplined. College administrators, under the shroud of \"intersectionality,\" regularly discipline students for less.I, myself, was once accused of \"hate speech\" at the University of Massachusetts for putting up a poster from the punk band the Dead Kennedys -- wherein there was a swastika with a red circle and a line through it. Forget that the symbol over the swastika is the universal symbol for \"anti\" -- someone was offended, and that was all that was required. Our online public squares are no less subject to such arbitrary stupidity. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have all become increasingly bold in their efforts to suppress speech that someone there decides is \"offensive.\" However, there is little predictability or logic to their decisions, and they have long appeared to tilt toward protecting liberal speech while suppressing conservatives. This does not have the same chilling effect as criminal prosecution for \"offensiveness.\" However, it has perhaps a stronger effect upon the marketplace of ideas. Meechan may be held up as an example, a warning to others that they should avoid being \"offensive.\" However, our Silicon Valley internet overlords use the same nebulous thinking and the same censorious desires to flush ideas they think they do not like. You might say \"so what?\" You might think that \"offensive\" speech is of low value, so who wanted it anyway? However, if you don't believe in protecting \"offensive\" speech, you don't believe in protecting speech at all. What you deem \"offensive\" could be \"humorous\" to someone else. And what you find valuable, can very easily wind up on someone else's \"offensive\" list. With our growing tolerance for intolerance, I fear, UK-style prosecutions may be on the horizon for us. Even without them, the forces of censorship may simply make them unnecessary by suppressing all speech that someone might whine about. I, for one, have never seen fit to teach a dog to do a Nazi salute. I am pleased that I live in a country where such foolishness is allowed. However, I fear that with a growing vocal minority screaming for freedom from freedom, that allowance may be coming to a practical end. My beliefs can stand, steadfast, in opposition to a Sieg Heil pug named Buddha -- or worse. If yours cannot, then it may be you who is the offensive one.",

Bannon also had choice words about Facebook and the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who spoke to media outlets, including CNN, on Wednesday about the reports of data misuse. \"His entire business model is made up upon taking that data for free and monetizing it, and then writing algorithms behind a wall that treat you like hamsters on a wheel.

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nLos Angeles (CNN)Carol Rosenstein's husband, Irwin, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2006. Three years later, he was diagnosed with dementia.\n\nWith the progressive nature of the diseases, Irwin had ups and downs. Medication caused him to experience hallucinations. As his condition worsened and the couple grew increasingly isolated, Rosenstein said she could feel Irwin slipping away. \"Every day was like a roller coaster ride,\" Rosenstein said. \"When a terrible disease befalls a family, even your close friends don't know what to say. It feels like you have leprosy because people don't want to come near.\"June 2014 was a particularly difficult period for the couple, when Irwin was not responding well to medications. Then something seemingly miraculous happened: Rosenstein heard him playing the piano. Irwin had played saxophone and piano throughout his life. But this was the first time she heard him play in the eight years since his diagnosis. Rosenstein observed that he seemed more aware, responsive, energetic and communicative.Read More\"I was at my wit's end, and finally something positive happened,\" she said. \"The music actually resurrected him.\"Rosenstein contacted a doctor to tell him what was happening.\"He told me that I was watching music change brain chemistry,\" she said. \"Playing the piano caused him to release dopamine, and that was giving him the lift. ... I realized that no medications were more powerful than music.\"The experience led Rosenstein to start a band for Irwin and other people who have neurodegenerative diseases. \"We needed to get some musical buddies so we could all party together,\" she said.The band called itself The 5th Dementia.\"They were having so much fun playing music and socializing. ... And people were jumping on to get involved,\" Rosenstein said. \"We never looked back.\" Since 2014, her nonprofit, Music Mends Minds, has created 20 bands across the country that have improved the quality of life for more than 200 people. CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Rosenstein about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: After starting The 5th Dementia, what inspired you to turn this experiment into a nonprofit? Carol Rosenstein: It didn't take long before I recognized that we were on to something really grand. So, Music Mends Minds was born. We're in the business of creating bands in different cities where we can find people with neurodegenerative diseases who love to play music and are ready to jump on and have a good time. Bands practice once or twice a week. (It's) a safe zone for patients, for caregivers, for family members and for the entire public to come to a rehearsal and feel the magic of music and change their moods. Everybody is high on life after a rehearsal. We also organize concerts a couple of times a year for all the bands. The concerts bring great pride to our musicians and singers and offers them an opportunity to shine again.We're jamming all over the country. We've reached patients that were lost and lived without music and then we introduced them to the magic of music, and they in turn came alive and have an extension on life. CNN: As your husband's dementia progresses, what are some of his daily struggles and how has playing music helped? Rosenstein: People with dementia recognize that what they could do yesterday, they're having difficulty doing today, even if it's just articulating their wishes. They get tongue tied, their vocabulary is not accessible to them, and it's very frustrating. In Irwin's case, it's moving quite quickly now. His cognition is deteriorating. Irwin's conversational ability is deteriorating quite rapidly. And as a spouse, you recognize it because your conversational buddy is not able to articulate like he's been doing for over 30 years. And of course, I turn away and I'm heartbroken, because the reality is not pretty. But you have to be a rock and you keep on keeping on. We're making every day count. Science does show us today that playing a musical instrument is like a full body workout for the brain. It pushes natural neurotransmitters. Until science gives us a cure, we have natural medication available by playing music. The music has had such an impact on Irwin. It makes him more conversational and happier and more functional. The music resurrected him. CNN: Your work isn't just helping the band members. How do their loved ones benefit as well? Rosenstein: Living with a spouse with dementia is a difficult journey. Loneliness is something very real in a household where there's neurodegenerative disease. We are so close to all our members and their families. For caregivers to be able to socialize and make new, strong friendships, to love and hug and cry together is such a blessing. We are no longer alone on this journey. We all understand the trials and tribulations confronting all of us, and there's no explanation that anyone needs to give because we're all in the same boat. We find that this program is a powerful support group. We create extended new families, and we're just rocking. We sing at the tops of our lungs and just feel blessed that there's music in our lives.Want to get involved?

He is the author of several books, including \"The Large Hadron Collider: The Extraordinary Story of the Higgs Boson and Other Things that Will Blow Your Mind.\" Follow him on Facebook. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN)Chicken Little was right. In a very literal sense, the sky is falling. Not today and not tomorrow, but eventually. NASA has announced that on September 22, 2135 (which happens to be a Thursday, if you need to check your schedule), there is a small chance an asteroid a third of a mile across (named Bennu) will slam into the Earth with an impact energy equivalent to the currently deployed arsenal of US nuclear ballistic missiles.\n\nNeedless to say, if that happens, it will definitely be a bad day for everyone.But, not to worry, NASA has a plan. In a theoretical exercise, a team of engineers devised a conceptual design of the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response vehicle, or HAMMER. It is a hypothetical spacecraft that could either ram into Bennu or target it with a nuclear device, either of which it is hoped would deflect the asteroid away from Earth. HAMMER is not an actual NASA program, but rather an investigation into the technical challenges that would arise in building such a device. The 1998 movies \"Armageddon\" and \"Deep Impact\" were dramatizations of broadly similar efforts.While it is rather unlikely that Bennu will actually hit Earth, it is inevitable that eventually a similar one will. The probability of an impact is high for smaller rocks and decreases rapidly for larger asteroids. Read MoreIn 2013, a meteor about 60 feet (20 meters) across hit the Earth near Chelyabinsk in Russia. This relatively small rock still did considerable damage. It released about 30 times as much energy as the nuclear explosion at Hiroshima, blowing out glass windows and causing 1,500 people to seek medical attention. It was small enough that the energy was mostly dissipated in the atmosphere, although a few rocks hit Earth. At the other end of the spectrum was a meteor about 10 miles (16 kilometers) in diameter that hit the Yucatan Peninsula 65 million years ago with enough energy to wipe out the dinosaurs as a dominant form of life on Earth. This meteor left a crater about 100 miles (150 kilometers) across.Meteors like the Chelyabinsk one are fairly common, hitting the Earth every few years, while those on the scale of the Yucatan one happen perhaps every 100 million years or so. In between are impacts comparable to the Bennu asteroid, which are also fairly rare, perhaps once every 100,000 years.But even smaller meteors can cause considerable damage. And they are surprisingly common, although luckily most impacts occur over the oceans or uninhabited regions around the globe. An impact of even a modest-sized meteor could have catastrophic consequences if it were to occur over a large city. Humanity would have to intervene to avoid massive loss of life. Ideally, that intervention would be a mission like HAMMER to avoid the collision entirely.In the asteroid-deflection business, warning is everything. A small amount of force applied to an asteroid many years before a predicted impact can easily alter the asteroid's orbit, while a last minute intervention could require so much force that it might well be impossible to avoid the impact.With that in mind, NASA set up a program whose chief executive has what could well be the coolest title of any position in any organization: Planetary Defense Officer. The Planetary Defense Coordination Office oversees studies of mitigation efforts (like HAMMER and others) but also the near Earth orbit, or NEO, observations program. The Center for NEO Studies is dedicated to watching the skies, looking for large space rocks in orbits that could intersect the Earth. CNEOS has discovered approximately 18,000 near-Earth objects, with nearly 1,000 of them being over a kilometer in size. Those, of course, are the most dangerous ones. The NEO search program has existed in various forms since the 1970s. In 1998, NASA was directed by the Congressional Committee on Science, Space and Technology to look for possible threats of asteroids larger than a kilometer. The program has become more sophisticated over the last two decades. There are a bunch of NEOs out there and astronomers have found perhaps 90% of those larger than a kilometer and a lesser fraction of smaller ones. Of all NEOs found, NASA's programs were responsible for 98% of the discoveries, with other astronomers finding the others. At a very modest fraction of NASA's overall budget, this office is the sentinel, watching and waiting, warning us of potentially serious dangers. This is an important effort and one well worth our support.Will Bennu hit Earth in 2135? Probably not. But the Earth will definitely be hit again. It's not a matter of if, but when. We live in a cosmic shooting gallery and one day a bullet will head our way. And, when that fateful day comes, I very much hope that the good astronomers involved in NEO searches will have saved the day.",

                "body": "Story highlightsFareed Zakaria: To understand Vladimir Putin, you have to understand RussiaPutin understands the vulnerabilities of free societies, Zakaria says\n\nFareed Zakaria is host of CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS.\" This article is adapted from the conclusion of \"The Most Powerful Man in the World,\" which re-airs Sunday, March 25, at 10 a.m. ET on CNN. The views expressed in this commentary are those of the author.\n\n(CNN)In my latest documentary, we describe Russian President Vladimir Putin as the most powerful man in the world. But why? After all, the United States -- and China, for that matter -- are more powerful countries than Russia.\n\nThe power of a head of state is determined both by the country's strength and the capacity he or she has to exercise that power, unilaterally, unconstrained by other institutions, parties and political forces. And combining those two metrics, it's easy to see why Vladimir Putin rises to the top of list. Putin has created what he calls a \"vertical of power,\" something unlike any we see in other great nations. As the Russian chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov -- himself a harsh critic of Putin -- has noted, the entire structure of Russian political power rests on one man. When the czar died, you knew the structure that would endure and the process by which his successor, his son, would be elevated. When the general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party died, the Standing Committee and the Politburo would select his successor. But when Putin dies -- I almost wrote if -- what will happen? No one knows. To understand Putin, you have to understand Russia. The last hundred years for that country have seen the fall of the monarchy, the collapse of democracy, the great depression, World War II with its tens of millions of Russians dead, Stalin's totalitarian brutalities, the collapse of communism, the breakup of the Soviet Union, and Boris Yeltsin's years of chaos and corruption. Then comes Vladimir Putin, who ushers in stability and, in popular perception, rising standards of living and increasing prominence and respect in the world. That respect is important. Read MoreRussians have immense national pride. Russia is the largest country on the planet -- 48 times larger than Germany and encompassing 11 time zones that straddle Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Russia is also a rich country, containing some of the largest deposits of raw materials, from oil and natural gas to nickel and aluminum. Culturally, it has often thought of itself as the third Rome, preserving Christianity even as Rome and Byzantium fell to the Barbarians. Putin understands Russia. But he also understands the world. He is not foolish enough to make a frontal assault on America or Europe. Instead, he knows how to use power asymmetrically, with cyber tools and disinformation. He also understands the vulnerabilities of free societies -- their internal divisions and discord, and their gaping openness. He understands the fragility of institutions like the European Union and ideas like integration and diversity. In other words, Vladimir Putin understands us very well. But all that begs an important question: Do we -- and does Donald Trump -- really understand him?",

                "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nAlice Han is an instructor in obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School and an adjunct lecturer at the University of Toronto's department of obstetrics and gynecology. She previously served in Rwanda with Partners in Health as the women's health district clinical adviser. The ideas in this piece are based on her TEDx talk, \"Violence Against Women and Girls: Let's Reframe This Pandemic.\" The views expressed are solely her own.\n\n(CNN)The #MeToo campaign has shed light on sexual harassment and assault in shocking ways. The legal and political fallout, from Harvey Weinstein to convicted US Olympics doctor Larry Nassar, marks a shift in our culture. But noticeably absent from the conversation is how to support women's health and reduce violence against women and girls (VAWG).\n\nVAWG can be physical, emotional or psychological and has many forms, including rape, domestic abuse, child marriage, sex trafficking, and honor killings. As an obstetrician and gynecologist concerned with women's health and an epidemiologist studying patterns of disease, I have come to think of VAWG as a disease pandemic. Unlike a viral disease, the root causes of VAWG are sociopolitical, like gender inequality. But just like the virus that causes the flu, the ideas that lead to VAWG spread, infect and pose a threat to societies worldwide.Consider the facts: 1 in 3 women and girls in the world are directly affected by the most common forms of VAWG in their lifetimes -- physical and sexual intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence. This increases their risk for many serious health outcomes, including traumatic brain injury, HIV, depression and, at the extreme, death. Violence during pregnancy can also trigger a maternal stress response, increasing risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. VAWG can elude detection by healthcare providers, as it often leaves no physical marks. And it can devastate economies -- the lifetime cost of rape for all reported survivors in the United States is nearly 3.1 trillion dollars. Read MoreAround the world, many women and girls experiencing violence trust health services as a first contact. A number of women have shared their stories with me, including stories of domestic abuse, yet in my efforts to advocate for them, I've received dismissive responses from health authorities; VAWG is \"hard to do anything about,\" or it doesn't have anything to do with medical specialties. I've seen this dismissive attitude manifest itself in health professionals' attitudes and actions (or lack thereof). Just take the case of MC, a woman who was admitted to a hospital in Los Angeles in danger of miscarrying due to the actions of an abusive husband:\"I told the obstetric nurse that my husband wasn't a good person. ... Nobody asked me if he was violent or referred me to any service. ... In Stockholm a year later, after I left him and he attacked me, I went to the hospital and they just looked at my wounds. ... They didn't put me in contact with anyone or follow up with me. ... They ignored it all,\" she said.MC told me her period of abuse might have been shortened if she had received support from the medical professionals she reached out to. MC's experience is not an isolated story. In regions around the world, I've seen women and girls experiencing VAWG not receive the complete medical care they need. This includes the USA -- a study published in 2013 showed over 80% of emergency departments in the USA did not provide complete medical care after rape. There is a disturbing pattern here. Health systems around the world are often not recognizing VAWG as a health problem. According to Dr. Claudia Garcia-Moreno, who leads the World Health Organization's work on Violence Against Women, VAWG is underfunded in health budgets worldwide. Countries do not have or are slow to implement guidelines for clinicians on how to provide appropriate care. And thousands of doctors, nurses and midwives are graduating without any formal training on how to provide the care that is needed for VAWG. So, what should be done? For starters, instead of thinking of VAWG as a problem that's hard to do anything about, let's see it as a preventable disease. Strategies to prevent and reduce the number of cases won't fit into a syringe; rather, they assume the form of interventions like educational and economic empowerment programs aimed at root causes of VAWG, such as gender inequality. Evidence shows these interventions work to reduce the number of cases of VAWG -- and they don't take generations, but just a few years. For example, a study in Uganda had community leaders work with men and women to learn to equalize power dynamics over 3 years. This cut a woman's risk of physical violence from a partner in half.Everyone has a role to play in fighting this disease. Health policymakers: prioritize VAWG in budgets and develop and implement guidelines to help health providers to support women and girls. Health educators: provide training at every medical and nursing school on how to treat patients who are experiencing VAWG. Doctors, nurses and midwives: consider VAWG as a health threat to your patients. Philanthropists and funders: support scientists and programs working for gender equality and other root causes to reduce VAWG. And everyone else: voice your support for the efforts being made to eradicate VAWG. When the human body is infected by a virus, it mounts an immune response to rid the body of the virus. Let's all be a part of the global immune response against VAWG.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A new heroine is flying alongside Wonder Woman and Superman to pull Puerto Rico through hurricane Maria's aftermath.\n\nHer name is La Borinqueña. She soars through the air, performing feats of superhuman strength -- clad in a costume modeled after Puerto Rico's revolutionary flag. Come May, she'll team up with several DC comic superheroes to help the battered island. And you can help her on the mission.Origin storyRead More\"We are living in an era right now that is really celebrating superhero culture and storytelling but none of these characters are connected to real world issues,\" said creator Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez. The character was born in 2016 when Puerto Rico was in the midst of its catastrophic debt crisis.\"I created La Borinqueña because the debt crisis was not going to be paid,\" Miranda-Rodriguez told CNN. \"I thought to myself, 'If I create a superhero, maybe I can talk about what's happening to Puerto Rico through this character.'\"The hurricaneTwo weeks after Maria blew ashore, the artist sat at a Comic Con table in New York signing the first volume of his La Borinqueña comic book. He looked up to see the co-publisher of DC Comics (and fellow Puerto Rican), Dan Didio, thumbing through his book, enjoying his work.\"He literally waited 20 minutes to get to me at my table. He was wearing his Puerto Rican baseball league hat.\" \"At that moment, I felt compelled to ask him, 'What are you going to do for Puerto Rico? Can we do something together to help Puerto Rico?' He said, 'Put together a proposal.'\" Miranda-Rodriquez knew this was a job for La Borinqueña.The missionThe artist assembled dozens of Latino illustrators and writers. With super-human speed, they created the comic anthology \"Ricanstruction: Reminiscing and Rebuilding Puerto Rico.\" It includes stories from celebrities such as Ruben Blades and Rosario Dawson.At the center of the 200-page series is La Borinqueña. But she's not alone.DC Comics loaned Miranda-Rodriguez some of its famous characters to help bring attention to Puerto Rico's plight. Readers will see La Borinqueña rebuilding the island with help from Wonder Woman, Batman and Superman. \"It was an amazing act of generosity. I don't expect everyone to know who La Borinqueña is... but when they see that book on Amazon or in a comic book shop, they are going to drawn to Wonder Woman,\" Miranda-Rodriguez said. \"They are going to flip through the pages and it might be their first time they read anything about Puerto Rico, and it came to them via a comic book.\" The goalIt's been six months since Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, and parts of the island still lack electricity and reliable food. Miranda-Rodriguez hopes \"Ricanstruction\" not only helps the island financially, but also forces Americans to engage in issues that impact millions of Puerto Ricans every day. \"Ricanstruction: Reminiscing and Rebuilding Puerto Rico\" is now available for pre-order. It comes out May 23. The proceeds will benefit various non-profits working to help Puerto Rico recover.",

The screenshots provide the most robust picture of his social media activity and a wider window into his views refugees, Islam and climate change -- issues that would be central to his responsibilities in his potential posting at the United Nations. In several of the newly unearthed tweets, Isaacs shared a post that called climate change a \"hoax,\" shared a story from the conspiracy-peddling website InfoWars about the \"Clinton body count,\" and wrote \"#Islam is not peaceful.\"Read MoreIsaacs has made his Twitter account private, meaning only those that he allows to follow him can view his page. Screenshots of the tweets were provided to KFile anonymously and independently verified by matching the now-hidden tweets with still public replies from other Twitter users. Isaacs, who works in relief efforts for the Christian non-profit Samaritan's Purse, was nominated in February to serve as director general of the UN's International Organization for Migration, a 169-member group whose mission it is to promote \"humane and orderly migration\" through assistance to both governments and migrants. Isaacs has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for his social media presence after a report from KFile last week and one from The Washington Post in February revealing he shared anti-Muslim views on social media. In a statement after the February Washington Post report, Isaacs apologized, saying that he \"deeply\" regretted his comments and adding, \"I pledge to hold myself to the highest standards of humanity, human dignity and equality if chosen to lead IOM.\" According to the Associated Press, he told reports on Monday, \"I have re-tweeted many things to stimulate conversation. But at the same time ... have never shown discrimination against anybody, for anything.\"Issacs did not respond to a request for comment on this story. The State Department has pointed to Issacs' apology and expressed continued support for his nomination. Asked about the newly unearthed tweets, the department pointed to a statement that spokesperson Heather Nauert gave to the Post in February.\"Mr. Isaacs has apologized for the comments he posted on his private social media account. We believe that was proper for him to do so,\" Nauert said. \"Mr. Isaacs is committed to helping refugees and has a long history of assisting those who are suffering. We believe that if chosen to lead IOM, he would treat people fairly and with the dignity and respect they deserve. I would refer you to Mr. Isaacs for any information on his statements.\"Despite the controversy, Isaacs' nomination appears to be moving forward. A website has launched to support his candidacy and his supporters, including New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, have come to his defense.\"I've known Ken for more than 15 years, and in that period, I've utterly disagreed with him on politics and utterly admired his humanitarianism,\" Kristof told the Washington Free Beacon. \"He has been tireless in fighting for oppressed and desperate people of every faith and complexion, from Sudan to Iraq, Liberia to Bangladesh.\"\"Far from being an ideologue in his humanitarian work, Ken is a supreme pragmatist in his work to save lives, willing to work with anyone -- even liberal New York Times columnists -- to get the job done.\"In June, the IOM's members will hold a vote on Isaacs' appointment. He must receive support of two-thirds of its members to get elected. It has been a longstanding practice for members to elect the US-chosen candidate.If elected, Issacs will oversee an organization that is actively involved in resettling refugees, many of them Muslim, who have fled from the war torn regions of Iraq and Syria.Here's a look at what Isaacs shared on Twitter:On refugees:In May 2016, Isaacs responded to a tweet saying refugees should be viewed as an asset saying, \"refugees with other worldviews won't be the same as other immigrants.\"Also in May 2016, Isaacs said that Austria and Switzerland should consider building a wall in the Alps to \"control their borders from refugees.\" On Islam:In May 2017, Isaacs shared a link to an article saying Islam was not a religion of peace and warned that during Ramadan, \"Muslims fast, they also blast.\"In July 2016, after a terrorist attack in Nice, France, Isaacs tweeted out \"Nice #Islam is not peaceful\" next to a picture from the attack of a covered dead body next to a child's doll.In response to a June 2016 tweet blaming assault rifles for the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, Isaacs simply tweeted \"#Islam.\" That same day, in response to another tweet lamenting the attack in Orlando and the frequency of mass shootings, Isaacs again tweeted \"#Islam.\"In September 2016, Isaacs tweeted that \"All #Islamic #terrorists literally follow #Islam.\"In November 2015, Isaacs tweeted, \"If Islam is a peaceful religion lets see 2 million Muslims march on Nat Mall condemning jihad, terrorism, & stand for USA.\" That same month he made similar comments when responding to a tweet from British author Owen Jones, who said it was wrong to equate Islam and terrorism.In March 2017, Isaacs tweeted a link to a meme titled \"What Countries Look Like Before And After Islam,\" which included pictures of Iran and Afghanistan in the 1970s (despite Islam being the majority religion in both countries at that time), as well as a picture of white shoppers in London in 1980, juxtaposed with a picture of women wearing hijabs in 2012.In April 2015, Isaacs responded to a CNN tweet about how Islam was the fastest-growing religion, adding, \"does it include forced Islamic conversions.\" In January 2016, he compared Islam to the People's Temple, a cult founded by Jim Jones responsible for the mass murder-suicide of nearly all of its members in Guyana in 1978.On climate change: In August 2017, Isaacs retweeted a user who said climate change was \"a big hoax.\" A month later, Isaacs dismissed climate science, writing in a tweet saying, \"scientists can't predict path of a visible storm yet but certain of manmade climate change. A nutty run on nature.\"Conspiracies: In August 2016, Isaacs tweeted a link to a conspiracy story from Alex Jones of InfoWars saying Google was hiding \"Clinton Body Count\" stories, a reference to a fringe conspiracy that Bill and Hillary Clinton are linked to numerous murders over the years. In June 2016, Isaacs shared a tweet pushing a false conspiracy that a United Nations official died the same day he was set to testify against Hillary Clinton and was found with a barbell on his neck.Isaacs also retweeted a June 2017 tweet that promoted a conspiracy theory about the death of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Some significant proposals championed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and President Donald Trump were rejected in the $1.3 trillion spending bill that's making its way through Congress.\n\nDeVos and Trump proposed a budget that would have cut the Education Department's budget by $3.6 billion and funneled more than $1 billion toward private school vouchers and other school choice plans.But lawmakers rejected a number of those proposals, including slashing funding for the department's Office for Civil Rights, halving federal work study programs and spending $250 million on a private school choice program.During a congressional hearing earlier this week, DeVos defended the roughly 5% the White House sought to cut from the Education Department's funding, saying it was aligned with the goal of reducing federal involvement in education.\"When this department was created, it was charged with prohibiting federal control of education,\" DeVos said. \"Accordingly, President Trump is committed to reducing the federal footprint in education, and that is reflected in the budget.\"Read MoreFunding for charter schools did increase under the bill, up $58 million to a total of $400 million.The spending bill also includes a boost for after-school programs and adds $610 million to Head Start. DeVos and Trump had proposed eliminating the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant, which serves needy students, but the spending bill adds an additional $107 million to the program.\"After almost a decade of virtually stagnant federal funding for education, Congress has produced a Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations package that provides real increases for education,\" Sheryl Cohen, the executive director of the nonprofit Committee for Education Funding, said in a statement, noting that this bill \"is the first time in many years that Congress is addressing the need to support education.\"The spending bill would raise the maximum Pell Grant award to low-income students by $175 to $6,095; DeVos had proposed freezing the maximum at $5,920. She had also proposed cutting federal work-study programs in half, but the spending bill would add $140 million, for a total of $1.1 billion. Her budget plan also proposed cuts to the Office for Civil Rights, DeVos said, because the department had become more efficient at investigating and clearing complaints. The move alarmed Democrats and civil rights groups. The spending bill provides an additional $8.5 million for the office, for a total of $117 million.DeVos' budget sought to eliminate some grant programs that support student mental health services, a proposal she was grilled by Democrats on Capitol Hill for earlier this week in the wake of the deadly school shooting last month in Parkland, Florida.The omnibus includes a $700 million increase in funding, for a total of $1.1 billion, for a grant program that schools can use for counselors or other school-based mental health services, and an additional $22 million to reduce school violence.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsA diagnosis of bone cancer at age 11 meant Jennifer Pratt spent many days in the hospitalHoping to help change sick children's lives, she went to medical school\n\n(CNN)People say it's important to give back to your community. Jennifer Pratt is doing exactly that.\n\nShe was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, when she was just 11. The diagnosis meant she spent many days in the hospital. Pratt's chemotherapy took over a year, and because she spent so much time at Children's Minnesota in St. Paul, the hospital staff became like family to her. It was during her treatment that she decided to become a doctor and, 20 years later, she's living her dream as a hospitalist in the same place where she received treatment.\"(Cancer) is something that makes you stronger,\" she said. The journey Read MoreHer journey started when Pratt felt an unusual pain in her leg. She was referred to Children's by a pediatrician, and an x-ray revealed a tumor. Osteosarcoma is a rare form of cancer. Every year, according to the American Cancer Society, between 800 and 900 cases are diagnosed in the US. Half of those are in children and teens. The two most common treatments are surgery and chemotherapy. In certain cases, radiation therapy is used. Pratt had many sessions of chemotherapy -- spanning more than a year -- and eventually had surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. She then needed to use crutches for nine months. The chemotherapy for this form of cancer, Pratt said, is usually pretty intense and is given over multiple days in a row at the hospital. She had to go to chemotherapy sessions before and after surgery. \"I would go home and recover over the course of several days,\" she said. Her diagnosis was difficult to deal with, but she had support from family and friends -- so much that she decided to document her experience in a scrapbook. \"I think the whole journey of going through a cancer treatment is so significant and life-altering,\" Pratt said. Within the scrapbook were articles, letters people wrote to her and small words of encouragement. The most important part, she said, was making sure she and her family documented all of the positive things that were also happening, like her trip to Disney World through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. \"It was a valuable way of reflecting,\" Pratt said. At the time of her Disney trip, Pratt wanted to be an animator. She got to meet with one of the animators of the characters in many Disney movies, and that helped her get through the treatment. She was unsure what the future would hold but soon decided she wanted to help change the lives of other children -- and not through animation.Lessons from someone who's been therePratt is considered cured of osteosarcoma, and after 20 years, doctors say the cancer will not return. She graduated from Midwestern University's medical school in Chicago, and her residency brought her back to Children's. \"I have always wanted to work at Children's,\" Pratt said, because the hospital's values are parallel to her own. \"They put kids first, and that's really where my values are aligned to,\" Pratt said. \"(Working here) is a dream come true.\"Her favorite part of the job is her interaction with children every day, and she appreciates the positive feelings every time a kid is sent home with a smile, doing better than they were before. \"It's a unique experience, going through a cancer diagnosis\" at such a young age, she said. \"And just feeling the sense of understanding and being able to relate with other children that are going through a serious illness.\" Fortunately, she said, more kids are surviving cancer than ever, and she encourages everyone battling cancer to never give up. Like Children's did for her, she tries to be supportive and positive and make it easier for patients to deal with such a difficult diagnosis. \"I think that it's important to stay positive,\" she said. \"And always look to the future.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Two years ago, a bullet robbed De'Janae Gilliam of her ability to walk. But when students around the nation take to the streets for the March For Our Lives, Gilliam is making sure she's there with them.\n\nWith the help of her former art teacher Kate DeCiccio, Gilliam has transformed her traumatic experience into a poster, one in a series that will be distributed to students for the weekend event.\"Help me save lives,\" it says. \"Gun violence almost took mine.\"\"It's one thing to create a visual with powerful words to reach the people, but it's also one thing to be featured in the poster telling your story visually,\" Gilliam told CNN. \"I wanted people to actually see what gun violence has done to my family and I.\"The posters were curated by Amplifier, a design lab based in Seattle that fuses art and activism. The organization is giving away over 40,000 posters nationwide for participants to carry as they march for stricter gun legislation.Read More\"While the battle for gun reform has been going on for years, especially within black and brown communities most affected by gun violence, we have never seen this level of national energy around gun reform,\" Program Director Cleo Barnett told CNN. \"We knew that this was the moment for real change and we wanted to support the people on the ground pushing for policy change.\"Amplifier has designated seven cities around the country where protesters can pick up posters. They are also free to download on their website.All of the artwork focus on the experiences of young people who have been negatively impacted by firearms, like Gilliam.On November 30, 2015, she was hit by a stray bullet while at a gas station near her apartment in Charlotte, North Carolina. Gilliam was in the process of transferring to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to pursue a degree in pediatrics at the time. Her injury forced her to halt her studies, she said. Many of the designs were submitted by students themselves during an open call held by Amplifier in early March. DeCiccio believes that conveying these messages from a subjective point-of-view allows people to empathize more than they would from reading statistics.One piece pays tribute to the black youth movements that began protesting shootings years ago.Another was donated by iconic street artist Shepard Fairey, founder of OBEY Clothing and creator of Barack Obama's \"Hope\" poster.Fairey's Los Angeles gallery, Subliminal Projects, is one of the many locations where people can pick up prints in person.",
