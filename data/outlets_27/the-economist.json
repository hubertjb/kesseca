                "body": "REGULATING A COMPLEX new technology is hard, particularly if it is evolving rapidly. With autonomous vehicles just around the corner, what can policymakers do to ensure that they arrive safely and smoothly and deliver on their promise?\n\nThe immediate goal is to make sure that AVs are safe without inhibiting innovation. In America, experimental AVs are allowed on the roads in many states as long as the companies operating them accept legal liability. Chris Urmson of Aurora says American regulators have got things right, working closely with AV firms and issuing guidelines rather than strict rules that might hamstring the industry. \"It's important that we don't leap to regulation before we actually have something to regulate,\" he says.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Singapore's government has taken the most hands-on approach to preparing for AVs, says Karl Iagnemma of nuTonomy, an AV startup that has tested vehicles in the city-state. For example, it has introduced a \"driving test\" that AVs must pass before they can go on the road. This does not guarantee safety but sets a minimum standard. The city of Boston has done something similar, requiring AVs to be tested in a small region before roaming more widely.\n\nElsewhere, regulators have permitted limited testing on public roads but want to see more evidence that the vehicles are safe before going further, says Takao Asami of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. \"Simple accumulation of mileage will never prove that the vehicle is safe,\" he says. Instead, regulators are talking to carmakers and technology firms to develop new safety standards. Marten Levenstam, head of product strategy at Volvo, likens the process to that of developing a new drug. First you show in the laboratory that it might work; then you run clinical trials in which you carefully test its safety and efficacy in real patients; and if they are successful, you ask for regulatory approval to make the drug generally available. On this analogy, autonomous cars are currently at the clinical-trial stage, without final approval as yet.\n\nWhat form would that approval take? Eventually, it will mean formal certification of vehicles capable of operating fully autonomously, so they can be offered for sale. But initial approval is likely to be granted to operators of specific robotaxi fleets, rather than vendors of particular vehicles, suggests Mr Levenstam, because fleet operators will monitor all vehicles closely to ensure and maintain safety. Even this will be a calculated risk. It is not possible to prove that a new drug is entirely safe, but the risk is worth taking because of the benefits the drug provides. It will be the same for AVs, he suggests. After all, the status quo of human-driven vehicles is hardly risk-free.\n\nMr Asami draws another analogy, with aviation. \"Black box\" data recorders and careful testing have enabled air transport to evolve, despite crashes, because passengers know safety is taken seriously. In fact, America's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has started applying its aviation expertise to autonomous vehicles. In many ways AVs are more complex than aircraft, says Deborah Bruce of the NTSB, because they are closely surrounded by other things that move in unpredictable ways.\n\nBut medicine and aviation have global (or at least regional) regulatory standards, whereas AVs do not. The current patchwork of regulation will have to be simplified if the technology is to be widely deployed. \"Uniformity is the friend of scalability,\" says Mr Iagnemma. Questions of insurance and liability will also have to be worked out. Amnon Shashua of Mobileye worries that because of today's regulatory uncertainty, fatal accidents involving fully autonomous vehicles could plunge the industry into legal limbo, or kill it altogether. He has proposed a set of rules that define how a car should respond in all 37 scenarios in the 6m-entry accident database maintained by NHTSA, America's car-safety regulator, and would like to see these rules adopted as an open industry standard. That would absolve carmakers from making implicit ethical choices in their software while leaving room for innovation in other areas. Mr Iagnemma thinks it is a good start. Without such standards, he says, every company will develop its own way of translating the rules of the road, devised for humans, into a code that can be followed by machines.\n\nPolitical potholes ahead\n\nThe risk of a backlash seems real enough. A survey by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a consumer lobby, found that 64% of Americans were worried about sharing the road with AVs. In another survey, by the Pew Research Centre, 56% of Americans said they would not ride in a self-driving vehicle (see chart). Seeing AVs in action will be an important element of building public trust. In cities where AVs are commonplace, drivers have got used to them. Uber, Waymo and others are also starting to provide robotaxi rides in limited areas, so people can discover that riding in an AV is thrilling for the first 30 seconds and then quickly becomes boring. \"But that's the response we really want,\" says Noah Zych of Uber, because it means riders feel safe.\n\nAssuming that AVs can be shown to be safe, regulators will face a second challenge: setting the rules around how and where they operate, and how they relate to other forms of transport. Fine-tuning of pricing will, in theory, let planners control congestion and promote equal access to mobility.\n\nGovernments wishing to encourage the adoption of robotaxi services could go further, restricting the use of private cars (Gothenburg, London, Milan, Singapore and Stockholm already have congestion charges of various kinds) or banning them from some areas. That might be unpopular, and not just with car-owners. \"I think there will be some real resistance to measures that compel people to use autonomous vehicles,\" says Peter Norton of the University of Virginia. AVs could be seen as an Orwellian technology, an instrument of surveillance and social control.\n\nProtesters might object by standing in front of AVs and blocking traffic. That could lead to calls for AV lanes to be fenced off, \"thus making city streets even more inhospitable to non-motorists than they already are\", says Brian Ladd, author of \"Autophobia\", a history of opposition to cars. But an unregulated introduction of robotaxis could also cause problems. Rival fleet operators might flood the roads with vehicles offering cut-price rides, making congestion worse.\n\nChoices about transport and pricing are inescapably political in nature. How cities deal with them will depend on both economics and political dynamics, notes Justin Erlich of Uber. \"We should be exploring lots of different policies in lots of different cities,\" he says. Meanwhile, two principles can help.\n\nThe first is to consider AVs in the context of the wider transport system, and be clear about what role they are expected to play. AVs might be deployed as the primary means of transport in a particular area; or they could be used in \"first mile, last mile\" mode to ferry people to and from railway stations, filling mobility gaps and complementing other forms of transport.\n\nThe second principle is to be mindful of the balance of freedoms. AVs can potentially free people from driving, congestion, pollution and parking -- but in return may require them to give up some other freedoms, such as the ability to take their own vehicle anywhere. In liberal countries, AVs will be accepted only if people feel that they enhance freedom rather than reduce it.\n\nA century ago cars raised fundamental questions about personal autonomy, freedom of choice and mobility. AVs will do the same again. But this time around, with the benefit of hindsight, there is a chance that they will be seen not simply as a new form of transport but as a technology with far-reaching social and economic implications. Driverless cars present an opportunity to forge a new and better trade-off between personal mobility and societal impact. But AVs will deliver on their promise only if policymakers -- like passengers climbing into a robotaxi -- are absolutely clear about where they want to end up.",

                "title": "Self-driving cars will profoundly change the way people live",
                "body": "ROAD TRIPS. DRIVE-THROUGHS. Shopping malls. Freeways. Car chases. Road rage. Cars changed the world in all sorts of unforeseen ways. They granted enormous personal freedom, but in return they imposed heavy costs. People working on autonomous vehicles generally see their main benefits as mitigating those costs, notably road accidents, pollution and congestion. GM's boss, Mary Barra, likes to talk of \"zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\" AVs, their champions argue, can offer all the advantages of cars without the drawbacks.\n\nIn particular, AVs could greatly reduce deaths and injuries from road accidents. Globally, around 1.25m people die in such accidents each year, according to the WHO; it is the leading cause of death among those aged 15-29. Another 20m-50m people are injured. Most accidents occur in developing countries, where the arrival of autonomous vehicles is still some way off. But if the switch to AVs can be advanced even by a single year, \"that's 1.25m people who don't die,\" says Chris Urmson of Aurora, an AV startup. In recent decades cars have become much safer thanks to features such as seat belts and airbags, but in America road deaths have risen since 2014, apparently because of distraction by smartphones. AVs would let riders text (or drink) to their heart's content without endangering anyone.\n\nEvidence that AVs are safer is already building up. Waymo's vehicles have driven 4m miles on public roads; the only accidents they have been involved in while driving autonomously were caused by humans in other vehicles. AVs have superhuman perception and can slam on the brakes in less than a millisecond, compared with a second or so for human drivers. But \"better than human\" is a low bar. People seem prepared to tolerate deaths caused by human drivers, but AVs will have to be more or less infallible. A realistic goal is a thousandfold improvement over human drivers, says Amnon Shashua of Mobileye, a maker of AV technology. That would reduce the number of road deaths in America each year from 40,000 to 40, a level last seen in 1900. If this can be achieved, future generations may look back on the era of vehicles driven by humans as an aberration. Even with modern safety features, some 650,000 Americans have died on the roads since 2000, more than were slain in all the wars of the 20th century (about 630,000).\n\nTo take advantage of much lower operating costs per mile, most AVs are almost certain to be electric, which will reduce harmful emissions of two kinds: particulates, which cause lung and heart diseases, and climate-changing greenhouse gases. Even electric vehicles, however, still cause some particulate emissions from tyre and road wear, and the drop in greenhouse-gas emissions depends on how green the power grid is. The switch to electric vehicles will require more generating capacity (UBS estimates that it will increase European electricity consumption by 20-30% by 2050) and new infrastructure, such as charging stations and grid upgrades. For urban dwellers, the benefits will be better air quality and less noise.\n\nWhether AVs will be able to reduce congestion is much less clear. The lesson of the 20th century is that building more roads to ease congestion encourages more car journeys. If robotaxis are cheap and fast, people will want to use them more. Yet there are reasons to think that the roads would become less crowded. Widespread sharing of vehicles would make much more efficient use of road space; computer-controlled cars can be smart about route planning; and once they are widespread, AVs can travel closer together than existing cars, increasing road capacity.\n\nWhat is certain is that riders who no longer have to drive will gain an enormous amount of time that can be used to work, play or socialise. \"Americans can take back a total of 30bn hours per year that they now spend driving, sitting in traffic or looking for a parking space,\" says BCG.\n\nYet to think about AVs as a fix for the problems caused by cars is to risk falling into a familiar historical trap. This is exactly how people thought about cars when they first appeared: as a fix for the problems caused by horses. In the 1890s, big cities around the world were grappling with growing volumes of horse manure and urine and the rotting bodies of thousands of dead horses, spreading disease. In 1894 the Times of London famously predicted that by the 1940s every street in the city would be buried under nine feet of manure. By comparison, cars seemed clean and hygienic, a key reason why they were adopted so quickly in the 20th century. \"Cars replaced something that was in many ways far worse,\" says Donald Shoup of the University of California at Los Angeles. \"But because of bad planning, they had unintended consequences.\" What might follow from AVs?\n\nShops that come to you\n\nCars transformed retailing, giving rise to suburban malls with lots of shops and plenty of parking. AVs, combined with the rise of e-commerce, could transform it again. \"The Walmart of the future might be fleets of vehicles ready to drop off anything that you might get at a Walmart,\" says Peter Norton of the University of Virginia. Or you might order an AV to take you home from work, and arrange to have your groceries, or a meal, waiting for you when you climb aboard. And why should shops, restaurants or other facilities be fixed in place? Coffee shops or food stands could restock at a central depot and then migrate to business neighbourhoods in the morning and entertainment districts in the evening, suggests Chenoe Hart, an architectural designer at the University of California at Berkeley. Mobile shops selling items such as shoes, clothes or cosmetics could visit particular neighbourhoods on a regular schedule, or when hailed by a customer. \"It gives us flexibility to reassign space,\" says Ms Hart.\n\nCarmakers are experimenting with delivery vehicles that draw up outside a customer's home, announce their arrival by text message and allow items to be retrieved from a locked compartment by entering a code. Low-cost deliveries using AVs could stimulate local production of all kinds of things, most notably food. Already, food-delivery services like UberEats, Deliveroo, Seamless and GrubHub have given rise to \"ghost restaurants\" that produce food for delivery only, centralising food production in a few kitchens. Cheap autonomous deliveries could make this kind of model more widespread.\n\nAnother possibility, says Johann Jungwirth of Volkswagen, is that restaurants or retailers might cover the cost of travel to encourage customers to visit them. Fancy restaurants might lay on luxury AVs to ferry sozzled customers home, as part of the cost of a meal. Retailers could offer to pay for shoppers' rides. Ride-hailing networks have a lot of customer data that could be used to target in-vehicle advertising. Hail an AV to go to one shop or restaurant, and you might see ads for a rival. Riders may be offered cheaper rides with ads or more expensive ones without them.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles could also deliver other services, letting you work out with your personal trainer on the way to the office or summon a hairdresser to your home. Toyota's e-Palette vehicles are boxes on wheels in different sizes that can be kitted out as mobile shops, offices or beauty salons. Moreover, AVs could give rise to new kinds of social activities, just as cars provided teenagers with new social opportunities. Ride-hailing networks might group together people with similar interests or friends in common when assigning rides. Or they might work with a dating app, pairing people up with a potential match when they take a ride. AVs might also function as mobile party venues, or double as sleeping pods on long trips, offering an alternative to hotels and low-cost airlines.\n\nA watchful eye\n\nWhat unintended consequences might there be? One much-heralded benefit of AVs is that they will offer freedom and independence to people who cannot drive cars: the very old, the very young and the disabled. Such vehicles are already ferrying around people in retirement communities, and one of Google's videos shows a blind man doing errands in an autonomous car. But AVs could also encroach on freedom by invading people's privacy. Robotaxi operators will chronicle their riders' every move, so they will end up knowing a great deal about them. Some taxis already record riders for security reasons; robotaxis will surely surveil both their passengers and their surroundings to protect themselves. Police investigating a crime will ask AVs in the vicinity what they saw.\n\nIf people no longer drive cars, one consequence may be new forms of segregation, notes Ms Hart. Access to some places may be restricted to certain riders or robotaxi networks, just as some online services are \"walled gardens\" or cannot be accessed on all devices. She thinks there may be a need for a physical equivalent of \"network neutrality\" rules, to ensure that all locations are equally accessible to all AVs. In authoritarian societies, AVs could be a powerful tool of social control.\n\nAVs could also trigger a shortage of organ donors (many of whom are young people killed in car accidents) and a drop in smoking (more than half of all tobacco sales in America are made at petrol stations, which will vanish, notes Mr Evans). And if cars are no longer symbols of independence and self-definition for the young, other things will have to take their place. Like cars before them, AVs will change the texture of everyday life.",

                "title": "A chance to transform urban planning",
                "body": "MODERN CITIES, PARTICULARLY in America, are habitats for cars as much as people, devoting huge amounts of space to roads and parking. \"America is a great place to be -- if you're a car,\" says Donald Shoup of the University of California at Los Angeles. The expectation that people should be able to drive anywhere, encountering little or no congestion on the way and parking at their destination, led to a splurge of construction in the 20th century. Urban freeways, commuter suburbs and mandatory parking requirements reshaped cities. Now AVs promise to transform them once again, undermining many car-centric assumptions made in the 20th century, opening up new possibilities and turning urban-planning debates upside down. \"For the first time in a generation, we can really rethink what suburban development looks like,\" says Alan Berger, a professor of urban studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nSimply put, building cities around cars increases congestion, discourages the use of public transport and encourages sprawl, all of which urban planners generally disapprove of. The odd thing is that AVs could either reverse or accelerate each of these trends. They could reduce or increase traffic; make affordable transport more or less accessible; and lead to denser cities or more sprawl. It all depends on the rules for their use, and in particular the pricing. AVs know exactly where they are at all times, which makes it much easier to introduce fine-grained road tolls and congestion charges based on time of day, traffic levels and so on. That makes them a powerful and flexible policy tool.\n\nStart with congestion. A switch to shared robotaxis could increase vehicle occupancy rates, reducing the number of vehicles needed to move people around and easing congestion. But low-cost robotaxis might also encourage more people to take more trips -- the familiar problem of \"induced demand\" when road travel is cheap and easy. The roads could also fill up with autonomous delivery vehicles with nobody on board. The nightmare scenario, says William Riggs of the University of San Francisco, is that \"we create another form of congestion -- it just happens to be automated congestion.\" But careful pricing of roads and rides should be able to prevent that. Some cities already have congestion-charging schemes of various kinds, or rules to encourage vehicle-sharing, such as dedicated car-sharing lanes. Some are starting to price access to kerb space, for example at airports. AVs would allow far more subtle forms of charging, taking account of time, place, vehicle type, number of riders, traffic levels and so forth, to maximise sharing and minimise congestion. \"It will be that interplay that ensures we don't end up with highly congested roads,\" says Justin Erlich of Uber.\n\nWhat about the impact on public transport? A study by UC Davis found that among Uber and Lyft riders in America, bus use fell by 6% and light-rail use by 3%. AVs would be cheaper, so they could draw even more people away from public transport and onto the roads. This might discourage further investment in public transport, which in turn could create more \"transit deserts\" where large numbers of people (typically the poor and the elderly) depend on public transport but get an inadequate service. The economics of robotaxis will work best in dense urban centres, says Mr Riggs, so \"we could see social-equity implications around the fringes of cities.\" But again, there is also a rosier scenario. Using AVs for the \"last mile\" to move people to and from railway stations could make public transport more viable in less densely populated areas. Some cities might also operate their own robotaxi fleets, or subsidise rides in poor neighbourhoods using toll revenues collected in rich ones.\n\nThe emergence of AVs helpfully coincides with a change in the structure of cities, says Shlomo Angel, an urban-studies expert at New York University. He argues that the monocentric model, with a centre surrounded by suburbs, is a thing of the past. In many large American and European cities, jobs are moving from downtown to the periphery, and workers increasingly commute from one suburb to another, rather than to and from the centre. His analysis shows that 75% of jobs in a typical American city are outside the urban centre. In European and Asian cities with dense public-transport networks this decentralisation is easier to cope with, but retrofitting the necessary infrastructure onto American cities would be too expensive. \"American cities need door-to-door transport systems to get to work, and driverless cars will play this role beautifully,\" says Mr Angel. Robotaxis hailed on demand promise to be a lot more efficient than privately owned vehicles, he says, and are well suited to the spatial structure of both present and future American cities. Mr Berger agrees. \"It's not affordable to build mass transit that goes from suburb to suburb,\" he says. \"The best solution I've seen in my career is the idea of shared autonomous vehicles.\"\n\nThat raises the question of urban sprawl. On the one hand, a switch to shared AVs by urban dwellers could lead to denser cities as some of the space currently used for parking is reallocated to housing. New high-density housing is already being planned with pick-up and drop-off zones for ride-hailing vehicles, and fewer parking spaces. On the other hand, AVs could also encourage sprawl by making long commutes more acceptable, because riders will be able to work or even sleep on the move. \"The biggest negative of suburban living is the driving and the amount of space that has to be devoted to cars,\" says Joel Kotkin of Chapman University. By doing away with driving and making city centres easier to access, AVs will increase the appeal of suburban living. So it seems likely that AVs will make cities both denser and more spread out, depending on the road-pricing regime.\n\nTurning back the clock\n\nAVs could also make possible new kinds of suburbs, updating the 20th-century dream of garden cities. \"Over the last 100 years our landscape has been drastically altered by the automobile,\" says Mr Berger. With AVs, \"all the land we've given to the automobile can be put back into landscape and ecological functions.\" By doing away with parking and using one-way, single-lane roads that loop through neighbourhoods, the area of paved surface can be reduced by 50%, he calculates. That means more space for plants, more biodiversity and better water retention, reducing the risk of flooding in the urban core. Suburbs will have enough space to generate their own solar power or grow their own food.\n\nCity centres will end up looking different, too. In effect, cities have banked a large amount of valuable real estate in the form of parking lots and garages, notes Peter Norton of the University of Virginia, and must decide how to spend their windfall. Housing is one obvious use; parks are another. Some streets could be reconfigured to more imaginative uses than high-volume thoroughfares, he suggests. In particular, some quieter streets could become spaces where pedestrians and slow-moving AVs share the roadway as equals, with neither having priority. This would mark a return to the way streets worked a century ago, before cars took over. \"Streets should not just be roads for cars but places for people,\" says Mr Shoup.\n\nIn retrospect, many drawbacks associated with cars in the 20th century arose from a failure to price their use properly. With appropriate pricing, AVs should be able to avoid many of those problems, giving urban planners and policymakers a much wider range of choices about how cities and transport systems could be structured. The challenge will be to choose wisely.",

                "body": "EVERY DAY AROUND 10m people take an Uber. The company has made ride-hailing commonplace in more than 600 cities in 82 countries. But the Volvo XC90 picking its way through traffic on a wintry morning in Pittsburgh is no ordinary Uber. Climb into the back, and you will see a screen mounted between the front seats, showing a digital representation of the world around the car, with other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists highlighted as clusters of blue dots. Tap the screen to say you are ready to leave, and the car starts to move. But no one is driving it. This Uber is an autonomous vehicle (AV) -- a car that can drive itself.\n\nAdmittedly, Uber's self-driving robotaxi has a human sitting in the driving seat, but only to take over if something unexpected happens. The car drives carefully but confidently in downtown traffic and light snow, handling four-way stops, traffic lights and pedestrian crossings with aplomb. It even knows how to deal with drivers performing the \"Pittsburgh left\", a local custom that allows the first vehicle at a traffic light to turn left in front of oncoming traffic. The most noticeable difference from a human driver is that the vehicle makes no attempt to avoid Pittsburgh's notorious potholes, so the ride is slightly bumpy at times. The engineer in your correspondent's robotaxi takes over occasionally, for example to guide the car through roadworks where the lane markings have recently been changed.\n\nAutonomous vehicles are not yet quite ready to operate without human supervision, then. But they have made rapid progress in recent years, and can now be seen on the roads in several American cities, easily identified by the clusters of sensors on their roofs. Uber's robotaxis ferry riders around in Pittsburgh and Phoenix. Waymo, Google's self-driving car unit which is now a separate company in the Alphabet family, has gone a step further, operating autonomous minivans in Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, without safety engineers in the driving seat. It plans to launch a commercial ride-hailing service there this year. GM, America's biggest carmaker, hopes to launch a robotaxi service in 2019 using autonomous Chevy Bolt cars that do not even have steering wheels or pedals.\n\nAVs operated by tech giants, startups and established carmakers can also be seen around Silicon Valley and Pittsburgh, America's two main hubs of the emerging industry, drawing on talent from Stanford and Carnegie Mellon universities respectively. In other parts of the world, driverless shuttles ferry passengers on university campuses, in business parks or along special bus lanes. AVs stole the show at CES, the world's biggest technology fair, in Las Vegas in January. Suddenly, it seems, everybody is jumping on the driverless bandwagon.\n\nRecent progress in computer vision and other machine-learning systems is one reason. Tech folk from chipmakers to software firms see AVs as a lucrative new market for their products. Within the automotive industry, the rise of Uber and other ride-hailing services caused a \"massive shift in perception around 2015\", says Sebastian Thrun, a pioneer of AVs at Stanford who led the development of Google's first self-driving car. Carmakers realised that they needed to take AVs seriously -- because they will redefine their industry.\n\nThe combination of autonomy and ride-hailing, together with a switch to electric vehicles, seems likely to undermine the logic of car ownership for many people. Ride-hailing services in the rich world currently cost around $2.50 per mile, compared with about $1.20 per mile to own and operate a private car (see chart). But the driver accounts for about 60% of the cost of ride-hailing. UBS, an investment bank, reckons that automation, competition and electrification (which makes cars more expensive to buy but much cheaper to run) will cut the cost of ride-hailing by 70%, to about $0.70 per mile. So a typical Western household driving 10,000 miles a year could ditch its car, use robotaxis and save $5,000 a year. And there are other advantages, explains Mr Thrun: \"You can be drunk, you don't have to look for parking, and your kids can take the car.\"\n\n\"Once the car becomes autonomous, the relevance of car ownership drops materially,\" says David Lesne of UBS. His firm predicts that robotaxis will take off rapidly after 2025, with 80% of people using them in cities, where available, by 2035. BCG, a consultancy, reckons that by 2030 a quarter of passenger-miles travelled on America's roads will be in shared, self-driving electric vehicles, reducing the number of cars on city streets by 60%, emissions by 80% and road accidents by 90%. Though some people will want to own their autonomous cars, about half of AVs will be shared robotaxis, says Nikolaus Lang of BCG. Globally, the \"passenger economy\" created by the convergence of autonomous vehicles and ride-hailing will be worth $7trn a year by 2050, says Strategy Analytics, a consultancy.\n\nCarmakers, technology giants, startups and ride-hailing firms are already engaged in a furious battle to dominate this emerging industry. The carmakers understand metal-bashing, but know less about complex software. The tech firms know about machine learning and computer vision, but not making cars. The ride-hailing firms, for their part, have their apps installed on millions of users' phones, providing the obvious route to market. The result has been a flurry of deals, much hedging of bets and a constantly evolving web of alliances (see chart).\n\nMix and match\n\nIntel, a chipmaking giant, bought Mobileye, a maker of autonomous-driving systems, for $15.3bn in March 2017. GM bought Cruise, an AV startup, for $1bn in March 2016, set up Maven, a car-sharing service, and invested $500m in Lyft, Uber's main ride-hailing rival in America. Ford fired its CEO in May 2017, partly in response to concerns that the firm was falling behind in electric and autonomous vehicles; it is now investing $1bn in Argo, an AV startup, and also has an alliance with Lyft. Delphi, a big partsmaker, bought nuTonomy, an AV startup, for $450m, and has since reinvented itself as an AV company called Aptiv. Uber recently agreed to buy 24,000 self-driving cars from Volvo, for use in its robotaxi fleet; it also has a partnership with Daimler. For its part, Daimler has been buying up ride-hailing services across Europe and the Middle East that compete with Uber, and also owns a car-sharing service. Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, has struck a deal with Aurora, an AV startup founded by veterans of Google, Uber and Tesla. And so on.\n\nIn short, the tectonic plates of technology and carmaking are colliding, heralding a carquake. This seismic shift will transform both industries, and its aftershocks will be felt far and wide: AVs will be as transformative a technology as the smartphone. Just as cars reshaped the world in the 20th century, in ways good and bad, AVs could change how people live, work and play. They could dramatically reduce the number of road deaths, the time spent sitting in traffic and the space wasted on parking. In urban planning, AVs provide \"a great opportunity to address a lot of problems at the same time\", says Joel Kotkin, an urban-studies expert at Chapman University in Orange, California. \"If the 20th century was about cars giving us independence, the 21st will be about autonomous vehicles giving us independence from cars,\" says Justin Erlich, head of policy for AVs at Uber.\n\nBut just as cars had unexpected side-effects, AVs are raising new concerns about safety, cyber-security, liability and inequality. \"Autonomous vehicles will open a Pandora's box of unintended effects,\" says Peter Norton, a social historian at the University of Virginia. A century ago cars promised to provide safe, fast and congestion-free transport. The similarities with the claims now being made about AVs are \"eerie\", notes Mr Norton. This special report will assume that the technological hurdles to full autonomy can be overcome. It will consider the implications of AVs for personal mobility, car ownership and carmaking, but will also look at the wider economic, social and cultural knock-on effects. How will everyday activities be transformed? How could AVs reshape cities? And what lessons does the rise of the car in the 20th century hold for driverless vehicles in the 21st?",

                "title": "Clean power is shaking up the global geopolitics of energy",
                "body": "TO ENTER TAFT, two hours north of Los Angeles, you drive along the \"Petroleum Highway\", past miles of billboards advertising Jesus. God's country is also oil country. Spread over the sagebrush hills surrounding the town are thousands of steel pumpjacks (pictured), contraptions that suck oil out of the ground. They look like a herd of dinosaurs. Some Californians would describe the oil industry in the same way.\n\nThe oil produced at Taft is not produced by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as much of it is in Texas and North Dakota. It is so heavy it needs to be steamed out of the ground, in a process known locally as \"huff and puff\". Yet Kern County, with Taft on its western edge, produces 144m barrels of oil a year, the second highest output of any county in America. Fred Holmes, a third-generation oilman and patron of the West Kern Oil Museum, says he is proud of the heritage, however much it irks local drivers of electric Tesla cars that the Golden State has such a carbon-heavy underbelly. \"Oil is renewable energy. It just takes longer to renew,\" he quips. He has built a giant wooden derrick at the museum to celebrate it.\n\nIn its heyday, oil was prized in southern California. The Lakeview Gusher, which blew on the edge of Taft in 1910, became as emblematic of a boom era as the gold rush farther north. Taft also played a starring role early on in the geopolitics of energy. In 1910 the American navy, worried about its dependence on insecure coal supplies, commissioned its first oil-fired destroyer. Two years later President William Taft created the first naval petroleum reserve in Taft's Elk Hills to guarantee supplies of oil in the event of an international crisis. It came into its own in the second world war, when production soared. The president gave the town, formerly called Moron, a better name.\n\nSince then the geopolitics of energy -- usually defined as the impact of energy flows on the power and influence of nations -- has been mostly about the world's thirst for oil. The efforts to secure it, safeguard its shipment, stop enemies from getting or keeping hold of it, and monopolise it if possible, loomed large in 20th-century history (see chart).\n\nSince oil and gas are exhaustible and not available everywhere, they have often been rationed, to the benefit of an oligopolistic group of producers. Consuming nations have long felt that the scarcity of oil makes them more vulnerable. That is why, since the Arab oil embargo of 1973, every American president has seen the country's dependence on imported oil as a weakness. Policies like the \"Carter Doctrine\" proclaimed by the then president in 1980, which asserted the United States' right to use military force to protect its strategic interests in the Middle East, were aimed at ensuring a stable supply of oil.\n\nThis notion of scarcity is coming to an end, thanks to three big developments. The first is America's shale revolution, which has turned the country into the world's biggest combined producer of oil and gas (see chart). After decades of declining output since the 1970s, America is now producing as much oil as it has ever done: 10m barrels a day in November last year. It is making the country less reliant on imported oil, which has helped it shed a long-standing paranoia about such dependence. This could reduce the country's need to expend blood and treasure to protect supply routes from the Middle East. And it has added an abundance of oil and gas to world markets that has benefited energy consumers everywhere.\n\nThe second major change is taking place in China as it attempts to move from an energy-intensive economy to a more service-led one. Without choking off economic growth, in the past few years it has made staggering progress in moderating its demand for coal and oil, slowing the rise in electricity consumption, deploying gas and renewable energies and arresting the growth of carbon-dioxide emissions. It remains the world's biggest importer of fossil fuels, but its experience with filthy air and its concerns about over-dependence on imported oil have made it keener to harvest more of its own wind and sunlight. It also has by far the world's most ambitious plans for electric vehicles. Subsidies and a streak of energy authoritarianism have played a big role. But in its own way, China's energy transition has been as remarkable as America's.\n\nThese two developments play into the third, longer-term trend: the need to create a low-carbon energy system to fight climate change. The Paris agreement of 2015, though a milestone, still leaves a huge distance to travel before global warming can be stopped. To achieve that, trillions of dollars will have to be invested in wind and solar energy, batteries, electricity grids and a range of more experimental clean-energy sources.\n\nThis so-called energy transition has set off a global race for the best technologies and raised concerns about access to the rare earths and critical minerals needed to make the necessary hardware. As Francis O'Sullivan of MIT Energy Initiative, part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, puts it: \"We are moving from a world where the value of the energy is embedded in the resource to where technology is the resource.\"\n\nThe democratisation of energy\n\nThis special report will look at the energy transition from the perspective of America, the EU and China as well as petrostates such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. It will pinpoint winners and losers. It will argue that America is at risk of squandering an early lead, obtained by using natural gas and renewables to slash emissions, promoting clean technology and helping pioneer the Paris agreement. China is catching up fast. Saudi Arabia and Russia are in most obvious peril.\n\nThe past few years of growing American self-reliance and Chinese self-restraint have offered a glimpse of the foreign-policy implications of a new energy order. For America, some see it as a windfall, the title of a recent book by Meghan O'Sullivan of Harvard University. She says the shale revolution has helped temper predictions of American decline, made it easier to impose sanctions on adversaries, helped create a global gas market to ease Russia's stranglehold over Ukraine, and reduced tensions over China's pursuit of energy resources. She describes it as \"a boon to American power -- and a bane to Russian brawn\".\n\nThat may be over-optimistic. Russia and the OPEC oil cartel have been surprisingly successful at cutting production to counter the shale glut. They have also turned towards China, which is pouring money into their energy infrastructure. Most important, American shale risks entrenching reliance on oil even more deeply in the global economy, with potentially perilous consequences for the climate. If America focuses too much on producing fossil fuels, it may lose sight of the need to develop cleaner energy for the future.\n\nThe geopolitical implications of the broader energy transition will be even more complex. When in January a global commission to study the geopolitics of clean energy was launched under the auspices of the Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency, the underlying hope was that such a development would make the world \"more peaceful, stable -- and boring\". Champions of clean energy believe that boring is good. Unlike hydrocarbons, renewable energy is potentially available almost anywhere. Collaborative efforts to halt global warming could lead to open-source development and the sharing of technology. As power generation becomes more dispersed (examples include Germany, China and California), regions may become more self-sufficient in energy, a process labelled \"energy democratisation\". In Africa and elsewhere, enhanced access to energy, via mini-grids and rooftop solar panels, could reduce energy poverty even as the global population is soaring.\n\nDavid Criekemans of the University of Antwerp points out that from the Industrial Revolution onwards, energy transitions such as that to coal and then to oil have changed the world. This latest one could have equally far-reaching effects. \"The [nation] state and central power supply go hand in hand. They need one another,\" he writes. He expects decentralisation of the energy supply to boost the power of regions in relation to central authorities. The beauty of the energy transition, enthusiasts believe, will be to give communities \"super powers\" over their energy, rather than turn countries into energy superpowers.\n\nYet the transition has plenty of potential to cause geopolitical friction, too. The most obvious example is the challenge it will pose to economies that depend on petroleum. A new book, \"The Geopolitics of Renewables\", edited by Daniel Scholten of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, argues that the clearest losers will be those blessed with ample fossil-fuel reserves and those who bet on oil for too long without reforming their economies. The book also notes that,whereas in the traditional energy system the main constraint is scarcity, with abundant renewables it is variability. This could be mitigated by cross-border energy trade, but that, too, could cause arguments.\n\nAs economies become more electrified, with \"supergrids\" to handle the additional power demand from urbanisation, electric vehicles and unimaginable quantities of data, the risks could multiply. Grid politics could replace pipeline politics. Ukrainian saboteurs, for instance, reacted to Russia's annexation of Crimea by cutting off electricity supplies to the peninsula in 2015. Chinese investment in grids in Europe and Australia is also under scrutiny, on national-security grounds. And ever more electrified economies are at ever higher risk from cyber-attacks.\n\nThe new power tool\n\nIt seems inevitable that the geopolitics of energy will develop into a contest to see which country can produce the most energy of its own, and which has the best technology. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU's commissioner for climate and energy, explains that, \"We are on an irreversible pathway to renewable energy...those who don't embrace the clean-energy transition will be losers in the future.\"\n\nThe EU has set itself a clear goal to decarbonise all energy by 2050, and has appropriate market structures in place. That puts it in a strong position. China, too, is firmly committed to clean energy and boasts some impressive clean-tech entrepreneurs. America, for its part, has invented much of the world's clean-energy technology; and the shale revolution has opened up vast potential supplies of natural gas that can generate electricity far more cleanly than coal, serving as a bridge to a lower-carbon future. But the country risks losing its focus. It is divided between fossil-fuel fundamentalists, mostly Republicans, and clean-energy enthusiasts, mostly Democrats, who cannot agree on the best way forward for the economy and for the climate.",

                "title": "The future of war",
                "body": "IN THE PAST, predictions about future warfare have often put too much emphasis on new technologies and doctrines. In the 19th century the speedy victory of the Prussian army over France in 1870 convinced European general staffs that rapid mobilisation by rail, quick-firing artillery and a focus on attack would make wars short and decisive. Those ideas were put to the test at the beginning of the first world war. The four years of trench warfare on the western front proved them wrong.\n\nIn the 1930s it was widely believed that aerial bombardment of cities would prove devastating enough to prompt almost immediate capitulation. That forecast came true only with the invention of nuclear weapons a decade later. When America demonstrated in the first Gulf war in 1990-91 what a combination of its precision-guided munitions, new intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance methods, space-based communications and stealth technology could achieve, many people assumed that in future the West would always be able to rely on swift, painless victories. But after the terrorist attacks on America on September 11th 2001, wars took a different course.\n\nThis special report will therefore offer its predictions with humility. It will also limit them to the next 20 years or so, because beyond that the uncertainties become overwhelming. And it will not speculate about the clear and present danger of war breaking out over North Korea's nuclear weapons, which with luck can be contained. Instead, it will outline the long-term trends in warfare that can be identified with some confidence.\n\nIn the past half-century wars between states have become exceedingly rare, and those between great powers and their allies almost non-existent, mainly because of the mutually destructive power of nuclear weapons, international legal constraints and the declining appetite for violence of relatively prosperous societies. On the other hand, intrastate or civil wars have been relatively numerous, especially in fragile or failing states, and have usually proved long-lasting. Climate change, population growth and sectarian or ethnic extremism are likely to ensure that such wars will continue.\n\nIncreasingly, they will be fought in urban environments, if only because by 2040 two-thirds of the world's population will be living in cities. The number of megacities with populations of more than 10m has doubled to 29 in the past 20 years, and each year nearly 80m people are moving from rural to urban areas. Intense urban warfare, as demonstrated by the recent battles for Aleppo and Mosul, remains grinding and indiscriminate, and will continue to present difficult problems for well-meaning Western intervention forces. Technology will change war in cities as much as other types of warfare, but it will still have to be fought at close quarters, block by block.\n\nEven though full-scale interstate warfare between great powers remains improbable, there is still scope for less severe forms of military competition. In particular, both Russia and China now seem unwilling to accept the international dominance of America that has been a fact of life in the 20 years since the end of the cold war. Both have an interest in challenging the American-sponsored international order, and both have recently shown that they are prepared to apply military force to defend what they see as their legitimate interests: Russia by annexing Crimea and destabilising Ukraine, and China by building militarised artificial islands and exerting force in disputes with regional neighbours in the South and East China Seas.\n\nIn the past decade, both China and Russia have spent heavily on a wide range of military capabilities to counter America's capacity to project power on behalf of threatened or bullied allies. In military jargon, these capabilities are known as anti-access/area denial or A2/AD. Their aim is not to go to war with America but to make an American intervention more risky and more costly. That has increasingly enabled Russia and China to exploit a \"grey zone\" between war and peace. Grey-zone operations aim to reap either political or territorial gains normally associated with overt military aggression without tipping over the threshold into open warfare with a powerful adversary. They are all about calibration, leverage and ambiguity. The grey zone particularly lends itself to hybrid warfare, a term first coined about ten years ago. Definitions vary, but in essence it is a blurring of military, economic, diplomatic, intelligence and criminal means to achieve a political goal.\n\nThe main reason why big powers will try to achieve their political objectives short of outright war is still the nuclear threat, but it does not follow that the \"balance of terror\" which characterised the cold war will remain as stable as in the past. Russia and America are modernising their nuclear forces at huge expense and China is enlarging its nuclear arsenal, so nuclear weapons may be around until at least the end of the century. Both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, in their very different ways, enjoy a bit of nuclear sabre-rattling. Existing nuclear-arms-control agreements are fraying. The protocols and understandings that helped avert Armageddon during the cold war have not been renewed.\n\nRussia and China now fear that technological advances could allow America to threaten their nuclear arsenals without resorting to a nuclear first strike. America has been working at a concept known as Conventional Prompt Global Strike (CPGS) for over a decade, though weapons have yet to be deployed. The idea is to deliver a conventional warhead with a very high degree of accuracy, at hypersonic speeds (at least five times faster than the speed of sound), through even the most densely defended air space. Possible missions include countering anti-satellite weapons; targeting the command-and-control nodes of enemy A2/AD networks; attacking the nuclear facilities of a rogue proliferator such as North Korea; and killing important terrorists. Russia and China claim that CPGS could be highly destabilising if used in conjunction with advanced missile defences. Meanwhile they are developing similar weapons of their own.\n\nOther potential threats to nuclear stability are attacks on nuclear command-and-control systems with the cyber- and anti-satellite weapons that all sides are investing in, which could be used to disable nuclear forces temporarily. Crucially, the identity of the attacker may be ambiguous, leaving those under attack uncertain how to respond.\n\nRise of the killer robots\n\nAt least the world knows what it is like to live in the shadow of nuclear weapons. There are much bigger question-marks over how the rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning will affect the way wars are fought, and perhaps even the way people think of war. The big concern is that these technologies may create autonomous weapons systems that can make choices about killing humans independently of those who created or deployed them. An international \"Campaign to Stop Killer Robots\" is seeking to ban lethal autonomous weapons before they even come into existence. A letter to that effect, warning against a coming arms race in autonomous weapons, was signed in 2015 by over 1,000 AI experts including Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Demis Hassabis.\n\nSuch a ban seems unlikely to be introduced, but there is room for debate about how humans should interact with machines capable of varying degrees of autonomy, whether in the loop (with a human constantly monitoring the operation and remaining in charge of critical decisions), on the loop (with a human supervising machines that can intervene at any stage of the mission) or out of the loop (with the machine carrying out the mission without any human intervention once launched). Western military establishments insist that to comply with the laws of armed conflict, a human must always be at least on the loop. But some countries may not be so scrupulous if fully autonomous systems are seen to confer military advantages.\n\nSuch technologies are being developed around the globe, most of them in the civil sector, so they are bound to proliferate. In 2014 the Pentagon announced its \"Third Offset Strategy\" to regain its military edge by harnessing a range of technologies including robotics, autonomous systems and big data, and to do so faster and more effectively than potential adversaries. But even its most ardent advocates know that the West may never again be able to rely on its superior military technology. Robert Work, the deputy defence secretary who championed the third offset, argues that the West's most enduring military advantage will be the quality of the people produced by open societies. It would be comforting to think that the human factor, which has always been a vital component in past wars, will still count for something in the future. But there is uncertainty even about that.",

                "title": "Using clever technology to keep enemies at bay",
                "body": "A CRITICAL REASON for the success of Russia's and China's grey-zone strategies is that they have invested heavily in long-range sensor and precision-strike networks as well as cyber and space capabilities that can impose unacceptable costs on America projecting power in their regions. While America and its allies have spent much of the past 15 years fighting wars against irregular forces in the Middle East and Afghanistan, its adversaries have been studying the vulnerabilities in the Western way of warfare and exploiting technologies that have become cheaper and more readily available. They have also benefited from research and development passing from military institutions to the civil and commercial sectors.\n\nAlthough at the strategic level American military power is still uncontested, its major adversaries' anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) investment has blunted its technology edge to such an extent that it can no longer count on local dominance in the early stages of a conflict. This means that America's adversaries are able to shelter low-intensity and paramilitary operations by carrying out small-scale but highly accurate attacks against American forces should they attempt to intervene on behalf of an ally.\n\nIt is doubtful that American commanders would recommend such a hazardous mission unless they were given the go-ahead to disable their opponents' A2/AD network (revealingly, the Chinese name for A2/AD is \"counter-intervention\"). That would require a major commitment of forces to strike targets inside Russian or Chinese territory, such as ground-to-air missile batteries and command, control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C2ISR) nodes, which would probably result in heavy losses for the Americans. Even more important, such an operation would carry a risk so large as to make it infeasible. Even faced with the much less onerous task of suppressing Syrian air defences in 2012, Barack Obama was advised that 200-300 aircraft would be needed for an indefinite period.\n\nRussia's growing A2/AD capability has received less attention than China's, but poses similar problems to America and its allies. NATO commanders fear that in the event of a crisis, missile systems in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and in western Russia itself could make the Baltic Sea a no-go area for its naval vessels. Similarly, albeit on a lesser scale, Iran can threaten shipping in the Gulf, including American carriers, and American air bases across the water.\n\nSalami tactics\n\nChina's efforts are aimed mainly at degrading America's sea- and land-based air power and thus limiting the kind of war it can wage. The first step is to achieve what the Chinese call \"information dominance\". That means targeting America's data and communications networks, especially in space. Physical attacks on satellites, including \"blinding\" them with lasers, would be combined with cyber attacks on computer systems.\n\nTo prevent America from operating close to China's shore, a bristling arsenal of land-based air-defence and anti-ship missiles, along with fast missile boats, missile submarines and maritime strike aircraft, would attack US Navy vessels, as well as at US bases in Guam and Japan. In particular, China intends to push American carriers well beyond the unrefuelled range of their strike aircraft, such as the new F-35 stealth fighter, or risk catastrophic damage from anti-ship ballistic missiles.\n\nThe DF-21D, known as the \"carrier killer\", is a ballistic missile that can travel by road. It has a range of over 1,000 miles and may carry manoeuvrable conventional warheads. It might or might not work as planned, but there is enough uncertainty to make it a powerful deterrent. At the same time China is building a strong blue-water navy with aircraft-carriers of its own, to which it is now adding heavily armed artificial islands in the South China Sea.\n\nIn response, the Pentagon in 2014 announced its \"Third Offset Strategy\", concluding that if it could deter and defeat the \"pacing threat\" from China, it would be able to advance America's interests and defend its allies not only in the Asia-Pacific region but anywhere in the world. The strategy focuses on areas such as autonomous learning systems, human-machine collaborative decision-making, assisted human operations, advanced manned-unmanned systems operations, networked autonomous weapons and high-speed projectiles, all of which are certain to have a major impact on the future of warfare.\n\nThe name could have been better chosen (and indeed, has been quietly dropped by the Trump administration). The first offset, in the 1950s, was America's advantage in nuclear weapons as a way of repelling the Soviet Union's much larger conventional forces if they were to attack Europe. The second, when the Soviets achieved nuclear parity, was the \"look deep, strike deep\" precision-guidance revolution of the 1980s, designed to achieve the same result without using nuclear weapons.\n\nThe third offset, like the second, aims to harness emerging technologies to restore America's \"overmatch\" against near-peer adversaries, and thus its ability to project power even in highly contested environments. But whereas previous offsets secured a period of lasting technological advantage, even its most enthusiastic advocates (such as Bob Work, the deputy secretary of defence until 2017, who drove the effort for three years; or Michael O'Hanlon, a defence expert at the Brookings Institution) concede that this time America's lead may be more fleeting.\n\nOne reason for caution is that the pace of innovation in many of the key enabling technologies, such as artificial intelligence, deep machine learning, robotics and autonomy, has accelerated. Another is that investment in research and development is being driven by the civil sector, which is looking for quick commercial rewards.\n\nRussia, and particularly China, are both making AI a national priority, and have far fewer qualms than the West in how they go about it. According to Jim Lewis, an expert on the impact of technology on warfare at CSIS, \"when it comes to government data, the US doesn't match what China collects on its citizens at all. They have a big sandbox to play in and a lot of toys and good people.\" In China, where big data are bigger than anywhere else, privacy is not an issue, and there is no division between commercial research and military needs. By contrast, Google's London-based DeepMind subsidiary, whose machine beat a grandmaster at the game of Go, refuses to work with the armed forces.\n\nThis is not to say that the effort to restore America's technology edge will fail. It still spends nearly three times as much on defence as China does, and indeed more than all eight runners-up combined. Its forces have far more combat experience than any of their counterparts, and it has strengths in systems engineering that no other country can match. It continues to dominate commercial AI funding and has more firms working in the field than any other country.\n\nMore bang for the buck\n\nBut according to Bryan Clark of the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, America's chosen method of making a wide variety of investments and waiting to see what comes up fails to bring the most promising technologies to bear directly on the A2/AD challenge. In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the future of warfare, Mr Clark argued that America should apply new technologies to four main areas of warfare: undersea, strike, air and electromagnetic.\n\nQuiet Chinese submarines and new active sonar systems are making it increasingly risky for American submarines to operate in Chinese coastal waters. Small, hard-to-detect unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) could be used to clear mines, hunt enemy submarines in shallow waters and gather intelligence. Larger ones could deploy seabed payloads such as long-endurance sensors, power packs for other UUVs and extra missiles for manned submarines.\n\nIn the air, America may try to degrade an adversary's integrated air-defence systems (IADs) by interfering with their sensors and control systems, then send out networked swarms of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to inflict further damage before deploying penetrating long-range stealth bombers such as the B2 and the new B21. But air supremacy of the kind it has enjoyed since the end of the cold war may be passing. To achieve even local dominance, it will need longer-range sensors and lasers to detect enemy aircraft. Manned aircraft will increasingly be platforms for sensors, data-gathering and stand-off missiles.\n\nDominance of the electromagnetic spectrum will become more and more important. New ways of achieving it will include stealth technologies to conceal the radar signature of ships and planes; protecting space-based communications networks from attack; launching decoys; and defences against incoming missile salvoes. For example, miniaturised electromagnetic weapons (EMW) mounted on swarms of expendable UAVs launched close to shore from a large UUV could jam an opponent's targeting sensors and communications. Electromagnetic rail guns mounted on ships, which can fire projectiles at 4,500 miles an hour to the edge of space, could counter ballistic-missile warheads.\n\nThe Pentagon's lumbering acquisition system will find it hard to accommodate any of this. To get even close to keeping up with the pace of innovation, says Mr Work, it will have to move to rapid prototyping and adopt a different attitude to testing, emulating Silicon Valley's readiness to \"fail fast\". It will also have to find less bureaucratic ways of doing business with firms developing key technologies. To that end, the Pentagon has established DIUx (Defence Innovation Unit Experimental) to team up with companies that would not previously have worked with it.\n\nFinding the money will be another problem. And whereas the second offset was underwritten by the commitment of successive administrations, the third offset is no longer considered a strategy, merely a helpful way to tackle wider defence modernisation. Above all, it needs a compelling operational concept, tested in war games, that service chiefs feel able to support. The Chinese and the Russians will be watching with interest.",

                "body": "THERE IS NOTHING new about either fake news or Russian disinformation campaigns. Back in 1983, at the height of the cold war, an extraordinary story appeared in a little-known pro-Soviet newspaper called the Patriot. It claimed to have evidence that the Pentagon had deliberately created AIDS as a biological weapon and was ready to export the virus to other countries, mainly in the developing world, as a way of gaining control over them. Within a few years the story had reappeared in mainstream publications in more than 50 countries.\n\nIn February last year, in the wake of revelations about Russia's interference in America's presidential election but before the full extent of its activities on Facebook, Twitter and Google had become known, the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, announced that he had created units within the army to wage an information war: \"Essentially the information conflict is a component of general conflict. Deriving from that, Russia has made an effort to form structures that are engaged in this matter.\" He added that these were far more effective than anything Russia had used before for \"counter-propaganda\" purposes. A week earlier, General Petr Pavel, the Czech head of NATO's military committee, had revealed that a false report of a rape by German soldiers in Lithuania had been concocted by Russia.\n\nThe internet and social media are creating entirely new opportunities for influence operations (IO) and the mass manipulation of opinion. Those technologies allow IO accurately to target those people likely to be most susceptible to their message, taking advantage of the \"echo-chamber\" effect of platforms such as Facebook, where users see only news and opinions that confirm their prejudices.\n\nFacebook now estimates that during and after the American election in 2016 a Russian-linked troll farm called the Internet Research Agency was responsible for at least 120 fake pages and 80,000 posts that were directly received by 29m Americans. Through sharing and liking, the number multiplied to nearly 150m, about two-thirds of the potential electorate. The ads aimed to exploit America's culture wars. Similar IO have been launched in Europe, where Russia attempts to bolster support for populist movements that oppose liberal social norms.\n\nIt is not just Russia that conducts IO against other countries. Jihadist extremists and hacker groups employed by rogue states or criminal networks pose similar if lesser threats. And although the big social-media companies now claim to be working on solutions, including better and quicker attribution of messages, Russian IO techniques are bound to adapt accordingly. Rand Waltzman, a former programme manager at America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and now at the RAND Corporation, explains that \"when target forces start to counter these [Russian] efforts and/or expose them on a large scale, the Russians are likely to accelerate the improvement of their techniques...in other words, an information-warfare arms race is likely to ensue.\"\n\nIn the future, \"fake news\" put together with the aid of artificial intelligence will be so realistic that even the best-resourced and most professional news organisation will be hard pressed to tell the difference between the real and the made-up sort. Official websites and social-media accounts will become increasingly vulnerable to hackers, who may be able not only to provoke stockmarket crashes and riots but even contrive crises between countries that may induce them to go to war with each other.",

                "body": "HE CALLS IT \"the geopolitics of the gap\". Carlos Pascual of IHS Markit, a consultancy, says that one of the biggest challenges for the world's policymakers in coming years will be to strengthen pledges made in the Paris agreement. They still amount to barely one-third of what is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nRenewable-energy advocates talk of a \"tipping-point\" at which renewables become cheap enough to drive fossil fuels out of the electricity mix. To hear them talk about falling costs, you would think the world was almost there (see chart). Yet excluding hydropower, renewables still produce only 8% of the world's electricity, and far less of the energy needed for heating, cooling and transport, which are harder to decarbonise.\n\nA few statistics in a new book, \"Taming the Sun\", by Varun Sivaram, of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, DC, highlight the obstacles to be overcome before solar photovoltaics become a mainstream energy source. However fast the price of a kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by solar panels has fallen, he writes, the price of a gigabyte of data storage in a microchip has fallen a million times faster. The recent drop in solar prices has been due to economies of scale, not improvements in performance.\n\nMoreover, Mr Sivaram argues that although solar panels are cost-competitive as a niche energy source, their economics become less attractive the more they are deployed. That is because they cannot be turned on and off, so they flood the electricity market when the sun is high, driving down wholesale prices. The more solar power is added to the grid, the lower its value.\n\nBatteries could help solve that problem by storing the power for times of strong demand. But no one has yet invented a lithium-ion battery capable of storing solar energy for long periods of time to even out seasonal variations in sunlight. Electric vehicles (EVs) could speed up the energy transition, by cleaning up the transport component of energy and offering a way to store electricity, too. But mass electrification brings its own problems.\n\nIn order to incorporate large quantities of renewables, interconnected power systems will be needed so that those with an abundance of clean energy can share it with those who lack it. The risk is that these will recreate the vulnerabilities of cross-border pipelines. Karen Smith Stegen of Jacobs University in Germany argues in \"The Geopolitics of Renewables\" that interconnected grids are relatively safe because all the countries involved want to keep the electricity flowing smoothly. But high-voltage, direct-current transmission lines, such as those now being proposed between north Africa and Europe, may be more at risk of meddling.\n\nNone of these problems is insurmountable. New, more efficient solar technologies are being developed. Financial innovation is creating new ways of investing in renewable energy. Elon Musk, of Tesla and SpaceX fame, may yet produce lithium-ion batteries cheap enough to revolutionise transport. In the West he gets most of the attention, but China is also doing much pioneering work, from EVs to supergrids.",

                "body": "AT THE UN climate summit in Bonn last November some Americans came up with their own riposte to President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Outside the main conference building they put up a tent housing a rowdy coalition of people from 20 states and 110 cities under the banner \"We are still in\". Some non-American delegates at the conference found this fringe event more reassuring than the climate talks themselves. It showed that, even without Mr Trump and the federal government, local activists in America are committed to the spirit of the agreement.\n\nThe EU and China, each in its own way, are taking up America's mantle of climate leadership. The task remains daunting (see article). At present the EU has the boldest plans. It wants to lead the clean-energy transition, aiming to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions in 2050 by 80-95% from 1990 levels, which means almost entirely decarbonising its energy system. Germany reckons that its experience of launching an Energiewende (energy transition) in 2000 qualifies it to help lead the world away from fossil fuels. But not all its neighbours like the model it offers.\n\nStart with gas. For the next few decades Germany is likely to rely on imported natural gas as it phases out its nuclear and coal-fired power plants and brings in more electricity generated by wind and solar. Gas reserves elsewhere in Europe, such as the Netherlands, are declining. So Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, backed by five energy multinationals, has launched a project to lay a new pipeline to Germany, Nord Stream 2, under the Baltic Sea. This would double the capacity for Russian gas piped to Europe by 2019. It would also replace most of the gas flowing to Europe along the Brotherhood pipeline via Ukraine and Slovakia, reducing their transit revenues (see map).\n\nNord Stream 2 is highly divisive. The European Parliament says it increases Europe's dependence on a single route for gas imports, which is bad for energy security. American diplomats say it exposes Europe to manipulation of supply by Russia, as happened with Ukraine. (It also undermines America's export strategy for shipping more LNG to Europe, though they keep quiet about this.) Foreign-policy hawks believe it strengthens Russia's economic influence over Europe and weakens Ukraine.\n\nRussia and Germany retort that it is purely a commercial venture. Its supporters do not see it as a potential Russian chokehold but as a way to bind Russia more closely to Europe, because trade makes each more dependent on the other. Yet the plan has created a rift between Germany and its eastern neighbours.\n\nThat is also true of the Energiewende, underlining how divisive even clean energy can be when its effects spill across borders. Germany initially saw its dash for solar and wind as a purely domestic issue. The decision to phase out nuclear power after Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011 was a response to a deep-rooted domestic environmental lobby. Germany did not consult its neighbours on ramping up renewables, even though its grid is linked to many other countries' energy systems.\n\nThe foreign-policy ramifications have become wider since. Notwithstanding Nord Stream 2, renewables are part of a strategy to reduce the country's dependence on fossil-fuel imports (most of its coal and oil also come from Russia). Moreover, Germany hopes the Energiewende will give it a global edge in clean-energy technology. Siemens, for instance, has become a global leader in wind-turbine manufacturing.\n\nBut the rapid spread of wind power in northern Germany, and the lack of transmission lines to the industrial centres farther south, has caused headaches. Thomas Sattich of the University of Stavanger in Norway writes that when the wind blows hard, surplus renewable energy is pushed to neighbours such as Poland, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, clogging up their electricity systems. Excess renewable energy also brings down wholesale power prices, which is bad for investment. .\n\nOn the grid\n\nThe best way of dealing with such problems is more cross-border co-ordination, as well as more high-voltage power lines. The European Commission is finalising packages to redesign the block's electricity markets. In January European lawmakers proposed increasing the EU's goals for the share of renewables in the energy mix to 35% by 2030.\n\nNorway, with its abundance of round-the-clock hydroelectricity, wants to play a role as Europe's \"green battery\". It is also among ten countries by the North Sea that subscribe to the North Sea Countries' Offshore Grid Initiative, which aims to create a regional supergrid. Miguel Arias Cañete of the European Commission says that such interconnections are essential if the goal of 35% renewables is to be achieved. But he also notes resistance from local communities to large, unsightly power lines, and from national-grid operators to surrendering autonomy. Sometimes the commission must wish for the sort of control over energy policy that China's mandarins enjoy.",

                "title": "China is rapidly developing its clean-energy technology",
                "body": "WHEN IT COMES to energy, no country generates such bittersweet superlatives as China. It is the world's largest consumer of coal and the second-largest of oil, after America. It has the largest power-generation capacity, by a wide margin. It also produces more carbon dioxide than any other country.\n\nChina is hoping to deal with this over-dependence on fossil fuels partly by rebalancing the economy away from energy-intensive industries. But it also leads the world in clean energy. In recent years, through a combination of subsidies, policy targets and manufacturing incentives, it has spent more on cleaning up its energy system than America and the EU combined. Last year alone it shelled out $132bn, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), a consultancy.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) says China has one-third of the world's wind power, a quarter of its solar capacity, six of the top ten solar-panel manufacturers and four of the top ten wind-turbine makers. It sells more electric vehicles than the rest of the world combined. It also leads the world in construction of nuclear power plants. In December it gave the go-ahead for what is expected to be the world's largest carbon-trading scheme.\n\nGiven China's thirst for energy, the combined impact of these advances in renewables is still relatively small. Non-fossil-fuel energy, chiefly hydro and nuclear, accounts for only 12% of its total energy mix. And China is far from self-sufficient. That is why, for the next decade at least, China's main energy-related geopolitical concern will be the need to secure fossil fuels.\n\nThis is already evident in the plethora of deals that its state-owned companies are doing with oil and gas producers in the Middle East and Russia, both to finance new projects and to help develop them. But China is also reaching out to America.\n\nZou Ji of the Energy Foundation, a think-tank, says the immediate priority for China's energy policymakers is to curb the dirtiest uses of coal, especially heating urban homes with it. For this, America's shale revolution may be a blessing, he says. By adding large quantities of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to global markets, it has made it cheaper and easier for China's coastal areas to switch from coal to gas. Last year the country's LNG imports grew by 50%.\n\nIncreasingly China is looking to America to help it diversify its sources of supply. In February China National Petroleum Corporation, a state behemoth, signed the first ever long-term contract to buy LNG from an American supplier, Texas-based Cheniere Energy. Mr Zou says that more energy interdependence between China and America, particularly in the LNG market, could be good for relations between the two superpowers, especially if it helps reduce America's trade deficit with China.\n\nEventually, China's increasing production and use of renewables, batteries and electric vehicles (EVs) are also likely to have geopolitical consequences, even if that is not the government's primary aim. China could benefit in three ways.\n\nAll power to the yellow emperor\n\nFirst, by being able to produce more of its own energy, it will reduce its reliance on fuel imports that may be vulnerable to global instability. Second, its \"soft power\" will be strengthened. This is already evident in its leadership role in the Paris climate agreement. Third, and perhaps most important, the development of clean-energy technologies -- especially batteries and EVs -- could put it firmly in the vanguard of the energy transition, ahead of America and Europe, and provide a new impetus for economic growth.\n\nCurrently the race is wide open. No country has an unassailable lead. Whether clean-energy technology becomes a source of healthy competition or geopolitical friction will depend largely on global trade. If it becomes bogged down in protectionism, trade wars and cyber-crime, everyone will lose. But that need not happen.\n\nSo far, many in the West have been sceptical about China's role in renewable-energy technology. The country's solar industry is thought to have piggybacked on Germany's generous renewable-energy subsidies and has benefited from massive government support. In 2012 the European Commission launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations of Chinese solar-panel imports. The following year the two sides reached a settlement, followed by the imposition of minimum prices. In 2014 America slapped import duties on Chinese solar-panel imports. In January the Trump administration imposed more tariffs on imported solar panels, most of which come from China.\n\nThe Chinese have bungled some of their own renewable-energy policies, building large-scale projects in remote locations without the transmission lines to support them. Some Western experts argue that China lacks adequate regulatory structures for a smooth transition to clean energy. And in 2010 the Chinese authorities halted most exports of rare earths, raising fears about their stranglehold on the supply of minerals critical to green-energy technology (see article).\n\nHowever, such criticisms risk underplaying the sheer entrepreneurial zeal that the Chinese put into clean energy, and their growing ambition to decentralise as well as decarbonise the energy supply. Both may give China a dominant position in developing the energy technologies of the future.\n\nFor instance, the world's biggest solar-panel manufacturer, Shanghai-based Jinko Solar, is a relative newcomer that started only 11 years ago. Since 2013 it has quintupled global production to a mighty 10 gigawatts (GW) a year and doubled its global market share to 10%. Gener Miao, its head of sales, explains that the firm has succeeded by internationalising its marketing efforts and relentlessly investing in technology. Support from the Chinese government now mostly goes on early-stage research projects, he claims.\n\nAnother case in point is one of China's biggest wind-turbine developers, Envision, also from Shanghai. It has invented turbines that operate at low wind speeds so they can be placed close to urban centres, rather than in the country's remote northwest. But the company views the turbines merely as a cash cow for a bigger ambition: to create a global \"energy internet\", or operating system, that helps companies manage locally produced, or \"distributed\", energy assets such as turbines and solar panels, electric vehicles, battery storage and commercial electrical appliances. Launched in 2016, Envision says the system already manages more than 100GW of renewable assets globally (more than America's entire wind capacity).\n\nChina is also upgrading its regulatory structure. Sophie Lu of BNEF says that distributed solar energy accounted for almost one-third of the 53GW of new solar capacity installed in China last year. This surprised everyone because until recently all renewable energy had been installed in remote areas on a utility scale. The aim is to spur reform of China's gargantuan power company, State Grid. \"The government is using technology, innovation and power-market reform to break the monopoly of the grid,\" says Ms Lu.\n\nIn future the main bone of contention may be the new technologies developed to make renewable energy and storage ever more cost-competitive. Some American experts fret that by giving a low priority to renewable energy, the Trump administration may put America's industry at a disadvantage in relation to China's. Since President Trump decided to pull out of the Paris agreement, he appears to have jettisoned America's pledge to double the $6.4bn the government is due to spend on energy innovation by 2020. China pledged $7.6bn, so it may soon take the lead. Equally telling, research by Devashree Saha and Mark Muro of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, shows that patents and venture-capital investment in clean-energy technologies in America recently peaked. Patenting, they said, was increasingly done by foreign firms, especially Chinese ones.\n\nIf China's growth in clean-energy technology leads to more protectionism, along the lines of the Trump administration's move in January against imports of solar panels, clean tech could become a trade battleground. The same could happen if China denies Western energy technology a meaningful place in its markets (as it has done with American internet firms) or restricts access to its rare earths. But technology also provides scope for collaboration. If America, the EU and China can build that into the transition to renewables, energy geopolitics will start to look a lot more promising.",

                "body": "DESPITE THE EXTRAORDINARY decline in interstate wars over the past 70 years, many foreign-policy experts believe that the world is entering a new era in which they are becoming all too possible again. But there is a big difference between regional wars that might be triggered by the actions of a rogue state, such as North Korea or Iran, and those between great powers, which remain much less likely. Still, increased competition between America, Russia and China poses threats to the international order and does have a military dimension.\n\nThis special report will concentrate on what could lead to a future conflict between big powers rather than consider the threat of a war on the Korean peninsula, which is firmly in the present. A war to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons seems a more speculative prospect for now, but could become more likely a few years hence. Either would be terrible, but its destructive capacity would pale in comparison with full-blown conflict between the West and Russia or China, even if that did not escalate to a nuclear exchange.\n\nThe main reason why great-power warfare has become somewhat more plausible than at any time since the height of the cold war is that both Russia and China are dissatisfied powers determined to change the terms of a Western-devised, American-policed international order which they believe does not serve their legitimate interests. In the past decade both have invested heavily in modernising their armed forces in ways that exploit Western political and technical vulnerabilities and thwart America's ability to project power in what they see as their spheres of influence. Both have shown themselves prepared to impose their will on neighbours by force. Both countries' leaders are giving voice to popular yearning for renewed national power and international respect, and both are reaping the domestic political benefits. Where they differ is that Russia, demographically and economically, is a declining power with an opportunistic leadership, whereas China is clearly a rising one that has time on its side and sees itself as at least the equal of America, if not eventually its superior.\n\nRussia's president, Vladimir Putin, wants to regain at least some of the prestige and clout his country lost after the collapse of the Soviet Union, an event he has described as the \"greatest geopolitical tragedy of the [20th] century\". He believes that in the 1990s the West rejected making Russia an equal partner, and that the European Union's and NATO's eastward expansion jeopardised Russia's external and internal security. In a statement on national-security strategy at the end of 2015 the Russian government designated NATO as the greatest threat it faced. It believes that the West actively tries to bring about \"colour revolutions\" of the sort seen in Ukraine, both in Russia's \"near abroad\" and in Russia itself.\n\nRussia's armed forces, although no match for America's, are undergoing substantial modernisation, carry out frequent large-scale exercises and are capable of conducting high-intensity warfare at short notice across a narrow front against NATO forces. Russian military aircraft often probe European air defences and buzz NATO warships in the Baltic and the Black Sea, risking an incident that could rapidly get out of control.\n\nWar games carried out by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank, in 2015 concluded that in the face of a Russian attack \"as currently postured, NATO cannot successfully defend the territory of its most exposed members\". NATO has since slightly beefed up its presence in the Baltic states and Poland, but probably not enough to change the RAND report's conclusion that it would take Russian forces 60 hours at most to fight their way to the capital of Latvia or Estonia.\n\nIf that were to happen, NATO's political leaders would have to choose between three bad options: launch a bloody counter-offensive fraught with the risk of escalation; exacerbate the conflict itself by threatening targets in Russia; or concede defeat, with disastrous consequences for the alliance. Domestic support for the first and second options would be fragile (in Britain and Germany a Pew survey last year found only minority backing for NATO's Article 5 commitment to mutual defence if Russia were to attack a neighbouring alliance member, see chart). And Mr Putin's doctrine of \"escalate to de-escalate\" would almost certainly bring the threat, and possibly even the use, of Russian tactical nuclear weapons to encourage NATO to throw in the towel. Mr Putin reckons, probably correctly, that he has a much higher tolerance for risk than his Western counterparts.\n\nThe probability of such a direct test of NATO members' Article 5 promise is low. But Mr Putin has shown in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria that he is an opportunist prepared to roll the dice when he is feeling desperate or lucky. A second-term Trump administration, shorn of generals committed to NATO and with a more populist Republican party in Congress, might well tempt him, especially if low energy prices and a weak economy were creating mounting problems at home.\n\nSome suggest that America and China are destined to go to war, falling into the \"Thucydides trap\" as encountered in antiquity by Sparta and Athens. In essence, the established power feels threatened by the rising power, which in turn feels resentful and frustrated. Graham Allison, the author of a popular book expounding this thesis, believes that \"war between the US and China in the decades ahead is not just possible, but much more likely than currently recognised.\"\n\nMr Allison's prognosis, based on an analysis of past conflicts between incumbent powers and thrusting newcomers, may be too deterministic. Although China and America do not have anything like the shared international agenda that America had with Britain when the roles were reversed, they are bound together by a web of economic interests. Strategic patience and taking the long view comes naturally to Chinese leaders, and successive American presidents (except perhaps the current one) have tried hard to show that far from wanting to keep China in its box, they wish to see it playing a full and responsible part in the international system. The previous contests for hegemony cited by Mr Allison were not conducted under the shadow of nuclear weapons, which for all their risks remain the ultimate disincentive for great powers to wage war against each other.\n\nMoreover, says Jonathan Eyal of RUSI, a defence think-tank, demographic factors and changing social attitudes in China suggest that there would be little popular appetite for conflict with America, despite the sometimes nationalistic posturing of state media. Like other developed countries, the country has very low birth rates, fast-decreasing levels of violence and large middle classes who define success by tapping the latest smartphone or putting down a deposit on a new car. In a culture of coddling children prompted by the one-child policy, Chinese parents would probably be extremely reluctant to send their precious \"snowflakes\" off to war.\n\nNo coffins, please\n\nEven in Russia, where Mr Putin has encouraged a revival of a more macho culture, he wants to avoid casualties as far as possible. In his view, the thousands of coffins returning from Afghanistan in the 1980s were partly to blame for the collapse of the Soviet Union, so he has gone to extraordinary lengths both to minimise and conceal the deaths of any conscripted troops in Ukraine. In Syria, he has used private military contractors wherever possible.\n\nThe risk that the West will run into a major conflict with China is lower than with Russia, but it is not negligible and may be growing. China resents the American naval presence in the western Pacific, and particularly the \"freedom of navigation\" operations that the US Seventh Fleet conducts in the South China Sea to demonstrate that America will not accept any Chinese claims or actions in the region that threaten its core national interests or those of its allies.\n\nFor its part, China is planning to develop its A2/AD capabilities, especially long-range anti-ship missiles and a powerful navy equipped with state-of-the-art surface vessels and a large submarine force. The idea is first to push the US Navy beyond the \"first island chain\" and ultimately make it too dangerous for it to operate within the \"second island chain\" (see map). Neither move is imminent, but China has already made a lot of progress. If there were a new crisis over Taiwan, America would no longer send an aircraft-carrier battle group through the Taiwan Strait to show its resolve, as it did in 1996.\n\nHow such tensions will play out depends partly on America's allies. If Japan's recently re-elected prime minister, Shinzo Abe, succeeds in his ambition to change the country's pacifist constitution, the Japanese navy is likely to increase its capabilities and more explicitly train to fight alongside its American counterpart. At the same time other, weaker allies such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia may conclude that bowing to Chinese military and economic power is a safer bet than hoping for a declining America to fight their corner.\n\nThe greatest danger lies in miscalculation through a failure to understand an adversary's intentions, leading to an unplanned escalation that runs out of control. Competition in the \"grey zone\" between peace and war requires constant calibration that could all too easily be lost in the heat of the moment.",

                "title": "The shale boom could prove a double-edged sword for America",
                "body": "WHEN RYAN ZINKE, America's secretary of the interior, turned up for his first day in office a year ago, the ex-Navy Seal arrived on a horse called Tonto, wearing a cowboy hat. Since then, the man leading the Trump administration's charge to unlock vast tracts of federal land for oil and gas drilling has brandished American oil like a gunslinger. Using a slogan favoured by President Donald Trump, he talks of \"energy dominance\". Explaining the concept to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, last year, he said: \"Our goal is an America that is the strongest energy superpower that the world has ever known...America's strength relies on American energy. And I don't want to see us ever held hostage to a foreign country to heat our homes or to power our nation.\" He made it clear that by energy he meant chiefly oil, natural gas and coal.\n\nAs with many of the Trump administration's favourite terms, the meaning of energy dominance is hazy and depends on the audience. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January the president struck a more conciliatory note than Mr Zinke, promising to use American oil and gas to provide energy security to its allies. \"No country should be held hostage to a single provider of energy,\" he said. But the point of energy dominance is that Mr Trump wants America to produce and export more oil, gas and coal and will try to undo years of environmental safeguards and regulations to achieve it.\n\nHe has picked a good moment. Not only has America's oil and gas production soared; the shale revolution has greatly reduced the country's dependence on imported crude oil and petroleum products, from 57% a decade ago to about 20%. The effect on the trade balance, the focus of Mr Trump's \"America First\" policy, was already dramatic even before he took office. The energy-trade deficit has come down from $416bn at its peak in 2008, when it accounted for half the total trade deficit, to $53bn in the first ten months of 2017, less than a tenth of the total.\n\nThe decline in import dependence has already had geopolitical effects. In her book, \"Windfall\", Meghan O'Sullivan shows that between 2011 and 2014 American oil replaced supplies disrupted by political developments in Sudan, Syria, Iran and Libya, \"nearly one barrel for one barrel\". That helped keep oil markets stable. Plentiful oil at home has also made it easier for America to impose sanctions on oil producers it views as dangerous. It helped persuade other countries to pressure Iran to sign a deal putting its nuclear ambitions on hold in 2015, because they did not fear a resulting spike in global oil prices. As Amos Hochstein, the State Department's energy envoy at the time, muses, \"It was lucky timing that America became an energy superpower.\"\n\nFoot on the gas\n\nNatural gas may have strengthened America's hand abroad even more than oil. In 2017 the country became a net gas exporter for the first time in 60 years. This has helped establish a global market in natural gas, giving the world easier access to a fuel that produces only a quarter as much carbon dioxide as coal and half as much as oil.\n\nFor now, America's biggest gas export market is via pipelines to Mexico, creating what is fast becoming an integrated North American energy powerhouse (as long as Mr Trump does not kill off the North American Free-Trade Agreement). But globally the change is being driven by exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The dome-like LNG tankers heading out from Louisiana and Texas are creating a market that can flexibly and cheaply deliver gas where it is needed. LNG exports took off only in 2016. By 2022 America is expected to vie with Australia and Qatar as one of the world's biggest LNG exporters.\n\nMore LNG helps the transition towards cleaner energy, potentially slowing (though not stopping) the pace of global warming. A global LNG market also eases one of the thorniest problems in energy geopolitics: Russia's use of gas pipelines to bully neighbours such as Ukraine. American LNG is still more expensive than Russian gas, so not much of it is sold to Europe. But its mere presence helps reassure the Europeans about their energy security. Partly in response, Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, has turned eastward, offering piped gas and LNG to China, where demand is also rising.\n\nMr Trump is pursuing China, too, offering LNG as a way to narrow the bilateral trade imbalance. Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of IHS Markit, a consultancy, points to this as an example of how trade in energy might actually soothe global tensions. He says that China now sees America as part of the solution to its energy needs, rather than a competitor for scarce resources. Mr Trump has also discussed LNG exports with leaders from India and South Korea, Mr Yergin notes. \"He has become the world's number one LNG salesman.\"\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nThis windfall is likely to continue. America's oil and gas output is still rising. According to the International Energy Agency, by 2025 the shale revolution will have unlocked more oil and gas in America more quickly than in any other country, including Saudi Arabia in its heyday from 1966 to 1981.\n\nThe Trump administration wants to build on this success by making life easier for fossil-fuel producers. In his first year Mr Zinke has sought to smash what he calls a \"fortress of red tape\", open up offshore reserves to drilling (except in Florida, where it risked jeopardising the political ambitions of Rick Scott, the Republican governor), and ease restrictions on coal mining and natural-gas production imposed under President Barack Obama.\n\nWhether all this deregulation will make much difference to domestic energy production is questionable. Jason Bordoff of Columbia University writes that markets play a much bigger role. Cheap natural gas, for example, hurts coal far more than the clean-power regulations that the Trump administration is now promising to remove. And Congress, state governments and the courts can block policies to stimulate fossil-fuel production and roll back environmental regulation, whatever the wishes of the federal government.\n\nThe geopolitical effects of the shale boom have been complex and have been compounded by other policy shifts such as sanctions and protectionist trade policies. Some experts feel that the idea of \"energy dominance\" sounds imperialistic. The mere idea of \"weaponising\" oil undermines years of American efforts to persuade countries like Russia not to use energy for political ends.\n\nSome of America's trade policies may also be counterproductive. The country's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement which includes some of America's biggest potential LNG customers, such as Japan, was self-defeating, because it makes it harder for America's allies to import its LNG.\n\nStephen Cheney and Andrew Holland of the American Security Project, a think-tank, argue that America's greatest contribution to global energy security since the oil shocks of the 1970s has been to keep global energy markets fluid. Some analysts worry that this fluidity would be jeopardised if the Trump administration were to use oil and gas as a bargaining chip in bilateral relations, as China has done.\n\nAlthough the shale revolution has been good for global consumers, it has not been a clearcut benefit to American influence abroad. The collapse of oil prices in 2014 nudged OPEC, Russia and other producers into an \"OPEC-plus\" alliance, raising Russia's profile in the Middle East at a time when an inward-looking America was less engaged. Moreover, the use of sanctions against Iran, Russia and Venezuela has created a perception among some countries, including China, that America is playing a \"dirty economic game\". This has brought its opponents closer together, says Sarah Ladislaw of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. China has offered financial support to all three of those countries. Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil company, is tapping Venezuelan oil in exchange for cash.\n\nMatthew Bey of Stratfor, a risk consultancy, talks of a \"mosaic of forces\" threatening American energy diplomacy as China overtakes America as the world's biggest energy consumer. He notes the alarm caused in Washington, DC, by the recent news that China might take a preferential stake in the planned initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company. \"It's not just Russia against the West,\" he says. \"It's Russia, China, Iran and others looking at pragmatic opportunities to chip away at Western hegemony.\"\n\nAbove all, Mr Trump's tub-thumping for coal, oil and gas appears to run counter to a worldwide push to lessen dependence on fossil fuels, improve energy efficiency and combat global warming. So although, for now, Americans may feel relief at the shale boom, it could prove a double-edged sword. If their country continues to promote fossil fuels at the expense of cleaner energy sources, its dominance is unlikely to last.",

                "title": "Neither war nor peace",
                "body": "A KEY ELEMENT of Chinese strategy is to \"know your enemy\". The generals who worked at the Academy of Military Science in Beijing studied every aspect of America's \"revolution in military affairs\" in the 1980s, driven by advances in microprocessors, sensors and communications. They concluded that although China was well placed to exploit the new technologies to create its own version of \"informationised\" warfare, it would not be in a position to challenge American military might directly until the middle of the 21st century. To do so sooner would be suicidal. H.R. McMaster, Donald Trump's national security adviser, once observed: \"There are two ways to fight the United States: asymmetrically and stupid.\"\n\nAccordingly, the Chinese generals and their Russian counterparts, who had been equally impressed by the precision-strike capabilities that America demonstrated in the first Gulf war, sought ways to reap some of the political and territorial gains of military victory without crossing the threshold of overt warfare. They came up with the concept of a \"grey zone\" in which powers such as Russia, China and Iran can exercise aggression and coercion without exposing themselves to the risks of escalation and severe retribution. Mark Galeotti of the Institute of International Relations in Prague describes this approach as \"guerrilla geopolitics\".\n\nA key aspect of grey-zone challenges is that they should be sufficiently ambiguous to leave targets unsure how to respond. If they do too little, they will face a series of small but cumulatively significant defeats. If they do too much, they risk being held responsible for reckless escalation. As Hal Brands of the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute argues, grey-zone tactics are \"frequently shrouded in misinformation and deception, and are often conducted in ways that are meant to make proper attribution of the responsible party difficult to nail down\". They are drawn from a comprehensive toolset that ranges from cyber attacks to propaganda and subversion, economic blackmail and sabotage, sponsorship of proxy forces and creeping military expansionism.\n\nThe clearest recent cases of grey-zone challenges are Russia's intervention in Ukraine, China's assertive behaviour in the South and East China Seas and Iran's use of proxy militias to establish an arc of influence from Iraq through Syria into Lebanon. All three countries recognise and to some extent fear superior Western military power. But all of them also see vulnerabilities that they can exploit.\n\nA Russian grey-zone strategy is to undermine faith in Western institutions and encourage populist movements by meddling in elections and using bots and trolls on social media to fan grievances and prejudice. The result, the Kremlin hopes, will sap the West's capacity to respond resolutely to acts that defy international norms. If Russian cyber attacks did help to get Donald Trump elected, they have been astonishingly successful in their broader aim, if not in the narrower one of relieving Ukraine-related sanctions.\n\nThere is no evidence of Chinese complicity in Russian-style hacker attacks on the West, but officially sanctioned trolls send out hundreds of millions of social-media posts every year attacking Western values and pumping up nationalist sentiment. The advent of Mr Trump serves Chinese aims too. His repudiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership removed a challenge to China's regional economic hegemony, a key objective of its grey-zone strategy. And the American president's hostility to free trade and his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord has allowed Xi Jinping to cast himself, improbably, as a defender of the international order.\n\nAs for Iran, America's inconsistency and lack of a long-term strategy in the Middle East has offered boundless opportunities for grey-zone advantage-seeking. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama in their different ways allowed Iran to use a combination of soft religious and hard power through well-trained and equipped Shia militias to turn first Iraq and then most of Syria into something resembling Iranian satrapies.\n\nGrey-zone success depends on patience and an ability to blend together all the instruments of state power in ways that pluralistic, democratic societies find harder to achieve. Hybrid warfare may be as old as warfare itself, but in Ukraine Russia provided a near-textbook example of it in its modern form, using a variety of techniques: sophisticated propaganda that stirred up local grievances and legitimised military action; cyber attacks on power grids and disruption of gas supplies; covert or deniable operations, such as sending \"little green men\" (soldiers in unmarked green army uniforms) into Crimea and providing weapons and military support to separatist irregular forces; the threat of \"escalating to de-escalate\", even including limited use of nuclear weapons. All this dissuaded the West from even contemplating a military response of any kind. Whenever the sale of defensive weapons to Ukraine was mooted in Washington, Mr Putin threatened to expand and intensify a war in which he claimed not to be a participant.\n\nRussia's objective is not to \"win\" a war in Ukraine but to reverse the country's attempt to move out of Russia's orbit; to discourage other countries, such as Belarus, from trying anything similar; and to stoke nationalist and anti-Western sentiment at home. The effort has not been without cost. Sanctions have hurt. Making Crimea a viable entity will take time and lots of money. Most important of all, NATO has rediscovered some of its sense of purpose. But neither Mr Putin nor any likely successor would hesitate to apply the same hybrid-warfare techniques in the future should the need arise.\n\nChina's grey-zone campaign to assert uncontested control over the South China Sea and jurisdiction over disputed islands in the East China Sea has been going on for much longer, and has turned a darker shade of grey over time as the country's confidence and power has grown. Since 2009, when China submitted a map to the United Nations showing a \"nine-dash line\" that supported its claim to \"indisputable sovereignty\" over 90% of the South China Sea (see map), it has applied what James Holmes of the US Naval War College has described as \"small-stick diplomacy\" (as opposed to the big stick of conventional naval power), using its highly capable coastguard and militiamen embedded in its fishing fleet to push other littoral states out of waters to which it claims ancestral rights.\n\nIt has been able to cow most of its neighbours into sulky acquiescence while avoiding a direct confrontation with American naval ships, which did not want to risk a major incident over what China portrayed as maritime policing. When in 2013 China took its provocations a step further by sending civil engineers to the Spratly and Paracel archipelagoes to construct artificial islands, Xi Jinping said China had no intention of militarising them. But in 2017, satellite images released by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies showed shelters for missile batteries and military radar installations being constructed on the Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi Reefs in the Spratly Islands. Fighter jets will be on their way next. Mr Holmes suggests that such strategic gains cannot now be reversed short of open warfare, which means they will almost certainly not be. Unlike traditional warfare, grey-zone strategies will not produce decisive results within a defined time frame. But both China and Russia have demonstrated that hybrid warfare, if not pushed too far, can achieve lasting, if not costless, results.\n\nHybrid warfare is hard to deter unless the target state itself resorts to hybrid strategies. Mr Brands sees no reason why America and its allies cannot play that game too. America has potent economic and financial tools at its disposal, along with an arsenal of cyber weapons, expert special forces, a network of alliances and unmatched soft power. But the West tends to think about conflict in a binary way: you are either at war or at peace; you win or you lose. Its adversaries are more attuned to conflict somewhere between war and peace, and to blurring distinctions between civil and military assets in pursuit of their goals. So for opponents of the rules-based system, the grey zone will remain fertile territory.",

                "body": "NUCLEAR WEAPONS, LIKE the poor, seem likely always to be with us. Even though arms-control agreements between America and the Soviet Union, and then Russia, have drastically reduced overall numbers, both countries are committed to costly long-term modernisation programmes for their strategic nuclear forces that should ensure their viability for the rest of the century.\n\nRussia is about halfway through recapitalising its strategic forces, which include a soon-to-be-deployed road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM); a new heavy ICBM; eight new ballistic-missile submarines (SSBNs), most of which will be in service by 2020; upgraded heavy bombers; and a new stealth bomber able to carry hypersonic cruise missiles. America will replace every leg of its nuclear triad over the next 30 years, at an estimated cost of $1.2trn. There will be 12 new SSBNs; a new penetrating strike bomber, the B21; a replacement for the Minuteman III ICBMs; and a new long-range air-launched cruise missile. As Tom Plant, a nuclear expert at RUSI, a think-tank, puts it: \"For both Russia and the US, nukes have retained their primacy. You only have to look at how they are spending their money.\"\n\nOther states with nuclear weapons, such as China, Pakistan, India and, particularly, North Korea, are hard at work to improve both the quality and the size of their nuclear forces. Iran's long-term intentions remain ambiguous, despite the deal in 2015 to constrain its nuclear programme. Nuclear weapons have lost none of their allure or their unique ability to inspire dread. Whether or not they are ever used in anger, they are very much part of the future of warfare.\n\nSo far, the best argument for nuclear weapons has been that the fear of mutually assured destruction (MAD) has deterred states that possess them from going to war with each other. MAD rests on the principle of a secure second-strike capability, which means that even if one side is subjected to the most wide-ranging first strike conceivable, it will still have more than enough nuclear weapons left to destroy the aggressor. When warheads became accurate enough to obliterate most of an adversary's missiles in their silos, America and Russia turned to submarines and mobile launchers to keep MAD viable.\n\nA more dangerous world\n\nIt still is, and is likely to remain so for some time. But disruptive new technologies, worsening relations between Russia and America and a less cautious Russian leadership than in the cold war have raised fears that a new era of strategic instability may be approaching. James Miller, who was under-secretary of defence for policy at the Pentagon until 2014, thinks that the deployment of increasingly advanced cyber, space, missile-defence, long-range conventional strike and autonomous systems \"has the potential to threaten both sides' nuclear retaliatory strike capabilities, particularly their command-and-control apparatuses\", and that \"the potential of a dispute leading to a crisis, of a crisis leading to a war, and of a war escalating rapidly\" is growing.\n\nIn a new report, Mr Miller and Richard Fontaine, the president of the Centre for a New American Security (CNAS), identify cyber and counter-space (eg, satellite jammers, lasers and high-power microwave-gun systems) attacks as possible triggers for an unplanned conflict. Other new weapons may threaten either side's capability for nuclear retaliation, particularly their strategic command-and-control centres. James Acton, a nuclear-policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, lists three trends that could undermine stability in a future crisis: advanced technology that can threaten the survivability of nuclear attacks; command-and-control systems that are used for both nuclear and conventional weapons, leaving room for confusion; and an increased risk of cyber attacks on such systems because of digitisation.\n\nBoth America and Russia rely heavily on digital networks and space-based systems for command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C3ISR) to run almost every aspect of their respective military enterprises. Cyber space and outer space therefore offer attackers tempting targets in the very early stages of a conflict. In the utmost secrecy, both sides have invested heavily in offensive cyber capabilities. In 2013 the Defence Science Board advised the Pentagon that: \"The benefits to an attacker using cyber exploits are potentially spectacular. Should the United States find itself in a full-scale conflict with a peer adversary, attacks would be expected to include denial of service, data corruption, supply-chain corruption, traitorous insiders, kinetic and related non-kinetic attacks at all altitudes from under water to space. US guns, missiles and bombs may not fire, or may be directed against our own troops. Resupply, including food, water, ammunition and fuel, may not arrive when or where needed. Military commanders may rapidly lose trust in the information and ability to control US systems and forces.\"\n\nOne problem with this is that the space architecture on which America depends for its nuclear command and control, including missile early warning, is also used for conventional warfare. That means a conventional attack might be mistaken for a pre-emptive nuclear strike, which could lead to rapid escalation. Another difficulty is that an aggressor may be tempted to go after cyber and space assets in the hope of causing major damage to a target's defences without actually killing anybody. That would raise doubts over whether nuclear retaliation could be justified. A third worry is that because of the potential speed and surprise of such attacks, some responses might be delegated to autonomous systems that can react in milliseconds. Lastly, there is the possibility of \"false flag\" cyber operation by a rogue state or non-state hacker group.\n\nDon't worry just yet\n\nFor now, the prospects of a successful disarming strike remain sufficiently remote to leave the strategic balance intact. Mr Miller argues that it would require a \"fundamental transformation in the military-technological balance...enabled by the development and integration of novel military capabilities\" to upset the balance.\n\nOminously, he thinks that such a fundamental transformation may now be on the horizon, in the shape of conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) and new missile-defence systems. Both China and Russia fear that new American long-range non-nuclear strike capabilities could be used to deliver a disarming attack on a substantial part of their strategic forces or decapitate their nuclear command and control. Although they would still launch their surviving nuclear missiles, improved missile-defence systems would mop up most of the remainder before their warheads could do any damage.\n\nStill, Michael Elleman, a missile expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, reckons that for now those concerns are overblown. As much as anything, he says, they are talked up to restrain investment in the enabling technologies: \"They [the Russians and the Chinese] are saying to the US, the trouble with you guys is that you never know when to stop.\"\n\nCPGS would involve a hypersonic missile at least five times faster than the speed of sound and a range of more than 1,000 miles. This could be achieved in several ways. One would be to stick a conventional warhead on an ICBM or a submarine-launched ballistic missile -- a cheap solution but a dangerous one, because defenders would not know whether they were under conventional or nuclear attack, so they might overreact.\n\nThe alternatives would be a cruise missile powered by a rocket-boosted scramjet (a supersonic combusting ramjet) engine, or a boost-glide vehicle that would be launched from a ballistic missile and then fly towards its target like a paper dart. Glide vehicles pull up after re-entering the atmosphere, using the curvature of the Earth to delay detection by ballistic-missile defences. Both types would be manoeuvrable, and would be accurate to within a few metres of their target. However, they, too, could carry nuclear warheads, again leaving the target uncertain what kind of attack it was under. America first tested a glide vehicle in 2010, but seems in no rush to deploy them. Russia and China have more recently tested hypersonic glide missiles.\n\nCurrent American missile-defence systems, such as Patriot, THAAD (terminal high-altitude area defence) and Aegis, provide quite effective regional defence but are not designed to cope with a salvo of ICBMs. The Ground-based Midcourse Defence system in Alaska and California is supposed to provide some defence of the homeland against a few missiles launched by a North Korea or an Iran, but it was never designed to defeat a massive salvo attack by a major adversary.\n\nHowever, substantial improvements are on their way. Mr Elleman describes the SM-3 IIA interceptors, which could be deployed as soon as next year on Aegis-class destroyers, as a \"big deal\". They are much faster than their predecessors, and Mr Miller thinks that if hundreds of them were put on ships close to America, they might support a late midcourse defence against Russian ICBMs.\n\nMore exotic missile defences are not far behind. Mr Elleman says that in about five years' time it may be possible to put solid-state lasers on large numbers of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) orbiting at very high altitude. Small missiles could also be put on UAVs as boost-phase interceptors, firing a minute or so after launch. Interception at that stage is technically much easier than later on because the target is much larger when all its stages are still intact, and moving more slowly.\n\nMr Elleman believes that for now the advantage is likely to remain with the attacker rather than the defender, but like Mr Miller he fears that emerging technologies could \"undermine crisis stability very rapidly\". Yet if arms-control agreements could be reached at the height of the cold war, it should surely be possible for America, Russia and China to talk to each other now to avoid persistent instability.",

                "title": "Self-driving cars will require new business models",
                "body": "IF YOU WANT to buy a fully self-driving car, you may have to wait for another decade. Autonomous vehicles will initially be offered for sale not to private owners but to robotaxi-fleet operators, for two reasons. First, LIDAR sensors are still so expensive that, deployed in production cars, they would cost more than the rest of the vehicle put together. For AVs in a robotaxi fleet, that is less of a problem, because vehicles will be operating, and thus generating revenue, throughout the day, whereas private cars are in use only about 5% of the time.\n\nSecond, getting AVs to work safely and reliably is much easier if their geographical range is limited to places that have been mapped in fine detail, such as city centres. So your first ride in an AV will be in a vehicle you hail using an app, not one you own.\n\nWaymo, Alphabet's AV effort, is testing a robotaxi service in Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, and hopes to launch a commercial service later this year. Uber is operating driverless taxis in parts of Phoenix and Pittsburgh; users who hail a ride may find themselves being picked up by an autonomous car, supervised by an engineer (Uber gives riders the option to use an ordinary car instead if they prefer). Voyage, an AV startup, runs a robotaxi service in The Villages, a retirement community in San Jose, and is expanding to a second location, in Florida. Navya, a French startup, is operating an eight-seater autonomous shuttle bus in downtown Las Vegas, with three stops along a 1km (0.6 mile) route. It also has shuttles running in several other cities around the world, as does Easymile, a rival French firm. Large-scale deployments of AVs are most likely to start with geofenced robotaxi services in parts of cities such as Singapore or Dubai, and then expand over several years, predicts Nikolaus Lang of BCG.\n\nIt is likely to be many years before AVs are cheap enough for individuals to buy them, and capable enough to operate outside predefined, geofenced areas. Meanwhile, the roll-out of cheap robotaxis in urban areas might encourage many young urbanites, who are already going off car ownership anyway, to abandon it altogether. The combination of ride-hailing and autonomous-driving technology confronts carmakers with \"the most profound challenge to their business models in a century\", declares a recent report from BCG. That is why carmakers are now piling into ride-hailing and car-sharing services and pushing on with their own AV programmes. In an autonomous future where ownership is optional, they need to be selling rides, not cars.\n\nThis shift offers carmakers a big opportunity. The car market is worth around $2trn a year globally, whereas the market for personal transport is worth as much as $10trn, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. But it also exposes them to new competitors, in the form of technology companies and ride-hailing networks. Some carmakers have launched their own mobility services; others may prefer to act as fleet managers, providing capacity for ride-hailing operators and charging them by the mile. Some will even make \"white label\" fleets badged with the name of a city or a ride-hailing network, rather than their own brand.\n\nRobotaxi fleets running around the clock will generate predictable yields that will appeal to institutional investors. Turning themselves into asset managers for such fleets would be a logical step for carmakers, whose finance arms are already involved in fleet management, says David Lesne of UBS.\n\nPricing models for users will change, too: Uber is already testing telecoms-like monthly price plans in some cities, which include a certain number of rides or miles for a fixed price, just as a mobile calling plan offers a certain amount of calls, texts and data.\n\nOne big question is the effect of AVs on the number of vehicles sold worldwide per year, currently around 80m. Since most cars sit unused 95% of the time, switching to shared robotaxis that operate around the clock could greatly reduce the number of vehicles on the road. UBS reckons the global fleet size will halve by 2030 (see chart). But if robotaxis are in use 50% rather than 5% of the time, they will need to be replaced far more often, says Johann Jungwirth, chief digital officer of Volkswagen. So unless vehicle lifespans can be greatly extended, the number of new vehicles needed each year will rise.\n\nMaking vehicles reliably in large quantities is hard, as Tesla's production problems have shown. \"The core expertise that we've had for decades is excellent manufacturing,\" says Ponz Pandikuthira, head of product planning for the European arm of Nissan. So even in a world of robotaxis, being a carmaker could still be a big business -- just a different one from what it is today. After 130 years making hardware, says Mr Jungwirth, \"we need to take software and services just as seriously.\" That requires taking on new staff, retraining, acquisitions and partnerships. AVs will also accelerate the switch to electric vehicles, which have fewer components and need fewer assembly workers.\n\nForm follows function\n\nIt will not just be carmakers that change shape; so will cars. Just as early \"horseless carriages\" resembled horse-drawn carriages, without the horse, most autonomous vehicles today are ordinary cars, retrofitted to drive themselves. But take away the need for a steering wheel and pedals, and AVs can assume a much wider range of shapes and sizes; Volkswagen's Sedric and the Mercedes-Benz F015 are pods in which passengers sit facing each other. Future AVs may need to allow for some physical separation of passengers to encourage people to share vehicles with strangers, says Karl Iagnemma of nuTonomy, while families might hail a different vehicle that lets everyone sit together.\n\nAll this is bad news for car dealers. Most are barely profitable now and make their money from car financing and servicing, so even a small shift from car ownership to shared robotaxis could hit them hard. Repair shops and partsmakers could also suffer, assuming AVs reduce the number of car accidents. Already, some parts suppliers are listing AVs as a threat to their future profitability in regulatory filings. Insurers would be hit hard by a fall in private car ownership and fewer accidents. Health-care providers and personal-injury lawyers would also suffer if there were fewer accidents, though few will feel sorry for them.\n\nPeople who drive taxis, delivery vehicles and trucks are most directly threatened by AVs. Uber and Lyft say they will continue to need human drivers on some routes for years to come, but driving jobs might be redefined rather than abolished. Delivery drivers could be employed to manhandle large packages into customers' homes. Truck drivers might become overseers of platoons of vehicles travelling on highways. And AVs will create new jobs for remote fleet supervisors and mobile repair workers.\n\nIt already seems clear that AVs will cause the car industry and its adjacent businesses to change shape dramatically over the next couple of decades. But the consequences will not stop there. Like cars before them, AVs are sure to have far-reaching cultural and social effects too, most obviously in cities.",

                "title": "Autonomous-vehicle technology is advancing ever faster",
                "body": "THE MODERN AUTOMOTIVE era began with a competition. In the early 1890s there was much interest in the emerging technology of horseless carriages, which promised to combine the speed of a train with the flexibility of a horse and the convenience of a bicycle. Le Petit Journal, a French newspaper with a knack for publicity stunts, decided to hold a contest to discover the best method of propulsion: steam, electricity or petrol engine. It invited entrants to drive from Paris to Rouen, a distance of 79 miles. Their vehicles would be judged not by their speed but whether they were safe, easy to use and economical to run.\n\nThe competition, held in July 1894, attracted crowds of onlookers as 21 contraptions set out from Paris. Only 17 vehicles stayed the course; along the way, seven dogs were run over and one cyclist was injured. The clear winner was not a direct participant but an inventor: Gottlieb Daimler, whose internal-combustion engine had powered nine of the vehicles, including the four that shared first prize. He had, the judges proclaimed, \"turned petroleum or gasoline fuel into a practical solution\" for self-propelled vehicles, which were starting to be referred to in French as \"automobiles\". Daimler's victory helped establish the supremacy of petrol-powered cars in the 20th century, and the term automobile soon spread into English and other languages.\n\nFittingly, the modern era of autonomous vehicles also began with a competition, held in March 2004 in the Mojave desert. It was organised by DARPA, America's main military-research agency, and required driverless vehicles to navigate a 150-mile off-road course. A total of 21 teams qualified, but after pre-contest trials and mishaps only 12 vehicles crossed the starting line. Amid mechanical failures and encounters with ditches, none of them made it to the finish. Carnegie Mellon's Sandstorm, the vehicle that did best, travelled 7.4 miles before getting stuck; as it tried to free itself, its front wheels caught fire.\n\nIt seemed that DARPA had set the bar too high. Yet when it held another competition in October 2005, five of the 23 participants completed the entire 132-mile course, and all but one beat the 7.4-mile record from the previous year. The winning vehicle was built by a team from Stanford University led by Sebastian Thrun; Sandstorm finished second. In just 18 months, autonomous driving had gone from hopeless to feasible. In a third DARPA contest, in November 2007, vehicles had to complete tasks in a simulated urban environment, coping with road signs, traffic signals and other vehicles. Six out of 11 teams completed this much more complex challenge.\n\nEncouraged by this rapid progress, Google set up a self-driving car project in 2009, led by Mr Thrun. Since then the participants in the various DARPA contests have gone on to work on autonomous-vehicle technology at Google, Uber, Tesla and a host of startups. Prototype self-driving cars first took to America's public roads in 2012; they have since travelled millions of miles and have become steadily more capable. But the technology is not ready for mass deployment just yet. A fully autonomous car must solve three separate tasks: perception (figuring out what is going on in the world), prediction (determining what will happen next) and driving policy (taking the appropriate action). The last of these is the simplest, making up just 10% of the problem, says Mr Thrun; perception and prediction are the hard parts.\n\nI see\n\nAutonomous cars perceive the world through a combination of sensors including cameras, radar and LIDAR -- a radar-like technique that uses invisible pulses of light to create a high-resolution 3D map of the surrounding area. The three complement each other. Cameras are cheap and can see road markings, but cannot measure distance; radar can measure distance and velocity, but cannot see in fine detail; LIDAR provides fine detail but is expensive and gets confused by snow. Most people working on autonomous vehicles believe a combination of sensors is needed to ensure safety and reliability. (Tesla is a notable exception: it hopes to achieve full autonomy without the use of LIDAR.) High-end LIDAR systems currently cost tens of thousands of dollars, but startups are devising new solid-state designs that should eventually reduce the price to a few hundred dollars.\n\nHaving combined the data from its sensors, the car needs to identify the items around it: other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, road markings, road signs and so forth. Humans are much better at this than machines, which have to be trained with lots of carefully labelled examples. One way to obtain them is to pay people to label images manually. Mighty AI, based in Seattle, has an online community of 300,000 people who carefully label images of street scenes for a range of automotive clients. \"We want cars to have human judgment,\" says Mighty AI's boss, Daryn Nakhuda, \"and for that we need human expertise.\" Imagery from video games such as \"Grand Theft Auto\", which features strikingly realistic street scenes, can also help. Because the game software knows what everything is, it can label such scenes with perfect accuracy, allowing them to be used for training.\n\nThe hardest things to identify, says Mr Thrun, are rarely seen items such as debris on the road or plastic bags blowing across a highway. In the early days of Google's AV project, he recalls, \"our perception module could not distinguish a plastic bag from a flying child.\" Puddles on the road also caused confusion. Combining data from multiple sensors, however, can reveal whether an item in the road is a solid obstacle or not. Cars can also compare their sensor readings with those gathered previously by other cars on the same road, learning from each other's experiences in a process called \"fleet learning\". That gives an edge to first movers with thousands or millions of miles of self-driving experience under their belts; but some startups also create and sell ready-made high-resolution maps for use by AVs.\n\nOnce a vehicle has identified everything around it, it needs to predict what will happen in the next few seconds and decide how to respond. Road signs, traffic lights, brake lights and turning signals provide some clues. But AVs are at a disadvantage to human drivers, who are used to dealing with exceptions to the normal flow of traffic, such as roadworks, broken-down vehicles, delivery trucks, emergency vehicles, fallen trees or bad weather. Snow is a particular challenge: LIDAR systems must be carefully tuned to ignore falling snow, and accumulations of snow on the roads make high-resolution street maps less accurate.\n\nWhile the technology is still being developed, it helps to stick to limited areas that have been mapped in detail and generally have good weather. That explains why Phoenix, with its sunshine and regular grid system, is a popular place to test AVs. Pittsburgh is considered more difficult because of its harsher weather. Cruise, an AV startup now owned by GM, has demonstrated some impressive autonomous driving in the complex streets of downtown San Francisco. Kyle Vogt, Cruise's boss, argues that testing in densely populated environments means cars experience unusual situations more often, and thus learn faster.\n\nWhen an AV gets confused and does not know how to respond, or makes the wrong decision, the safety engineer in the driving seat takes over. This is known as a \"disengagement\", and the number of disengagements per 1,000 miles travelled provides a crude measure of how the companies developing AVs compare (see chart). Disengagements are best seen not as failures but as learning experiences that help AV systems improve. Sensor data recorded in the lead-up to a disengagement can reveal what the car got wrong, says Noah Zych, head of safety at Uber's AV unit. Modifications to its software can then be tested in simulation. \"We can play it back again and again, vary the scenario and see the distribution of outcomes,\" says Mr Zych. The improved software is then rolled out in real cars.\n\nWhat do I do now?\n\nEven when AVs are widely deployed, they will probably still need to ask for human assistance sometimes. Consider an AV caught behind a broken-down truck on a two-lane road with a solid line down the middle, says Christophe Sapet of Navya, a maker of driverless shuttles. Because it has been programmed to obey road markings, the AV will get stuck. Human drivers would simply bend the rules and drive around the truck when the road is clear. Navya's AVs instead call a remote supervision centre, where a human operator can see live feeds from their cameras. Rather than controlling such a vehicle remotely, the operator gives it temporary permission to cross the white line when it is safe to do so. Mr Thrun suggests such operators could, in future, end up supervising thousands of AVs at a time.\n\nMeanwhile, limited forms of autonomy are being gradually added to existing production cars. A scale devised by the Society of Automotive Engineers defines the levels of autonomy. Level 1 involves basic assistance (such as cruise control). Level 2 adds features such as lane-keeping, allowing the car to drive itself on highways, but still requiring the driver to pay full attention. The new Audi A8, launched this year, is the first car to achieve level 3, which means it can drive itself and monitor its surroundings, but the driver must take back control when asked.\n\nWaymo, Uber and others are attempting to jump directly to level 4, which provides full autonomy under certain conditions, such as in a specific part of a city. Some in the industry consider the partial automation of levels 2 and 3 to be unsafe, because drivers are still required to pay attention even when they have handed over control of the vehicle, which they find hard to do. (The driver of a level 2 Tesla Model S was killed when his vehicle hit a lorry in May 2016; investigators found that despite warnings from the car, he failed to keep an eye on the road.)\n\nOne problem for AVs is that the world was built to cater for human drivers, with whom they must share the roads. Humans communicate by flashing their lights and using other non-verbal cues, which (like other driving customs) can vary from place to place. AVs will probably end up being tuned to fit in with their surroundings, driving more aggressively in Boston than in California, for example, suggests Amnon Shashua, the boss of Mobileye, a maker of autonomous-driving technology.\n\n\"You have to make the vehicle so it can operate in the world as it is today,\" says Chris Urmson of Aurora, an autonomous-driving startup. But things should get easier in future. There may be road lanes or entire districts dedicated to AVs, and special equipment to support them, known as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology. Already, in some areas where AVs operate, traffic lights have been modified to tell approaching vehicles when they will change. In future, V2I and V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) technology should allow AVs to co-ordinate their actions better.\n\nThe public seems concerned mainly about two potential risks associated with AVs. The first is how they should respond to ethical dilemmas: say, choosing between hitting a group of children in the road or swerving and hitting another vehicle. Many people working in the field think that such questions do not reflect the real world, and point out that the best course of action is usually to slam on the brakes. AVs have superhuman, 360-degree perception and much faster reaction times, notes Danny Shapiro of NVIDIA, a chipmaker whose products power AVs.\n\nThe second worry is about cyber-attacks. AVs, which are essentially computers on wheels, could be remotely hijacked or sabotaged. Engineers working on AVs insist that they take cyber-security very seriously, and say that the multiple redundant sensor and control systems they build in to make a vehicle mechanically safe will also provide some protection. If any part of the vehicle starts to behave strangely, for whatever reason, it will stop. \"It is easier to use an ordinary vehicle to kill people than to take control of a driverless car,\" says Mr Sapet.\n\nAVs are on the cusp of working on public roads, at least in orderly environments with good weather. \"Once you can crack that nut, it's incremental,\" says Mr Urmson. For his part, Mr Thrun has moved on to a new challenge: building cars that fly. Automotive bosses think he is crazy, he admits. But until quite recently they were just as sceptical about self-driving cars.",

                "title": "Global powers need to take the geopolitics out of energy",
                "body": "ON THE EVE of the first world war a young Winston Churchill switched the Royal Navy from coal to oil. As Daniel Yergin put it in his book \"The Prize\", the reliance on doubtful supplies of oil from Persia rather than Welsh coal turned energy security into a question of national strategy. Churchill responded that \"safety and certainty in oil lie in variety, and variety alone.\"\n\nThe same is true of energy today, but the variety of available sources now extends far beyond oil. Military planners are taking note. Since 2003, when America's current defence secretary, James Mattis, drew attention to the vulnerabilities in warfare caused by the \"tether of fuel\", America's armed forces have invested in a variety of clean-energy technologies: wind turbines, solar panels and mini-grids are common on military bases. So are experiments. A year-long naval exercise in 2016 involved a strike group powered by a mixture of conventional fuels, nuclear power and biofuels made from beef fat.\n\nAccess to abundant energy helps a country fight wars. It also supports peaceful projections of power. This special report has argued that those with the most readily available and reliable sources of energy, and the ability to produce and export new technologies, will be winners as the world reduces its dependence on oil. The losers will be those whose vested interests and lack of alternatives keep them wedded to fossil fuels. But the transition need not be a geopolitical battleground. Two factors could help: better collaboration and greater localisation.\n\nIn the energy field, collaboration has deep roots. According to Stephen Cheney, a retired Marine brigadier-general who heads the American Security Project, a think-tank, it emerged after the oil shocks of the 1970s as consuming countries sought a way of jointly ensuring energy security in the face of soaring prices. One result was the creation of the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) in 1974, with a broad mandate to work for energy security and co-operation on energy policy among its members, chiefly large energy consumers. In 2001, 28 of the IEA's members each agreed to establish strategic petroleum reserves, equal to 90 days' worth of net imports, as a buffer against supply shortages.\n\nAnother result was the global oil market, generating price signals that alert consumers to oil shortages and gluts. America and its allies have supported it since the 1970s by helping underwrite the secure flow of oil, keeping sea lanes open and supporting stable regimes (however odious) in the Middle East. This market has now been extended from oil to gas. Trade in liquefied natural gas is growing, and pricing has become more flexible.\n\nThe transition to clean energy is partly driven by the need for ever bigger efforts to tackle global warming. Among other things, that means clean energy needs to expand from electricity, which gets most of the attention now, to heating, transport and industrial processes. It involves building a spider's web of cross-border grids to help offset the variability of sun and wind power. As the transition gathers pace, it may even require support for petro-economies made vulnerable by the switch.\n\nCountries and regions that lack the right climate may need high-voltage transmission lines to feed them clean energy from thousands of miles away. New IEA-type organisations may be required to ensure that such supplies are not \"weaponised\". And if the worst happened and climate change proved catastrophic, the world would need to come together to deal with the consequences, such as mass migration and water wars.\n\nTechnology is another area of potential collaboration. The best guarantee of this would be free markets. Trade wars and other forms of protectionism stymie innovation. Putting quotas on critical minerals, as China did in 2010, would resemble the worst cartel-like tactics of the oil markets.\n\nInternational agreements on technology also help. On the sidelines of the Paris accord in 2015, 22 countries and the EU as a block pledged to double their research-and-development funding for clean energy. (Some very rich people, led by Bill Gates, also pledged to spend billions on breakthrough technologies.)\n\nThe need for more of this is compelling. In solar energy, for example, 60 years of silicon-cell technology has probably gone as far as it can. Perovskite solar cells, a more recent discovery, already come close to silicon's performance and may be more efficient. They can be made cheaply and, unlike rigid silicon cells, can be applied to flexible films of plastic. They are close to commercial launch, though durability is still a problem.\n\nDecentralised power\n\nLocalisation is a second way of depoliticising energy. The fossil fuels that powered the 20th century were produced by oligopolies, fed into centralised networks and sold on the premise of scarcity. Supplies were seen as finite. Renewable energy such as solar and wind is abundant but intermittent. Supergrids are one way of overcoming this. Minigrids involving locally produced wind and solar power, electric-vehicle batteries, small-scale hydropower and small modular nuclear reactors may be another. Some of the companies mentioned in this report are working towards such localised solutions, including Envision, a Chinese firm that hopes to create an \"operating system\" for small-scale producers and users of energy, to help keep supplies stable. It has also invested in Germany's Sonnen, which sells batteries that become virtual power plants when connected to other households.\n\nIf they succeed, local communities, districts and regions may get more say in the energy system, weakening the influence of national utilities, as has happened in Germany's Energiewende, albeit at wasteful expense. Some of the more energy-secure regions may compete with countries to influence global policies. Leaders from California, New York and other renewable-friendly states in America are trying to help shape global climate talks even as the Trump administration turns away.\n\nSuch \"energy democratisation\" could provide better access to electricity for the 2bn people likely to be added to the global population in the next few decades. It could help decentralise economies and counter the perception that the market works just for the rich and powerful. It could also open up a whole new realm of innovation, just as oil did with motor cars, suburbanisation, air travel, plastics and mass food production in the 20th century. The great game of green energy need not be winner takes all.",

                "body": "THE HIGHLIGHT OF a trip to the vast Shaybah oil field in Saudi Arabia's \"empty quarter\" is a stroll at dusk to the top of a range of silky sand dunes. There you can watch the sun set over the pride of the Saudi petroleum industry as a muezzin in the mosque below strikes up a call to prayer. Unfortunately, executives from Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, challenged your correspondent to a running race. By the time he reached the top, he was coughing so badly that he missed the sunset; and the banter drowned out the muezzin. \"If only we could turn this sand into silicon for solar panels,\" one joked. \"We'd be rich.\"\n\nLike many petrostates, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, is aware that demand for petroleum may one day fall victim to solar panels, electric vehicles, more frugal consumption and so on. But how seriously do the big oil producers take the threat? The answer comes in two parts. The first concerns their response to the recent onslaught of American shale production. The second is about their reaction to the prospect of \"peak oil\" (the beginning of the end of the world's addiction to oil) over the next few decades. For now, the former appears to carry far more weight than the latter, even though peak oil may eventually cause what some call \"the mother of all oil crises\".\n\nStart with the impact of shale. The galloping rise in American oil production up to 2014 caught many traditional oil producers off guard and contributed to a rapid increase in global oil stocks to unsustainably high levels. The subsequent oil-price crash clobbered oil-producing countries that had been spending lavishly on social programmes. They acted swiftly.\n\nA reeling Saudi Arabia unveiled a plan to sell off 5% of the world's biggest oil company, Saudi Aramco, to raise $2trn for the country's public-investment fund. This is part of the kingdom's so-called Vision 2030 strategy, designed by Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince, to reduce the country's dependence on oil and diversify the economy to provide new sorts of jobs for a young population. But in the absence of high oil prices it is unlikely to raise anything like the sums he wants.\n\nIn late 2016 OPEC and non-OPEC producers, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreed to curtail production by a combined 1.8m barrels a day (or about 2% of global output) to push up prices. So far the plan has not only worked, it has set the stage for an \"axis of love\" between Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, and Prince Mohammad. Despite their support for opposite sides in the Syrian civil war, and despite Russia's long-standing friendship with Iran, they now talk of developing long-term joint projects, especially involving Russian natural gas.\n\nWhether they are seriously preparing for the longer-term threat -- of falling oil demand as the world switches to electric vehicles -- is harder to answer. Publicly, leaders of Saudi Arabia and Russia dismiss the risk that demand will collapse. They predict that cars, trucks and planes will still consume growing amounts of fuel into the middle of this century, and that plastics and petrochemicals will still use a lot of oil. But some observers think that concern about peak oil is leading them to hedge their bets and may be one reason the Saudis are selling off part of Aramco.\n\nDrill, habibi, drill\n\nWhat should petrostates do about output if oil demand ebbs? In theory they should pump as hard as possible now so they can bank the money while they can. But that would set off a battle for market share among producers which would drive down oil prices further. Those with the lowest costs, such as Saudi Arabia, which can produce oil for as little as $6 a barrel, might feel that this is a fight they are bound to win.\n\nHowever, a paper published in January by Spencer Dale of BP and Bassam Fattouh of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies casts doubt on this idea. It argues that Middle Eastern oil producers should focus not on the cost of extraction but on the \"social cost\" of oil: their spending on social commitments such as health care, education and public-sector employment. The authors use the oil price needed to achieve balanced budgets as a rough proxy. This is close to $60 a barrel. Mssrs Dale and Fattouh argue that until such countries can shift their economies away from oil, they will need to cover these social costs. So instead of fighting each other for market share, they will seek to maintain long-term alliances, such as the current OPEC-plus arrangement. Yet in the past such pacts have always unravelled because of cheating on quotas. And investors in Aramco might balk at sacrificing short-term revenues for long-term strategic objectives. So perhaps the Aramco IPO will be the high-water mark of Saudi Arabia's co-operation efforts.\n\nIf the producers are not able to control the market, reform will become more urgent. But it will be tough. Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 depends almost exclusively on the will of the young crown prince, who has ripped up a long-established model of rule by consensus, with unpredictable consequences. His sense of urgency is not matched by experience, and progress is patchy. Saudi Aramco is taking longer to list than planned.\n\nOther Middle Eastern producers, such as the United Arab Emirates, are also hedging their bets, talking up clean energy but also reaffirming their commitment to using fossil fuels for half their energy needs until at least 2050. Like Saudi Arabia, they are blessed not just with oil but with sun and space, which offer ideal conditions both for large solar-photovoltaic parks, which harvest the sun during daylight hours, and concentrated solar plants, which store the heat generated by the sun in molten salt and release it as electricity at any hour of day or night. But at present Middle Eastern oil producers see renewable energy mainly as a way to use less oil and gas at home so they have more of it available for export. They do not consider clean energy to be an existential threat.\n\nAs for Russia, it appears to be even blinder to the prospect of the energy transition. It has given short shrift to renewables. Beyond oil and gas, most of its attention is on nuclear energy. And it is still betting heavily on oil. Partly thanks to global warming, last year it started drilling in the Laptev Sea, in the Arctic Circle, despite low prices and semi-frozen terrain that would put off most Western oil companies.\n\nThe wild card for petro-producers is what happens to demand for oil and gas in the developing world, particularly in China. Last year China overtook America to become the world's largest oil importer, and those imports are forecast to continue growing rapidly for at least a decade. At least for now, China's energy relationship with the Middle East and Russia is likely to become closer. State companies from all three regions are investing in each other's assets. Chinese funding has helped Russia finance drilling projects, despite Western sanctions. The same may happen with Iranian gas. Saudi Aramco has invested in a refinery in China's Fujian province. Russia has offered to sell Arctic gas to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe end of oil will not be linear. If oil prices slump, electric vehicles may look less attractive. Concerns about over-investment in oil may produce unexpected price spikes. But if the producers do not embrace economic reform, they could find themselves in deep trouble very quickly. They need only look at Venezuela to see how rapidly falling oil revenues can force an autocratic state to break its bargain with the people, leading to economic turmoil, social instability and regional tension.",

                "title": "CFIUS intervenes in Broadcom's attempt to buy Qualcomm",
                "body": "IT WAS only five months ago that President Donald Trump lauded Broadcom, a chipmaker, as \"one of the really great, great companies\" for announcing its plan to move its legal headquarters to America from Singapore. With such praise in the bank, the firm's chief executive, Hock Tan, may have expected his subsequent offer for a rival, Qualcomm, to enjoy an easy ride. Its course has been anything but smooth. The $142bn bid, which would be the largest-ever tech deal, was rebuffed by Qualcomm's management. Broadcom next turned to shareholders, asking them to elect its nominees to Qualcomm's board at a meeting scheduled for March 6th.\n\nThen, in a dramatic twist, the Committee on Foreign Investment into the United States (CFIUS), which oversees the national-security implications of foreign transactions, stepped in to delay the meeting while it conducts a review. It had been drawn in by Qualcomm, in what its furious suitor has branded a \"desperate\" attempt to prevent the vote. The panel's surprise intervention suggests a more activist approach to deals involving any kind of cutting-edge technology.\n\nCFIUS has considerable power. It is chaired by the treasury secretary, and its members include the secretaries of defence and of homeland security. It can block deals or insist on remedies to mitigate national-security risks; in rare cases it passes decisions on to the president. It has tended in the past to block only a small number of deals but many worry this could change under Mr Trump. In January the committee blocked the acquisition of Moneygram, an American money-transfer firm, by Ant Financial, an online-payments affiliate of Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant. At its recommendation, Mr Trump blocked the takeover of Lattice Semiconductor by a consortium of Chinese investors in 2017. (Concerns about Chinese acquisitions are not new: in 2016, Barack Obama blocked the takeover of the American unit of a German robotics firm, Aixtron, by a Chinese firm.)\n\nThe panel's scrutiny of a takeover of Qualcomm is unsurprising. The deal pushes a lot of buttons in America, notes James Lewis, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank. Qualcomm is a leading innovator in 5G, the next generation of wireless technology, which the government sees as a national-security priority to protect against Chinese cyber-espionage. CFIUS laid out in a letter its fears that the takeover could give Chinese competitors -- notably Huawei -- an edge, if Broadcom, with its \"private-equity style\" intentions, cuts back on research spending at Qualcomm to boost profits. (Broadcom has since pledged to make America the \"global leader in 5G\" and to maintain the resources Qualcomm devotes to R&D).\n\nCFIUS' latest intervention departs from recent form in two ways. The first is that Broadcom is not a Chinese firm, though CFIUS noted \"risks associated with Broadcom's relationships with third-party foreign entities\", which appears to hint at links to China. Another unusual feature is the timing of its review: the panel is getting involved before a deal has been agreed. But greater activism might not imply that all deals involving chips or Chinese acquirers are doomed, says Joseph Falcone, from Herbert Smith Freehills, a law firm. In January CFIUS cleared the takeover of Akrion, a chip manufacturing equipment company, by a Chinese firm. And Broadcom's purchase of Brocade, yet another semiconductor firm, got the go-ahead in 2017.\n\nThat said, more scrutiny from CFIUS can be expected. Legislation expanding its scope, which has bipartisan support, is making its way through Congress. That would bring into its purview not only big deals but joint ventures and even some licensing agreements. Mr Tan and many other executives may need to spend more time getting their paperwork in order.",

                "body": "RENAULT unveiled the EZ-GO, a concept for a robotaxi, at the Geneva motor show, which opened on March 5th. Nissan, in conjunction with DeNA, a Japanese software firm, recently began trials of driverless taxis in Japan. The two companies are pursuing their own paths towards the future of mobility. Yet both are bound together in a close alliance, which celebrates its 20th anniversary next year. In 2016 they were joined by Mitsubishi. Last year the trio sold 10.6m cars between them, one in every nine worldwide.\n\nIt is a unique carmaking liaison, neither a full merger nor as loose as the many tie-ups forged to spread the cost of developing pricey pieces of technology. Each firm remains autonomous but shares a growing number of links in the supply chain with the other two. It all looks hugely successful. In 2017 Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi overtook Volkswagen (VW) as the world's biggest car company (if lorries are included, the German firm is narrowly ahead).\n\nYet enthusiasm for the alliance among petrolheads and analysts is muted. Despite making some sporty models -- Renault even runs a Formula 1 team -- the group lacks a brand such as VW's Porsche to set car-buyers' pulses racing. Those who pore over its financial performance use words like \"decent\" and \"reasonable\". The mass market is competitive and margins are low. Investors cringe at a complex structure. Renault owns a controlling 43.4% of Nissan; Nissan has a non-voting 15% stake in Renault. Mitsubishi is controlled by Nissan through a 34% stake. Carlos Ghosn (pictured) is chairman of all three firms. Last year he stepped down as boss of Nissan but still runs Renault, plus the alliance itself, with its own board and executives.\n\nHence the calls for a simpler structure, which could cut costs and shore up profits. The current one gives Renault, itself 15% owned by the French state, the upper hand. Yet Nissan, rescued from near-bankruptcy by Mr Ghosn in 1999, now makes more cars and money. When rumours surfaced recently that France may sell its stake to Nissan as a prelude to a full merger, Renault's shares soared by 9%, revealing what investors think of the structure -- and the government's involvement. (The alliance has denied the reports.)\n\nFrench intentions are hard to fathom. Mr Ghosn and Emmanuel Macron, France's president, have a history. As finance minister in 2015, Mr Macron briefly increased France's stake in Renault to 20%, apparently to block Mr Ghosn from pushing through a change to company bylaws that would have inoculated it against a new law granting double voting rights to long-term shareholders. He also reportedly wanted a merger that would keep France as the main shareholder, the better to preserve French interests and jobs.\n\nMr Macron now insists he wants to get the French state out of business. But he still sees Renault as a symbol of French manufacturing might. He may be reluctant to allow closer integration along the lines Mr Ghosn, who opposes state involvement, has in mind. But the appointment in February of Thierry Bolloré, a Frenchman (and likely successor to Mr Ghosn), to a new role of chief operating officer of Renault may persuade Mr Macron that a merger would safeguard Renault's position at home.\n\nWhatever happens, the logic of the tie-up, which fills gaps in partners' businesses and cuts costs, is clear. Renault's strength in Europe complements Nissan's in China and America. Nissan brings a premium brand, Infiniti. Mitsubishi offers expertise in plug-in hybrids. By 2016 the alliance claimed annual savings of €5bn ($6.2bn), despite making just 2m cars on two common \"platforms\", the basic underpinnings of a vehicle. In September a new five-year plan promised deeper integration. By 2022, 9m vehicles will be built using four platforms. Savings are promised to double. In order to \"turbocharge\" performance and growth, at the start of the month Mr Ghosn announced more convergence of purchasing, engineering and manufacturing. On March 14th new managers were named.\n\nTying members together more tightly would advance Mr Ghosn's wish to make the alliance \"irreversible\". Yet that brings problems of its own. It has survived where full mergers have failed because the firms did not have to work too closely together. One former executive recounts how Renault and Nissan engineers could not agree on anything. \"There is tension in the system\" admits Trevor Mann, another former Nissan executive who is now Mitsubishi's chief operating officer, \"but positive tension.\"\n\nManaging internal friction may distract Mr Ghosn from keeping the alliance growing. So far it has, despite challenges facing the mass market. Scale is vital to be able to invest in electric and autonomous vehicles, Mr Ghosn believes. He aims to sell 14m cars a year by 2022. Max Warburton of Bernstein, an equity-research firm, likens the group to a \"hustler\" for its skills in sniffing out opportunities. With German carmakers dominating the most profitable bits of the European market, Renault pushed Dacia, its successful low-cost brand. Early investments in electric cars will ensure the alliance is the first to turn a profit from them, according to UBS. A big bet on emerging markets looks inspired.\n\nBut Mr Ghosn's acumen has a drawback: it has made him seem indispensable. Succession planning has been overlooked. Impatient contenders such as Carlos Tavares, now boss of PSA, have quit. It will be hard to re-engineer an unusual structure and replace an unusual boss while keeping the hustle going.",

On March 14th Ms Holmes was accused of fraud by America's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

At its height Theranos claimed a private-market valuation of around $9bn and raised more than $700m from investors -- until a critical article by the Wall Street Journal in 2015 prompted media and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIt now turns out that Ms Holmes's claims were deceptive, according to the SEC. She allegedly exaggerated her startup's capabilities. Theranos only reliably performed a dozen of the 200 tests it offered with its own technology. It also lied about its portfolio of clients. For example, investors were told that its technology had been used by the American military on the battlefield, when it had only been used in studies; and that it was poised to be rolled out by a grocery chain even when the deal had collapsed. The financial figures were apparently concocted, too. Ms Holmes told one investor that Theranos had $108m in revenue in 2014; the real figure was $100,000.\n\nThe Theranos saga is not over. Ms Holmes's business partner, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, whom the SEC has also charged with fraud, is contesting the charges. A criminal investigation into Theranos is believed to be ongoing.\n\nMs Holmes wooed investors while sharing few details about how exactly her technology worked. Today they are being more inquisitive and cautious, especially in health care. The SEC is eyeing Silicon Valley's firms more closely for foul play, too, for example by asking to see how venture-capital firms mark their investments and how startups value their private shares. The time when plucky wannabe tech titans could do no wrong is gone. Ms Holmes has certainly left a mark on Silicon Valley -- and not a mere pinprick.",

                "title": "Germany's two biggest utilities strike a deal",
                "body": "WHEN Johannes Teyssen took control of E.ON in 2010, it was Germany's second-biggest company after Siemens, an industrial giant. From its headquarters in chic Düsseldorf, the utility looked down on RWE, its longtime rival, based in Essen, a down-at-heel former coal-and-steel town 40 minutes' drive away.\n\nThe illusion of superiority did not last. The following year Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, reacted to the meltdown at Fukushima in Japan by starting a process to shut down Germany's nuclear-power plants, on which both companies relied. Other aspects of the Energiewende, or energy transition, added to their woes, as lavish support for renewables clobbered the country's wholesale electricity prices. The companies' profits slumped, as did their share prices (see chart).\n\nIn 2016 E.ON recorded its biggest-ever loss, moved its headquarters from Düsseldorf to Essen, and reinvented itself as a renewable-energy business and a household gas-and-electricity supplier. It spun off its fossil-fuel-burning power plants into a related company, Uniper. RWE flipped the process, floating its renewables and network businesses as Innogy, in which it kept a 77% stake, while keeping the dirtier power-producing assets in-house.\n\nThese corporate chimeras are soon for the chop, as RWE moves upstream and E.ON downstream. On March 12th the companies revealed elaborate plans to shuffle about €20bn ($25bn) of assets. E.ON will become Europe's largest operator of power grids by assets and of consumer-energy supply by customers (of which it will have 50m). RWE will be its third-largest producer of renewable energy, behind Iberdrola of Spain and Italy's Enel.\n\nSam Arie of UBS, a bank, says that will enable them to embrace two \"megatrends\" reshaping the global energy industry: the falling cost of wind and solar power; and the rise of electric vehicles (EVs). RWE will gain sufficient scale to become a big producer of renewables. E.ON will take the lead in power distribution in a rich country, Germany, that could come to love EVs.\n\nTheir infant progeny will cease to exist. In a mostly cashless deal, E.ON will acquire RWE's stake in Innogy and absorb it, cutting 5,000 jobs in the process. It has already announced the sale of its stake in Uniper to Fortum, a Finnish utility. RWE will acquire a restricted 16.7% stake in E.ON, as well as all E.ON's and Innogy's renewable assets. It will pay E.ON an additional €1.5bn.\n\nThe main criticism of the plan is that it should have happened two years ago. Uniper soared in value once spun off, but Innogy struggled. After a profit warning in December, it jettisoned its chief executive (and architect of the spin-off). Earlier this month it was rocked by an unexplained acid attack on Bernhard Günther, its chief financial officer. Yet without the initial spin-offs, it hard to see how the deal could have happened. Markets have reacted well, suggesting regulators and activist investors are not expected to put up a fight.\n\nE.ON's focus on pylons, poles and wires means that 80% of its operating earnings will come from regulated businesses, up from 65%. That will ensure stable earnings and chunkier dividends. The company expects €600m-800m a year of savings from the deal by 2022, offsetting the decline in its nuclear earnings. Mr Teysson describes it as E.ON's \"first real growth step for more than a decade\" -- in other words, the best news of his whole tenure.\n\nRWE, a carbon-dioxide belcher whose lignite power plants tarnish the credibility of the Energiewende, becomes greener and more focused. Analysts said it gains more immediately from the deal, though E.ON will make up for that later with its expected future savings. Already RWE's profits are recovering fast. Like E.ON, on March 13th it announced a bumper payout to shareholders. Consumers, who pay a high price for electricity in Germany, are unlikely to be squeezed any harder as a result of the transaction. For once this is a deal that looks good for everyone involved, including the planet.",

                "title": "Which firms profit most from America's health-care system",
                "body": "EVERY year America spends about $5,000 more per person on health care than other rich countries do. Yet its people are not any healthier. Where does all the money go? One explanation is waste, with patients wolfing down too many pills and administrators churning out red tape. There is also the cost of services that may be popular and legitimate but do nothing to improve medical outcomes. Manhattan's hospitals, with their swish reception desks and menus, can seem like hotels compared with London's bleached Victorian structures.\n\nThe most controversial source of excess spending, though, is rent-seeking by health-care firms. This is when companies extract outsize profits relative to the capital they deploy and risks they take. Schumpeter has estimated the scale of gouging across the health-care system. Although it does not explain the vast bulk of America's overspending, the sums are big by any other standard, with health-care firms making excess profits of $65bn a year. Surprisingly, the worst offenders are not pharmaceutical firms but an army of corporate health-care middlemen.\n\nIn crude terms, the health-care labyrinth comprises six layers, each involving the state, mutual organisations and private firms. People and employers pay insurance companies, which pay opaque aggregators known as pharmacy-benefit managers and preferred provider organisers. They in turn pay doctors, hospitals and pharmacies, which in turn pay wholesalers, who pay the manufacturers of equipment and drugs. Some conglomerates span several layers. For example on March 8th Cigna, an insurance firm, bid $67bn for Express Scripts, a benefit manager. A system of rebates means money flows in both directions so that the real price of products and services (net of rebates) is obscured.\n\nTo work out who is stiffing whom, Schumpeter has examined the top 200 American listed health-care firms. Excess profits are calculated as those earned above a 10% return on capital (excluding goodwill), a yardstick of the maximum that should be possible in any perfectly competitive industry. For drugmakers the figures treat research and development (R&D) as an asset that is depreciated over 15 years, roughly the period they have to exploit patents on discoveries. The data are from Bloomberg.\n\nTotal excess profits amount to only about 4% of America's health-care overspending. But this still makes health care the second biggest of the giant rent-seeking industries that have come to dominate parts of the economy. The excess profits of the health-care firms are equivalent to $200 per American per year, compared with $69 for the telecoms and cable TV industry and $25 captured by the airline oligopoly. Only the five big tech \"platform\" firms, with a figure of $250, are more brazen gougers.\n\nEveryone hates pharmaceutical firms, but their share of health-care rent-seeking is relatively trivial, especially once you include the many midsized and small firms that are investing heavily. Across the economy, average prices received by drug manufacturers have risen by about 5% per year, net of the rebates. But their costs have risen, too. As a result, even for the 15 biggest global drugs firms, returns on capital have halved since the glory days of the late 1990s, and are now barely above the cost of capital. As employer schemes get stingier, employees are being forced to pay more of their drug costs; they are price-conscious.\n\nMeanwhile the effectiveness of R&D seems to have fallen. Richard Evans of SSR, a research firm, tracks the number of high-quality patents (defined as those cited in other patent applications) that drug firms generate per dollar of R&D. This metric has dropped sharply over the past decade. Shareholders may groan, but for the economy overall the system seems to be working. Big pharma is still splurging on R&D but not making out like a bandit.\n\nAs the drug industry has come back down to earth, the returns of the 46 middlemen on the list have soared. Fifteen years ago they accounted for a fifth of industry profits; now their share is 41%. Health-insurance companies generate abnormally high returns, but so do the wholesalers, the benefit managers and the pharmacies. In total middlemen capture $126 of excess profits a year per American, or about two-thirds of the whole industry's excess profits. Express Scripts earns billions while having less than $1bn of physical plants and no disclosed investment in R&D. This year the combined profits of three wholesalers that few outsiders have heard of are expected to exceed those of Starbucks.\n\nThe dark view is that pockets of rent-seeking have become endemic in America's economy. Wherever products are too complex for customers to understand, and where subsidies and complex regulation add to the muddle, huge profits can opaquely be made. Remember mortgage-backed securities?\n\nIn the case of health care, consolidation has probably made things worse by muting competition. There are now five big insurance companies, three big wholesalers, three large pharmacy chains and three big benefit managers. The current vogue is for \"vertical mergers\" in which firms expand into different layers. As well as Cigna and Express Scripts, Aetna, another insurer, and CVS, a pharmacy and benefits manager, are merging. All these firms insist competition will be boosted. But they are also projecting the deals will boost their combined profits by $1.4bn.\n\nAmazon and the health-care jungle\n\nYet perhaps capitalism is not broken and new contenders will eventually be tempted in. Amazon has acquired wholesale pharmacy licences in multiple states. It is also teaming up with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to create a new health system for their staff. These initiatives are at an early stage, but investors are sufficiently worried that they value the intermediaries on abnormally low multiples of profits, suggesting earnings may fall. People often get upset when conventional industries are hit by digital competition. Few would lament it in the case of health-care middlemen.",

                "body": "PROUDLY overlooking the River Thames, Unilever House looks more royal palace than office building. Built on the site of a Tudor estate, for nine decades it has been the London home to Unilever, one of the world's largest consumer-goods firms. Since a merger of British soapmakers and Dutch margarine merchants in 1929, Unilever has been a dual-nationality company. It is legally domiciled in Britain and the Netherlands, with headquarters in both the London building and in Rotterdam.\n\nThe appeal of dual citizenship has faded. After a year-long review, on March 15th Unilever's board announced plans to move its legal base to Rotterdam. (The firm will continue to have a listing in London, and claims no British jobs will be lost.) Many in the City of London finger Britain's decision to leave the European Union for the move. But Graeme Pitkethly, the firm's chief financial officer, insisted Brexit was \"absolutely not a factor\" in the decision. Over the past decade Unilever has been shifting its production facilities nearer to its customers in other parts of the world. Even Britain's possible exit from the EU's customs union would not affect its operations as much as it once would.\n\nInstead the company claims that the new structure will make it \"simpler, more agile and more focused\". Under its current structure, the shares of Unilever NV cannot be exchanged for those in Unilever PLC, its British sibling. This makes it much harder to buy or spin off its businesses. Unilever's chief executive, Paul Polman, wants to boost profits by selling low-margin foods divisions and moving into more profitable areas such as personal-care products. That makes a single entity alluring.\n\nThere may be another reason. Unilever makes money by selling well-known brands in over 190 countries. But consumers are switching to local alternatives, especially in China. Activist investors are circling. In 2017 Kraft Heinz, an American food giant, made a hostile bid for Unilever worth $143bn. The company had to fight it off. Mr Polman has argued in the past that British takeover rules favour the predators, and that the Netherlands offers a more level playing field. Although this week he denied that was a factor, the liberal takeover rules which used to attract firms to Britain may be scaring some away.",

                "title": "AT&T's merger with Time Warner goes on trial",
                "body": "AN ANTITRUST trial over AT&T's $109bn acquisition of Time Warner, which begins on March 19th, will have more keen observers than one courtroom can handle. Disney, Comcast, 21st Century Fox, Verizon, Charter Communications, CBS and Viacom will be watching. So will Netflix, Amazon and Google.\n\nThe reason is simple. If AT&T wins the case against the Justice Department, and the \"vertical merger\" of the distribution and content businesses goes through, a wave of consolidation deals will follow. Companies that rely on large numbers of people to watch video will want to bulk up to compete with each other and Silicon Valley's mightiest.\n\nComcast may make a hostile bid for Fox's assets, setting off a bidding war with Disney, which has already agreed a $66bn deal with Fox. (Comcast already wants to buy Sky, a European satellite provider that is part of the Disney-Fox transaction.) Other pay-TV and mobile firms, like Charter and Verizon, will feel emboldened to go after content companies such as CBS or Lionsgate. All are watching the case with \"bated breath\", says Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, a research firm.\n\nHistorically, antitrust actions have targeted horizontal mergers between firms operating in the same area. But in November the Justice Department sued to block the Time Warner purchase on the ground that it would give AT&T, which has 25m pay-TV customers and national reach with DirecTV, too much leverage over competitors. AT&T could extract higher fees from other cable operators for Time Warner's popular Turner channels, or simply offer them exclusively on its own cable services in order to poach customers from rivals. The government adds that AT&T could employ this anti-competitive tactic in cahoots with Comcast, a competing operator which already owns valuable programming via NBCUniversal.\n\nAT&T retorts that it makes a lot of money selling content; withholding it from other operators would be commercially self-defeating. Calculations by independent analysts, such as Ben Thompson of Stratechery, a tech newsletter, suggest that AT&T would have to lure more than 15% of its competitors' customers for such a strategy to be profitable. The government's own witness on the issue reckons that 12% would switch. In its pre-trial brief the company claims that its pay-TV business is in structural decline, losing millions of high-paying customers to the likes of Netflix.\n\nVertical integration, AT&T will try to persuade the court, would enable it to target advertising more effectively, levelling the playing field against the tech titans. In reality, most analysts think the merger only makes sense if the Justice Department's worries are founded. AT&T now has the awkward task of talking this sound business case down.",

                "title": "Online starlets are refashioning Chinese e-commerce",
                "body": "LIANG TAO shifted 80 pink Givenchy bags in 12 minutes. Becky Fang offloaded 100 turquoise Mini Cooper cars in just five. Both are wanghong, literally \"red-hot on the web\". Every day millions of Chinese trawl social media for wanghong posts or tune in to live-streams for opinions on everything from a French fashionista's essentials to rampant sexism in China. The fans are helping this new breed of Chinese internet star to monetise their popularity -- and to shake up the country's e-commerce industry in the process.\n\nUnlike conventional luxury-and-beauty brand ambassadors, many wanghong have built their fan bases through compelling online content rather than a famous name. Some of the most successful are not especially glamorous. \"Pudgy Luo\" is a middle-aged man who discusses everything from Chinese emperors to 3D printing on his talk-show. MC Tianyou raps about the hardships faced by other young, working-class men. Papi Jiang, a comedian, pokes fun at stardom and Chinese society in salty tirades.\n\nA few have been recruited by luxury brands. After the Communist Party's anti-corruption campaign crimped sales of Jaeger-LeCoultre's snazzy timepieces among its traditional older clientele, the Swiss watchmaker hired Ms Jiang for a video ad targeting young urbanites, including her 27m fans on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog. Zhang Yi of iiMedia Research, a consultancy, reckons that up to 15% of sales on shopping sites like Taobao or social-media apps such as WeChat are influenced by wanghong endorsements. The length of a dress might be decided by a survey of a wanghong's fans; its launch date might be based on the number of hits, shares or comments it garners, some of which can prompt last-minute design tweaks.\n\nThis poses a new challenge for retailers, whose supply chains must respond ever more quickly to wanghong verdicts. Whereas previously a company would look for a celebrity to match its image, wanghong and their admirers are shaping merchandise.\n\nAnother challenge comes directly from wanghong themselves. They increasingly make money not merely from online endorsements or advice but by launching their own e-commerce stores. Sales of goods accounted for just under half of wanghong earnings of 53bn yuan ($8bn) in 2016, estimates Analysys, a Chinese market-research firm (the rest came mostly from live-show tips and adverts).\n\nSome wanghong are going a step further. In November Ms Fang launched her own clothing line. Part of her motivation, she says, was that the brands she endorsed did not always match the trends she was sharing with her followers. By creating her own marque, Becky's Fantasy, she retains full control of the quality. She also gains a new revenue stream. For the time being only 3-5% of wanghong follow Ms Fang's entrepreneurial example, iiMedia Research reckons. But it expects the model to become an industry in its own right, straddling entertainment and e-commerce, and driven by online data.\n\nAgents of change\n\nAn industry is indeed springing up to assist the internet starlets. Dedicated wanghong incubators, of which China now has around 50, seek out promising candidates, help them hone online business models and act as supply-chain managers, as well as agents. They help with hiring designers, sourcing fabrics and finding factories. In 2016 Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce group and owner of the Taobao emporium, invested 300m yuan in Ruhnn, an incubator which was valued at 3.1bn yuan at the time and has since inked contracts with a few dozen influencers.\n\nThe wanghong economy looks poised to grow. In 2016 it was already 15% bigger than the Chinese film industry's gross box-office sales, Analysys reckons. This year it could surpass 100bn yuan.\n\nIts success illustrates how intertwined online retail and social media are becoming in China. Alibaba has stakes in video-streaming sites such as Nonolive and Youku Tudou. A year ago Weibo launched a venture to support e-commerce wanghong and their incubators with consumer analytics and customer surveys; it owns a live-streaming platform, as does Taobao. Alibaba hopes such integration will keep shoppers on its marketplace for longer (an average one opens the Taobao app almost eight times a day). Other apps like Xiao Hong Shu (\"Little Red Book\"), a Pinterest-like e-commerce site, blur the distinction altogether.\n\nLike all branding, however, the influencer business is a delicate one. Many consumers seemed put off when Christian Dior, a French fashion house, hired Zhao Liying, an actress who had previously endorsed mass consumer brands like Dove. Given the influence of wanghong, some of the more risqué can run into trouble with the authorities. The profane Ms Jiang has been reprimanded by censors. MC Tianyou was recently barred from his platforms for promoting drug use. Many starlets expect to quit after a couple of years, straining incubators' business model. In the first half of 2017 Ruhnn was 15m yuan in the red. Some brands have started to look for lesser-known influencers, who command smaller fees and retain a more authentic image among devotees. It is hard to stay red-hot for long.",

                "title": "Protectionism may impede Delta's expansion plans",
                "body": "AS AMERICA'S oldest airline still aloft, Delta makes much of its southern roots. At its biggest hub, Atlanta airport, the company museum recounts how it became the world's second-biggest carrier. The answer: by buying up domestic rivals. With few takeover targets left at home, Delta's chief executive, Ed Bastian, is looking abroad. But his plans for more foreign joint ventures (JVs) face regulatory headwinds.\n\nLast year Mr Bastian announced a flurry of JVs. In May Delta launched one with Aeromexico and in June another with Korean Air. In July Delta formed one of the world's biggest JVs with Virgin Atlantic of Britain and Air France-KLM, a European group. In December it sealed one with WestJet, Canada's biggest low-cost carrier. It wants closer relations with China Eastern and GOL of Brazil, two airlines in which it owns shares. And on March 12th it emerged that Delta and Air France-KLM plan to bid for Air India, an ailing flag carrier. If all these deals come off, one passenger in eight worldwide will fly on carriers linked to Delta by JVs or equity stakes.\n\nAmerica's domestic market is \"relatively mature\", says Mr Bastian. Flying visitors in and out of the country is where the growth opportunities lie. Airline JVs, which are granted exemptions from antitrust law, allow Delta to sidestep national ownership rules that block cross-border mergers. Foreigners cannot own over 25% of airlines in America or over 49% in the EU, for example. In JVs carriers combine operations and share revenues and profits but preserve national ownership. They produce 90% of the cost savings of a full merger, says Alan Lewis of LEK Consulting. Shallower forms of co-operation -- such as the oneworld alliance, Skyteam or Star Alliance -- produce as little as 25% of the benefits because they fall under antitrust rules.\n\nOther airlines are thus also keen on JVs. Three of these, including Delta's, now control nearly 80% of the market for transatlantic flights, according to OAG, a data firm. And the tie-ups, which tend to be anonymous, are expanding. Between 2006 and 2016 the share of long-haul passenger traffic controlled by JVs grew from 5% to 25%. It is set to rise to 35% by 2021.\n\nIn the past, regulators waved through such deals. Although JVs reduce competition by letting rival carriers act as a single entity, it was thought that some cost savings would be passed on to passengers so long as new airlines could compete with incumbents. That is why JVs are generally allowed only in places with open-skies agreements, where such competition is possible, explains Dave Emerson of Bain & Company, a consultancy.\n\nIATA, a trade group for legacy carriers, claims that JVs do indeed lower fares. Recent studies suggest they do not -- at least where room for new entrants is limited. Several have found that fares in markets dominated by JVs have risen significantly relative to routes with none. The JV between American Airlines and British Airways (BA) in 2010 resulted in higher transatlantic economy fares at BA, whose home hub, Heathrow, is Europe's most congested airport. Barriers to entry are rising; 19 European airports will be as full as Heathrow by 2035, reckons ACI Europe, a trade group.\n\nRegulatory hostility is growing. In 2016 America rejected a JV between American and Qantas, arguing it would raise fares. Watchdogs are also being tougher on Delta. Its JV with Aeromexico was approved only after it added a sunset clause and gave up airport slots at Mexico City and New York. In January the EU forced KLM, Delta's oldest JV partner, to surrender slots on its flagship Amsterdam-New York route.\n\nExpansion plans like Mr Bastian's may also run up against rising protectionism. After Britain leaves the EU, it will have to negotiate a new open-skies agreement with America. On March 6th the Financial Times revealed that the Trump administration wants stricter terms for Britain. Under America's proposed ownership rules, if a planned purchase by Air France of 31% of Virgin goes ahead, it may no longer be British enough to qualify for the open-skies agreement and thus for its JV with Delta.\n\nAlthough JVs are falling out of favour with authorities, airlines are still keen on consolidation. With scale, \"I don't think we're ever going to lose money again\", American's boss recently proclaimed. The carrier has duly resubmitted its JV with Qantas to regulators. At the Atlanta museum, displays of crew uniforms and other items from the 40 defunct carriers Delta has swallowed hold a lesson for airlines. In one curator's words, it's \"get big or die.\"",

                "title": "America's companies have binged on debt; a reckoning looms",
                "body": "AMERICA's companies have been powering ahead for years. Amid growing profits, the recession that began in 2007 seems an increasingly distant memory. Yet the situation has a dark side: companies have binged on debt. For now, as the good times have coincided with a period of record-low interest rates, markets have been untroubled. But a shock could put corporate America into trouble.\n\nNo matter how it is measured, the debt load looks worrying. When calculated as a percentage of GDP, the total debt of America's non-financial corporations reached 73.3% in the second quarter of 2017 (the latest available data). This is a record high. Measured against earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), the net debt of non-financial companies in the S&P500 hit a ratio of 1.5 at of the end of 2016, a level not seen since 2003. And it remained nearly as high in 2017 (see chart).\n\nTo be sure, things are less worrying than they were before the financial crisis. According to a recent analysis by S&P Global Ratings, a ratings agency, for example, debt is now more evenly distributed. Only 27% of American firms in 2017 were highly levered (defined as a debt-to-earnings ratio higher than five), down from 42% of firms in 2007, meaning that fewer firms are immediately at risk.\n\nThe use of the extra debt was also somewhat different. Bob Michele of J.P. Morgan reckons that in recent years much of it was used by companies to finance share buy-backs, essentially for purposes of balance-sheet management (rather than, say, big expansions or acquisitions).\n\nEven so, certain industries look particularly vulnerable under their debt loads. David Tesher of S&P Global Ratings says that retail is the sector in America most at risk. Such companies accumulated high levels of debt after more than a decade of private-equity-sponsored activity. They must also cope with tough competition from e-commerce. Around 50 American retailers filed for bankruptcy in 2017 alone, many due to the debt piled on by their private-equity owners. The most prominent example is Toys R Us, which was acquired by a consortium of private-equity firms in 2005. In the case of Payless ShoeSource, a retailer that also went bankrupt last year, creditors argued in court filings that its private-equity owners should share the blame for its collapse; after much argument, the owners agreed to put more than $20m back into the company.\n\nEnergy and utilities are two other industries at risk from their levels of indebtedness. The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of the energy industry rose to three times by 2016, largely because of the shale-oil boom. But firms then issued a substantial amount of new equity. As earnings recovered with the rise in oil prices, their debt ratio improved to two times by last year. Utilities, meanwhile, which have always borrowed heavily, saw their debt rise to a 14-year high of 4.5 times earnings in 2017.\n\nAmerica's new tax reforms add extra complications. Despite being welcomed by most businesses, the impact on firms' willingness and ability to take on debt is uneven. For many, the lowering of the headline corporate-tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as provisions such as the ability to expense capital spending up front, will boost profits and thus reduce the need to take on new debt (unless bosses go on a buying spree). But the new law also caps the (previously unlimited) tax deductibility of interest payments at 30% of EBITDA until 2021, falling to a more restrictive 30% of earnings before interest and taxes (but after depreciation and amortisation) from 2022. This provision will hit the most indebted firms hard, notably those owned by private equity, as well as industries such as utilities.\n\nHow quickly debt levels turn into a problem depends on monetary policy and how the economy fares. In a benign scenario, in which corporate earnings rise across the board, and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates at a slow and predictable pace, companies' debt ratios may even fall, for now. But if more worrying scenarios -- say, a trade war, or significantly faster-than-expected monetary tightening -- come to pass, more indebted companies may find their luck running out. A binge, after all, never lasts forever.",

                "title": "A Chinese oil baron is reportedly detained by the authorities",
                "body": "STAFF had routinely been directed to pore over their chairman's speeches and learn from them. One which Ye Jianming, the 40-year-old founder of CEFC, delivered last autumn -- \"Only One Step From Midsummer to Harsh Winter\" -- was a historical tale meant to motivate the troops. In it he compared his firm's swift rise to that of Hu Xueyan, a 19th-century merchant banker. Hu amassed a fortune trading in salt, tea, arms and silk through close ties to China's imperial elites, then fell from grace and went bankrupt.\n\nMr Ye did not mean the lesson to be pertinent to his own situation. CEFC was then enjoying its own midsummer. As China's largest private oil group, it had just won a 14.2% stake in Russia's state-backed oil firm, Rosneft, paying $9.1bn for one of the most significant shares of the world's largest listed oil firm by production. Industry analysts outside China had been scrambling to study CEFC since early 2017 when it joined national oil heavyweights such as Total and BP in winning a stake, of 4% for 40 years, in the largest oil concession of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut harsh winter appears to have set in. On March 1st Caixin, a business magazine, reported that Mr Ye had been placed under investigation (CEFC denied the \"irresponsible\" report). The news came less than a week after the Chinese government announced it had taken over Anbang, a high-flying and highly indebted insurer, for a period of one year, and that it would prosecute its boss, who has not been seen since his own detention last June, for economic crimes. The South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's main English-language newspaper, then reported that a Shanghai government agency, Guosheng Group, had taken over CEFC's management and daily operations. CEFC this week denied the takeover by Guosheng Group, saying it had not received any relevant notice.\n\nThe gravest scenario would be outright nationalisation of CEFC through a takeover by one of China's state-owned oil champions. Mr Ye's fate would fit a pattern of recent crackdowns on over-ambitious tycoons and the freewheeling financing of their firms. Anbang raised cash by selling high-risk insurance products to fund brash overseas dealmaking. Wanda and HNA, two other overstretched companies, are selling assets to repay their debts after censure from regulators. Yet in the case of CEFC, the precise reasons for Mr Ye's alleged troubles are still a mystery.\n\nAcquisitions at the firm are on hold, say employees close to its dealmakers. Its financing, much of which came from state-owned lenders, has been cut as banks press it to repay loans. They say that asset disposals, including the sale of its stake in oil fields in Abu Dhabi, are under discussion. Analysts reckon that an apparent hold-up on the Rosneft deal, expected to close early this year, could now be explained by the news of the investigation.\n\nFrom his hometown of Fujian, a southern province rich in tea plantations and talented entrepreneurs, Mr Ye founded a trading firm at the age of 25, buying refineries and storage tanks in China. His oil colossus is thought to be among the ten largest private firms in the country, with 50,000 employees and assets of 183bn yuan ($29bn), ranging from investments in Kazakhstan's refineries to stakes in an airline and a football club in the Czech Republic.\n\nMr Ye's reported detention is all the more puzzling given CEFC's close ties to government projects and the state banks that fund them. A bond prospectus from June shows that close to two-thirds of its financing, or 32bn yuan, was from China Development Bank. Observers note that CEFC has aligned itself with schemes such as the Belt and Road Initiative of Xi Jinping, China's president (a vast network of infrastructure projects in central Asia, eastern Europe and the Middle East). Mr Ye proclaimed that if the Rosneft deal were finalised, \"70% of the credit\" should go to the state for its national strategy.\n\nLeslie Zhang, vice-president of the United Energy Group, an oil firm in Hong Kong, says CEFC's deals are unusual among Chinese peers for \"investing in countries over projects\". Observers say it has often hired former diplomats, creating ties with overseas governments that allow it to do business with explicit state blessing -- or the semblance of it.\n\nCEFC is among many private firms that have been trying to \"use the logic of the party to do deals\", says Andrew Polk of Trivium China, a research firm in Beijing. Its chief may yet extract himself, as did the boss of Fosun, a mining-to-tourism conglomerate, who disappeared for a short while in 2015 to assist authorities in an investigation. But Mr Ye and his peers are on slippery ground.",

                "body": "QUARTER-LITRE bottles of whisky whizz down a conveyor belt past Mukhtar Ali, a quality-control employee at Pakistan's Murree Brewery, the only legal beer-and-spirit maker in this Islamic country. Nearby labourers pack Vat No.1, a cask-aged spirit, into boxes. An elderly man with a long beard tapes them up. Asked over the roar of imported German machinery if they have ever taken a sip of the amber liquid, each shakes his head. \"It's haram,\" (meaning forbidden), says Mr Ali.\n\nThe 155-year-old institution causes some spluttering nonetheless. Founded for British troops of the Raj, it can sell only to the 3% of the 207m-strong population that is comprised of foreigners and non-Muslims. But many of its products end up in Muslim hands, as illustrated by the predilections of the former prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who ordered a nationwide ban on alcohol in 1977. \"He was the biggest consumer of Murree in history!\" says the company's boss, Isphanyar Bhandara. Some employees do sneak drinks on the job, he adds.\n\nShareholders can toast a vintage few years for the firm, whose market capitalisation of $160m makes it one of the largest food and beverage firms listed on Pakistan's stockmarket. In 2016, it doubled its alcohol-production capacity. Profits have risen by almost 100% since 2012, reaching a foamy $19.6m last year.\n\nOne reason is an influx of thirsty Chinese citizens, who clamour for alcohol as they deepen their country's footprint in Pakistan. An increasingly relaxed officialdom also helps. Government employees work inside Murree's fortress-like walls and hold the keys to locks on every vat of whisky. Yet in recent years provincial administrations have granted more permits to individuals and upmarket hotels to indulge. Elite Pakistanis, able to afford prices of around $3 for a can of lager, are a reliable source of demand.\n\nIt also helps that in 2009 the main sharia court ruled that the official punishment for drinking -- 80 lashes -- was itself un-Islamic; the verdict had never been imposed. Yet Murree's product remains a touchy subject. In 2016 the Sindh High Court temporarily banned all sales of alcohol in the southern province, a significant blow to profits as it accounts for 60% of Murree's liquor sales. The case still hangs over the company.\n\nTo guard against such headaches in future, Murree is expanding its range of soft drinks, including Murree Sparkletts, a mineral water. Freer liquor markets abroad also appeal. Attempts to brew Murree in neighbouring India (Pakistan's law forbids exporting it outright) have foundered, the result of sour diplomatic relations. Yet the firm soon hopes to offer British citizens the chance, once again, to \"have a Murree with your curry\". A worldwide distribution deal is being negotiated through a Czech brewery that produces its beer. \"The Brits started it here, so why not?\" says a tweed-jacketed executive, Sabih Ur Rehman, puffing on a Silk Cut cigarette.",

                "title": "Nigeria hopes high tariffs will make it grow more rice",
                "body": "STANDING ankle-deep in water between neatly spaced rice plants, an instructor shows a group of about 100 farmers in Kebbi, a state in north-west Nigeria, how to apply herbicide. The training session, arranged by TGI Group, a Nigerian conglomerate that runs a large rice mill nearby, has an enthusiastic audience. Hussein Ahmed, a farmer, says the yield from his small field has increased by about 50% since he started using chemicals and carefully spacing the seedlings. Another farmer boasts of marrying a second wife thanks to the extra money he is earning from growing rice.\n\nAcross the region the grain is cooked with tomatoes and mounds of chili to make jollof, a dish that is almost always eye-wateringly spicy, no matter how mild the cook insists it is. Jollof is not just the cause of many arguments in the region -- Ghanians and Nigerians each insist theirs tastes better. Its main ingredients have also become symbols of how Nigeria is trying to diversify an economy that exports crude oil and imports almost everything else.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari, who was inaugurated as president in May 2015 in the midst of an economic shock caused by low oil prices, turned to autarky. His central bank stopped providing foreign exchange to importers bringing in 41 categories of goods, including rice, toothpicks and incense. The government increased customs duties on rice from 10% to 60% in October 2016 to encourage farmers to plant more.\n\nSuch tariffs have certainly spurred investment in farms and in milling plants such as the one run by TGI in Kebbi. The mill can already produce 120,000 tonnes of rice a year, yet the company is planning to add another 100,000-tonne production line and open two more mills in other states in the next five years. Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man, says he will invest in six new factories that will produce 1m tonnes of rice a year.\n\nTo feed these mills, Nigeria will have to increase its rice yield, which is among the lowest in the world. Farmers in Thailand harvest three crops a year, compared with one or sometimes two in Nigeria. Outgrower schemes, in which firms such as TGI provide training, fertiliser and other chemicals on credit that is repaid after harvest, can help. But extending them to all 1.4m rice farmers in the country would be a huge task.\n\nThe central bank has done its bit by doling out some 55bn naira ($153m) in loans to 250,000 farmers (most of whom grow rice). Architecture graduates and civil servants have cashed in on the boom and taken up farming. Central-bank officials are happy to talk about how much money it has lent, but they do not mention how much money is being paid back. Nigeria's anti-corruption body recently said that it had recovered 300m naira stolen from the farm-loan scheme in two states.\n\nThe bigger problem, however, is that local rice is still not competitive with Asian imports. Farouk Gumel of TGI says that in January he was selling 50kg bags at his factory gate for 14,000 naira each (traders then add on the cost of the long journey to cities in the south). Smuggled rice, on the other hand, was being sold in urban markets for 12,500 naira a bag. Thanks to increased production and perhaps smuggling, rice prices are lower now than they were a year ago, though they are still 68% higher than they were two years ago.\n\nThe government says its policies are working and that Nigeria will no longer need to import rice by the end of the year. But its numbers do not add up. It says that rice production has doubled since 2015 (and will increase by 50% again this year), but there are scant data to support such ambitious claims. Nigerians eat 5.3m-7m tonnes of rice a year. Imports account for 2m-3m tonnes, a figure that has barely budged in recent years (see chart). Nigeria's information minister, Lai Mohammed, points to statistics from Thailand showing that its exports to Nigeria have slumped by 97% in two years. But Thailand's exports to Benin, have doubled to 1.8m tons a year, the equivalent of 160kg per Beninese. The country's tariff of 12%, and its poorly policed border with Nigeria are probably the main reason for its booming demand.\n\nNigeria's import restrictions benefit farmers and millers and seem to be encouraging more planting. But until yields improve and the costs of producing Nigerian rice fall, the country's consumers will have more reason to thank smugglers for keeping their plates filled with jollof.",

                "body": "FOR over a year, fishermen, miners and jobless graduates in northern Morocco have demanded more help from the government. To be fair, the government is acutely aware of the need to create more jobs. Even as the protests rage, workers are putting the finishing touches on Marchica, the first of seven eco-resorts planned for the northern coast under the king's ten-year plan to increase tourism. \"We can't just build hospitals and schools,\" says Sami Bouhmidi, one of Marchica's managers. \"We need to lay the foundations for investment and regeneration.\"\n\nMorocco's development has been impressive. A growing manufacturing sector, investment by European and Chinese firms, and stronger links with sub-Saharan Africa have boosted the economy. Since 2000 GDP per person has increased by 70% in real terms. Tax breaks have drawn a splurge of foreign investors, including 110 aerospace firms and 150 automotive companies, to the north. Progress can be seen in new roads that cut through the mountains and a high-speed train that is set to hurtle down the coast by year's end. Tourists are already flocking to the country in record numbers.\n\nPoverty has dropped over the past decade. Still, many people feel left behind. Tolls on the new roads mean that most Moroccans remain on clogged and dangerous carriageways. The high-speed train may please tourists, but it will be a luxury for the average family. As many as two-thirds of Moroccans entering the labour market fail to find work.\n\nThe situation has grown dire in parts of the country. In much of the north, the youth unemployment rate is 40%, over twice the national average. A charity distributing food in Sidi Boulaalam, 200 miles south of Casablanca, was swamped with applicants last November, leading to a stampede that killed 15 people. Tens of thousands of Moroccans cross the Strait of Gibraltar each year on unreliable dinghies, hoping to find work in Europe. Relatives back home rely on their remittances.\n\nProtests, sometimes violent, have pricked the conscience of King Muhammad VI. He warns of \"a political earthquake\" and scolds his government for failing to \"reduce disparities between segments of the population, correct inter-regional imbalances or achieve social justice\". He gripes that only a sliver of his five-year development plan for the north has been implemented. Several ministers have been sacked.\n\nBut the king spends much of his time convalescing abroad. (Last month he was travelling again, for heart surgery.) He surfaces to cut ribbons on new projects. In his absence, though, only some come to fruition. The ruling elite, known as the makhzen (\"storehouse\"), controls much of the economy and puts its projects first.\n\nSome in the Rif, a northern mountain region with a rebellious history, dream of a new uprising. King Muhammad's father, Hassan II, violently suppressed a Riffian revolt in the 1950s, then neglected the local Berbers, whom he called savages. His son prefers to exercise soft power. He has championed development in the north, where he often holidays, and made the Berber tongue, Tamazight, an official language. Only three people have been killed in the year-long protests.\n\nIn February King Muhammad sent the mild-mannered prime minister, Saad Eddine El Othmani, on a conciliatory tour of Jerada. The desolate city in the north has been rocked by protests since December, when two brothers died collecting coal in an abandoned mine. State-run mines were once a mainstay of the city's economy, but the government shut them down in the 1990s. The security forces kept things calm during Mr Othmani's visit, but protesters returned to the streets as soon as he left. Hundreds have been arrested. Over 50 are on trial for undermining the state. \"The people want an economic alternative,\" they chanted. A few eco-resorts are probably not enough.",

                "title": "Increasing debt in many African countries is a cause for worry",
                "body": "\"A FOOL'S bargain.\" That is how Idriss Déby, Chad's president, now describes the state oil company's decision to borrow $1.4bn from Glencore, an Anglo-Swiss commodities trader, in 2014. The loan was to be repaid with future sales of crude, then trading above $100 a barrel. But two years later, as the price dived, debt payments were swallowing 85% of Chad's dwindling oil revenue. For weeks schools have been closed and hospitals paralysed, as workers strike against austerity. On February 21st, after fractious talks, Chad and Glencore agreed to restructure the deal.\n\nChad's woes recall an earlier era, when African economies groaned beneath unpayable debts. By the mid-1990s much of the continent was frozen out of the global financial system. The solution, reached in 2005, was for rich countries to forgive the debts that so-called \"heavily indebted poor countries\", 30 of which were in Africa, owed to the World Bank, IMF and African Development Bank. With new loans and better policies, many of these countries turned their economies around. By 2012 the median debt level in sub-Saharan Africa (as defined by the IMF) fell to just 30% of GDP.\n\nToday the median debt level is over 50% of GDP. That is low by international standards, but interest rates are generally higher for African countries, which collect relatively little tax. Economic growth slowed in response to lower commodity prices. As a consequence, there is much less revenue to service debts. The pace of borrowing has picked up. The IMF reckons that five sub-Saharan African countries are already in \"debt distress\", with nine more at high risk of joining them.\n\nLending to Africa surged after the financial crisis, when interest rates in rich countries sank to historic lows. Fund managers chased the high yields of African government bonds and the profits from a commodities boom. The biggest lenders to Africa had long been Western governments. But since 2006, 16 African countries have sold their first dollar-denominated bonds to foreign investors. Interest rates in the rich world remain low, so several countries are scrambling back to the market this year. Senegal's $2.2bn Eurobond was five times oversubscribed on March 6th.\n\nBorrowing makes sense for poor countries if it finances things like roads, schools and hospitals, which improve welfare and support economic growth. But the keenest borrowers in Africa are also feckless spenders. Take Ghana, which racked up debt as it ran an average annual budget deficit of 10% from 2012 to 2016. When a new government entered office last year, it found a $1.6bn \"hole\" in the budget. The new chairman of the state cocoa board found that a $1.8bn loan meant to fund cocoa production in 2017 was \"all gone\".\n\nGhana got a three-year loan of $918m from the IMF in 2015, ensuring a degree of transparency. Commercial loans are easier to hide. In Mozambique, three state-owned companies borrowed $2bn in deals arranged by European banks. Most of this was done in secret. The proceeds were squandered on overpriced security gear and a bogus fleet of trawlers. An audit could not trace $500m. The once-buoyant economy sank and Mozambique defaulted on its debt last year.\n\nLeveraged corruption\n\nA study of 39 African countries from 1970 to 2010 found that for every dollar borrowed, up to 63 cents left the continent within five years. The money is often siphoned out as private assets, suggests Léonce Ndikumana, one of the researchers, based at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Some banks seem more interested in juicy fees than good governance.\n\nChina's involvement in Africa has made it harder to assess the situation. Countries such as Zambia and Congo-Brazzaville have taken out opaque loans from Chinese companies. Angola has borrowed more than $19bn from China since 2004, mostly secured against oil. Such loans often have built-in clauses to review repayments as prices fluctuate, says Deborah Brautigam of the China-Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University. But there is little precedent for restructuring Chinese loans. Nor is China a full member of the Paris Club, which co-ordinates the actions of creditors when things go wrong.\n\nThough much of the money borrowed by states comes from foreign investors, some is provided by local banks. They find it easier to buy government bills than to assess the reliability of businesses or homebuyers. Moody's, a ratings agency, estimates that African banks' exposure to sovereign debt is often 150% of their equity. So a sovereign-debt crisis could fast turn into a banking one.\n\nDisaster can still be averted in most African countries. Abebe Shimeles of the African Development Bank warns against sudden spending cuts, which would leave half-finished infrastructure projects to rust. Research from the IMF suggests that the least costly way to deal with fiscal imbalances in Africa is to raise meagre tax-to-GDP ratios, which have crept up by just a couple of percentage points this century.\n\nOther proposals aim to make lenders share more risk with borrowers by, for example, linking interest payments to growth or commodity prices. Some suggest changing laws in America and Britain, where most debt is issued, so that countries are not liable for loans agreed to by leaders acting without due authority. Organisations such as the IMF could be more robust, speaking out early when countries seem to be in a downward debt spiral.\n\nAs it is, the costs of bad borrowing rarely fall on leaders or their lenders, which often makes politicians borrow (and steal) more. \"It's the common man that actually bears the brunt,\" says Bernard Anaba of the Integrated Social Development Centre, a Ghanaian advocacy group. The people of Chad, now paying for Mr Déby's foolish bargain, would surely agree.",

                "title": "How a small African nation is beating AIDS",
                "body": "AS A middle-class Senegalese man, Salou (not his real name) was rather proud of his roundness in 2002. But by 2003 his clothes were falling off. He got tested and found he had AIDS. His pregnant wife was also infected with HIV. They went to Dakar, Senegal's capital, and she was put on antiretroviral drugs to prevent the infection of her unborn child. \"When my son was born he tested negative, thank God,\" exclaimed Salou.\n\nThe hopeful tale of Salou's baby is far from universal. Although west and central Africa have long had a lower prevalence of HIV than the south and east (see map), the region still has a stubbornly high rate of new infections. In south and east Africa close on 20m people have the virus, almost four times more than in west and central Africa. From this high base, the number of new infections each year in the south and east has fallen by 29% since 2010, to 790,000. Alas, new infections in west and central Africa have fallen just 9%, to 370,000. Moreover, about 310,000 people die from HIV-related illnesses each year in west and central Africa, compared with 420,000 a year in east and southern Africa. This high toll is prompting urgent calls from global bodies such as UNAIDS and UNICEF for a new approach.\n\nAn example of that may be found in Senegal, which has cut new infections by almost three-quarters since 2010, leaving it with one of the least-afflicted populations in Africa. Whereas 4.3% of people in sub-Saharan Africa are HIV-positive, the prevalence in Senegal is just 0.4%.\n\nSenegal may be poor but its HIV prevention and treatment system punches above its weight. It was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to start a government-backed programme to treat people with antiretrovirals in 1998, not just prolonging the lives of those with HIV but reducing the chances that they would pass it on. In a bold move in 2003 it made the treatment free, several years before the World Health Organisation recommended that countries do so.\n\nIt has also pushed back social taboos by ensuring that drug users and sex workers are treated. Prostitution is legal in Senegal, so long as sex workers have health check-ups every three months. If they get HIV, they are not driven underground, where they might continue to spread the disease. Instead they are allowed to work while being given free treatment, which makes them less infectious. As a result, HIV prevalence among sex workers dropped from 28% in 2002 to 7% in 2016, according to UNAIDS. Drug users are given free syringes, so they are less tempted to use dirty ones.\n\nSenegal's decentralised health-care system helps, says Ibrahima Traoré of the Social Polytechnic Institute of Hygiene in Dakar. The number of sites offering voluntary counselling and testing increased by 600% in the four years to 2010.\n\nOne thing that Senegal has done remarkably well is to involve a wide range of groups in tackling the virus. Marabouts (imams) talk about HIV in mosques. Women's groups try to find unregulated sex workers and Senegal's famous wrestling groups teach men about the risks of unsafe sex. This use of civil society is something that is sorely lacking elsewhere in the region, says Nathalie Cartier of Médecins Sans Frontières.\n\nTo be sure, there is work to be done. About half of people infected with HIV are still not being treated. Only about a quarter of children with the virus are getting medication for it. And gay men are afraid to ask for advice because homosexuality is punishable by up to five years in jail. Nonetheless, Senegal has shown that even a poor country can curb the epidemic.",

                "body": "BARINGO county, in Kenya's Rift Valley, is a hard place. Water is short in the dusty bush, so businesses tend not to thrive. But one industry is booming. At the edge of Mogotio, a town of roadside shops, hundreds of donkeys graze along the road. They are waiting to be sold for slaughter at the local abattoir. Next to a lorry, a woman in a shimmering dress says she has brought 100 donkeys from Moyale, two days' drive north. She expects to make several thousand dollars from the sale.\n\nAcross Africa, donkeys are used as beasts of labour. Most Kenyans turn up their noses at the idea of eating them. But Chinese entrepreneurs have opened a new market. In China donkey skins are used to make a gelatine, called ejiao, that is used as traditional medicine. The meat is also a delicacy. The abattoir in Baringo has been running for almost two years, slaughtering hundreds of donkeys a day to satisfy Chinese demand.\n\nThe slaughterhouse employs some 400 people. Isaac Kibengo says that he came from Kitale, 200km (125 miles) away, to work packaging skins. He gets health insurance, a housing allowance and about 20,000 shillings ($200) per month, a good salary in Kenya. \"They even pay on time,\" he says.\n\nBut the trade has also caused an outcry. The Donkey Sanctuary, a British charity, worries that the donkey population is falling in some African countries, that the animals are mistreated and that the trade is fuelling a rise in donkey theft. The Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad, another British charity, thinks it knows better than donkey owners what is good for them. \"For a subsistence farmer in a country like Ethiopia...being offered the equivalent of £150 ($208), cash in hand, could seem like an offer too good to turn down,\" it said. \"But the long-term consequences of selling their means of generating an income are unthinkable.\" Several African countries have banned the export of donkeys because of such concerns.\n\nThey might do better helping farmers increase supply to take advantage of a doubling in the price. To be fair, this is hard, since donkeys reproduce slowly. Yet it can be done. Some ejiao firms plan to replace imports with Chinese donkeys. Banning a trade that raises money for the poor makes asses of those who claim to speak for them.",

The campaigner for LGBT rights has been assaulted by Islamic extremists outside his house in Tunis and beaten by a mob as a policeman watched. Since helping to launch Shams Rad, an online radio station catering to LGBT people, he has received thousands of online threats and insults.\n\nThe station, which began broadcasting out of Tunisia in December, is the first of its kind in the Arab world. It is on six days a week and reaches 10,000 people in 15 countries, according to Shams, the Tunisian group behind the effort. The Dutch embassy provides funding. The aim is to create a space to talk about LGBT issues that is not \"dominated by imams\", says Mounir Baatour of Shams.\n\nThe challenge is staying within the law. Anal sex is punishable by up to three years in jail in Tunisia. A court once suspended Shams' operating licence on dubious grounds. Hosts are careful with their language, so as not to be seen as promoting homosexual activity. Nobody comes out on air. Common topics include the science behind homosexuality and the treatment of gay people.\n\n\"We're in 2018 and the Arab street is still homophobic!\" said a host recently. \"They still use the word 'pervert'.\" Another decried the Arab world's rejection of \"all international resolutions and declarations\" dealing with homosexuality. Songs by Mashrou' Leila, a Lebanese rock band with an openly gay singer, are interspersed throughout the shows.\n\nSince the Arab spring, as gay people have become more visible, homophobic attacks have increased in Tunisia, say human-rights groups. The police often look the other way, or arrest the victims. Men can be detained for \"looking gay\" or being effeminate, says Badr Baabou of Damj, a pressure group. No witnesses are required for a suspect to be found guilty. Often the only incriminating evidence comes from a rectal examination, which many other countries have outlawed.\n\nIn other ways Tunisia is at the forefront of LGBT rights in the Arab world. It is the only country in north Africa to have legalised groups that focus on LGBT issues. And the government has pledged to end forced rectal examinations. Still, the hosts of Shams Rad have plenty to talk about.",

But they have a problem: what to put in the empty trucks going back? The answer -- pasta.\n\nSome informed sources reckon that, apart from people, by weight pasta is probably the most smuggled product to cross the desert. Drug trafficking and gunrunning may earn fatter margins. But many smugglers diversify their load by pushing penne.\n\nIn part the trade is fuelled by subsidies in places such as Algeria, which spends about $28bn a year keeping down the price of food and energy. In Libya, which still subsidises food prices, even if somewhat erratically because of the civil war, 500g of pasta can be bought for 15-25 American cents. The same bag of pasta might cost 250 CFA francs ($0.50) in Timbuktu and about 800 CFA francs ($1.50) in Senegal or some of the posher parts of Bamako, the capital of Mali.\n\nAnother incentive to smuggle is found in west Africa. Under the region's customs union, imports of pasta face a tariff of 20% and also value-added tax of 15%.\n\nSmugglers rarely answer surveys, so the facts around them are slippery. But a study in 2015 by the Economic Research Forum, a think-tank based in Egypt, found that pasta was the main product going across the Sahara from Algeria to Mali, accounting for about a third of the trade. The researchers reckoned that smugglers earned profits of 20-30%.\n\nTheir impact is not just being felt in markets south of the Sahara, but also on the desert itself.

                "body": "TO ALGERIANS, Abdelaziz Bouteflika is like Schrodinger's cat: simultaneously alive and dead until his actual state has been observed. Occasionally Mr Bouteflika, the 81-year-old president of Algeria, who has suffered at least one bad stroke, is rolled out in his wheelchair for an appearance. In October, for example, he met Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister. A short video of the encounter showed Mr Bouteflika staring blankly into the distance and mumbling a few words. Behind the scenes, a clique of military officers and economic officials actually runs the country.\n\nMr Bouteflika is indicative of the decrepit state of the region's politics. Of the 18 Arab countries and territories, nearly a third are ruled by old men in terminal decline. They are a stark contrast to the region's young population. Whereas the median age in the Arab world is 25, among Arab heads of state it is 72. Even when lucid, the old fogeys appear out of touch with their more progressive and increasingly frustrated young subjects. And their prolonged rule leaves deep uncertainty about who will one day replace them.\n\nTake Mahmoud Abbas, who is in better shape than many Arab leaders, even at the age of 82. The Palestinian president is well enough for the occasional trip to Brussels or the United Nations. But his health is also in decline. Three years ago, to dispel rumours of a stroke, he trudged out to a gourmet supermarket in the middle of a snowstorm (with a camera crew in tow).\n\nWhile his constituents are angry about rampant corruption and the never-ending occupation, Mr Abbas spends most of his time in Amman, insulated from such concerns. And he has no clear replacement. Many fear his death will touch off a period of instability in the Palestinian territories.\n\nOman may be in for an even rougher transition. Its leader, Sultan Qaboos, 77, at least appears before his subjects a few times each year. He has suffered from cancer for several years. A bachelor since the 1970s, he has no heirs. The name of his chosen successor is written on a sealed envelope in his palace.\n\nWith a sprawling royal family, contenders abound. But rather than elevate potential rivals, the ailing sultan also serves as the prime minister, defence minister, finance minister and foreign minister. In his spare time, he runs the central bank. No one knows how much attention he actually devotes to this sprawling portfolio.\n\nOther Gulf leaders are faring no better. Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait, is 88 and stumbles over his speeches. Khalifa bin Zayed, the nominal ruler of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has been in seclusion since he suffered a stroke in 2014. King Salman of Saudi Arabia also appears to be fading. He keeps his speeches short and his public schedule limited. In February he presided over a humanitarian-aid summit in Riyadh organised by a charity that bears his name. But he did not say a word.\n\nOld leaders are nothing new in the Arab world, where monarchies and dictatorships are the norm. In some countries, at least, doddering rulers have limited powers or they have transferred power to younger go-getters. Kuwait has an elected parliament and relatively liberal constitution. Real power in Saudi Arabia and the UAE rests with their crown princes, both relatively young and popular.\n\nBut seven years after a series of revolutions led by young people, elderly kings and presidents seem more common than ever. Even the Arab world's lone true democracy has elected a nonagenarian. Beji Caid Essebsi, Tunisia's president, is the oldest Arab leader, having turned 91 last year. \"They have good genes,\" jokes a journalist in Lebanon, where the president is older than the country. Or perhaps just good doctors. Mr Abbas quietly checked into a Baltimore hospital for tests in February; Sultan Qaboos had his cancer treated in Germany. Those options, needless to say, are not available to many of their citizens.",

                "body": "WHEN Ian Khama steps down at the end of the month, after ten years as president, he will leave his country looking perky. Mr Khama has been lavished with praise as he makes a series of farewell sorties around the country. At a recent gathering of farmers, he was \"gifted with 35 cattle, a bull, two sheep and goats, a horse, and shares worth 25,000 pula [$2,628] at Tlou Energy\", a coal-development company, according to the pro-government Daily News.\n\nThe statistics paint a pretty picture, too. In its annual report card on African governments, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation regularly ranks Botswana near the top. At independence in 1966 it was one of the world's poorest places, with \"only 7km of tarred road and a capital, Gaborone, that amounted to little more than a railway station,\" wrote a historian. Now it boasts a GDP per head among the highest in Africa. This is largely because Botswana is the world's second-biggest producer of diamonds, yet has only 2m people. Mineral wealth has ruined other countries. But Botswana has benefited from prudent economic policies, multiparty politics and fair elections.\n\nMr Khama, 65, a former general and the son of the country's founding president, Sir Seretse Khama, has much to be proud of. He has been down-to-earth, businesslike and courageous, decrying Robert Mugabe, the former president of his much beefier neighbour, Zimbabwe, when most leaders in Africa winked at his horrors. He refused to kowtow to China, inviting the Dalai Lama to visit (though in the end he did not). More to the point, Mr Khama balanced the books, even as diamond prices went up and down. Above all, he says he will obey the constitution, which limits him to two five-year terms.\n\nYet all is not well in Botswana. Mr Khama has become authoritarian and aloof, relying for advice on too narrow a circle of friends. His governments have failed to wean the economy off diamonds, which may run out within 30 or 40 years (nobody knows for sure) and are anyway becoming costlier to dig out. His fondness for the armed forces has led him to buy an unnecessary arsenal of fighter jets, tanks and armoured vehicles. He has overseen an excessively rigid visa regime, stemming the inflow of talent. Corruption has spread on his watch and the bullying Directorate of Intelligence and Security Services (DISS), run by his confidant, Isaac Kgosi, has become far too big for its boots.\n\nMr Khama's vice-president, Mokgweetsi Masisi, 54, a cerebral figure who once worked for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's agency, is a near lock to be endorsed by parliament as the new president. \"He must step in fast to stop the rot and put the DISS back in its box,\" says a prominent businessman in Gaborone. An assistant minister from the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which has run the show without a break since independence, fears there will be trouble if corruption persists. The opposition and the country's independent newspapers are calling for Mr Kgosi to be sacked as an early signal of good intent.\n\nMr Masisi has a year and a half until the next election. Last time round, in 2014, opposition parties won more votes than the BDP for the first time, but lost because they were divided. If the two main groups can unite, most likely under Duma Boko, an articulate Harvard-educated human-rights lawyer, they would have the best chance yet of displacing the BDP. \"People are tired of 50 years of BDP rule,\" says Mr Boko.\n\nIf the BDP loses, it is assumed that it would graciously bow out. That is one democratic legacy for which Botswanans could then thank the Khama family.",

                "title": "Saudi Arabia's use of soft power in Iraq is making Iran nervous",
                "body": "IT ALMOST feels like old times. Before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, Gulf Arabs partied on the banks of the Shatt al-Arab river in southern Iraq. Many owned villas in the fields around Basra and took Iraqi wives. Now, after a break of three decades, they are back. Saudi Arabia is putting the finishing touches on a consulate in Basra's Sheraton hotel, where Iraqi crooners sing love songs and waiters dance. Last month a dozen Saudi poets travelled to Basra for a literary festival.\n\nAir links between Saudi Arabia and Iraq have also resumed, with 140 flights each month. Several state-owned businesses, including SABIC, the Saudi petrochemical giant, are registering offices in Baghdad. At a conference in Kuwait last month, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, pledged $1bn in loans and $500m in export credit to support Iraq's reconstruction after the war with Islamic State (IS).\n\nSaudi interest was initially pricked by America, which has been marshalling Gulf support to help stem Iran's push west. It was a hard sell. Iraq, under Saddam, threatened to invade Saudi Arabia. More recently, it has allowed Shia militias backed by Iran to set up camp on the Saudi border. In response the kingdom, which considers itself the region's Sunni champion, is accused of bankrolling Sunni jihadists in Iraq.\n\nBut Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, is shaking the kingdom from its sectarian logic. In 2015 he was central to restoring diplomatic relations and last year reopened the kingdom's borders with Iraq. He has shifted money from Sunni politicians to more effective Shia ones. He has even hosted Muqtada al-Sadr, a Shia cleric, and Qasim al-Araji, Iraq's interior minister who is close to Iran. Diplomats note the disparity in help offered by Saudi Arabia and Iran, which pledged nothing at the conference in Kuwait. \"Having failed to outfight Iran, the Saudis now want to outspend it,\" says a delighted Iraqi official.\n\nIn a country where Shia Arabs make up the majority of the population, Iran has sought influence by stoking sectarianism and gaining the allegiance of Shias. Saudi Arabia wants to win them back by reviving the country's Arab identity, and setting Iraqis against Persian Iran. Arab nationalism was largely smothered when Iraq's former ruling Baath party was banned in 2003.\n\nMuch of the focus is on Basra, which is Iraq's richest province. Projects earmarked by the Saudis for investment include Basra's moribund petrochemical plant, which could help wean Iraq off Iranian products. Saudis have also eyed the scrub along the border, which the kingdom wants to turn into fertile fields by tapping underground aquifers. Iraqi officials hope it will finance railroads and reopen the pipeline that, until 1990, shuttled Iraq's oil to the Red Sea.\n\nSouthern Iraq has drifted so far into Iran's orbit that highways are named after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of Iran's Islamic revolution; Iranian-backed Shia parties rule the roost. But some in Tehran are nervous, recalling how Saudi Arabia goaded Iraq's Arabs, even Shias, to wage an eight-year war on Khomeini's Iran beginning in 1980. Iranian businessmen worry about fresh competition for Iraq's market, their second largest for non-oil products after China.\n\nSo to tie Iraq even closer, Iran has opened a free-trade zone next to the Shalamcheh crossing near Basra. It has unilaterally lifted visa requirements for Iraqis to ease their shopping sprees in Khuzestan, on the border. The collapse of Iran's currency has sucked in custom. Iraq imports over 100 times more from Iran than it exports, in terms of value.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian-backed factions in Iraq are trying to sully the rapprochement with Saudi Arabia. Their politicians cite the 3,000 or so Saudis who joined IS. \"How can we welcome our killers?\" asks a militiaman in Basra. Clerics in Najaf have dithered on the kingdom's request to open a consulate in the Shias' holiest city.\n\nBut overall the Saudi charm offensive has proven popular. For all their sectarian bonds with Iranian Shias, the people of Basra fought on the front lines of Iraq's brutal war with Iran. Many view Iranian engagement as colonisation. And even militias are swayed by the prospect of more commerce. Saudi investors, they hope, will need protection and help dealing with the country's tortuous bureaucracy.\n\nHaider al-Abadi, Iraq's prime minister, seems happy to juggle the regional rivalry. His security forces reportedly confiscated posters, printed by a pro-Iranian group, that denounced the Saudi consulate in Basra. But the kingdom may need more reassuring. To date it has done little more than window-shop for potential investments. It will probably wait until after the Iraqi elections in May before signing any deals.\n\nOther Gulf states dismiss Iraq as a corrupt black hole. The young Prince Muhammad, too, might lack the strategic patience to see through his initiative. But if the Saudis were hoping for a quick win, their first football match in Iraq for nearly 40 years offers a salutary reminder. The Saudi players paraded across the pitch in Basra holding Iraqi scarves aloft. In the end, though, they got a thrashing, losing 4-1.",

                "body": "\"LOUIS VUITTON\" handbags for the price of a sandwich. \"Rolex\" watches that cost as little as a T-shirt. You would not expect to find such obvious fakery at a suburban shopping mall in Canada. But deals of this sort are available at the Pacific Mall in Markham, near Toronto, according to the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). Its latest report on \"notorious markets\", published in January, lists the three-floor mall alongside the Silk Market in Beijing, Tank Road in Delhi and El Tepito, an open-air market in Mexico City, as places where people can buy counterfeit goods. It is the first time a Canadian bricks-and-mortar outlet has appeared in the report, which has been published since 2011. \"Requests for assistance from local law enforcement have reportedly gone unanswered,\" the report complains.\n\nThe United States has long alleged that its northern neighbour is soft on piracy, allowing vendors to sell goods and cultural products that infringe trademarks and copyrights of American and other firms. Canada appears regularly on the USTR's annual list of countries that are doing too little to protect intellectual property. The USTR estimates that global trade in counterfeit goods is worth $500bn a year, about 2.5% of total imports. Until now, it has directed most of its complaints about physical retail outlets at developing countries where the rule of law is weak.\n\nBy fingering the Pacific Mall, which calls itself \"the largest Chinese shopping mall in North America\", it is turning up the heat on Canada. It is probably no coincidence that the United States, Canada and Mexico are holding talks to revise the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which encompasses the three countries. The United States wants better protection of intellectual property to be part of the new accord.\n\nIts biggest complaint is that border controls in Canada, an important transshipment country, are too lax. In 2014 Canada enacted a law to give customs officers more power to detain shipments and toughened sanctions against people who violate copyrights and trademarks. But after hunting out drugs, guns and illegal immigrants, border guards have little time and money to look for non-Swiss Swiss watches. Over the past two and a half years Canada has detained fewer than 50 suspect shipments, says Lorne Lipkus, a Canadian lawyer who specialises in counterfeiting issues. American customs catch some 30,000 a year.\n\nThe United States also wants better policing within Canada. Unlike the United States and the European Union, Canada does not have a central law-enforcement team responsible for counterfeiting. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the national force, disbanded its unit after the government stiffened the law in 2014.\n\nLocal police forces are expected to help, but they lack manpower. Robert Whalen, the specialist for the Toronto police force, learned about counterfeiting while investigating organised-crime gangs, which traffic in tandoori ovens with bogus safety certificates, fake cancer drugs and other impostor products. Even he does not pursue counterfeiters full-time. \"If I'm called right now and told there is a store with a whole bunch of counterfeit Louis Vuitton and I get a call five minutes later and [am] told there is a shooting up the street, I'm going to go to the shooting,\" says Mr Whalen.\n\nAmerican suspicions of the Pacific Mall, where most sellers and customers appear to be of Chinese origin, are well founded, says Mr Lipkus. \"I've served hundreds of court orders, cease-and-desist documents, and helped the police execute multiple search warrants there,\" he says. The mall's appearance on the USTR's list of notorious emporiums may be having more effect. In a statement on February 20th its management said it was \"deeply disturbed and disappointed\" by reports that vendors were selling fake goods, and would take measures to stop the practice.\n\nOn a recent Friday (before the statement) a black \"Chanel\" handbag was on sale for C$12.95 ($10.20). (The real thing lists for C$5,950.) But that was one of the few fakes on display. Since the USTR's report big names like Gucci, Burberry, and Louis Vuitton are hidden, says Mr Whalen. If the NAFTA countries agree to update the treaty, the fakes may stay off the shelves.",

                "title": "Michel Temer is trying to fix Brazil's pension systems",
                "body": "POLITICS is no novelty at Brazil's carnival celebrations, but some themes are more danceable than others. Beija-Flor, one of Rio de Janeiro's most famous samba schools, won this year's carnival competition with a lament about corruption and crime and a celebration of tolerance. Pension reform seems less carnivalesque. That did not discourage some blocos, or street parades, from taking up the cause at this month's festivities. One, in Brasília, the capital, marched to the up-tempo \"Don't go touching our pensions\". Retirees in São Paulo performed the catchy samba, \"Those who have worked their entire lives deserve more respect\".\n\nThat lyric will be ringing in the ears of legislators when they return from their carnival break. On February 19th they will begin debating a proposal by the government to reform pensions. It is congress's most important task. Without change, the publicly financed pension systems for private- and public-sector workers will overload the government with debt, sap spending on other priorities, such as reducing poverty, and crimp economic growth.\n\nYet prospects are dim. Reform requires a constitutional amendment, which must be passed by three-fifths majorities in both houses of congress. With a general election due in October, many legislators are scared to back a measure that provokes samba scorn. The lower house is expected to vote by the end of February. The government is at least 40 votes short of the 308 needed.\n\nThat congress is even contemplating pension reform is testimony to the virtues of Brazil's centrist, pro-business president, Michel Temer. If it fails it will be in part because of his weaknesses.\n\nMr Temer took office after his left-wing predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached in 2016. The economy was in the midst of its longest and deepest recession on record. Mr Temer started well. Unlike Ms Rousseff, he knows how to marshal a congressional majority. In December 2016 he secured a constitutional amendment to freeze public spending in real terms for 20 years. Last July he signed the biggest overhaul of the Mussolini-inspired labour laws in more than 70 years.\n\nThese confidence-building measures helped spark an economic recovery. The IMF expects the economy to grow by 1.9% in 2018. An abundant harvest helped bring down inflation to 2.95% in 2017. That is the lowest rate for any year since 1998. This month the central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate to 6.75%, an all-time low.\n\nLately, though, Mr Temer has concentrated more on his political survival than on the economy. Last May O Globo, a newspaper, published an excerpt of an audio tape in which he seems to endorse payment of hush money to a politician convicted of taking bribes. That dragged him into the vast Lava Jato (Car Wash) corruption investigation that has ended the careers of many of the most prominent politicians and led to the conviction of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president.\n\nMr Temer persuaded the lower house of congress not to refer the case to the supreme court for trial. He has little pork or patronage left to offer congressmen to support his legislative programme. They have no incentive to back a president with an approval rating of 6%.\n\nHis unpopularity does not make it any less necessary to fix the pension systems. Under the current ones, the average retirement age is 54. That compares with 65 in the OECD, a group of mainly rich countries. A Brazilian man who retires at 55 gets a pension that pays on average 70% of his pre-retirement earnings; in the OECD, a worker can expect a little more than half.\n\nGoodies for oldies\n\nPension spending consumes a third of federal spending before interest payments. It accounts for 9.1% of GDP. With the number of Brazilians older than 65 expected to rise from 17m to 58m by 2060, pension spending is set to rise to a fifth of GDP.\n\nIn December 2016 Mr Temer's government sent its first reform proposal to congress. It would have established a minimum retirement age of 65 for men and women. Widows and widowers would have inherited half their spouses' pensions rather than the full amount, as now. Even this ambitious-sounding plan would not have solved the problem. It would have saved 800bn reais ($240bn) over ten years, but debt would have continued to rise from its alarming level of 74% of GDP.\n\nWhen O Globo's scoop came out, the government cancelled a vote on the proposal. It returned with a more modest one last November that would have let women retire at 62. That, too, failed to get support in the lower house. Mr Temer has now tweaked the reform again. Rural workers and spouses of police officers killed in the line of duty will continue to benefit from the current rules. The new proposal would save just 400bn reais over ten years.\n\nThe president is touting the diluted reform on television variety shows as if it were an economic elixir. The government has launched a campaign with the slogan, \"Everyone for pension reform. Don't let Brazil go bust\". Voters are unimpressed. According to a poll commissioned by the president's office, 14% back the reform.\n\nAs it becomes feebler and takes longer, the cost to the economy will rise. In January S&P downgraded Brazil's credit rating, citing the government's slow progress in reducing expenditure. Other rating agencies may follow if the watered-down reform does not pass. And that will not be enough. Without more reforms next year, \"Brazil could fall back into crisis,\" wrote Tony Volpon of UBS, a bank, in a note.\n\nSome analysts hope that congress will do nothing now, leaving the problem to Mr Temer's successor. Inadequate reform would give Brazilians a false sense that they have fixed the problem, says Monica de Bolle of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. With no reform, the next president will face a severe squeeze on discretionary spending, giving him or her little choice but to overhaul the system quickly. \"It's better to have the crunch,\" says Ms de Bolle.\n\nBut no one knows who will govern Brazil starting next January. Lula is ahead in polls, despite the corruption conviction that may bar him from running. He is a fierce critic of pension reform. His nearest competitor is Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing demagogue, whose views on pensions are vague. Mr Temer, who understands how destructive the current pension system is, has wasted a golden opportunity to fix it.",

                "title": "Colombia's two anti-coca strategies are at war with each other",
                "body": "JUST one road connects Tumaco, the second-busiest port on Colombia's Pacific coast, to the rest of the country. Beyond its verges are fields of coca bushes, many of them cultivated by poor people. Yuley Alexandra Ruano's crop grows behind a beauty parlour she owns on a patch of land she does not. It is fringed by yucca, plantains and a rotting cacao tree. She and her neighbours have signed up to the government's \"comprehensive programme for illicit crop substitution\" (PNIS), whose aim is to replace the coca with a profitable legal crop. But bureaucracy moves slowly. Ms Ruano has yet to see new seeds or the money promised by the government to help with the switch.\n\nFrom her salon in the department of Nariño, she can see that the government is pursuing with more energy the other part of its anti-coca strategy, forced eradication. Every day a Black Hawk helicopter passes, bearing police to a jungle camp in Alto Mira y Frontera (see map). Their mission is to kill the bushes, by uprooting them or by spraying them with herbicide. The government wants to eradicate by force 65,000 hectares (160,000 acres) of coca this year.\n\nThe two approaches are supposed to complement each other. The crop-substitution strategy is set out in a peace accord that in 2016 ended more than 50 years of war between the government and the FARC, a leftist guerrilla group. It is part of a broader project to bring stability and better living standards to swathes of the countryside once controlled by the FARC, which has now become a political party. The government says it reserves forced eradication for industrial-scale plantations controlled by large drug gangs, and for farmers who refuse to participate in crop substitution.\n\nBut things are not going to plan. Coca cultivation surged in anticipation of the peace deal, from 96,000 hectares to 146,000 in 2016. Farmers planted more because they expected cash from the government to switch to something else. Voluntary substitution is progressing painfully slowly. That is partly because the government has not complemented it with a programme to build roads rapidly and provide services in coca-growing areas.\n\nSome areas vacated by the FARC have been taken over by the ELN, a smaller guerrilla group; drug gangs such as the \"Gaitanista Self-Defence Forces\", which has its origins in a right-wing paramilitary group; and FARC members who rejected the peace agreement. In January Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, suspended peace talks with the ELN after a series of bombings that killed seven policemen.\n\nArmed groups also target small-scale growers of coca who want to switch crops. Last month in Caquetá, a southern department, ex-members of the FARC forced six officials of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) out of their cars and stole their GPS devices and mobile phones. The agency says the assault was an attempt to stop crop-substitution in that area.\n\nThe jump in coca production brought pressure from the United States. In September last year Donald Trump said he might decertify Colombia as a partner in the fight against drugs, putting in jeopardy some of the $390m in American aid Colombia receives. In February this year he threatened to cut aid to drug-exporting countries that are \"laughing\" at the United States. These warnings stirred traumatic memories of decertification in 1996 and 1997, when Colombia seemed to be a failing state.\n\nMany Colombians are nearly as worried about coca as Mr Trump. They judge the success of the peace deal by the number of hectares given over to the crop, says Hernando Zuleta, director of the Centre for Studies on Security and Drugs at the University of the Andes in Bogotá. That is because the cocaine trade financed the FARC.\n\nThis is stirring up an election season already roiled by debate over corruption and the economy. Colombia is to elect a new congress on March 11th and a new president on May 27th. The contests pit supporters of the peace agreement against its foes. The agreement is unlikely to be reversed. So the argument has shifted to proxy issues, including the coca surge. Peace-deal sceptics cheer on forced eradication; pro-deal politicians back crop substitution.\n\nRafael Pardo, the government's post-conflict \"high commissioner\", thinks peace is unsustainable unless the government solves the coca problem. That is not because the FARC will return to war, but because coca crops \"will always feed a market that is accompanied by violence\", he says. Small-scale coca-growers, caught between the security forces and the drug gangs, are among the most vulnerable to it.\n\nNowhere is Colombia's many-sided drug war more intense than in Tumaco. It has 23,000 hectares of coca fields, more than any other municipality. Nariño, the department of which Tumaco forms a part, is a focal point of fighting among armed groups for control of the drug trade. The government sent 2,000 more troops to Tumaco in January to contain the violence.\n\nUnder pressure from Colombian voters, and perhaps the United States, the security forces uproot fields that are supposed to be set aside for voluntary crop substitution. That provokes clashes with small-scale coca-growers. Last year peasants angry about forced eradication blocked roads in Nariño and other regions for days. Members of an eradication group that took off from Tumaco killed seven unarmed protesters in October.\n\nSince then, riot police have joined the missions. They are tension-filled. In a Black Hawk circling a coca field just outside Alto Mira y Frontera, a police officer spots three motorbikes speeding towards it. He suspects their drivers are farmers intent on protecting their crops. As the chopper lands, police jump out, to fumigate and depart before a confrontation can occur. A police commander says anyone who interferes risks being sprayed with glyphosate, even though Mr Santos, deeming the herbicide dangerous, banned aerial spraying in 2015. This month a group of farmers detained 14 riot police for a day in the area.\n\nSuch disputes are not supposed to happen. The PNIS is Colombia's first large-scale attempt to deal with coca cultivation as a problem of development rather than a crime. Small farmers like Ms Ruano are supposed to get seeds for alternative crops, such as cacao, expert advice on planting them and a stipend of 1m pesos ($350) a month for a year. Nearly 30,000 families are benefiting from the programme.\n\nBut that is just a quarter of the families that have signed collective agreements, which is just the first step towards qualifying for help. The process is slow by design. UNODC has to verify that the acreage covered by collective agreements is accurate before the PNIS can sign individual ones. Farmers' mistrust of the state, which was absent from coca-growing areas until recently, and the role given to the FARC by the peace agreement in co-ordinating crop substitution also slow things down, says Juan Carlos Garzón of Fundación Ideas para la Paz, an NGO.\n\nWhile the PNIS process inches forward, the armed forces (including the police) exceeded their goal of eradicating 50,000 hectares by the end of 2017. The offensive has at least placated the United States. In Bogotá on February 6th Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, praised Colombia's progress but added a warning. \"We need to see...the number of acres or hectares under cultivation going down,\" he said.\n\nThe successes may be short-lived. UNODC estimates that growers replant 30% of the area uprooted on average. More important, the government has not made much progress in areas controlled by organised armed groups. As a result, the coca-growing area might well have expanded last year, UNODC says.\n\nIt will be up to the next president and congress to determine the balance between helping coca-growers and uprooting crops. Candidates on the left, such as Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogotá, favour the voluntary approach. Conservatives such as Germán Vargas Lleras, a former vice-president, would resume aerial spraying. None of the main right-of-centre candidates has given much support to crop substitution. Unless Colombia's next president gives stronger backing to the voluntary approach, a Black Hawk could soon land on Ms Ruano's doorstep.",

                "title": "Why it's hard to reduce informality in Latin America's labour market",
                "body": "HER business occupies a small concrete patch in a distant corner of Lima's wholesale market. There Dora Iparraguirre sells herbs, spinach, cauliflower and cabbage. Her aim is to go up in the world -- to the raised, roofed platforms that house bigger stands where lorries can unload directly. Getting one would help her business expand. The platforms are auctioned periodically by the market authority. But to bid Ms Iparraguirre would need a tax-registration certificate.\n\nShe says she will try to get one, but it is \"complicated\" and she doesn't have the time. \"I need to have all the papers, and I don't know which ones.\" She works on her own and says she would need an accountant, but can't afford to pay one.\n\nMs Iparraguirre is one of around 135m Latin Americans -- or around half of all workers -- who, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), toil in what economists call the \"informal sector\". Remarkably, in most countries this proportion has fallen only slightly, even as people have become more educated and economies have modernised. Since a large informal sector is associated with slower economic growth and low incomes, this points to a colossal failure of public policy. Yet there is little agreement as to what explains informality.\n\nThe term itself is vague. It applies to firms and workers that stand outside a country's tax and regulatory systems but is not synonymous with illegality. In Peru, for example, it is not obligatory to register in the social-security system. According to the ILO, half of informal workers are self-employed. Others work in businesses that may be formal or informal, or are domestic servants. Many businesses are partly formal and partly not. Workers sometimes drift in and out of informality.\n\nSome economists say that informality is a result of low growth -- but it may be cause as well as consequence. Libertarians blame business taxes. They and \"institutionalists\" point to coils of red tape. Anthropologists note that some workers choose informal self-employment, for its flexibility and because they resent bad treatment by formal firms. For Ms Iparraguirre, it is the only steady work available.\n\nIn fact, all these explanations may be true. The biggest problem, says Santiago Levy at the Inter-American Development Bank, is that Latin America has so many very small, not-very-productive family businesses, which tend to be informal. The reason, he says, is the interaction of regulations, taxes and social-protection schemes, which means that businesses have no incentive to grow. The preponderance of low-productivity firms means that the region is not getting the return it should from its big investments in education.\n\nTake Mexico, where 57% of the workforce is informal, according to the statistics institute. Mr Levy notes that the typical Mexican business limits itself to a few members of an extended family who do not receive a contractual wage. If the business does well and starts hiring outside workers, its costs and risks shoot up. Social-security and other labour costs add 40% or more to wages. If trade dips, by law salaried workers cannot be laid off. Official application of regulations can amount to \"extortion\", says Luis de la Calle, another Mexican economist.\n\nPiecemeal reforms haven't worked. In Peru, the share of the workforce in informal jobs fell from 80% in 2002 to a still huge 70% in 2013. The reason for that modest decline was faster economic growth, especially in sectors with labour-intensive businesses, according to research by Juan Chacaltana of the ILO. A new, low tax for small businesses had almost no effect. Such tax reforms, which are popular among politicians, discourage firms from growing. Colombia's government slashed labour taxes, which seemed to work better. Formal employment rose from 44% of the urban workforce in 2013 to 51% last year.\n\nLatin America is paying a high price for having imported Bismarckian social-security structures to the tropics. Workers and politicians resist labour flexibility in the formal sector because losing a job also once meant losing health care and pensions. But rigid labour rules and high costs keep the formal sector small. Governments, in turn, have launched a patchwork of non-contributory benefits for the mass of informals, undermining the point of enrolling in social security.\n\nWhat is missing is political ambition. A serious effort to reduce informality requires a shift to universal social protection combined with flexible labour laws and simpler tax and business regulations. That was what the government of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski promised when it came into office in Peru in 2016. It drew up a bold plan. And then it shelved it.",

                "title": "Canada's Trayvon Martin moment",
                "body": "ON FEBRUARY 9th an all-white jury acquitted a white farmer of murder in the shooting death of an indigenous man in Saskatchewan, in western Canada. Several people in the courtroom shouted \"murderer\". Anger has continued to rise. Some liken the man who died, a 22-year-old Cree named Colten Boushie, to Trayvon Martin, a black American teenager killed by a Hispanic man in Florida in 2012. In that case, the killer pleaded self-defence and was controversially acquitted by a nearly all-white jury.\n\nIn Canada's case, activists who represent the country's 1.7m indigenous people, who are customarily divided into First Nations, Métis (a mix of First Nations and Europeans) and Inuit, hope the verdict will lead to changes to judicial procedures. On February 14th Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, said Canada would reform the criminal-justice system to protect indigenous rights. But such promises have been made before.\n\nMr Boushie was killed after he and four friends, who had been drinking, drove onto the property of Gerald Stanley near Biggar, Saskatchewan. One or two of them tried to steal a vehicle. Mr Stanley grabbed a semiautomatic handgun and fired two warning shots. He said the third, fatal shot was accidental. The jury believed him. It acquitted him of second-degree murder and of the lesser charge of manslaughter.\n\nDefenders of indigenous rights saw the verdict as warped by racism. Defence lawyers used peremptory challenges to dismiss five prospective jurors who appeared to be indigenous. That is perfectly legal. But activists claim it is one way that the criminal-justice system discriminates against indigenous people. Although they make up 4% of Canada's adult population, they account for more than a quarter of inmates in federal prisons.\n\nMr Stanley's supporters say he was merely defending his home. \"For farm people, your yard is your castle,\" his lawyer contended. The two sides have set up rival crowd-funding pages. The \"Gerald Stanley Support Fund\" had raised C$180,000 ($144,000) to pay his legal bills by February 14th. \"Justice for Colten Boushie\" had raised C$166,000 for his family.\n\nAfter meeting Mr Boushie's family, Mr Trudeau promised legislation to make Canada's courts more friendly to indigenous people. It will be enacted before the next national election, which is due in 2019. He did not provide much detail, though it is likely that the reform will change the rules under which lawyers can dismiss potential jurors.\n\nMany indigenous Canadians doubt that Mr Trudeau will bring about big changes. Past declarations of good intentions include one by a Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in 1996 and one by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015. \"We need to make sure this time it's for real,\" said Romeo Saganash, a Cree member of parliament from Quebec.",

                "body": "EVERY morning crowds gather on the Venezuelan side of the Simón Bolívar bridge to cross over into Colombia. Many just want to shop for basic goods, which are scarce at home. But growing numbers are staying, at least until the political and economic crisis in their country passes. Colombian immigration officials counted 550,000 Venezuelans in the country at the end of last year. That is an increase of 210,000 from the middle of the year.\n\nOn February 8th Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, on a visit to the border town of Cúcuta, tried to stanch the flow. In a warehouse used by the disaster-relief arm of the government of Norte de Santander, Cúcuta's province, he announced that Colombia would stop issuing one-day entry cards for Venezuelans and deploy 3,000 more guards along the countries' 2,200km (1,400-mile) border. \"Colombia has never before experienced a situation like this,\" he said. On February 14th he said the country needs international help to cope with it.\n\nMr Santos is not the only Latin American leader to be unnerved by the influx of Venezuelans. Brazil's president, Michel Temer, went on February 12th to Boa Vista, an Amazonian town of 330,000 people that is hosting 40,000 Venezuelans. Fewer have entered Brazil than Colombia in part because the border region is a jungle. Brazil plans to double the number of border guards and help Venezuelans resettle to other cities in the country's interior. The point is not to stop migrants from coming but to \"discipline and co-ordinate\" their arrival, Mr Temer said.\n\nMore than 200,000 Venezuelans entered Ecuador from January 2016 to September 2017, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Three-quarters of them went on to Peru and to Chile, where requests for residency permits from Venezuelans last year were on track to double those in 2016. Some 27,000 pitched up in Argentina in 2017 and perhaps 40,000 are in Trinidad and Tobago. Some 2.7m of Venezuela's 34m people are abroad.\n\nColombia, the most accessible neighbour, has borne the brunt. As the numbers have risen, its easy-going attitude has toughened. Unemployment and crime are rising in Cúcuta and other border towns, say local officials. People who had good jobs in Venezuela now beg and sleep on Cúcuta's streets with their families.\n\nColombia is trying to balance border control with compassion for people fleeing a country where inflation is expected to reach 13,000% this year and the economy will shrink by 15%. Mr Santos reminded Colombians that Venezuela received 1m of their countrymen during Colombia's decades of armed conflict, which subsided in the early 2000s. Colombia's foreign minister, María Ángela Holguín, says her government has been learning tips from Turkey, a destination for Syrians fleeing war, on how to deal with migrants from Venezuela. It has been working with the UN to set up reception centres for them.\n\nTo Venezuelans in Cúcuta, the new policy feels more like a crackdown. Those in the country are being required to register with immigration offices. They will be able to work, but only if they have stamped passports. A shortage of paper for passports is one of many that are causing Venezuelans to flee.\n\nA new task force will keep Cúcuta's growing homeless population out of squares and parks. Last month, immigration officials raided a basketball court that 900 migrants had turned into a shelter. Hundreds were deported.\n\nBut such measures will not stop the flow of Venezuelans and may not slow it much. The long border is easily crossed. Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, has called a presidential election for April 22nd. He is unlikely to face an effective rival. As long as he is in charge, the Venezuelans will keep coming.",

                "body": "THE mood was despondent as Carlos Antonio Lozada walked onto a makeshift stage in a plaza in Fusagasugá, a town 70km (43 miles) south-west of Bogotá, on March 3rd. He was the main speaker for the final campaign event of the FARC, once a guerrilla army, now competing in an election as a political party for the first time. The former commander gave a listless speech to a rain-spattered crowd of perhaps 400 people. They listened with indifference while FARC functionaries handed out lunch boxes, soft drinks and flags with the party's new rose-and-star symbol.\n\nThe FARC's participation gave historical significance to the congressional election held eight days later. But it also showed that Colombians have no intention of giving the ex-guerrillas the power they failed to gain in 52 years of war against the state. The FARC won just 53,000 votes in the election for the senate, 0.34% of the total. Under the peace agreement signed by Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, it will nonetheless have five seats in the 108-seat senate and five of the 172 seats in the lower house of congress, which gives it some clout, but not a huge amount (see chart). The FARC's leader, Rodrigo Londoño, dropped out of the presidential election, whose first round is to be held on May 27th, for health reasons.\n\nOther results from the vote will have bigger consequences. Pro-peace parties, including the Unity Party of Mr Santos (who cannot run for a third term), lost seats. Parties of the centre-right and right that are sceptical of the accord will be the strongest force in the new congress. More important are the results of two consultas, or primaries to nominate presidential candidates, held on the same day as the legislative vote. They conferred front-runner status on a critic of the peace deal and on a left-wing former mayor of Bogotá. Both would veer from the course set by the moderate Mr Santos, but in different directions.\n\nThe biggest vote-getter was Iván Duque, who will be the candidate of a coalition that opposed the peace agreement in a referendum in 2016. The alliance was put together by Álvaro Uribe, a conservative former president who is a ferocious critic of Mr Santos. Mr Duque, his protégé, is less strident and more technocratic. A lawyer with little political experience, he amassed 4m votes to defeat Alejandro Ordoñez, a fundamentalist Christian, and Marta Lucía Ramírez, a conservative senator. Mr Duque named Ms Ramírez, who got 1.5m votes, as his running-mate. The pair are well positioned for the presidential vote. Democratic Centre, Mr Uribe's party, will be the largest in the senate and the second-largest in the lower house.\n\nThe other big winner is Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogotá and ex-member of the M-19 guerrilla group, who won a left-wing consulta against token opposition. Although his 2.9m votes do not match Mr Duque's haul, they are the most won by any left-wing presidential candidate in Colombia's history. Mr Petro's anti-establishment message resonates. He leads in the most recent opinion polls, with the support of nearly a quarter of voters.\n\nThe main threat to the two front-runners comes from Germán Vargas Lleras, a vice-president under Mr Santos who has become a critic of the peace agreement. Mr Vargas Lleras did not compete in a consulta, but the strong showing in the congressional election of his Radical Change party, which nearly doubled its number of seats, shows that he is master of Colombia's most effective political machine. The grandson of a former president, he has a network of allies among local power-brokers, especially on the densely populated Caribbean coast.\n\nAlthough Mr Vargas Lleras has made fighting corruption a focus of his campaign, many of his allies have had links to paramilitary groups, says Juanita León, of La Silla Vacia, a political-news website. Some have been convicted of corruption and other crimes. Sergio Fajardo, a centre-left former governor of the north-western province of Antioquia, is a long shot to get into a second round of presidential voting.\n\nImplementation of the peace accord, which has been disrupted by criminal gangs and slowed by the inefficiency of the state, is not among voters' main worries. In a recent survey by Celag, a pollster, just 16% of respondents said it would influence their choice. More than half named as pressing concerns jobs, health care and corruption, which is fresh in voters' minds after allegations that Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction firm, bribed Colombian officials (and paid for posters and polling in Mr Santos's re-election campaign).\n\n\"I care much more about all the corruption we see\" than about the peace deal, says Dayana Rodríguez, a recent university graduate voting at Corferias, a convention centre in Bogotá. Another voter, struggling to find work, remarked that the FARC had never threatened her. If either Mr Duque or Mr Petro wins, it will be because voters are fed up with mediocre economic growth and with the smugness that Mr Santos seems to represent.\n\nBut the presidential election will matter for implementation of the peace accord, and for talks with the ELN, a guerrilla group that is smaller than the FARC but still active. Just how much is unclear. Mr Duque is more moderate than his mentor, Mr Uribe, but he wants to bar from politics FARC members who have committed crimes against humanity. That would contravene the agreement. Mr Vargas Lleras thinks FARC ex-guerrillas should not be allowed to participate in politics before they pass through the special \"transitional-justice\" courts set up by the accord.\n\nBoth are sceptics of negotiations with the ELN. Mr Santos broke them off in January, after accusing it of staging a series of attacks on the police (the ELN claimed responsibility for one). He resumed talks on March 12th. Mr Vargas Lleras has said he would not negotiate with the group; Mr Duque would set tougher conditions.\n\nMr Petro would cause rupture of another kind. His plans include taxing unproductive land and summoning an assembly to rewrite the constitution, both of which scare the rich. As mayor of Bogotá, he clashed with the city council and sometimes governed by decree. Parties on the centre-left, which could help him win the presidency and govern afterwards, consider him too dogmatic to be a reliable ally. If he becomes president he will face a hostile congress. He could put his radical proposals directly to the voters through referendums, says Eduardo Pizano, director of the school of government at the University of the Andes in Bogotá.\n\nConservatives brand Mr Petro a \"castrochavista\", intent on importing Fidel Castro's stultifying socialism and the chaos of next-door Venezuela, which follows the teachings of the late Hugo Chávez and is sending economic refugees into Colombia. The accusation will worry many voters. But Mr Petro appeals to a growing number of people angered by inequality and corruption. That rage will probably propel him to a second round of the presidential election, scheduled for June 17th. It could even lift him to victory.",

                "title": "The lives and deaths of transgender Latin Americans",
                "body": "A QUARTER of a century ago the town of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the capital of Chiapas state in Mexico's deep south, was the setting of a spate of horrific killings of transgender prostitutes. Nine of them were murdered in two years, shot execution-style with up to a dozen bullets from high-calibre revolvers. Police claimed that in two cases they were murdered after having had sex with their killers.\n\nThe deaths caused a stir in Mexico, not least because of speculation that a police death squad was involved and because the authorities framed clearly innocent people. The Mexican interior minister at the time, Patrocinio González, when previously governor of Chiapas, had closed down discos frequented by the sex workers, forcing them onto the street. (Mr González is the nephew of the priest-baiting governor of a neighbouring state who was the model for a character in Graham Greene's novel \"The Power and the Glory\".) \"We are all scared now, but it's what we live from,\" said one prostitute, called Jessica. Six months later the Zapatista rising elsewhere in Chiapas grabbed global headlines. The country stopped paying attention to dead transgender people.\n\nBello was reminded of his reporting trip to cover that long-ago outrage by \"A Fantastic Woman\", a Chilean film which has just won an Oscar. Its protagonist is Marina, a trans woman (someone who has transitioned from male to female) who has a conventional life as a waitress and aspiring classical singer. It tells the story of what happens when her lover, an older businessman with whom she lives, dies suddenly. The film is remarkable for Marina's dignity in the face of psychological violence. This derives from the fear her transgressive identity provokes. \"What are you?\" spits the dead man's son.\n\nIn interviews Daniela Vega, the film's star, who is herself a trans woman, says optimistically that attitudes are changing in Chile, until recently a socially conservative country. That applies more broadly. A survey last year by ILGA, a pressure group, found that some 70% of respondents in Latin America agreed that gays and trans people should enjoy the same legal rights as anyone else, the highest figure anywhere. \"The region has seen huge change in terms of its willingness to talk about this,\" says Javier Corrales, a political scientist at Amherst College in Massachusetts.\n\nSome countries have gone beyond talking. Argentina, Uruguay and Colombia are among only a handful in the world that have approved measures allowing citizens to change their gender on their identity documents without having to undergo surgery or obtain a doctor's authorisation. This is a priority for transgender activists. Having the \"wrong\" legal identity leads to harassment and also makes it harder to get jobs. The city government of Buenos Aires has opened the first support centre for transgender people in Latin America.\n\nIt is a paradox that, as Mr Corrales puts it, \"groundbreaking innovations in public policy coexist with atavistic attitudes\" in Latin America. Governments' willingness to extend human rights into the field of gender has prompted a backlash led by religious groups, both evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics. And that may cause continuing violence.\n\nEven a quarter-century on, the Tuxtla Gutiérrez killings are probably more representative of the world of transgender Latin Americans than is Ms Vega. A report in 2015 by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights claims that the average life expectancy for trans people in the region is just 35 years (compared with 75 for the population as a whole). Another study found that four-fifths of murders of trans people take place in Latin America.\n\nWhat explains that? Many trans people face rejection by their families, and thus poverty. That may push them into sex work. Transgender prostitutes are visible on the streets of many Latin American cities. They are both used and abused by men, including police. In some cases, machismo may mask homosexual feelings of which the men are ashamed. And Latin America is a violent place.\n\nCritics sometimes complain that the demands of the LGBT lobby are burdened by political correctness. A legislative proposal in Uruguay would establish a quota for trans people in public employment. Courts in the region have sometimes gone far ahead of public opinion in, for example, legitimising gay rights. Many people find it hard to cope with the questioning of sexual identity. That does not weaken the moral force of trans people's fundamental demand for recognition of their humanity. \"I am of flesh and blood,\" Marina coolly answers one of her interrogators in the film. If \"A Fantastic Woman\" makes that more widely accepted, it will deserve a bigger prize than an Oscar.",

                "title": "Venezuela's crypto-currency: salvation or scam?",
                "body": "IT \"WILL be an instrument for Venezuela's economic stability and financial independence\", promises a white paper published by the country's government last month. Venezuela, the issuer of the world's least stable currency, proposes to issue its most trustworthy in the form of the petro, a \"sovereign crypto asset backed by oil\". A private sale of this promising new asset started in February. The government plans to offer it to the public on March 20th.\n\nIn one sense, the idea is as ludicrous as it sounds. Only the most credulous investors will trust a currency issued by Venezuela's socialist regime, which has debased the bolívar, expropriated private enterprises, ridden roughshod over the country's constitution and faces sanctions from the United States and the European Union.\n\nBut there is a germ of sense in what Venezuela is proposing. The country is suffering from hyperinflation, with prices doubling every month. By the end of 2018 economic output will be 40% lower than it was in 2013, according to the IMF. Venezuela needs the \"economic stability\" promised by the white paper. In theory, adoption of a crypto-currency, impervious to political whims, could provide that.\n\nVenezuela is not the only country seeking a cryptonic. Officials of Iran and Russia have said their governments might be interested in issuing crypto-currencies. On February 28th the Marshall Islands announced that it would issue one, called the sovereign, that it will accept as legal tender.\n\nWhat would-be cryptocracies have in common is an uncomfortable relationship with the dollar. The Marshall Islands is a dollarised economy; a second currency would give it at least the illusion of greater control over its money. Iran and Russia are subject to American sanctions.\n\nFor Venezuela, whose crypto plans are more advanced, the petro might simply be a way to evade American sanctions and raise cash it desperately needs. The United States has frozen the dollar assets of the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, and 48 other Venezuelans. It has also barred companies with American operations from lending to some Venezuelan entities. Production of oil, almost the country's sole source of foreign exchange, is declining because of lack of investment by PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. Venezuela's foreign-exchange reserves are dwindling.\n\nWith the petro, Venezuela has something new to sell. It has \"pre-mined\" 100m petros, all that will ever be created, promises the white paper. State television showed outdated personal computers supposedly poised to mine the new currency. The \"pre-sale\" brought $5bn, Mr Maduro claimed, without providing evidence. At the government's reference price for oil of $60 a barrel, the total value of the new currency is $6bn (so, if Mr Maduro is telling the truth, almost all the petros have been pre-sold). That is a useful sum, but less than half the amount the country must pay to service its foreign debt this year. The United States Treasury has warned that investors who buy petros with dollars may be violating its sanctions. That makes the currency less useful as a sanctions-buster.\n\nA more intriguing possibility is that the government views the petro as a substitute for the value-leaking bolívar. Other countries with high inflation, like Zimbabwe and Ecuador, have escaped by adopting the dollar, which would be anathema to Mr Maduro's regime. In 1923 Germany defeated hyperinflation by issuing the Rentenmark, a currency backed by land. Brazil slew inflation in the early 1990s by replacing the cruzeiro with a new currency, the real, managed by a central bank that came to be seen as trustworthy. In theory, the petro could be Venezuela's real.\n\nThe government has announced that Venezuelans will be able to buy petros at authorised exchange houses and pay taxes with them, which could be the first step towards making the petro an everyday currency. Zimbabwe dollarised when citizens refused to accept payments in the local money. In Venezuela, which deprives people of access to dollars more effectively than did Zimbabwe, people could switch from the bolívar to the petro. That would increase demand for the new currency, and thus its price (and the government's eventual profits).\n\nBut the government has already undermined the trust that is supposedly built into the notion of an oil-backed crypto-currency. During the pre-sale it switched from the widely used Ethereum platform, which validates and keeps records of transactions in multiple crypto-currencies, to the New Economy Movement (NEM), a newcomer. The main crypto-currency on the NEM platform has a market capitalisation of just $4bn, compared with $61bn for Ethereum's main currency. Because the platform is smaller, the network of computers used to validate transactions and enforce the rules on which a crypto-currency is based is more centralised. That makes it easier for one user, say, Venezuela's government, to dominate the platform and undermine a crypto-currency.\n\nThe link to oil is no more convincing. The petro is not exchangeable for oil. It is merely backed by the government's promise that it is backed by oil. That promise may not be honoured by the country's repressed opposition, which may some day take power. Without decentralisation or a credible link to oil, the petro is just an unbacked currency issued by Venezuela's discredited government. That's what the bolívar is, too.",

                "title": "How Venezuela tests Latin America's commitment to democracy",
                "body": "WHEN Bill Clinton called the first Summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994 he wanted to celebrate the shared commitment of all 34 countries in the hemisphere to democracy and free trade -- all, that is, except Cuba, the 35th, which was not invited. At the seventh summit in Panama in 2015, regional solidarity prevailed. At Latin America's insistence, Cuba was invited and Raúl Castro sat down with Barack Obama, setting the seal on their diplomatic détente.\n\nSo it was a big diplomatic step when last month Peru's government, the host of the eighth summit, scheduled for April 13th-14th, announced that it was withdrawing Venezuela's invitation and that Nicolás Maduro, its president, would be denied entry. Peru acted for the 14-nation ad hoc \"Lima group\", which includes most Latin American countries. They rejected Mr Maduro's decision to hold a sham presidential election on April 22nd. Latin America is once again giving priority to the defence of democracy. Can it do so consistently and effectively?\n\nIf democracy is to be the criterion for participation (as agreed at the meeting in Quebec in 2001), why not exclude others? Neither Cuba nor Nicaragua should qualify. Nor, arguably, does Honduras. Having ended term limits in dubious fashion, Juan Orlando Hernández, a pro-American conservative, won a second term as president in November in an election that the opposition and outside observers claim was rigged. His party's legislators have given themselves carte blanche to steal public money, eviscerating an anti-corruption mission under the aegis of the Organisation of American States (OAS).\n\nBut the electoral fraud in Honduras was not clear-cut. Mr Hernández should be warned but not excluded. Venezuela remains the most dramatic case of democratic regress in Latin America. Its descent into economic chaos, human misery and dictatorship is of unprecedented gravity.\n\nMr Maduro's regime has stopped publishing many statistics. A survey by three universities published last month found widespread malnutrition; 87% of respondents were poor and 61% were extremely so. That is far above the Latin American averages of 31% and 10% respectively, and should shame all those who hailed Hugo Chávez, Mr Maduro's late mentor, as an anti-capitalist paragon. The survey estimates that 815,000 Venezuelans have emigrated since 2012, most in the past two years. Their arrival in other South American countries is pushing the region to act.\n\nHaving weakened the opposition through the imprisonment or banning of its leaders and the intimidation (including torture) of its activists, Mr Maduro is trying to seal his dictatorship by bringing forward the presidential election due later this year. Since the government refuses the conditions for a free and fair contest, the opposition coalition says that it will boycott the poll next month. In those circumstances, \"a lot of Latin American countries will not recognise the result as legitimate,\" says Juan Carlos Varela, Panama's president.\n\nOn February 23rd the OAS, which brings together all countries except Cuba, approved a resolution similar to the Lima group's. But it did so only by a bare majority. Venezuela's regime still has a few allies (and clients among Caribbean island-states that receive cheap oil). Some may boycott the Lima summit in solidarity.\n\nWhat chance is there that action by Venezuela's neighbours can achieve results? \"This is the moment for mediation [in Venezuela], but it has to be by everyone, by Latin America, the United States and Europe,\" says César Gaviria, a former secretary-general of the OAS. The priority must be a free and fair election. Failing that, the region will have to ramp up the pressure.\n\nOstracism is a start. That it hurts the regime's pride was clear in 2016 when the foreign minister tried to gatecrash a meeting of the Mercosur trade group, from which her country has been suspended. Latin American countries should follow the United States and the EU in barring the regime's leaders from visiting, and in seizing their looted assets. It should also demand that the faction-ridden opposition unite behind a single leadership.\n\nLatin America has plenty of disagreements with Donald Trump, but anti-imperialism should not, as Venezuela argues, override the defence of democracy and human rights. Neither should the tradition of non-intervention, nor an insistence on unattainable regional unanimity. That means the OAS might not be the right diplomatic vehicle. Rather, the Group of Lima should turn itself into an open-ended coalition of the willing to take whatever political action is necessary to return Venezuela to democracy and stave off a humanitarian disaster.",

                "title": "Latin America needs an infrastructure upgrade",
                "body": "THE Transnordestina railway is supposed to carry soya beans, iron ore and other commodities from farms and mines in Brazil's northeast to ports in Ceará and Pernambuco, and then on to markets in China. Brazil has spent more than 6bn reais ($1.8bn) on the project since work began a decade ago. But cows still amble along its unfinished tracks. In Lima and Bogotá workers can spend half as much time commuting as they do at the office. In Brito, a village on Nicaragua's Pacific coast, there are no paved roads, electricity or running water. \"It's like we're still living in the era of Columbus,\" laments a fisherman.\n\nLatin America is hobbled by its inadequate infrastructure. More than 60% of the region's roads are unpaved, compared with 46% in emerging economies in Asia and 17% in Europe. Two-thirds of sewage is untreated. Poor sanitation and lack of clean water are the second-biggest killer of children under five years old, according to the World Health Organisation. Losses of electricity from transmission and distribution networks are among the highest in the world. Latin America spends a smaller share of GDP on infrastructure than any other region except sub-Saharan Africa (see chart).\n\nThere are some bright spots. Chile's roads are better than those of Belgium, New Zealand and China, according to the World Economic Forum. Uruguay's electricity and telecoms outclass those in the United States and Canada. But in general, the quality of infrastructure is more of a drag on than a boost to Latin American economies. If the infrastructure of the region's middle-income countries were as good as that in Turkey and Bulgaria, their growth rates would be two percentage points higher than they are, according to McKinsey, a consultancy.\n\nRecently a window of opportunity to upgrade it opened up. Global interest rates have been unusually low, which makes it cheap to raise money to repair old infrastructure or start new projects. Market-friendly presidents have taken office in several countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Peru. They have made improving infrastructure a priority. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Peru's president since July 2016, promised to turn the country into a \"construction camp\". Mauricio Macri, elected Argentina's president in 2015, launched an infrastructure plan called Plan Belgrano for the country's poorly connected north. His cabinet chief, Marcos Peña, calls it \"the most ambitious in Argentina's history\". In Colombia a promise to build rural infrastructure is part of the peace agreement between the government and the FARC, a leftist guerrilla group that had been at war with the state since 1964.\n\nA window closes\n\nBut the region's governments have not made the most of the opportunity. A big setback was the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation, which began as a money-laundering case in Brazil and has engulfed the governments of a dozen Latin American countries. Odebrecht, a Brazilian firm that built highways, dams, power plants and sanitation facilities across the region, admitted to paying $788m in bribes. Its money financed political campaigns, including those of Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos and Juan Carlos Varela, now Panama's president. Mr Kuczynski has admitted that companies linked to him have taken (legal) payments from Odebrecht.\n\nThe scandal has left a trail of unfinished projects, frightened politicians and bureaucrats, and wary bankers. A $7bn contract with Odebrecht to build a pipeline to transport natural gas from the Amazon basin across the Andes to Peru's coast has been annulled and work has been suspended. Ruta del Sol 2, a 500km (300-mile) stretch of highway to help connect Bogotá to Colombia's Caribbean coast, has stalled. Panama's government cancelled a contract with Odebrecht for a $1bn hydroelectric project. Mexico's biggest scheme, a new airport near the capital, has been plagued by corruption allegations. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the front-runner in Mexico's presidential election, scheduled for July 1st, has threatened to scrap it.\n\nGovernments also worry that a rise in interest rates will raise the cost of borrowing to build infrastructure and that a reduction in corporate tax in the United States, signed into law by Donald Trump in December, will pull capital away from Latin America. They are racing to get their infrastructure plans back on track before the opportunity passes.\n\nThe biggest need, say economists, is for roads, railways, ports and urban transport to speed exports and the travels of workers. To move sugar from Jujuy in northern Argentina to Buenos Aires by rail, a journey of 1,675km, takes 22 days, as long as it takes to ship it on to Hamburg. Cargo can take two days to journey from Bogotá to Santa Marta on the Caribbean coast; then it can wait as long to pass through customs.\n\nA big difficulty in widening such bottlenecks is cumbersome procedures, legal hurdles and ponderous bureaucracies. A new airport near Cusco, Peru's most popular tourist destination, was proposed in the 1970s; a contract to build it was signed in 2014 but scrapped last year. Projects often impinge on indigenous lands, which can slow things down further. Conflicts over projects cause average delays of five years, according to a study by the Inter-American Development Bank.\n\nDespite low interest rates, governments cannot borrow much to pay for infrastructure. Non-financial public-sector debt rose from 30.6% of GDP in 2008 on average in Latin America to 40.4% in 2016. In Brazil it reached a record of 74.4% last year. Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru have rules that limit public spending or borrowing.\n\nPrivacy, please\n\nSo governments must form partnerships with private enterprises, says Jose Fernandez, a former assistant secretary in America's State Department. They are no panacea. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are open to abuse by construction firms such as Odebrecht, which make low bids to secure contracts and then renegotiate them to push up the cost, often by bribing a politician or two. More than three-quarters of Latin American PPP contracts in transport have been renegotiated within about three years of signing, according to José Luis Guasch, a professor of economics at the University of California.\n\nPPPs require competent agencies and often government guarantees, as well as sophisticated domestic financial markets. In Chile, which has strong institutions and financial markets, most roads, ports and airports are operated by private companies. In most countries private participation is a complement to, rather than a substitute for, public money, the World Bank argues. The region's volatile politics makes investors wary. Michel Temer, Brazil's centrist president, is dogged by scandal and will not run in the presidential election in October. Mexico's election may bring the populist Mr López Obrador to power. In Peru congress is threatening to impeach Mr Kuczynski, who narrowly avoided impeachment once before.\n\nNot all the news is bad. One reason for cheer is that infrastructure can be less expensive than governments think. With conventional policies, South America needs to spend $23bn-24bn a year to upgrade its electricity networks, according to the World Bank. But if the region manages demand better, introduces renewable sources of energy and promotes conservation, it can cut that cost to $8bn-9bn. Freight can be sped up and made cheaper by simplifying bureaucracy and improving regulation as well as by expanding roads. Latin America's trucking industry is now 15 times more concentrated than that of the United States, the World Bank says. Promoting competition would reduce costs.\n\nA second source of encouragement is China. Its banks invest more in Latin America's infrastructure than the World Bank and IDB combined, according to David Dollar of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington. Last year Chinese companies invested at least $21bn in Brazil, not least in power plants and ports. Bolivia has a $10bn Chinese credit line to spend on motorways and hydroelectric dams. China has agreed to build two nuclear-power plants in Argentina. But some Chinese ideas, like a railway through the Amazon and a canal through Nicaragua to rival the Panama canal, may never materialise.\n\nLatin American countries may be learning from their mistakes. The scandals are changing how business is done. Companies are increasing radically the number of compliance officers, says Brian Winter, vice-president for policy at the Americas Society and the Council of the Americas. New laws seek to bring more transparency and strike a balance between discouraging corruption and chilling investment. Legislation in Peru, for example, exempts from penalties firms that co-operate with anti-corruption investigators.\n\nSome countries, including Colombia and Peru, have passed laws that make it harder to renegotiate PPPs. Brazil's plan for 34 partnerships in roads, ports and other projects seeks to reduce red tape by making sure that they have environmental licences before their details are announced.\n\nSuch reforms improve the chances that Latin America's president-builders will eventually realise their ambitions. Repairers are at work on the rail line through Jujuy. Peru's government hopes to find new investors in the gas pipeline this year. With the right policies, honestly executed, rolling stock, rather than livestock, could someday glide along the tracks of the Transnordestina railway.",

                "title": "What's next for Canada's economy",
                "body": "\"EVERYBODY thinks this is a 50-pound sack of seeds,\" says Steven Fabijanski as he hefts a large white bag onto a table. \"Actually, it's 8,000 litres of jet fuel.\" That is what Agrisoma Biosciences, the company Mr Fabijanski runs in Quebec, plans to make from the bagful of carinata, or Ethiopian mustard seed. In January a Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by Qantas flew from Los Angeles to Melbourne on a mixture of jet fuel and juice extracted from Agrisoma's mustard seeds. Eventually, a third of biofuel for aviation will come from seeds bred by the company, Mr Fabijanski predicts. His slogan is: \"don't drill, plant.\"\n\nBiofuel looks like an industry of the future in a country that depends on those of the past. Oil and vehicles, Canada's two biggest exports, are both declining, and may continue to do so. Oil from Alberta's tar sands is expensive to produce. The United States, by far its biggest foreign customer, is fracking more and importing less. Carmaking has never fully recovered from a recession in the United States in 2008. Production has dropped from a peak of 3m vehicles in 1999 to 2.2m last year.\n\nWith Donald Trump in the White House, Canadians worry that things will get worse. No one knows what will come out of the renegotiation demanded by Mr Trump of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, under which the trade in vehicles takes place. Businessmen also worry about the new American tax law, which slashes the tax on corporate profits from 35% to 21%, below the average Canadian rate of 26.7%. Jack Mintz, an economist, has called it a \"tax tsunami\" for Canada. That and the threat to NAFTA are encouraging American businesses to keep their money at home rather than investing in Canada, says the central bank.\n\nThis comes on top of other discouragements to growth. The workforce is shrinking as ageing baby-boomers retire. Economists worry that consumers, who have built up record levels of debt, will spend less as interest rates rise. Dominic Barton, the managing partner of McKinsey, a consultancy, has warned that, without changes, GDP will grow by an average of 1.5% over the next 50 years, half the rate of the previous 50. The economy grew 3% last year. But the government forecasts a slowdown to 2.2% this year and to 1.6% in 2019.\n\nThese gloomy expectations were in the air when Bill Morneau, the finance minister, presented the government's budget in parliament on February 27th. Business-people were hoping he would give the economy a quick boost, perhaps by reducing taxes to match Mr Trump's corporate cut or with a dose of deregulation. Mr Morneau disappointed them. The budget continues the government's methodical approach to fixing the economy's problems. Mr Morneau and the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, prefer to plant patiently rather than to drill aggressively.\n\nThat was evident in the \"equality and growth\" budget's big idea: putting more women to work. Just over 61% of working-age women have a job or are looking for one, compared with around 70% of men. Women working full time earn 88% of what men do on average. That is not bad by the standards of other rich countries. But Mr Morneau reckons that much could be gained by doing better. If female participation in the labour force rose to that of men, an unlikely scenario, the economy would be 4% larger, according to RBC, a bank.\n\nA woman's place is in the office\n\nMr Morneau quoted that prediction to justify a range of female-friendly policies. He will raise the child benefit, which parents can spend on day care, and improve incentives for new fathers to take time off work. There will be extra money for female entrepreneurs and to fight sexual harassment. The federal government will close its own pay gap, Mr Morneau promised.\n\nFemale-friendliness is fashionable, but it also fits with the strategy of removing economic roadblocks advocated by Mr Barton, a Canadian who leads a panel that advises the government on how to promote growth. Encouraging women to work is a politically palatable alternative to raising immigration. Polls suggest that Canadians do not want to increase the target from its current 310,000 a year. The government plans to spend C$180bn ($140bn) on infrastructure over 12 years. It has not yet followed economists' advice to improve competitiveness by lifting restrictions on foreign ownership of airlines and telecoms firms.\n\nMore appealing to the Liberal government is the idea of trading more with countries besides the United States. The value of foreign trade is equivalent to 64% of Canada's GDP. The United States buys three-quarters of its exports. Apart from threatening NAFTA, the Trump administration has slapped tariffs on Canadian softwood and newsprint, and may impose them on steel and aluminium. Canada needs friendlier partners.\n\nIt is making progress. An economic and trade deal with the European Union, negotiated by the previous government, took effect last September. Canada is due to sign a deal with ten Pacific countries, including Japan and Vietnam, on March 8th. But its quest for further agreements has faltered. Mr Trudeau failed to launch trade talks with China on a visit there in December. His trip last month to India, with which Canada has been conducting fruitless talks since 2010, was a disappointment. Mr Morneau did not mention India when he listed \"new markets\" Canada hopes to enter.\n\nCanada is unlikely to make much impression on those markets with the same old industries. That is where companies like Agrisoma come in. It exemplifies the idea, promoted by Mr Barton among others, that tomorrow's winners will come from adding technology to yesterday's successes, especially agriculture. The Saskatchewan Food Industry Development Centre, a non-profit lab in Saskatoon, is working with growers of pulses, wheat and soya beans to produce meat substitutes. It has produced passable chicken fingers, says Shannon Hood-Niefer, its chief scientist. James Cameron, a Hollywood director, has invested in a plant in Vanscoy, Saskatchewan, to make new foods from peas. \"Shame on us if we don't develop agri-food as a focal point of growth,\" says Philip Cross, an economist at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Ottawa.\n\nIn January, BlackBerry, a Canadian technology company, announced a partnership with Baidu, a big Chinese internet firm, to work on ways to use artificial intelligence in cars. Last month the government said that it would spend nearly C$1bn over five years to help groups of firms and research institutes working on artificial intelligence, food protein, marine vehicles, advanced manufacturing and digital technology. It hopes that these projects will lead to the development of Silicon Valley-like \"superclusters\".\n\nSubsidising such things probably has a lower economic pay-off than encouraging women to work and improving infrastructure. Mark Wiseman of BlackRock, an American investment firm, who is a member of Mr Barton's advisory panel, worries that support targeted at specific industries risks \"spreading the proverbial peanut butter too thin\". The government should back proven winners, not potential ones, he says. Others think it should let individual firms and sectors fend for themselves.\n\nThe criticism aimed at Mr Morneau's budget is blunter. He responded to gathering threats from the United States with \"deep denial\", fumed the Fraser Institute, a free-market think-tank. John Manley of the Business Council called the budget \"disappointingly thin\". But Mr Morneau, who has abandoned his promise to balance the budget by next fiscal year, cannot afford the tax cuts many of his critics favour. The government's patient planting strategy makes sense, as long as a storm does not ruin the harvest.",

                "title": "The fight to save European dialects in Brazil",
                "body": "THE two dozen old men playing cards in the parish hall in Serafina Corrêa, a small town in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, seem unremarkable until you eavesdrop. They banter not in Portuguese but in Talian, a dialect that mixes words from Venetian and other Italian dialects as well as Portuguese. It is spoken by perhaps 2m descendants of immigrants who came to Brazil 150 years ago. A sign at a zebra crossing in the town asks, \"Parché Corer Cossi? Va Pianpian\" (\"Why are you racing? Slow down\").\n\nSerafina Corrêa calls itself the \"capital\" of Talian, one of about 30 non-indigenous tongues used in Brazil, especially in the south. They include Polish, Russian and Dutch, but also rare dialects such as Trentino, another import from northern Italy, and Riograndenser Hunsrückisch and East Pomeranian, both forms of German. Their speakers fret that the advance of Portuguese will drive them to extinction. Marli Zanella, who works in a boutique in Serafina Corrêa, complains that when she addresses her 23-year-old daughter in Talian, \"she only replies in Portuguese.\"\n\nThe dialects have survived other threats. Getúlio Vargas, Brazil's president when it entered the second world war on the allies' side, banned all foreign languages, the most common of which were German and Italian. \"Many people went to jail,\" says Paulo Massolini, a doctor who heads the Federation of Italian-Brazilian Associations of Rio Grande do Sul. These days, Talian speakers are pilloried rather than prosecuted. Some have trouble pronouncing nasal diphthongal sounds in Portuguese words such as pão (bread).\n\nAlthough Talian and the other dialects are hybrids, their defenders fear that the Portuguese influence is becoming dominant. In the 1950s a fatigued Talian speaker would have called himself stanco; today, he is likely to say he is cansado -- tired in Portuguese -- says Dr Massolini. In Hunsrückisch, schuhloja -- shoe shop -- is reassuringly a hybrid of the German for shoe with the Portuguese for shop. But an aeroplane is simply an aviong, from the Portuguese avião rather than the German Flugzeug.\n\nTalian has an energetic lobbying campaign behind it, which may improve its chances of survival. Known formerly as \"Venetian-Brazilian\", Dr Massolini and other campaigners coined the new name in 1995. It comes from Venetians' habit of dropping the first and last vowel sounds of some words. Talian champions published a grammar. Dictionaries and teach-yourself books followed. In 2009 Serafina Corrêa's municipal council ordered that official documents be printed in Talian as well as Portuguese, and in 2014 Brazil's ministry of culture recognised it as part of the country's cultural heritage. Mr Massolini is pressing UNESCO to recognise it.\n\nSpeakers of less favoured dialects are resentful and envious. Talian speakers in Serafina Corrêa \"act as if their variant is the correct one\", complains Giorgia Miazzo, a linguist who has recorded speakers of Italian dialects across Brazil. (They have 15 different ways of saying \"yellow\", she found. In Talian, it's gialdo.) Cléo Altenhofen, a linguist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, laments that Hunsrückisch, spoken by some 1.2m descendants of immigrants from Rhineland-Palatinate, lacks Talian's celebrity. \"They have dictionaries, and we have a research project,\" he says wistfully.\n\nHe and his colleagues are mapping the regions in which Hunsrückisch is spoken and have amassed 800 hours of audio recordings. \"It's the first step in getting it formally recognised,\" he says. He dreams of opening a museum of linguistic diversity.\n\nBut museums and dictionaries are feeble defence against globalisation and urbanisation. The best way of keeping the dialects alive would be to use them as a medium of instruction in public schools. But the national government sets the curriculum, so that is unlikely to happen. Parents are a poor substitute for teachers. \"The more you make kids speak a language the more they rebel,\" says Mr Altenhofen. His 16-year-old daughter is learning Japanese. She wants to study Korean next.",

                "title": "El Salvador's rising political star",
                "body": "SOME voters sketched, scratched and scribbled on their ballots. The cleverest crossed out letters from the voting instructions to form dirty words. Photos of their handiwork appeared on Twitter on March 4th as Salvadoreans voted in municipal and legislative elections. One in ten voters defaced their ballots or left them blank. In a country where voting is obligatory, a record 58% stayed at home.\n\nThe right-wing opposition party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), had a clear lead in valid votes. It won nine out of 14 major mayorships, including San Salvador, the national capital, and 37 of 84 seats in the national assembly. Arena's chairman said its success was a prelude to victory in next year's presidential election.\n\nIn fact, the election was a repudiation of the main parties, both of which are tainted by corruption. The real winner was a politician who was not running, belongs to no party and encouraged voters to spoil their ballots: Nayib Bukele, the outgoing mayor of San Salvador. He is now the front-runner for the presidency.\n\nThe Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) of President Salvador Sánchez Cerén saw its worst defeat since it ceased being a guerrilla army a quarter-century ago. It won just two mayorships of big cities and 23 seats in congress, eight fewer than before. On election night a drum kit sat unused on a stage outside FMLN headquarters while speakers blared lyrics made ironic by the day's events: \"I know it's too late to beg forgiveness.\"\n\nThe FMLN first won power in 2009, promising economic reform, social change and less violence. It has failed to deliver. Under Mauricio Funes and then Mr Sánchez Cerén, GDP growth has averaged less than 2% a year, poverty has risen and El Salvador became the most murderous country in the world. Mr Funes has been in Nicaragua since 2016, when prosecutors started investigating him on suspicion of illegally enriching himself while he was president. Mr Sánchez Cerén barely appears in public. There are rumours he is ill.\n\nArena has its own corrupt politicians. Mr Funes's predecessor, Tony Saca, is awaiting trial for funnelling hundreds of millions of government dollars into his bank accounts. Most of the 13 legislators being investigated for corruption are or were from Arena. Eleven ran for re-election; all of them won.\n\nSo did Arena's candidate to be mayor of San Salvador, Ernesto Muyshondt. A member of the MS-13 street gang has testified that he paid $69,000 to the outfit in exchange for votes in the presidential election in 2014, when he was Arena's vice-chairman. The gang has family and other ties to about a tenth of the population.\n\nMr Muyshondt's victory was no triumph for Arena. He won with fewer votes than the party's losing mayoral candidate got in 2015. The party lost votes in the legislative election, too. It won only because voters were even more disgusted with the left than with the right. None of the smaller parties, which are also plagued by scandals, won more votes than the number of blank and spoiled ballots.\n\nThe only politician who had cause to cheer the high rate of abstention was Mr Bukele. Some voters spoilt their ballots by scrawling on them, \"Nayib 2019\". A slick 36-year-old businessman, Mr Bukele has enthralled the capital's voters with projects to revitalise poor neighbourhoods, progressive stances on social issues such as gay marriage and shrewd use of social media. The FMLN kicked him out in October (supposedly for \"verbal aggression\" against a city employee, but probably because rivals wanted him out of the way). He formed the New Ideas Movement. Since it was not yet a party, the group put forward no candidates in the elections.\n\nMr Bukele aims to become the first president in three decades who belongs to neither of the main parties. On the day after the elections he posted a video on Facebook in which he criticised pundits who declared Arena the winner. \"They're analysing the scoreboard of a game that the population is no longer playing,\" he said. Three days later, the video had 1.5m views. If the presidential election were held tomorrow, polls suggest, Mr Bukele would win easily.",

                "title": "The bumpy road ahead of Sebastián Piñera",
                "body": "THE second presidency of Sebastián Piñera, a billionaire businessman turned politician, will begin on March 11th in seemingly auspicious circumstances. Mr Piñera won a resounding victory in a run-off election in December, with 55% of the vote. Chile's economy is growing at its fastest rate for two years and the price of copper, its main export, is rising. The 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal from which Donald Trump opted out, is due to be signed in Santiago on March 8th. And a Chilean film has just won an Oscar.\n\nYet the sunny appearance may deceive. Mr Piñera, who was a successful but unpopular president of the centre-right in 2010-14, must deal with the conflicting pressures of restoring rapid economic growth by boosting private investment while trying to meet the demands of a society undergoing far-reaching change.\n\nFor two decades after the end of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship in 1990, Chile offered a successful model of an open, free-market economy and gradual social reform under centre-left governments. Chileans became less poor, and millions of people went to university for the first time. Mr Piñera continued this approach. The economy boomed on his watch. But faced with a powerful student movement angry over the cost of higher education, he struggled politically.\n\nHis successor (and predecessor), Michelle Bachelet, swung to the left, adopting the students' demands. When one of her allies promised to take a retroexcavadora (the graphic Spanish word for a backhoe loader) to Pinochet's \"neoliberal model\" under which many public services are privately provided, she did not contradict him. Ms Bachelet pushed through reforms of tax, education and labour, all aimed at making society less unequal. To achieve this, she abandoned the consensual approach of her predecessors. However laudable her intentions, many of her reforms were polarising, technically flawed and unpopular.\n\nBusiness took fright. Investment has fallen for the past five years. The economy averaged growth of just 1.8% a year under Ms Bachelet, compared with 5.3% under Mr Piñera. Her people blame low copper prices; her critics blame her reforms. It was Mr Piñera's economic record, and fear that Ms Bachelet's candidate would tack even further left, that brought him victory.\n\nHis main aim is to restore economic growth to 3.5-4% a year, the most the economy can now manage, says Felipe Larraín, who will be finance minister (as he was in 2010-14). A key measure will be improving Ms Bachelet's hugely complicated tax reform and gradually cutting the corporate income-tax rate from 27%, among the highest in Latin America.\n\n\"We want to build on what we have,\" says Mr Larraín. \"There will be no retroexcavadora.\" The new president could not demolish Ms Bachelet's legacy if he wanted to. Unlike her, he will lack a majority in congress and will have to woo the Christian Democrats, centrists who belonged to Ms Bachelet's coalition.\n\nShe promised universal free higher education and banned top-up fees and profits in privately run but publicly financed schools. Mr Piñera is likely to tweak rather than scrap these changes. Free higher education would cost 3% of GDP. \"We don't have that money, we're not Norway,\" says Mr Larraín, who inherits a much weaker fiscal situation than he left. The new government will focus on making most technical education free and allowing limited top-up fees and selection in schools. It also promises to put more public money into health care and the privately managed pension system.\n\nChile needs better schooling and worker training to raise productivity, diversify the economy and reduce inequality. The question facing Mr Piñera is whether he can sell his policies politically. Chile's success has made the country harder to govern. The student movement has waned, but not much. Unions were empowered by Ms Bachelet's labour reform. Her electoral reform has made congress more proportional, but weakened the stable two-coalition system of post-1990 politics. A new far-left group, akin to Spain's Podemos, won 20 of the 155 seats in the lower house of congress.\n\nIn his first government Mr Piñera often seemed to Chileans more the businessman -- arrogant, impatient, unempathetic -- who understood investors than the politician who cared about ordinary people. One source close to him insists he has mellowed. Some of his cabinet appointments look odd. He has placed Alfredo Moreno, a fellow tycoon, in charge of the social-development ministry, for example. But his team includes a core of experienced politicians. He will need them.",

                "title": "The triumph of America's companies",
                "body": "THE Citizens United ruling in 2010 was one of the most controversial in the history of America's Supreme Court. The judges affirmed that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend their money to influence elections; the decision seemed to extinguish any hope of serious campaign-finance reform. As Adam Winkler's fascinating book recounts, this was only the latest in a long line of corporate legal victories.\n\nThe rights of corporations were not debated in the state conventions that ratified the constitution, nor were companies mentioned in the Federalist Papers, the essays largely written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. But corporations have repeatedly been able to exploit laws meant to benefit others. In 1819 a landmark Supreme Court decision regarding Dartmouth College limited the rights of states to interfere in businesses set up by charter; private contracts, it held, should be sacrosanct. That was followed by a jump in the creation of chartered corporations. They were viewed with suspicion by Andrew Jackson, the populist president, who thought they took rights away from the people and gave them to a few.\n\nIn 1882 Roscoe Conkling, one of the drafters of the 14th Amendment -- designed to give equal citizenship to freed slaves -- persuaded the Supreme Court that it had also meant to protect companies. He misrepresented the contents of a journal to help clinch the argument. Sure enough, between 1868 (when the amendment was adopted) and 1912, the justices decided 28 cases asserting the rights of African-Americans, almost all of which were lost. They decided 312 cases on the rights of companies, which succeeded in striking down minimum-wage and child-labour laws. \"For most of American history,\" Mr Winkler remarks, \"the Supreme Court failed to protect the dispossessed and the marginalised, with the justices claiming to be powerless in the face of hostile public sentiment.\" By contrast \"the court has insisted that broad public sentiment favouring business regulation must bend to the demands of the constitution.\"\n\nOne tricky issue has recurred. Are companies citizens in the same sense as individuals? Or are they different entities with different rights and responsibilities? The Citizens United case was much criticised by Democrats for treating companies as people. But the politics of corporate personhood are complex. For much of American history, left-leaning activists argued in favour of it.\n\nFor example, in the 1930s the case of Grosjean v American Press Company involved Huey Long, the governor of Louisiana, who wanted to tax awkward newspapers. The Supreme Court said that \"A corporation is a 'person' within the meaning of the equal-protection and due-process clauses.\" It was the first time the Court had decreed that corporations had the right to freedom of speech under the constitution. Later extensions of corporate free-speech rights flowed from left-wing initiatives, too. In the 1970s a consumer-rights group linked to Ralph Nader tried to tackle the cost of prescription medicines. Pharmacists were forbidden from advertising their prices, making it difficult for patients to shop around. Mr Nader's lawyers argued for the rights of customers to hear what the pharmacists had to say.\n\nA focus on the rights of the listener, not the speaker, was at the heart of the Citizens United case. Nevertheless, commentators were right to see it as a striking victory for corporate rights. It was followed, in 2014, by the Hobby Lobby case, which gave the company an exemption from a federal rule requiring large employers to include birth control in their employees' health plans. This established that businesses enjoyed religious freedom.\n\nCritics such as Leo Strine, chief justice of Delaware's Supreme Court, have pointed out that, in aggregate, court rulings on corporate rights do not make sense. Companies are obliged to prioritise the profits they make for shareholders, rather than seeking to benefit employees or the wider community; that sits oddly with the notion that businesses also have political and religious freedom. The owners of Hobby Lobby affirm that their religious beliefs cannot be separated from the ethos of the business. But they might well insist on a strict boundary between themselves and the firm were a customer to fall in a store and sue them personally for damages.\n\nMr Winkler shows admirable command of detail in tackling a topic that ought to be at the heart of political debate.

                "body": "AT THE emergency foster home, they call the children \"shoots\". The word invokes growth and greenness, but it has a different meaning in the 21st-century Florida of Jennifer Clement's \"Gun Love\". \"We call you children shoots because your parents were shot,\" a social worker tells 14-year-old Pearl France, the narrator.\n\nPearl grew up in a trailer park, and not even in a trailer: she lived in a battered Mercury, its tyres flat, the boot full of heirlooms that Margot, her mother, purloined when she fled home as a pregnant teenager. Margot dies halfway through the novel, but her fate is foreshadowed from the first pages. \"In our part of Florida things were always being gifted a bullet just for the sake of it,\" Pearl says.\n\nIt would be tempting to call Ms Clement's book timely, were gun violence not so pervasive in America, where on average 19 children are shot every day. Pearl lives in a world so saturated with guns that the only question is when, not if, the trigger will be pulled. After her mother's death she settles into the foster home, but her life there, though happier and more stable, is haunted by the past -- in particular by Margot's connection to Eli, a sinister lover who was part of a gun-running ring. \"My mother was a cup of sugar,\" Pearl says in the opening lines. \"You could borrow her anytime.\"\n\nMargot, a rich girl gone bad, is perfect prey for a man like Eli. Too perfect, perhaps: her character suffers another kind of danger, that of veering into stereotype, as does Corazón, her tough yet sentimental Mexican trailer-park neighbour. The ending is predictable. But \"Gun Love\" is lifted by its language, as in this simple, shocking incantation of the smuggled weaponry loaded onto a bus:\n\nIn the belly of the Greyhound bus there was a Smith & Wesson M&P assault rifle, DPMS Panther Arms assault rifle, Smith & Wesson handgun, Llama handgun, Glock pistol, Smith & Wesson pistol, Taurus pistol, Del-Ton assault rifle, .40-calibre semiautomatic pistol, .45-calibre Glock, Beretta pistol, Smith & Wesson semiautomatic pistol, Remington shotgun, Bushmaster XM-15 rifle, .22-calibre Savage Mark II rifle, Springfield Armory semiautomatic handgun, Smith & Wesson semiautomatic rifle, Remington shotgun, Glock .40-calibre semiautomatic pistol, FN Herstal pistol, Beretta 92 FS 9mm pistol, and a Beretta PX4 Storm pistol.\n\nWith this hammering list, Ms Clement creates a weird poetry of murderous force. Chekhov's narrative principle -- that a gun hung on the wall in the first act must eventually go off -- has become a metaphorical rule of storytelling. To reflect American reality, Ms Clement puts a gun on every wall in every room.",

                "body": "Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein's Broadway Revolution. By Todd Purdum. Henry Holt; 400 pages; $32. To be published in Britain in May; £25.\n\nAT THE age of 46 Oscar Hammerstein was living as a country squire on his Pennsylvania farm, apparently washed up. It was 14 years since he had written his last hit, \"Show Boat\", a landmark musical in its embrace of a gritty subject, race. Meanwhile Richard Rodgers remained, at 39, one of Broadway's marquee composers; but he was contemplating a future without Lorenz Hart, a lyricist and his long-standing collaborator, who had become a shiftless alcoholic. The stage was set for one of the grandest second acts in entertainment history. From 1941 until Hammerstein's death in 1960 his partnership with Rodgers yielded an anthology of musical theatre's greatest hits: \"Oklahoma!\", \"Carousel\", \"South Pacific\", \"The King and I\" and \"The Sound of Music\".\n\nThese days the duo's popularity is sometimes held against them, as if they were merely purveyors of mawkish schlock. \"Something Wonderful\", Todd Purdum's skilful dual biography, strips away the accretions of time and reputation to retrieve the craft and dynamism with which his subjects created a new kind of musical. He contends that their early work, in particular, should be considered an antecedent of today's edgier, more subversive Broadway fare, as fresh in its time as \"Hamilton\" seems now.\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein were unlikely revolutionaries. They resembled a \"couple of chiropractors\", according to Groucho Marx. Far from being agitprop provocateurs, their ingenuity was driven strictly by the artistic need to resolve dramatic problems. In the play from which \"Oklahoma!\" was sourced, for example, \"nothing much happens,\" writes Mr Purdum. From this predicament they conjured a mould-breaking musical, the first to combine dance and drama, while ditching the prefatory all-cast chorus that was customary, and grappling with naturalistic issues and characters.\n\nTheir previous, separate output had introduced these elements individually, but they had never been integrated. The effect was to impart a new, all-singing, all-dancing dramatic coherence to the form. Mr Purdum captures the flexibility of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most beloved numbers. Songs such as \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" soared over Broadway's footlights, taking on a life of their own as free-floating anthems. Yet, in context, they accomplished the more earthbound dramaturgical task of nimbly developing character or advancing plot without turgid exposition.\n\nFor all the unabashed sentimentality of their lyrics, they were hard-nosed about their work behind the scenes. The most thrilling sections of \"Something Wonderful\" pull back the curtain on the \"surgery\" Rodgers and Hammerstein performed on their musicals during pre-Broadway \"try-outs\" in New Haven and Boston. Mr Purdum recounts the clinical dispassion with which the pair picked apart their scripts on the basis of audience reception, ruthlessly culling scenes and songs. \"Now I see why these people have hits,\" remarked John Fearnley, a stage manager, after watching one of these sessions. \"I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life.\"\n\nThey emerge as eminently practical innovators, professional artists toiling in a commercial medium to serve what Hammerstein described as \"A big black giant/Who looks and listens/With thousands of eyes and ears/A big black mass/Of love and pity/And troubles and hopes and fears\": in other words, the punters. In one telling anecdote, Richard Halliday, husband of Mary Martin -- the original leading lady in \"The Sound of Music\" -- suggested she snag \"her bloomers on the tree in her opening number\". \"All you care about is the show!\" he groused when his idea was dismissed. True, Mr Purdum concludes.",

                "body": "FROM Siberian banishment to the Soviet gulag, the cruelty of punishments under Russia's tyrants has yielded a commensurately rich literature. It is unlikely, though, that any previous story has likened interrogation by Stalin's secret police to a game of cricket, as a character does in \"The Devils' Dance\", a beguiling novel of sinister enchantments and mind-stretching affinities.\n\n\"One man in, another man out,\" thinks the imprisoned Uzbek writer Abdulla Qodiriy -- a real historical figure -- as his cell-mates in Tashkent in 1938 are dragged away to face trumped-up charges. Just like cricket, he reflects, a sport his companion Muborak, a well-travelled Uzbek Jew, has told him about.\n\nAs he sits in jail ahead of his betrayal, torture and probable execution, Qodiriy recomposes in his mind the historical novel he was writing at the time of his arrest. It deals with the bloody rivalries of the early 19th century between the Emirs of Bukhara and the Khans of Kokand. He shares these tall but largely true tales with fellow inmates. He also reimagines the lives of the Uzbek women poets -- trophy wives who transformed their harem confinement into mystical art. He depicts, sometimes comically, the intrusion of British and Russian spies, engaged in their own \"Great Game\", into this courtly but cruel society.\n\nLike his hero's fables, Hamid Ismailov, an exiled Uzbek dissident and journalist with the BBC World Service, turns this double plot into \"a fairy story, adapted for ordinary men's minds\". Both strands -- the purge of the 1930s, the imperial manoeuvres of a century before -- draw on actual events and characters, such as the now-revered Qodiriy and the English adventurers Stoddart and Conolly. The two eras converge in the muse-like figure of Oyxon, a shackled royal consort and poet of genius. Her \"endless misfortunes\" become \"a reflection of the nation\".\n\nUzbek fiction is unknown to most English-language readers. Translating Mr Ismailov's tapestry of history and legend, Donald Rayfield captures the \"joy of life\" as sung by Uzbek women in their \"gilded cage\", as well as the terror spread down the generations by khans and commissars, those \"lords of the lie\".",

                "title": "The making of a Shakespearean actor",
                "body": "ON A Saturday afternoon in February, a month before \"Macbeth\" was to open at the National Theatre in London, its artistic director, Rufus Norris, rehearsed alone with Rory Kinnear. Dressed in jeans and trainers, Mr Kinnear heaved a battlement across the studio. On Mr Norris's cue, he became the thane, hand clutched to his pate in anguish, eyes aglow.\n\nThe session's aim, said Mr Norris, was to find an approach to Shakespeare's soliloquys that fitted the Olivier Theatre, the National's biggest. For all the brawling and sorcery, at the play's heart are the lulls in which Macbeth mulls the witches' prophecies and the crimes they incite; in which he decides what kind of man he will be. These are intimate scenes, and finessing their gestures and tempo was intimate work, like a clinch between prizefighter and trainer. \"It's less literal,\" Mr Norris said of the dagger that Macbeth hallucinates before killing Duncan, the old king. Grab higher, he told his star.\n\nIt helped that Mr Kinnear was well-acquainted with the Olivier's stage. As Hamlet in 2010 he smoked a cigarette on it during \"To be or not to be\". In 2013 his Iago filled the theatre with his resentments. The finest Shakespearean actors are more than entertainers: they are standard-bearers of a national identity and culture, and indeed of culture in general. Mr Kinnear's preparations and career offer an insight into the demands of that specialised, storied craft.\n\n\"Macbeth does murder sleep,\" a line delivered soon after the regicide, turns out to be true in more than the obvious, conscience-stricken sense. With every play, said Mr Kinnear a few days later, \"you try to delay the point when your entire life is consumed by it.\" Now, he conceded, \"it's time to give in.\" Anne-Marie Duff, his Lady Macbeth, describes him as \"fantastically playful\" and \"dangerously funny\". He is also single-minded, driven by an inkling that \"there's still more to discover, there's something I'm missing\" in the part.\n\nThe future in the instant\n\nIf dedication is one requirement, Mr Kinnear's performance in \"Othello\" showcased another talent expected by modern audiences: the ability to make plausible human beings of 400-year-old characters. Often Iago is a cartoon of evil; his was propelled by a class grudge and as recognisable as a neighbour. \"That version of Iago was Rory's from top to bottom,\" says Adrian Lester, who played the Moor. In \"Measure for Measure\" at the Almeida Theatre, also in 2010, Mr Kinnear's Angelo -- sometimes a monstrous prig -- was a man tragically outmatched by his own feelings. Gimmickry and special effects are the obvious way to make Shakespeare feel contemporary. This kind of psychology is harder and more effective.\n\n\"What is it about these people who are drawn to the top of the pyramid?\" Mr Kinnear asked of the Macbeths in a break between rehearsals. In his reading, post-traumatic stress contributes to their cruelty. \"The things he must have seen,\" he said of all the bloodletting; \"the things he's been required to do.\" Macbeth, he noted, always has somebody to blame, fate or the witches or his wife. And yet, Mr Kinnear said, breaking into a soliloquy, atrocity \"brings out something utterly gorgeous in him\". Shakespeare is \"always seducing the audience to the dark side\"; in Macbeth's case, \"it's the blackest desire within him that summons up the greatest poetry.\"\n\nThe poetry is Shakespeare's biggest challenge, both to actors and to audiences. Hammy magniloquence risks alienating viewers, not just for an evening but for life, as does obscurity. As Tiffany Stern, of the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham, says, great verse-speaking -- honouring both the sense and the music -- is a skill that other kinds of acting do not involve. One venerable shortcut, dating at least to David Garrick in the 18th century, has been to ditch tricky passages.\n\nMr Kinnear's goal is to make the iambic pentameter seem as vernacular as artificial. \"He can speak Shakespeare as if it's his first language,\" says Nick Hytner, who directed \"Hamlet\" and \"Othello\". Usefully, Mr Kinnear saw lots of Shakespeare as a child. His mother is an actor, as was his well-known father Roy, who died after a film-set accident when his son was ten -- too early to see Rory's schoolboy appearance in \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", the moment he thought \"maybe this is my thing.\"\n\nWith these cerebral abilities, says Ms Stern, Shakespearean actors need a \"physical litheness and grace\", as Laurence Olivier epitomised. The plays, after all, were \"written for whole-body acting,\" not \"a twitching eyebrow and bobbing Adam's apple\". Mr Kinnear (now 40) has some of that mime-artist's ranginess. His slouch said as much about his Iago as his lines.\n\nThis physicality is a bigger asset in the theatre than on camera, with its capacity for close-ups. Tellingly, perhaps, though Mr Kinnear has featured in television dramas and as a spy chief in recent James Bond films, he is most recognised for his stage acting, and is fervent about it. Theatre is an expensive and risky art-form; it can seem clunky, even moribund, in a world of digital entertainment. But, he said, nothing else elicits \"the exchange of energy that you get at live performance\", a connection even more valuable in an automated age. Screens can never match the electric sense that \"no one else gets to see what you see.\"\n\nCiting some of the practitioners he reveres -- Anthony Hopkins, Albert Finney, Michael Gambon -- he added an abstract quality to the job description, a mysterious amalgam of ethics and charisma. A role \"is just a prism\" that \"reveals who you are as a person\", he argued. \"You become drawn to actors' souls.\"\n\nThe last syllable\n\n\"Macbeth\" opened this month, one of several current productions of the play in Britain. Its timeliness is glaring. In the story, the wrong people are in charge. The same attributes that propel them to power leave them wholly unsuited to wielding it. Macbeth's misdeeds make him paranoid. \"To be thus is nothing,\" he says bitterly of the status he once coveted. \"But to be safely thus...\" Yet he misses the real threats against him, blundering to his doom as accusations of treason proliferate. \"There's not a second where he shows any enjoyment in being king,\" Mr Kinnear observed.\n\nA new stiffness in his gait projects this tension on stage. Between the combat and decapitations, Macbeth's horrified shaking, his cowering in the face of Banquo's ghost and cradling of his wife's corpse, Mr Kinnear's is an all-action turn. But its strength lies in quieter gestures -- a rub of the head, an anxious stroke of the ear. His body relaxes again only when he arms for his last fight, like an embattled politician rediscovering his mojo at a rally.\n\nJust as his Hamlet was a familiar (if hyper-intelligent) depressive, his Iago an improvising punk, his Macbeth is a simple soldier in a brutish world, carried away by the logic of ambition. His tone is as demotic as his verse is precise. \"It was a rough night,\" he says after stabbing Duncan, like a man recovering from an all-night party.\n\nIn the scene that precedes the murder he reaches high for the spectral weapon, as Mr Norris had urged. His hand thrashes the air, but as he asks the famous question -- \"Is this a dagger which I see before me?\" -- he smiles as if greeting an old friend.",

                "body": "The People vs Democracy: Why Our Freedom is in Danger and How to Save It. By Yascha Mounk. Harvard University Press; 393 pages; $29.95 and £17.99.\n\nDEMOCRACY is going through its worst crisis since the 1930s. The number of countries that can plausibly be described as democracies is shrinking. Strongmen are in power in several countries that once looked as if they were democratising, notably Russia, Turkey and Egypt. The United States -- the engine room of democratisation for most of the post-war period -- has a president who taunted his opponent with chants of \"lock her up\" and refused to say if he would accept the result of the election if it went against him.\n\nBut what exactly is the nature of this crisis? And what is driving it? Yascha Mounk's \"The People vs Democracy\" stands out in a crowded field for the quality of its answers to these questions. Mr Mounk provides an admirable mixture of academic expertise and political sense. He teaches at Harvard University, where he has busied himself collecting opinion-poll data, but he grew up in pre-1989 West Germany, where the distinction between real and pretend democracy was more than just academic. He also takes the trouble to unpick terms that too many commentators on this subject take for granted.\n\nMr Mounk argues that there are two sides to liberal democracy. One focuses on the first half of the equation: protecting individuals from the tyranny of the majority through checks and balances and enumerated rights. The second focuses on the other half: handing power to the people. For most of the post-war period these two versions of liberal democracy went together like apple and pie.\n\nToday, though, the popular will is increasingly coming into conflict with individual rights. Liberal elites are willing to exclude the people from important decisions, most notably about immigration in the case of the European Union, in the name of \"rights\"; meanwhile populists are willing to dispense with constitutional niceties in the name of \"the people\". Politics is defined by a growing battle between illiberal democracy, or democracy without rights, on the one hand, and undemocratic liberalism, or rights without democracy, on the other.\n\nThe most obvious reason why liberal democracy is splitting into its component parts lies in slow economic growth. From 1960 to 1985 the income of the typical American household doubled. From 1985 it remained flat while a tiny minority of Americans saw their incomes surge. Liberal elites tend to explain this divergence in terms of the laws of globalisation. Populists have a darker interpretation: that those elites are using a mix of lobbying power, personal connections and technocratic expertise to rig the system to their own advantage -- most notoriously by bailing out the banks with taxpayers' money.\n\nMr Mounk points to several other developments that help explain the divide. The social-media revolution is transferring power from traditional media gatekeepers to laptop warriors. As well as enabling malign people to spread fake news, as many have pointed out, this revolution is also making it easier for outsiders to draw attention to self-dealing. The increasing diversity of Western societies, driven partly by immigration and partly by the idea that different groups should celebrate their differences rather than adopting dominant mores, is politicising the question of racial identities, with potentially explosive consequences. Political entrepreneurs are upending politics by taking over old parties, like Donald Trump, or creating new parties, like Italy's Beppe Grillo, exploiting pent-up resentment of the old elites and using the new media to get their message across, raw and unfiltered.\n\nMr Mounk is far less convincing on the question of what to do about this dismal situation. He makes some valiant suggestions. He argues that technocratic elites need to moderate their ambitions. The more they try to protect important areas of decision-making, not least immigration, from the will of the people, the more they will create festering resentment. He urges policymakers to focus on domesticating nationalism rather than attempting to sideline it as an anachronistic relic. He makes a good case for devoting more effort to turning children into citizens through civic education. Here he is admirably sharp with his fellow academics who are so bent on presenting Western civilisation as a history of oppression that they risk undermining any residual faith that their students might have in democracy.\n\nYet he spends too little time grappling with the nuances of these ideas -- for example how you persuade a technocratic European elite to listen to the voices of the people when all the bureaucratic incentives are to ignore them. And he throws in too many banal bromides about \"fixing the economy\", as if there were no difficult trade-offs between, say, raising productivity levels and destroying stable jobs. It is as if Mr Mounk's publishers asked him to provide a Hollywood-style happy ending, after all the blood and gore, and he has simply gone through the motions without any real conviction.\n\n\"The People vs Democracy\" is a chastening read for all sorts of reasons. It provides lots of evidence to suggest that the battle between illiberal democracy and liberal elitism will only become more intense. It demonstrates that those harbingers of openness, young people, are in fact much more sceptical about democracy than are their seniors. But the biggest reason for its chilling effect is unwitting: the prescriptions for saving democracy are so much feebler than the explanation of why it is in danger.",

                "body": "\"RED SPARROW\", a new thriller featuring Jennifer Lawrence as a Russian spy, is not entirely a paint-by-numbers film. Its hero is a woman. A few of its twists are genuinely surprising. But in one way, it is Hollywood to the core. Its Russian characters display their Russianness by speaking accented English to each other. Ms Lawrence hardly bothers with anything much beyond a general eastern European; only the occasional throaty l sounds at all Russian. And just one line of real dialogue is in Russian: another spy complains about a drunken American woman he and Ms Lawrence's character are cultivating, saying that if he has to spend another minute with her he will shoot her in the face. The accents might give the viewer the same feeling.\n\nHollywood's attention to the detail of foreign settings, from clothing to sets, has advanced beyond the old lazy stereotypes of years past. But in things linguistic, the situation is patchy. \"Red Sparrow\" hardly improves on \"The Hunt for Red October\", released in 1990, in which Sean Connery mumbles a few lines in Russian, then speaks with a modest, generically foreign twinge to his Scottish burr.\n\nThe other classic option seems to be to give a British accent to every character in a foreign clime -- especially the villains -- whether the locale is ancient Rome or the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros in \"Game of Thrones\". It is a rare movie in which an actor successfully masters not only a foreign accent, but foreign-language dialogue. The impressively multilingual Viggo Mortensen puts Ms Lawrence and Mr Connery to shame with his fluid Russian in \"Eastern Promises\" (2007).\n\nA few recent films have tried to make the creative difficulty of a foreign-language setting a feature rather than a bug. One example is \"Black Panther\". For most of the movie, African-American actors speak English with a kind of pan-African accent, which does not, in fact, exist; Africa is home to around 2,000 languages. But the film-makers also took the unusual step of making a real language -- Xhosa, which was Nelson Mandela's mother tongue -- stand in for the fictional \"Wakandan\". Ignoring the potential charge of cultural appropriation -- borrowing a real-world culture for an American popcorn film -- the use of Xhosa did at least give a suitably foreign flair to the setting. Sadly, it did little more than that; its scattered use and the random switches to English did nothing to advance the plot or flesh out the characters.\n\nThe award for most audacious use of language in a recent film has to go to \"Arrival\", in which aliens land on Earth and stay put in their ships without explanation. A linguist is sent to discern their intentions; she deciphers their visual language in scenes that rely on the expertise of actual working linguists, many of whom were pleased to see some of their ideas make it to the big screen. The film's crux draws on a theory of language and the mind -- that learning a new language \"rewires\" the brain and its processes -- taking that premise to such an extreme that the viewer is in no doubt about being in a land of science fiction. Still, the story took the question of language seriously.\n\nWhy can't more film-makers simply work language into their plot in a realistic way that will let viewers recognise the world they live in? \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009) is set in second-world-war Germany and France. Several multilingual characters, including the marvellous Christoph Waltz, alternate languages in the service of crucial plot points. Michael Fassbender speaks fluent German (his real-life father is German). His character, an English spy in Germany, makes a fatal mistake not with his spoken German but with a hand gesture that crucially differs between the two countries. All through the film, the viewer has to ask why the characters are choosing the language they employ at any given time. It is as though language is a character itself.\n\nMany non-American films integrate language-switching much more naturally, as the process is a routine part of many people's daily lives. It seems that Hollywood has simply not developed the confidence that its viewers are willing to tolerate such disjunctures. The assumption is that they want foreign climes, but familiar faces and sounds. Yet successes such as \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"Arrival\" prove that Anglophone viewers aren't necessarily turned off by subtitles if there is a reason for them. Hollywood is leading more films with non-white actors and women. Why not put the world's languages in the spotlight too?",

                "title": "The real resonances, and warnings, of Weimar Germany",
                "body": "Berlin Alexanderplatz. By Alfred Döblin. Translated by Michael Hofmann. NYRB Classics; 480 pages; $18.95. Penguin Classics; £14.99.\n\nEARLY in \"Babylon Berlin\", a lavish new television series, Gereon Rath, a police detective from Cologne, is sent to the German capital in 1929 to investigate a mafia pornography ring. Extremists have taken to the streets. The parallels between then and now are glaring. Moka Efti, the meticulously recreated nightclub where much of the action plays out, stands for louche contemporary society. As a review in the Times put it, \"for the National Socialists, read Alternative for Germany\" (AfD), the insurgent far-right party; \"for the League of Nations, the European Union\"; and for the Weimar Republic, modern Germany.\n\nWeimar is a popular reference point these days, in Germany and beyond. A retrospective on its cinema was a highlight of last month's Berlinale, the capital's international film festival. An exhibition on its art has just closed at the Schirn Kunsthalle museum in Frankfurt. It has sometimes been deployed as an analogy to the sinister glitz of Moscow under Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile Glenn Beck, an American TV host, last month posited that his polarised country was in \"probably 1926, 1928 -- Weimar Republic\".\n\nThe notion of Weimar implied by these comparisons stars Marlene Dietrich and features jackboots and sequins. A very different perspective on the era is offered by Alfred Döblin's \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\", the classic Weimar novel. Its version is at once more accurate and more ominous.\n\nLike \"Babylon Berlin\", Döblin's story concerns a lone outsider. Released from prison after serving time for a woman's murder, Franz Biberkopf negotiates the temptations and dangers of Berlin in 1928. Much of the novel comes in a stream-of-consciousness style known as erlebte Rede, a cinematic barrage of impressions and thoughts recalled without explanation or differentiation. It was long branded untranslatable, a view reinforced by a turgid rendering published in 1931. Yet a fluent, pacy new translation by Michael Hofmann gainsays that assumption, opening up the book for English-speakers.\n\nAnd with it the city. Seen through Biberkopf's eyes, the heart of Berlin is Alexanderplatz itself. Then as now, the square in the capital's proletarian east was associated with transience, both architectural (it was endlessly being rebuilt) and human (it was a place of prostitutes, criminals and ne'er-do-wells). The glamorous metropolis of popular imagination, with its decadence and excess, is glimpsed in political street fights and nightclub adverts, but is not Döblin's main concern. He was a doctor, whose surgery lay just to the east of the square he knew well, and he concentrates on the city's flickering mundanity:\n\n'Mokka-fix' on Alexanderstrasse, nonpareil cigars, cultured beers in mugs and glasses, card games forbidden, guests are responsible for their own coats, I'm not taking the rap. Signed, the Landlord. Breakfast from 6am to 1pm, 75 pfennigs, one cup of coffee...\n\nSuch was the lot of Biberkopf, a resentful, anonymous working-class citizen of Weimar who is trying to be \"respectable\". Think of him as one of the blurred faces in a crowd scene by George Grosz, an expressionist painter of the time (see picture); as an extra in \"Babylon Berlin\"; as an alter ego of Fräulein Schroder, the grumpy landlady in Christopher Isherwood's \"The Berlin Stories\", a collection that inspired the musical \"Cabaret\". Döblin's novel was published two weeks before the Wall Street Crash and a few years before Adolf Hitler came to power. In the view of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, whose film adaptation appeared in 1980, Biberkopf would probably have voted for the Nazis.\n\n\"Berlin Alexanderplatz\" therefore offers an invaluable insight into Weimar Germany, through the eyes of a writer intimately acquainted with its people, but who did not know precisely what was to come. In some ways this view is reassuring, for the Germany he depicts looks nothing like wealthy societies now.\n\nIt is poor -- far poorer than Western countries today and than many at the time. Ordinary folk in the novel scrape about to avoid destitution. Its heaving crowds were young. The average age was 32, whereas in modern Germany it is over 47. Above all, it is violent. Biberkopf is beaten up and beats others up. He loses his arm in a car crash and responds stoically. \"It won't make my arm grow back,\" he says of a mooted revenge, \"and I've got no beef with my arm being gone neither. It had to go, there's no sense in yapping about it.\" As David Runciman of Cambridge University has noted, \"the collapse of the Weimar Republic was shot through with killing on the streets.\" He observes that its demography made it more like today's Egypt than the West.\n\nLook more closely, however, and the real resonances of this bygone society, and its true warning signs, start to appear. To begin with, Biberkopf is overwhelmed by change. On the tram from the prison he has something like a panic attack: \"The crowds, the crowds. My skull needs grease, it must have dried out.\" This is followed by seething resentment at the satisfied citizens in their restaurants and shops: \"Hundreds of shiny windows, let them flash away at you, they're nothing to be afraid of, it's just that they've been cleaned, you can always smash them if you want.\"\n\nBetween beauty and desperation\n\nThis Unbehagen, a nagging unease with the unfamiliar or fast-evolving, is prominent even in today's rich countries. In a speech on February 26th Angela Merkel said it helped explain the rise of the AfD.\n\nThe battle between Biberkopf's primal urges and his quest to \"remain decent\" is also recognisable. Döblin read and advocated Freud's theories, and his repressed anti-hero is both horrified and seduced by the permissiveness of the city. The freedom of a dark cinema prompts him to visit a prostitute. Selling newspapers, he wanders into a gay-rights meeting; he storms out in disgust, not just at what he has seen but at his own enchantment with it. This tension between take-what-you-want hedonism and a stark sense of respectability is manifest, too, in the modern world's blend of prurience and puritanism, or in the support of American religious conservatives for a libertine president.\n\nMoreover, Biberkopf's take on current affairs will be familiar to any social-media user. \"I don't do politics,\" he smugly tells a girlfriend. Contact with the business does not help. When he stumbles into a political meeting, the speaker appears to him a grotesque figure, \"a fat balding man, provoking, tempting, laughing, teasing\". In that moment \"there is nothing so contented as our Franz Biberkopf, who tells politics to go get lost.\" This tear-it-all-up tendency may have been what Fassbinder was getting at when he presumed to know how Biberkopf would have voted. It lives on in sneering online nihilism.\n\nWestern societies -- changing, hypocritical, anti-political -- are not about to follow Weimar Germany's trajectory. But elements of \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\" still echo. Consider \"Seven Nights\", a new novel by Simon Strauss, a German journalist who has reported on the rise of populism, in which the narrator seeks stimulation in the seven deadly sins. The current liberal, conformist Germany could hardly be more different from its late-1920s counterpart, yet in Mr Strauss's book it prompts similar sensations. At a masked ball the narrator reckons that \"Between beauty and desperation lies just one word: lust.\"\n\nSomething of the psychology of Weimar, the desire to touch the electric fence just to see what happens, lives on in modern societies and makes them, in their own ways, vulnerable to extremism and demagoguery. Mr Runciman argues that a latter-day failure of democracy will look very different to the implosion of the 1930s. One lesson of \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\" is that darkness can take many forms.",

                "title": "An American marine's eloquent memoir",
                "body": "WHAT is it like to wage war? Correspondents and film-makers try to depict it, while veterans often struggle to convey the reality. Matt Young manages to answer better than most.\n\nAs an alienated young man he joined the Marines in 2005 and served three tours in Iraq during the bloodiest years of the American occupation. In \"Eat the Apple\" he offers a series of vignettes drawn from his experience, changing tone and voice with each. Sometimes he refers to himself as \"this recruit\", at others he is \"the boy\". Rarely does he write as \"I\", more often referring to \"we\" and \"us\". Here he narrates with cold distance, there he is close and grisly. Some pages are tender and wistful, others repulsive, still others funny.\n\nThe experimental, jagged account matches the disjointed life of the soldier: long periods of boredom, interspersed with terror and confusion in battle, and drunken brawls on leave. The comradeship of men at arms becomes a refuge from the incomprehension of family. The Marines' dog-tags become talismans, both remnants of fallen friends and \"a foretelling of violent anonymous death\".\n\nMr Young draws, too. One sketch describes how, with a towel and rubber glove, a serviceman can fashion a home-made aid to onanism. \"Masturbation is a means of survival. Jerking off has saved countless lives through countless wars,\" he writes, noting how it helps keep men awake on long nights of guard duty.\n\nHis scenes recall the body- and soul-deadening training; the urge to desert on the eve of his first deployment to conflict; the exhilaration and struggle to survive amid the heat and insects. Violence explodes on the pages suddenly, like improvised explosive devices (IEDs). After a car-bomb blasts his Humvee, he becomes a \"person-thing\". Confronting the Iraqi onlookers, he steps on a fleshy pile, which turns out to be the suicide-bomber's face. \"The person-thing thinks it is wonderful and hilarious and physically amazing. It holds the bomber's face in front of his own and screams at the crowd through plump, blood-flecked lips, watching the crowd's reaction through empty eyeholes.\"\n\nHe has an eye for the absurd. After his patrol is blown up by an IED, he recovers in a field hospital, upset that the doctors are cutting away his favourite boots. At a strip club back home, he emphasises the \"undulating stretch marks and caesarean scars\" of the naked girls.\n\nOn occasion he reflects on America's wars. A night patrol prompts the observation that: \"There is no light pollution in Iraq. There might've been once, but not any more. Bombs dropped, buildings collapsed, people died. But now there are stars.\" He imagines a letter to a dark-skinned taxi-driver he punched. Recalling that many cabbies are Somalis, he asks, \"Are you one of them?...It seems I can't go anywhere without running into someone whose country the Marine Corps has fucked over.\"\n\n\"Eat the Apple\" is not a treatise on grand strategy. It offers no lessons on defeating insurgencies or the intricacies of countries in which America fights. This is a grunt's story, of the world seen through gun-sights and the reinforced glass of armoured vehicles. The enemy is unknown and generic: muj, hajji and \"raghead\".\n\nInstead, Mr Young's is a tale of pathos. A young man tries to find himself by going to war, but fails. \"I didn't even get to kill anyone,\" he laments. He has only shot dogs, guiltily at that. Yet, in writing about war, he has found a purpose and his voice.",

                "title": "The aftermath of the Weinstein scandal",
                "body": "IN 2009 Nina Jacobson -- formerly president of a Walt Disney studio, by then an independent film producer -- was pitching a new franchise to Hollywood bigwigs. \"The Hunger Games\", based on a bestselling novel, was the sort of dystopian sci-fi epic that might seem an easy sell. Yet several executives passed, partly because the heroes were teenagers -- and partly because the central character was a woman. \"I was taught as though it were a common-knowledge truth that girls will identify with a male protagonist, but boys will not identify with a female protagonist,\" says Ms Jacobson, who eventually sold the project to Lionsgate, a minor studio. Starring Jennifer Lawrence, it became a huge hit.\n\nMs Jacobson describes the industry's rules of thumb about women on screen as \"bias disguised as knowledge\". The trouble was, she says, that \"there weren't enough cases to prove the theories wrong.\" There may be soon.\n\nThe scandal over Harvey Weinstein's treatment of women, and over the other reprobates exposed in his wake, is changing Hollywood irrevocably. The #MeToo and #TimesUp movements have forced a reckoning of the industry's monsters, of the countless careers that were destroyed by them, and of a sexist culture that let it all happen. Regal men have been dethroned. The furore will colour the Academy Awards ceremony on March 4th.\n\nBut there are signs, too, of what may prove an equally important shift, in the stories Hollywood tells. The most powerful people in the industry -- who are mainly men -- have justified their decisions about what to put on screen by what they say sells tickets. Ms Jacobson's experience suggests many have been operating on flawed and myopic hunches. So does \"Wonder Woman\", directed by and starring women (pictured), which last year was the third-highest-grossing film at the North American box office. Likewise \"Black Panther\", with its black director and stars, is poised to become one of the most successful Marvel films ever -- dispelling another assumption, that predominantly African-American films do not succeed internationally.\n\nBack to the future\n\nIn the past such successes have typically been isolated blips. Now, as women demand more power in the production of film and television -- and begin to get it -- that pattern may be changing. The business of mass entertainment, and its output, are set to become more diverse, in ways subtle and profound. The trend began before the scandal but has been accelerated by it. It promises to be good for female actors and directors, for the studios, and, above all, for audiences.\n\nIn recent years women have made some headway on the small screen. In pay-TV and streaming television, female-dominated shows such as \"Big Little Lies\" and \"The Handmaid's Tale\" have thrived on a business model that depends less on overall viewership than on passionate support, via subscriptions. The sprawling medium forces producers to be more original. As one executive notes, it would be difficult for another television show about a white, heterosexual, male doctor to get noticed. Some of the most influential people in TV are women, including Shonda Rhimes, a producer who signed a lucrative development deal with Netflix last year. Reese Witherspoon, producer and star of \"Big Little Lies\", has acquired multiple women-centred stories to develop at her company. Women (and minorities) are increasingly being hired as directors, though they are still underrepresented: about one in six TV episodes is directed by a woman.\n\nMainstream Hollywood is strikingly ossified in comparison. As it happens, the first person to direct fictional films was a woman. Alice Guy was an employee of Gaumont when in 1896 she began telling short stories with film. She went on to make popular features, including action films with women in leading roles and narratives that captured an enlightened view of marriage. Eventually, though, as filmmaking became industrialised under the male-run studio system, women directors all but disappeared. Behind the camera, as in front of it, the studios' woman problem is as deep as it is entrenched.\n\nMale actors command about twice the screen time of female ones. Men are the heroes and villains and do most of the talking, with (at the last count) two-thirds of speaking parts in successful films, a ratio only slightly better than in the late 1940s. Women, still, are often ornaments or victims, love interests or damsels in distress: useful for being disrobed, attacked or both.\n\nSo one of the simple ways that studios can be more inclusive is to put more women and minorities in central roles. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, founded by the co-star of \"Thelma and Louise\", has been lobbying them for years to do this on a broad scale. Disney's Lucasfilm, run by Kathleen Kennedy, made women the heroines of its new \"Star Wars\" trilogy and a spin-off, \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\". Next year Brie Larson will star in \"Captain Marvel\", the first female-led feature from Marvel Studios (now owned by Disney).\n\nThis rebalancing might seem like common sense, given that women buy half the cinema tickets. The same logic holds for minority actors, considering non-white moviegoers buy more tickets per person in North America than white ones; altogether they too account for half of total sales. Yet in the past female-led hits such as \"The Hunger Games\" have not been widely emulated. Perhaps \"Wonder Woman\", a female superhero flick with a male star as the sidekick, will buck that trend. Flops, meanwhile, have been taken to confirm the old chauvinist biases. After \"Catwoman\" bombed in 2004, it took Warner Bros 13 years to release \"Wonder Woman\".\n\nThus the number of female characters in action films has risen only slightly since 2007, from 20% to 23% in 2016, says Stacy Smith, who analyses screen portrayals of women and minorities at the University of Southern California. (Her research also found that women are much more likely to be given only one shot at directing a studio film.) Females are nudged out of the picture in varied ways. Ms Jacobson says that when she was doing research for \"Antz\", an animated movie released in 1998, she learned that females had a lot of the most important jobs in ant colonies. Then an executive at DreamWorks SKG, she wanted to switch a leading role from a male ant to a female one, but was rebuffed.\n\nOf the top 100 films at the North American box office in 2016, 34 featured women in leading or co-leading roles, compared with 20 in 2007, according to Ms Smith's research. That looks like progress -- but women are not being deployed more imaginatively. About one in four were shown nude or partially nude in that sample, almost treble the rate for men. That includes 35% of females aged 13-20, up from 23% in 2007. The #MeToo movement has produced chilling accounts of actors being intimidated into taking their clothes off on camera. Salma Hayek wrote a harrowing article in the New York Times in which she alleged that Mr Weinstein pressured her into a lesbian-sex scene in \"Frida\", a film about Frida Kahlo, an artist. (Mr Weinstein \"does not recall\" pressuring her into the scene.)\n\nNobody thinks sex is going to vanish from screen. After all, women enjoy erotica, too. \"Women are just as game as men are,\" says Ms Jacobson; \"it's just a matter of who gets to tell the stories.\" But the Weinstein convulsions are spurring a rethink. The change won't mean \"purifying\" entertainment, says a senior movie agent, but will mean films offer a more \"balanced\" view of sexuality. Figures in the industry whispered to the Hollywood Reporter that executives have become skittish about greenlighting films with gratuitous sex.\n\nLike a better equilibrium between male and female roles, a less pornographic approach to sex might actually be good for business. Data suggest female viewers are turned off by the exploitative sexualisation of women and girls. Nick Meaney of Epagogix, a consultancy that evaluates screenplays algorithmically to predict box-office takings, says that sex scenes can indeed help films make money, but only when they fit organically into the story.\n\nHollywood, the sequel\n\nIf sex on screen is under scrutiny, so is misogynistic violence. Films portraying women in distress are unlikely to go out of fashion, but they might be made in a style that is less crass and demeaning. As it happens, says Mr Meaney, that would also help at the box office. 'Woman in peril' films fare best, he finds, when the woman fights back and wins at the end. This advance from primitive victimisation may already be under way. Keira Knightley recently said that, reviewing scripts set in the present, she had noticed a welcome uptick in women who \"aren't raped in the first five pages and aren't simply there to be the loving girlfriend or wife\".\n\nAnother, more concrete ramification of Hollywood's Weinstein moment, observes Ms Jacobson, is that fewer careers of ambitious young women will be crushed by harassment. Fewer abusive men will mentor acolytes in their image. In time that will mean more women taking decisions. Two big agencies have pledged to achieve equal representation in senior posts by 2020. Some redistribution has already begun. The former boss of Amazon Studios, who left under a cloud, has been replaced by a woman, Jennifer Salke.\n\nChange has begun in the director's chair as well. Martha Lauzen of San Diego State University found that, for the top 100 films in 2017, 8% of directors were women. That seems paltry, but in 2016 the figure was 4%; in 2010, it was 2%. Greta Gerwig, one of that minority, has been nominated for the best-director Oscar for \"Lady Bird\". A female cinematographer has been nominated for the first time (Rachel Morrison for \"Mudbound\"). The link between more female artists and more rounded pictures is hard to quantify, but it is real. John Landgraf, president of FX, a network that has raised its share of female and non-white directors to around a half, notes that \"broadening the diversity of our roster\" has \"yielded a wider and often times more surprising range of choices\".\n\nAll this matters beyond Hollywood because of the example it sets to viewers everywhere. To take one small but telling instance of that influence, after the release of \"The Hunger Games\" there was a surge in girls' interest in archery, the heroine's speciality. Almost two-thirds of women say that watching a strong role model on screen made them more ambitious or assertive, says Rachel Pashley of J. Walter Thompson, a marketing firm. Women report seeing greater possibilities in the real world if their avatars realise them on celluloid: \"What they said was, 'if we saw more female scientists or female leaders or female politicians on screen, it would make it easier for that to happen in real life'.\"\n\nA new kind of storytelling does not mean homogenising men and women, or eliminating sex and violence. It means telling much the same stories, but with a different eye. Recent television provides a template. \"Big Little Lies\" is in part a saga of domestic abuse. \"The Handmaid's Tale\" is a parable of women being systematically controlled. But they are told from the perspective of the women. Similarly, \"Wonder Woman\" was a superhero film in more than name. Some people who went to see it waited with trepidation for the scene in which the heroine is reduced to a fetish object; that scene never came. Instead women and girls walked out of screenings ready to conquer the world.",

                "body": "Behemoth: A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern World. By Joshua Freeman. W.W. Norton & Company; 448 pages; $27.95 and £22.\n\nWHEN it was built in 1721 beside the River Derwent, in Britain's East Midlands, Lombe's silk mill became something of a tourist attraction. Daniel Defoe, one of its many visitors, described its \"vast bulk\" as \"a curiosity of a very extraordinary nature\". Employing some 300 people, mostly children in ghastly conditions, the mill was not large by modern standards. But it is widely regarded as the first successful mechanised factory, an innovation that over the next 100 years transformed the way people lived and worked.\n\nLombe's mill is the natural starting-point for Joshua Freeman's lively chronicle of the factory, which as the title of his book \"Behemoth\" implies, concentrates on the largest specimens of their time. Mr Freeman, a historian at Queens College in New York, travels from Britain's textile mills, which centralised tasks that were previously carried out in homes and small workshops, to monster steel and carmaking factories in 20th-century America, Europe and the Soviet Union. His journey ends in southern China at Foxconn's city-sized plant, which makes iPhones and other electronic gadgets.\n\nMr Freeman rolls up his sleeves and delves into the nitty-gritty of manufacturing. He successfully melds together those nuggets with social history, on the shop floor and beyond the factory walls, from union battles to worker exploitation and, in the case of Foxconn, suicides. Consider, for example, his account of one of the most famous factory bosses of all.\n\nHenry Ford launched his Model T in 1908, turning the car from a luxury into a mass-manufactured product. Ford's original factory, just outside Detroit, used standardised parts and fitted them to vehicles as they travelled along a moving assembly line. By 1914 this cut the labour time needed to assemble a Model T from 12.5 hours to 93 minutes. Before long the nearby River Rouge complex became the centre of a vertically integrated empire, designed to produce everything required to make a car.\n\nThe Model T, however, soon became obsolete. As Mr Freeman describes, this exposed the weakness of the Ford system: it is extremely expensive and slow to switch a giant factory from one product to another. In 1927 Ford halted production and laid off 60,000 workers, causing a social crisis in the Detroit area. After six months 15,000 machine tools had been replaced and 25,000 others rebuilt, so that the Rouge was ready to make the new Model A. At its zenith the factory employed 100,000 people. But it was a brutal place to work, with employees subject to harsh discipline and tyrannical foremen. \"A man checks 'is brains and 'is freedom at the door,\" one Rouge worker complained.\n\nAs the switch from Model T to Model A plunged Ford into loss, Alfred P. Sloan, president of General Motors, presciently observed that carmakers would need to \"adopt the 'laws' of Paris dressmakers\". That meant bringing out new models more often. The shortening of product cycles and the fickle nature of modern markets has duly seen manufacturing atomise into smaller, nimbler, more specialist factories. The Rouge, for instance, lives on, but with just 6,000 workers making pick-up trucks.\n\nSome see offshoring to low-wage countries, particularly in Asia, as the mega-factory's last hurrah. Yet long supply chains and distant plants are leaving producers vulnerable to rapid changes in their home markets, so production has been trickling back. Meanwhile new materials and manufacturing methods, such as 3D printing, are demolishing the economies of scale that giant factories have relied on. Although Mr Freeman is not ready to write off his behemoths, he has probably written their obituary.",

                "title": "In the court of common usage, an old pronoun is losing its case",
                "body": "LAST week The Economist considered the new South African president's in-tray, advertising our advice on the cover with the words \"Who Cyril Ramaphosa should fire\". Some readers might have wondered whether someone should fire our proofreaders. Shouldn't that be \"Whom Cyril Ramaphosa should fire\"?\n\nIt wasn't a cock-up. On its face, our editors agreed, the grammar was clear. It should be whom. Who is used for subjects, whom for objects, including direct objects such as that of the verb to fire. \"He fires him\", not \"He fires he\". Thus, \"He fires whom\".\n\nThe issue is not as simple as that. Whom is one of the few remaining vestiges of case in English. At the time of \"Beowulf\", the great monster-slaying Anglo-Saxon epic, English nouns, pronouns and adjectives, plus words like the, all had an ending showing case. Four different cases in Old English tell you whether a word is a subject, direct object, indirect object or possessor. Other languages, from Ancient Greek to Russian to Estonian, have far richer case systems still.\n\nMore than 1,000 years later, that system has vanished almost entirely -- probably fatally weakened by foreign invaders. When foreign speakers learn a second language, as the Vikings and then the Normans did when they conquered England, cases are tricky to pick up, as any student of Russian knows. If they can be dispensed with, they often will be. Those Vikings and Normans feebly learning Old English helped turn it into Middle English, in which case was far less often visible.\n\nYet fans of whom might ask, how can you dispense with case without throwing out intelligibility? It's important to know what word in a sentence is the subject, which the direct object, and so on. That is true -- so true that every language on Earth has a way of solving the problem, whether it has cases or not. In English and other case-poor languages, from Swedish to Vietnamese, the solution is word order.\n\nIn Old English, Latin or Russian subjects, objects and other words can appear in different orders; this gives speakers and writers a way to play with rhythm and emphasis. The loss of case in modern English means that word order must be relatively fixed, usually subject, verb and object in that sequence. Steve loves Sally means that Steve is the lover, Sally the loved. This could be reversed in Old English, with the meaning unchanged, because the case-endings would show who loved whom.\n\nIn English today just six words still show a distinction between subject and object: I, he, she, we, they and who. For the first five, making the case-distinction is mandatory nearly all of the time. You cannot say \"I love she and she loves I\". Admittedly, some people say \"between you and I\". (It should be between you and me, because both you and me are objects of the preposition.) But this is a marginal mistake, made mostly by educated people taking to excess the childhood lesson not to say \"you and me\" in sentences such as \"you and me are going to be friends.\" Regardless, that children say \"you and me are going\" and grown-ups say \"between you and I\", and both are perfectly understood, illustrates the point: case just isn't important to meaning in English.\n\nWhom is special. It is used in questions and relative clauses, which are rarer and more complex than \"he saw him\" type sentences. It is not always obvious whether the relevant word is a subject or an object, as in sentences such as, \"He's the candidate who(m) we think will win\". (It should be who.) Perhaps because these sentences are tricky, and swapping who and whom rarely causes confusion, the two words have been collapsing into just one combined form: who, which is used, just like you, as both subject and object.\n\nWhom is stuffier in some places than in others. The pomposity of Sideshow Bob from \"The Simpsons\" is clear when he asks his audience \"Whoooom do you love?\" By contrast Twitter recommends \"Who to follow\". (Changing the site language to British English oddly changes this to \"Whom to follow\", though Britons do not actually use whom any more than Americans.) After a preposition, whom still feels necessary: \"people for whom a holiday is a far-off dream\". But in cases like our cover flash, \"Whom Cyril Ramaphosa should fire\" felt so unacceptably stilted that our editors decided against it.\n\nThe case, as it were, is getting stronger against whom. Except in the most formal language -- think courtrooms and prayers -- this little word may not survive. For whom, the bell tolls.",

To be published in Britain in June; £22.\n\nOF ALL the professions that trade on teenage fantasies, few are as brutal as football. Just 1% of the 10,000 youngsters in English clubs' academies go on to make a living in the sport. Two-thirds of those who earn a contract at 18 are out of the game by 21. The path is even tougher for prospects in Africa, as Sebastian Abbot shows in \"The Away Game\". His engrossing book follows the fortunes of a handful of teenagers who made it into Football Dreams, perhaps the most ambitious scouting programme in sporting history. Run by the Aspire Academy in Qatar, the search involved 5m boys across the developing world at a cost of more than $100m.\n\nThe tale opens in 2007 as Josep Colomer, the scout who nurtured Lionel Messi at Barcelona, navigates the Niger Delta escorted by armed rebels. Supported by 6,000 volunteers across Africa, he aims to assemble a squad of the continent's most promising 13-year-olds by testing half a million of them -- every year.\n\nMr Abbot's book focuses on a clutch of early candidates who are plucked from Ghana and Senegal and transported to unimaginable luxury in Doha. The motives of their benefactor, Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, are unclear. Ostensibly they are there to provide practice for local players in the hope of strengthening the national team, ahead of a bid to host the World Cup in 2022. Some think the real plan may be to make Qatari citizens of Africa's finest.\n\nNot that the players mind. The academy's well-drilled squads thrash youth teams from Manchester United and Real Madrid. They beat a Brazilian side including Neymar and Philippe Coutinho, later the two most expensive players in history.\n\nFrom there, however, the trajectory is downwards. Some of the trainees flounder; some turn out to have lied about their age. Though FIFA, the sport's governing body, forbids European clubs to sign outside players younger than 18, some of the older ones leave the academy in the hope of finding a glamorous suitor. None succeeds, and most forlornly return home. Those who stay graduate to a second-division Belgian club that the Qataris have bought. One makes it to Barcelona, but never breaks into the first team. After failing to find the next global superstar, the programme closed in 2016.\n\nMr Abbot describes the exploitation that many African starlets face. The unluckiest are ferried to Europe by dodgy agents, left without a club, and resort to begging rather than returning to Africa in shame. Since he concentrates on the academy, Mr Abbot gives only limited space to such poignant stories, and to the experiences of youngsters from Asia and South America.\n\nYet that is a minor shortcoming in a masterful account of the drama and science of scouting. One of the strongest predictors of intuition on the field, he finds, is the amount of kick-about football a youngster plays, which gives poor South American kids an edge. Such insights are woven into a lively evocation of football mania in Africa, where every corner bustles with locals in replica shirts: \"Messi adjusting the straps on a donkey, Ronaldo patching a fishing net in the shade of a tree.\"",

The moniker was borrowed from a cunning swordsman in a novel by Jin Yong. In spite of official sales estimated at 300m copies, plus multiple spin-off films, television serials and games, the 14 martial-arts epics written by Jin Yong between 1955 and 1972 have remained unknown to most Western readers. Their author, though, is hardly a hermit scribe.\n\nHis real name is Louis Cha. Now 93, Mr Cha founded and edited one of Hong Kong's leading newspapers, Ming Pao. He has been honoured by Queen Elizabeth and awarded two doctorates (one honorary, one for research) by Cambridge University. The swashbuckling blend of medieval history and heroic fantasy that he honed as Jin Yong is now set to reach a wide English-language readership.\n\n\"A Hero Born\" is the first of the 12 volumes of \"Legends of the Condor Heroes\", written in the late 1950s. Set in the years after 1205, it enjoyably wields the weapons of wuxia -- traditional martial-arts fiction, with its spectacular combat and pauses for philosophy -- to show Chinese identity under threat from foreign and domestic foes. \"Three generations of useless emperors\" have brought the Song dynasty to its knees. Quisling allies of the Jurchen Jin invaders, who rule the north, abet imperial decline.\n\nEnter the dragons of salvation: an \"eccentric\" kung fu clan known as the Seven Freaks of the South, and the militant Taoist monks of the Quanzhen sect. They are first rivals, then collaborators. Though strained, their joint mission embodies a pact between \"physical force\" and the \"more enlightened path\" of wisdom that may rescue China.\n\nBereaved and exiled by traitors, the hero Guo Jing grows up on the Mongolian steppes. He joins the entourage of Temujin, a great warrior who will become Genghis Khan. Although manifestly a parable of Han Chinese resistance to foreign humiliation, the story does not demonise outsiders. The Mongols, ferocious but \"refined people\", nurture the \"not naturally gifted\" youngster as a fighter and a patriot. In Anna Holmwood's spirited translation, this action-packed and ideas-laden saga is as revealing of modern as of ancient China.",

                "body": "STEPPING through the gauzy curtains, Michael Syrovatka screams and lurches backwards. In the real world, he is on the first floor of the Goethe-Institut (GI) in Prague. In the virtual one created by his headset, he has just looked into a mirror to find he has turned into a giant insect. \"I jumped when I saw myself,\" Mr Syrovatka says, as other pupils from Prague's Austrian Grammar School take turns in the installation. They had arrived sullenly, expecting a lecture. Soon they are chattering about how it feels to be Gregor Samsa.\n\n\"The opening of 'The Metamorphosis' is a nightmare,\" says Mika Johnson, a lecturer at Prague Film School and a Franz Kafka fanatic. In Kafka's story Gregor wakes to find himself transformed into a speechless bug. His family bangs on the door, pleading with him to respond; his boss berates him. To Mr Johnson and his team, Gregor's anguish was ideal for virtual-reality (VR) adaptation. \"It's a perfect coincidence of technology and text,\" says Berthold Franke, regional head of the GI, the German cultural association that funded the project. \"You're transformed by the headset, then you're transformed again in the story.\"\n\n\"VRwandlung\" -- the name plays on the story's German title \"Die Verwandlung\" -- is on view in Prague until the end of March. It both showcases a new way to enrich literature, and implicitly demonstrates what is irreducibly special about reading. Visitors find themselves in Gregor Samsa's bedroom; looking down reveals a greyish carapace and six stick-like limbs. Walking around brings floppy antennae into view. A window reveals a drab street. A mirror reflects the predicament that he is -- you are -- in. The entreaties of mother, father, sister and boss meld with the patter of rain and an ever-faster heartbeat.\n\n\"Imagine the strain and stress he's under,\" Mr Johnson says. \"I wanted to preserve all that in the hope of triggering real emotional responses.\" That he appears to have done. Taking off the headset, Susanne Reif-Breitwieser, Mr Syrovatka's German teacher, exhales sharply. \"I'm glad I'm not an insect,\" she says. \"Those annoying antennae, that complete helplessness.\"\n\nIf enthusiasts such as Mr Johnson have their way, literature may be in line for the virtual treatment, after VR-gaming and VR-pornography. \"VRwandlung\" reveals the technology's potential, and its constraints. One is cost. Immersive VR-systems rely on expensive infrared grids to track users through sensors on their hands and feet, meaning spaces are small. Interaction with computer-generated effects is especially pricey. Then there is the problem of a book's finitude: the inevitable ending contradicts the basic premise of VR, namely that the user can decide the outcome.\n\nIn other ways, of course, in its metaphors and ironies Kafka's story is much richer and more provocative than an installation could match. Ms Reif-Breitwieser identifies one deficiency. Praising the project for making a classic enticing to her students, she quibbles with the depiction of the creature. Kafka famously used an indeterminate term, Ungeziefer, to describe Gregor's new form (English translations such as \"insect\" or \"vermin\" do not convey its ambiguity). He implored his publisher not to illustrate the beast. \"I felt immersed in it,\" says Ms Reif-Breitwieser, \"but I'm not sure it's Kafka's world.\"\n\nStill, other devotees are working on metamorphoses of their own. Along with his students, Joseph Nugent of Boston College is applying VR to James Joyce's masterpiece \"Ulysses\". \"You can't map a city with all its things and its people -- the technology is not there and it would be way too expensive,\" Mr Nugent acknowledges. \"You have no chance to replicate the pace or complexity\" of the novel. All the same, in the past two years his students have reconstructed five scenes, even if they are mere \"slivers\" of the book's depths.\n\nAware of the obstacles, Mr Johnson set out to find a text that fits the parameters of the technology. It occurred to him that the opening of \"The Metamorphosis\" takes place in a small room and that, initially, interaction with other characters and objects is minimal. Gregor's reactions are paramount, allowing the VR-user to slip into a largely passive role. To heighten the experience he eschewed a purely computer-generated set. Instead a scale model was built, photographed and \"stitched together\" into a virtual, 3D world -- a homage, Mr Johnson says, to \"classic Czech animation films\", which also gave the room and its surfaces \"more texture\". \"Let's be clear,\" he emphasises, \"it's an adaptation in VR, it's not a reproduction of the text.\"\n\nFor all that, \"VRwandlung\" captures the allure and risks of modernity in Kafkaesque style. Reiner Stach, a Kafka biographer who helped with the project, thinks the author \"would have loved a new technology like this.\" Kafka once fantasised about combining stereoscopic postcard-viewers with moving pictures to create 3D films. \"But he would have immediately seen the dangers, too,\" Mr Stach adds. What if VR became so immersive that people preferred it to reality? \"He would have found that idea unheimlich.\"",

                "title": "A new generation is rising in Russia",
                "body": "KONSTANTIN CHERNENKO, the general secretary of the Communist Party, died on the night of March 10th 1985 at the age of 73. As red flags trimmed with black ribbons went up in every city in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev rushed to an emergency meeting of the Politburo in the Kremlin. That meeting put Mr Gorbachev in charge of the funeral committee -- and thus, by extension, of the Communist Party and the country. Chernenko was of the generation that had risen through the ranks under Stalin. (And he was the third general secretary to die in less than three years, in what was memorably dubbed a \"hearse race\".) After him, the party elders all felt that a younger, more dynamic leader was needed to rejuvenate the Soviet system and ensure its survival.\n\nIt was not until four the next morning that Mr Gorbachev returned to his dacha. As he and his wife walked the snow-covered paths of its garden, he summed up the mood of the elite and the country: \"We just can't go on living like this.\" Nor did they. Mr Gorbachev gave individual livelihoods and well-being -- the \"human values\", as he put it -- precedence over state or class interests, launching new policies ofglasnost (openness) andperestroika (restructuring), and bringing the cold war to a close.\n\nThe Soviet system could not keep going without deception and repression. Unwittingly and unwillingly, Mr Gorbachev brought about its end. What followed, however, was not the miraculous emergence of a \"normal\" country as many had hoped, but a decade of turbulence, economic decline, rising crime and social breakdown, and Mr Gorbachev got the blame. As he said years later, \"It is my grandchildren's generation who are benefiting fromperestroika. They are more confident, freer, they know that they must rely on themselves.\"\n\nAlexander Gabuev was born on the day Chernenko died. He is one of those \"grandchildren\". Now 33, he is the chief China expert at the Moscow Carnegie Centre, a think-tank. Fluent in English, Mandarin and German, he criss-crosses the world briefing government officials. In his spare time, between playing tennis and drinking rum cocktails in a Moscow bar, he cultivates a network of young experts and policymakers to thrash out \"actionable ideas\" of how to reform the country when they come to power. \"We need to be ready,\" he says.\n\nOlga Mostinskaya and Fedor Ovchinnikov are a few years older than Mr Gabuev. Ms Mostinskaya, 36, is a politician born into a family of diplomats. She spent ten years as an interpreter working directly for Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, before resigning in 2014 \"out of repugnance\". The war in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea were only the last straw, she says. Three years later she was elected to a local council in Moscow on a pledge to \"empower, inform and engage\" her voters.\n\nMr Ovchinnikov, also 36, grew up in a family of journalists in Syktyvkar, near the Arctic Circle. He was a teenager when Mr Gorbachev, trying to raise money for his foundation, appeared in a Pizza Hut commercial with his ten-year-old granddaughter: \"Because of him, we have opportunity!\" a young man in the advert tells a disgruntled old-timer. A decade later, Mr Ovchinnikov used that opportunity to launch a pizza place in Syktyvkar. His firm, Dodo, now has 300 outlets in Russia, as well as one in Britain and two in America.\n\nRegeneration\n\nBelonging to a generation involves more than proximity of dates of birth. As Karl Mannheim, a German sociologist, wrote in 1928, a meaningful generation is also forged by the common experience of a trauma that becomes central to its identity. Contemporaries become a generation, he argued, only when \"they are potentially capable of being sucked into the vortex of social change.\"\n\nMr Gabuev, Ms Mostinskaya, Mr Ovchinnikov and other Russians are part of a new generation of Russian elite who share the European values declared by Mr Gorbachev around the time of their birth and are traumatised by their reversal 30 years later. A significant and vocal group, they are imbued with a sense of entitlement and have the potential and desire to complete Russia's aborted transition to a \"normal\" country. Whether they get a chance to do so depends on many factors, including their determination and the resistance of the system embodied by Mr Putin's rule.\n\nThe new generation define themselves by their difference from their \"fathers\" as well as some similarities with their \"grandfathers\". Gorbachev's grandchildren recognise in each other a dissatisfaction with the aggression, degradation and lies that underpin Mr Putin's rule. He presides over the sort of power structure that Douglass North, an American political economist, has called the \"natural state\". In this, rents are created by limiting access to economic and political resources, and the limits are enforced by \"specialists in violence\". In Russia these are thesiloviki of the assorted security and police forces, serving the system as they did in Soviet times.\n\nThat system is not about to crumble. But the rise of a new generation -- especially one which, through quirks of demography, is large (see chart) -- matters in Russia. \"Every new group coming to power has always declared a break with the previous one,\" wrote Yuri Levada, a prominent Russian academic, \"blaming it for every possible sin. A demonstrable rejection of predecessors has been the main way for leaders of a new generation to establish themselves in power, regardless of whether they carried on or changed the means and style of governance.\"\n\nLacking strong civil institutions, Gorbachev's grandchildren look to their peers for definition, for their place in society and, as Mannheim would have it, in history. But so do their opponents, the disenfranchised nationalists who are similarly dissatisfied with the corruption and cynicism of Mr Putin's rule. The difference, at least for now, is that the nationalists lack leadership and resources and are overshadowed by the Kremlin's own rhetoric.\n\nOnly one winner\n\nThe presidential election on March 18th showed, on the face of it, little prospect of any change. With television and the bureaucratic powers of the state at his beck and call, Mr Putin was re-elected with 77% of the vote. The result reflected the status quo and was hardly surprising. Many civil servants and factory workers were cajoled into voting by their bosses, and driven to the polls. Thanks to pre-election thuggery, Mr Putin faced no serious challenger. Boris Nemtsov, the most credible liberal politician of Mr Putin's generation, was murdered three years ago, shot beside the wall of the Kremlin. Alexei Navalny, the most plausible candidate of the new generation, was barred from standing in December after the Kremlin engineered fraud charges against him.\n\n\"This is not an election,\" said Igor Malashenko, who helped Boris Yeltsin keep the presidency in 1996. \"It is a theatre performance directed by the Kremlin.\" But he still thought it mattered. That is why he ran the campaign of Ksenia Sobchak, a 36-year-old socialite-turned-politician. Her father was the first democratically elected mayor of St Petersburg and once Mr Putin's boss. She stood on the Kremlin's sufferance. It used her as a spoiler for Mr Navalny, who is 41. But while the Kremlin used her, she hoped to use it to build a platform from which to move into real, as opposed to Potemkin politics. For both Ms Sobchak and Mr Navalny an appeal to a young generation is central to their politics.\n\nMs Sobchak's strategy was the opposite of Mr Navalny's. Once he had been barred from standing, he called for a boycott of the election to undermine its legitimacy. He accused Ms Sobchak of helping Mr Putin by taking part. Though blocked from standing, he managed to dominate the election agenda. Many young people are thought to have abstained, though it is hard to tell whether this was because of apathy or a rejection of Mr Putin.\n\nAs polling stations in Moscow closed, Ms Sobchak, who in the end got only 1.7% of votes, went to Mr Navalny's headquarters blaming him for refusing to back her. He pushed her away, noting that her loss was a measure of his success. She looked deflated; Mr Navalny, off camera, uncorked the champagne. \"We have created a new opposition in a place where it was impossible,\" he said.\n\nIf the election was a ritual, it was still important. Giving Mr Putin another six years would \"mark the arrival of the post-Putin era\", argued Ivan Krastev and Gleb Pavlovsky, two political analysts, in a recent paper for the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. Constitutionally Mr Putin cannot stand in 2024, and from now on political life will be dominated by the question of succession and expectation of his departure. His own survival and preservation of the system he now presides over will be his sole objective.\n\nMr Putin has seen crises of succession before -- one brought him to power. As a youngKGB officer he served the ossified leaderships of Chernenko and Leonid Brezhnev. Their generation had grown old in power in part because it had won it young. Stalin's purges meant that by 1940 around half the party elite was under the age of 40.\n\nWho remembers the sixties?\n\nThe generation that followed identified themselves asshestidesiatniki -- the men of the 1960s. Soviet victory in the second world war gave them confidence in their country. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party, at which Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin, gave them their political inspiration. Many of their spiritual leaders were children of old Bolsheviks killed in the purges. They had a sense of being both entitled and required to put the country back on the course of true socialism -- this time with a human face. Those hopes were crushed when Soviet tanks rolled into Prague in 1968. They had to wait until 1985 for their chance.\n\nThe Brezhnev generation stayed long in power; the men of the 1960s did not. Mr Gorbachev was gone by 1991. Yeltsin, his contemporary and successor, was not part of that generation ideologically and surrounded himself with men who were 25-30 years his junior. The children of the 1960s men, the last Soviet generation, declared their fathers bankrupt both financially and intellectually. Socialism with a human face died with the Soviet economy.\n\nThe alternative was capitalism, which Soviet propaganda had portrayed as a cut-throat and cynical system in which cunning and ruthlessness mattered more than integrity or rules, and where money was the only measure of success. The new elite did not abandon that view. Those with power and connections acquired the material attributes of Western life. They could not buy its institutions, rules or norms -- but they were not interested in trying.\n\nMeanwhile millions of people in the first post-revolutionary decade of the 1990s felt disoriented, robbed of social status and savings. This was cynically and successfully exploited by Mr Putin. Yeltsin had promoted him as a man who, although of the next generation, would protect the wealth and safety of the elite. But Mr Putin consolidated his power by rejecting Yeltsin's legacy and demonising the 1990s. His first symbolic gesture was the restoration of the Soviet anthem, which Yeltsin had abandoned. This was quickly followed by real changes, including suppression of freedom of speech and redistribution of assets and rents.\n\nMr Putin has become the patron of a cohort of young technocrats in order to manage, and survive, the next generational shift. He wants these young men (as they are for the most part) to provide some economic modernisation while not upsetting the system or provoking social unrest. And he wants their continued deference and loyalty as he moves from father figure to grandfather. Today six regional governors, two ministers and 20 deputy ministers are in their 30s. Yet, politically Mr Putin needs these technocrats to preserve a system in which entitlements, privileges and rents are allocated not according to law or merit but by access to resources and by position in the social hierarchy. This system of \"conditional\" property rights has allowed Mr Putin's friends and cronies to put their children into positions of wealth and power.\n\nThe son of Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of the National Security Council and former chief of theFSB, heads a state-owned bank. The son of Sergei Ivanov, another formerKGB officer and old friend of Mr Putin, is the head of Alrosa, a state-owned firm which mines more diamonds than any other in the world. The son of Mikhail Fradkov, a former prime minister and intelligence service chief, heads a private bank which is the staple of the military-industrial complex. Many children of Mr Putin's friends and cronies hold senior positions in Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly, or own firms that depend on its contracts. All of them enjoy positions and wealth thanks largely to their family names.\n\nYet this also makes them vulnerable to political changes that come with generational shifts. Russian elites have endlessly tried to establish unconditional property rights for themselves. Andrei Zorin, a historian at Oxford University, sees this yearning for institutions that can guarantee both physical security and the transfer of wealth across the generations as one of the main reasons that Russian elites have sought to emulate Western Europe.\n\nThose who oppose\n\nFor all the difference in their tactics, Mr Navalny and Ms Sobchak share a vision of Russia as a normal European country subject to the rule of law. As a populist who comes from outside the system, Mr Navalny appeals to people alienated by the elites. He demands retribution and a complete overhaul of government, with those now in power barred from office. Ms Sobchak, who is far closer to the beneficiaries of Mr Putin's rule, promises a change without exposing the elite to reprisal. Justifying this halfway house, she says \"Everything in this country belongs to these people. Billions of dollars, the army and security services, the largest companies. They can lose it only if there is a social explosion and even then they will probably fight to the last bullet. But Putin does not want to be a Qaddafi.\"\n\nThis realism reflects the view that, even among the children of the elite, there is an appetite for change. Dmitry Gudkov, a 37-year-old opposition politician whose coalition won a majority in more than a dozen local councils in Moscow, is also the son of a formerKGB lieutenant-colonel, says: \"The children [of the elite] are feeling uncomfortable in the shadow of their parents. They don't want to be associated with all this obscurantism, self-isolation and anti-Westernism. They don't want to risk their businesses now by speaking out in public, but they are constantly sending us signals that they are on our side.\" Mr Gudkov and Ms Sobchak are now forming a party together.\n\nThe loyalists who have come of age under Mr Putin, and benefited from his patronage -- the cadre from which he draws the technocrats whom he hopes will shore up the system -- credit him with rebuilding the state. But they, too, see change ahead. As Mr Pavlovsky puts it, they \"want to make [the system] inhabitable\". But so did Mr Gorbachev when he came to power.\n\nThis interest in making or managing change, rather than simply benefiting from it, is relatively recent. In the 2000s Gorbachev's grandchildren seemed apolitical. Soaring incomes, the opening ofIKEA stores and a mushrooming of cafés, bars and nightclubs in Moscow were not taken as an achievement of the state, for which they should be grateful, but as a norm which they took for granted. They saw the end of the cold war not as a loss, but as part of becoming a normal country.\n\nMr Putin (and his circle) had a complex relationship with the West, coloured both by features of his generation and his service in theKGB. \"As part of the last Soviet generation he longed for Western comforts and goods. As aKGB officer, he was instilled with an idea of the West as an enemy,\" says Natalia Gevorkyan, Mr Putin's biographer. The result was aressentiment mixture of jealousy and inferiority which fuelled anti-Americanism.\n\nTo Gorbachev's grandchildren, by contrast, the West was just a place where they went. They did not crave its material attributes because they already had them. What they wanted were its institutions and rights. While older liberals lamented their lack of politics and public life, they were cultivating their urban space, with its parks, bike lanes and food courts. This shaped their expectations and sensibilities more than political statements. The presidency of Dmitry Medvedev, a place-holder installed by Mr Putin in 2008, fitted stylistically with this urban modernisation.\n\nThe new generation had no great enthusiasm for Mr Medvedev's politics, but they liked the fact that he loved his iPad (Mr Putin prides himself on never using the internet). As rumours of Mr Putin's return to the Kremlin began to swirl, though, Mr Medvedev started to become something more -- a figurehead for a modernisation which he was not really enabling, but from which Mr Putin's return would be a step back. When in September 2011 Mr Medvedev announced a pre-arranged job swap with Mr Putin, who had sat out one presidential term as prime minister, frustration boiled over.\n\nOld style, new style\n\nA rigged parliamentary election in 2011, which a few years earlier would have gone unnoticed, triggered protests in Moscow and other big cities; hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. Mr Navalny galvanised the movement using social networks. The young, including the previously apolitical elite, joined in. Ms Sobchak, once known only as an it-girl and star of reality television, stood in front of a crowd and declared, \"I am Ksenia Sobchak and I have much to lose.\"\n\nIn anger, Mr Putin turned his back on the young and the educated, appealing instead to older members of the working class and public-sector workers and unleashing nationalist and traditionalist rhetoric that infringed on the urban elite's style and private space. \"It was my breaking point,\" Ms Sobchak says now, \"they started taking away what we already had.\" Andrei Sinyavsky, a writer jailed for anti-Soviet propaganda, quipped after emigrating to France in the 1973 that his \"differences with the Soviet regime were purely of a stylistic nature\". The new generation increasingly defines itself by such stylistic differences, rather than through any sort of political cohesiveness. But style in Russia often becomes politics.\n\nGorbachev's grandchildren have never had to worry about being left penniless and that means they are less bothered about money. Success in the 1990s meant having a chauffeur, shopping in London and eating at $200-a-head restaurants. To be cool today is to use car-sharing, attend a public lecture about urbanism or make your own way around India. \"I prefer cycling around Kaliningrad to going by car,\" says Anton Alikhanov, the city's 31-year-old governor. \"And I don't understand why investors want to put money into building another three floors of a house, instead of increasing the value of their properties by cultivating public space.\"\n\nValue judgments\n\nMany care instead about what they can accomplish professionally rather than what they can get and about what they share, not what they own. They do not envy Mr Putin's cronies who live behind high fences, fly on private jets and have built special rooms for their fur coats. They ridicule them.\n\nThey hate the propaganda of state television, which for a long time was one of the main instruments of social control. It now irritates people more than the stagnating economy, according to Lev Gudkov of the Levada Centre, a think-tank. They live online in a world of individual voices. They speak a direct language. Hence the success of Yuri Dud, whose YouTube interviews of people with something to say, be they politicians, actors or rappers, are watched by millions. These are neither pro- nor anti-Kremlin but are simply outside the system. There was a similar striving for sincerity in the early 1960s when a plain, living language seemed an antidote to Soviet bombast. It is another thing Mr Gorbachev's grandchildren and the men of the sixties have in common.\n\nMr Gorbachev drew his support from a vast number of scientists and engineers who had time and skill but lacked prospects. Today, the demand for change is coming from an army of young entrepreneurs who want a system regulated by rules and open to competition. For people like Mr Ovchinnikov, business has become a form of activism. Openness is both his core business principle and selling point.\n\nMr Ovchinnikov turned Dodo's growth into something resembling a reality television show through a blog called Sila Uma (Brainpower). Both investors and customers watched Dodo deliver both pizza and profits in real time. \"We wanted to prove that you can be honest and transparent in Russia.\" Within a few years Dodo, largely crowdfunded through the internet, employed 10,000 people. Mr Ovchinnikov and others like him treat transparency not as a risk, but as a way of protecting themselves from the system.\n\n\"There are two parallel countries,\" Mr Ovchinnikov says. \"There is a country of smart and energetic people who want to make it open and competitive. And there is another country of security servicemen who drive in blackSUVs extorting rents.\" The two clashed when, earlier this year, Mr Ovchinnikov was accused of pushing drugs after the staff of one of his pizza joints in Moscow reported finding drugs in a lavatory that had, in fact, been planted by criminals with police protection apparently in order to extract a bribe or ruin his business. Mr Ovchinnikov gave his side of the raid through social media and the story went viral. It was picked up by Mr Navalny who mentioned it in one of his YouTube videos. A few weeks later the prosecutors backed off.\n\nThat will not always be the case. Part of North's logic of the \"natural state\" is that when rents get scarce the role of violence goes up. Many young Russians see a job in the security services as the only social lift available. A recent survey found that more than 75% of people under the age of 30 find a security-service job attractive and 50% would like their children to have one. And which way the spooks turn will affect Russia's future. ManyFSB officers are apparently in \"suitcase\" mood, ready to switch sides if necessary. But some are more ideological, and therefore more dangerous.\n\nLast autumn, youngFSB officers in a unit called the \"Service for the Protection of Constitutional Order and the Fight Against Terrorism\" arrested several anarchists and left-wing anti-fascists, accused them of trying to \"destabilise the political situation in the country\" and subjected them to torture and humiliation. As one victim was told as he was tasered: \"You must understand, anFSB officer always gets what he wants.\" Social-media profiles of some of those officers revealed their ultra-nationalist views. None of them has been charged or dismissed.\n\nThe impunity that the security services have gained under Mr Putin has reversed Mr Gorbachev's main principle: individual life and human values take precedence over the purposes of the state. Gorbachev's grandchildren want those values back. \"The current state system is not only incompetent. It is immoral,\" says Mr Gabuev. \"A state should be a service, not an idol.\"\n\nVote for change\n\nThe young elite is resentful of pretence, simulation and cynicism -- the staples of the current system. Instead they crave convictions and ideas. This was one reason why many Russians refused to cast a ballot on March 18th. Neither Mr Gabuev nor Mr Ovchinnikov saw any point in going to the polls. Ms Mostinskaya, by contrast, did. \"Participation gives you a right to act in the future,\" she says. Rather than backing one of the candidates, she spoiled her ballot paper by scribbling on the top: \"One day, even if not now, all this will change.\"",

                "body": "THE election was bound to be messy. But on March 4th Italian voters came up with a result that has surpassed the worst predictions, and cast a pall over not only Italy but the rest of the European Union, too.\n\nBoth chambers of parliament are hung, with no easy or quick way for anyone to achieve a majority (see article). More alarming is that half of the voters -- fed up with high unemployment, stagnant wages, uncontrolled immigration and a self-serving political class -- voted for the two main populist parties, the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the Northern League. Both are hostile to the EU and especially the euro, and both campaigned on lavish tax and spending promises that Italy cannot afford. Mathematically, no government can be formed without one of them. The previously governing Democratic Party (PD) lost well over half its seats, eliminating the option of a centrist coalition. The PD's drubbing was in part a rebuke to the vainglory of its leader, Matteo Renzi, who was trying again to become prime minister, despite losing a referendum on constitutional change in 2016. But the vote is also a rejection of the PD's attempt at economic reform, which Italy needs but apparently cannot stomach.\n\nThe PD may yet play the role of kingmaker. But the available kings are disturbing. M5S backs an unaffordable universal basic income and wants to scrap pension reforms. Its nebulous aims include transforming Italy into a direct digital democracy. It is led by a 31-year-old with no administrative experience and owes an unclear degree of allegiance to its founder, Beppe Grillo, a part-time comedian who began his political career with the cry of vaffanculo! (fuck off!) to the establishment.\n\nThe other king is no more appealing. The right-wing alliance that won 37% of the vote is dominated by Matteo Salvini, leader of the Northern League, whose party overtook Forza Italia, led by Silvio Berlusconi, a former prime minister whom we once called \"unfit to lead Italy\". Mr Salvini has shifted the League, which once advocated secession by the rich north, into a hard-right party allied with Marine Le Pen's National Front in France. He has called the euro a \"crime against humanity\" and has threatened the mass deportation of migrants who are stuck in Italian limbo because no one else in Europe will let them in. He also favours a budget-destroying 15% flat tax.\n\nFor the PD, the choice is between hemlock and cyanide. But refusing to give even limited support to either risks an even more gruesome possibility: an alliance between the League and M5S. Right now that seems unlikely. The League's traditional hostility to the poorer south, where M5S is strongest, makes such a pact hard. But unless the PD does a deal with someone, it may yet happen. Faced with deadlock, President Sergio Mattarella could seek to appoint a short-lived technocratic government. Or Italians may be asked to vote again. Neither option will solve much. Scheming to keep the populists out will only strengthen them; better to expose their empty promises by giving them some responsibility for governing. Whatever the outcome, Italy's public finances will probably weaken, while structural problems that have dragged down productivity and growth will remain untreated.\n\nFar beyond Italy's shores\n\nThis dismal result will be felt across Europe, where the rise of populists and the weakening of mainstream parties has become a theme. In Germany last weekend the centrists clung on to power, after members of the Social Democratic Party approved a new \"grand coalition\" with Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. Their coalition agreement includes measures to strengthen euro-zone governance, potentially providing more cash for infrastructure, a permanent fiscal backstop for its resolution mechanism for troubled European banks, and money to assist with structural reform.\n\nThis programme was always a hard sell to frugal north Europeans. In the light of Italy's vote for irresponsibility, it has become a much harder one. How many Germans want to shoulder more liabilities so that Italians can retire earlier?\n\nThe euro zone's third-largest economy has low growth and public-sector debt of about 130% of GDP. It is also too big to bail out. Italy poses a systemic risk to the euro unless it can reform itself. And on the evidence of last weekend, it can't.",

                "body": "IT IS everywhere, as visible as it is vilified. From car parts to crisp packets, plastic has suffused the Earth, and beyond -- in 1969 Neil Armstrong planted a nylon Stars and Stripes on the moon. More than 8bn tonnes has been produced since the 1950s, enough to wrap the continents in clingfilm four times over. Only 9% was recycled; 60% was dumped, mostly in landfills, too often in the natural world. Untold tonnes end up as irretrievable ocean flotsam, which sunlight and salt fragment into microscopic pieces that attract toxins and may be gulped by creatures that become seafood.\n\nPlastic weighs heavily on the mind, too. Nine in ten Europeans worry about its impact on ecosystems; three in four fret that it can harm their own health. In Britain hatred of plastic unites the right-wing Daily Mail, the leftie Guardian, and the queen, who has banned plastic straws from her castles. But hold on. The little scientists know about plastic suggests that although it is the most noticeable pollutant, it is far from the most harmful. Using less is at best a partial solution. A better answer is to collect more -- especially in Asia.\n\nRubbish data\n\nThe effects of plastic on nature and human health are hard to gauge. Most polymers are chemically inert. That makes them durable. It also makes them less likely to be a health risk to humans and beasts. As a pollutant, their impact is much lower than less tangible menaces. By one estimate, the environmental and social costs of plastic run to $139bn a year, chiefly from the greenhouse gases produced in its production and transport. The figure for farming is $3trn. Fertiliser run-off alone causes $200bn-800bn worth of damage to the ocean, compared with $13bn from plastic marine litter. Then look at the alternatives. A cotton tote bag must be used 131 times before its carbon footprint improves on that of a throwaway carrier bag.\n\nThis does not stop plastic from being a problem. But bans and penalties on plastic bags in rich countries may be better for the conscience than for the environment (see article). Prohibition makes sense in poor places like Bangladesh and Kenya that lack proper waste-management systems. It is less useful in tidy France where rubbish collection works smoothly. It would be more effective for rich countries to shore up their recycling industries. They may have little choice in any case. In January China stopped receiving imports of recyclable plastic waste. Because it took half the total traded around the world, that has left hillocks of the stuff piling up in the West.\n\nA carbon tax may spur recycling, which is less energy-intensive than producing virgin plastic. Mandating minimum recycled content in plastic containers, as California has since 1991, is also a useful tool. Governments could exempt second-hand polymers from value-added tax; after all, the tax has already been paid on the fresh source material.\n\nBut by itself, the West will not solve the problem. Among the ten biggest plastic polluters, all but two are in developing Asia. Together, they account for two-thirds of the plastic spewed into the ocean. Of these, only China could afford Western-style waste-management in the near future. Others are just waking up to the problem; before plastic began piling up, it reasonably seemed less of a priority for governments. Bangladesh may be able to copy India which, despite its 1.3bn people, falls outside the top ten thanks to armies of ragpickers. The rest, like Vietnam or Thailand, may be too wealthy for raddiwallahs, yet too poor for sophisticated rubbish collection. The rich world should focus its attention -- and resources, including charity -- on chivvying them along. That is the surest way to stem the plastic tide.",

                "title": "The rules-based system is in grave danger",
                "body": "DONALD TRUMP is hardly the first American president to slap unilateral tariffs on imports. Every inhabitant of the Oval Office since Jimmy Carter has imposed some kind of protectionist curbs on trade, often on steel. Nor will Mr Trump's vow to put 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium by themselves wreck the economy: they account for 2% of last year's $2.4trn of goods imports, or 0.2% of GDP. If this were the extent of Mr Trump's protectionism, it would simply be an act of senseless self-harm. In fact, it is a potential disaster -- both for America and for the world economy.\n\nAs yet it is unclear exactly what Mr Trump will do (see Briefing). But the omens are bad. Unlike his predecessors, Mr Trump is a long-standing sceptic of free trade. He has sneered at the multilateral trading system, which he sees as a bad deal for America. His administration is chaotic, and Gary Cohn's ominous decision on March 6th to resign as the president's chief economic adviser deprives the White House of a rare free-trader, signalling that it has fallen into protectionist hands. Not since its inception at the end of the second world war has the global trading system faced such danger.\n\nRough trade\n\nThis danger has several dimensions. One is the risk of tit-for-tat escalation. After the EU said it would retaliate with sanctions on American goods, including bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorbikes, Mr Trump threatened exports of European cars.\n\nThe second danger springs from Mr Trump's rationale. The tariffs are based on a little-used law that lets a president protect industry on grounds of national security. That excuse is self-evidently spurious. Most of America's imports of steel come from Canada, the European Union, Mexico and South Korea, America's allies. Canada and Mexico look set to be temporarily excluded -- but only because Mr Trump wants leverage in his renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement, which has nothing to do with national security. Mr Trump is setting a precedent that other countries are sure to exploit to protect their own producers, just as spuriously.\n\nIt is not clear whether other countries can respond legally when national security is invoked in this way. This puts the World Trade Organisation (WTO) into a rat trap. Either Mr Trump will provoke a free-for-all of recrimination and retaliation that the WTO's courts cannot adjudicate, or the courts will second-guess America's national-security needs, in which case Mr Trump may storm out of the organisation altogether.\n\nThe WTO is already under strain. The collapse of the Doha round of trade talks in 2015, after 14 fruitless years, put needed reforms on hold indefinitely. Disputes that might have been swept into a new trade round have fallen to the WTO's dispute-resolution machinery, which is too slow and too frail to carry the burden. The WTO has not kept pace with economic change. Investment is increasingly tied up in intangibles, such as patents and copyright, rather than physical assets, such as steel mills. Rules drafted for rich, market-led economies cannot always police state capitalism. The implicit subsidies China gives its producers were a cause of global gluts in industrial metals. No wonder that the world's second-biggest economy has been the focus of so much anger.\n\nWhatever the WTO's problems, it would be a tragedy to undermine it. If America pursues a mercantilist trade policy in defiance of the global trading system, other countries are bound to follow. That might not lead to an immediate collapse of the WTO, but it would gradually erode one of the foundations of the globalised economy.\n\nEveryone would suffer. Mr Trump seems to think trade is a zero-sum affair, in which a deficit is a sign of a bad deal. But the vast improvement in living standards after the second world war went hand in hand with a rapid expansion in world trade over eight trade rounds, each of which lowered barriers. Imports are in fact welcome, because they benefit consumers and spur producers to specialise in what they do best.\n\nWithout the WTO, cross-border trade would continue -- it is unstoppable -- but the lack of norms and procedures would leave disputes to escalate. The fewer the rules, the more scope for mercantilist mischief and backsliding. Trade policy could be captured by special interests. Military power would hold greater sway in trade disputes than economic fair play. Transnational investment could drain away. As a vast continental economy, America would lose less from this than other countries. It would nonetheless lose a lot, including a pillar of the system that has underpinned its post-war political influence.\n\nHow should the world get out of this bind? Even as Mr Trump behaves with astonishing irresponsibility, others must keep their heads. Some may impose limited retaliation -- that, after all, is how to treat bullies, and the threat to local manufactures will strengthen the hand of Republicans pressing Mr Trump to relent. But such action must be proportionate and limited. A tit-for-tat war with America would be disastrous.\n\nBack to basics\n\nThe more important task is to shore up support for trade. It would be comforting to think there is global backing to fix the WTO. But just now, there is not. The only new trade deals on offer are regional, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an 11-country pact signed this week that sets out to be a blueprint for trade modernisation. Although Mr Trump abandoned it, he has hinted he may reconsider, which would be a start.\n\nThe best way to help the WTO would be for its other members to co-ordinate any action, including bringing in a WTO complaint about Mr Trump's tariffs. Even though that may burden the WTO's court, it would be a vote of confidence in the idea that the global economy should be governed by rules.\n\nThe world is a long way from the 1930s, thank goodness. Yet ignorance and complacency have put the trading system in grave danger. Free-traders need to recognise that the WTO can help keep markets open in the face of protectionist lobbying, at home and abroad. It is vital they make the intellectual case for rules-based trade. That will not be easy. For the first time in decades, their biggest foe is the man in the Oval Office.",

                "title": "The lessons from Modi's attempt to formalise India's economy",
                "body": "FOR hulking bureaucracy, it is a thoughtful gesture. Each year the chairman of the Indian Central Board of Direct Taxation e-mails a \"Certificate of Appreciation\" to every resident who has paid over 100,000 rupees ($1,500) in tax. There are even helpful instructions on how best to print out this \"recognition of your contribution towards building of our great nation\", should you want to frame it.\n\nFret not for India's forests. In a country of 1.3bn, fewer than 400,000 of these precious testaments were awarded in the latest wave. Not many Indians make enough money to pay that kind of income tax, and many of those who do opt not to. Perhaps half of India's economic activity, and even more of its jobs, involve dodging tax. That is why Narendra Modi, the prime minister, has set out to formalise the economy. The results are hit and miss (see article). But they are clear enough to give other tax-catchers a guide to how they should cast the net.\n\nHaving a more formal economy makes sense. Taxes pay for public services. India's rampant informality is one reason why its tax-to-GDP ratio has been stuck at a measly 15% or so for decades, cramping education and health care. Formal jobs pay up to 20 times more than informal ones, by one government estimate, and formal firms are more likely to innovate, grow and export. Having people and businesses operate outside the rules, whether by dodging taxes or avoiding regulations, is an affront to the idea of a fair society.\n\nBut formality is easy to get wrong. Fetishising it can confuse means with ends. Countries tend to become more formal as they get richer because formal firms expand to displace informal ones. Hence a relatively smaller grey economy is more likely to be the outcome of rising prosperity than its precondition. Indeed, draconian policies to expand tax collection often hamper the very growth that brings it about.\n\nMr Modi's chief pro-formality policy was the \"demonetisation\" of most banknotes in 2016. The cost, several quarters of sub-par growth, outweighed the benefits. It caused such dislocation that it is hard to see others emulating it (even the pantomime central-planners of Venezuela rowed back after announcing that they would scrap their own banknotes). Throttling the informal sector meant hurting not just crooks and tax-dodgers, who were Mr Modi's targets, but also hundreds of millions scratching out a living in the jobs market of last resort. Most Indians would work in the formal sector if they could, but jobs are scarce. Rather than \"nudging\" them towards better behaviour, as policymakers are often advised to do, demonetisation was more akin to a cricket bat to the head.\n\nA better approach is to tempt people out of the shadows. A government scheme to provide bank accounts to all citizens, and have them linked to mobile phones and biometric national IDs, has turbocharged digital payments, which are easier to track and tax. Dealings with the authorities increasingly take place online, where it is harder to get shaken down for a bribe. That makes the prospect of being a formal business less terrifying. A newish goods and services tax entitles formal businesses to refunds that are not available in the grey economy. The number of firms registered has risen by 50%.\n\nCoax, don't coerce\n\nThe best results are those that lead to formalisation as a by-product of sensible rule-making. Small companies fail to grow into large (usually formal) ones because hundreds of unreformed labour laws make doing business legitimately a nightmare. Business taxes in India are among the highest in the world, or can be escaped only by using loopholes. Courts that formal businesses rely on often fail to help. Mr Modi is right that a more formal economy is a good thing, but he has overlooked the most effective solutions.",

                "title": "Italy goes to the polls with bleak electoral prospects",
                "body": "TO HEAR Italy's politicians tell it, the country is, if not quite out of the woods, then at least emerging into an unexpected clearing, blinking gratefully. Growth has returned, exports are up, some of the weakest banks have been repaired and even the migration crisis seems to be under control, thanks to a deal with Libya's warlords. Emboldened, the aspirants are outbidding each other to promise gifts to voters. Benefits will rise, taxes will fall and jobs will soon return.\n\nSadly, things are not quite so rosy. The deal with Libya is precarious, to say the least. Although the economy is expanding again, its recovery is much weaker than that of the other big euro-area economies. Output growth of 1.7% a year trails the euro-zone average by a full percentage point. Unemployment is still over 10%, and far worse among young people. Banks are sitting on large portfolios of non-performing loans. At around 130% of GDP, Italy's public-sector debt is still a huge burden, even as quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, which kept interest rates low, is coming to an end. The country is in poor shape to withstand the next downturn. Responsible, reforming government is as badly needed as ever.\n\nAlas, Italy is unlikely to get it on March 4th. The election that day is being fought using a new system that combines proportional representation with first-past-the-post contests in almost 40% of the seats (see article). Predictions are hard, but the signs point to a hung parliament, followed by a period of dealmaking, with a risk of things going seriously wrong.\n\nMost seats will probably go to an unsavoury right-wing coalition that consists of Forza Italia, led by a convicted fraudster, Silvio Berlusconi; the anti-EU and anti-immigrant Northern League; and a hard-right outfit called the Brothers of Italy. Fortunately, Mr Berlusconi cannot be prime minister. Because of his conviction he is barred from parliament, at least until next year. If the League wins more seats than Forza (polls have them near-tied), it will be the one pushing for the top job anyway. An administration led by its boss, Matteo Salvini, would spook markets and investors: he once described the euro as a \"crime against humanity\", and favours (as does Mr Berlusconi) a flat tax which would hit revenues hard. The party is soft-pedalling its traditional demand for northern separatism. It is now more of a far-right national party (allied with the National Front in France). The coalition, however, looks likely to come up short.\n\nThat might be either a relief or awful. A relief, because neither the 81-year-old Mr Berlusconi nor Mr Salvini is fit to lead Italy; awful because there is a small chance that Mr Salvini might in that case be tempted to throw in his lot with the Five Star Movement (M5S), another populist outfit that is led by a 31-year-old with no experience of running anything apart from a website. The most popular party in Italy, M5S is chiefly a protest movement. It has toned down its anti-Europeanism but has few credible policies and no ideological underpinning. The role of its founder and self-styled \"guarantor\", a comedian named Beppe Grillo, remains a mystery.\n\nIt has to be the Democrats\n\nIf The Economist had a vote, we would reject those woeful options and plump instead for continued government by the left-of-centre Democratic Party (PD). Under it, the country has at least been sensibly managed, and its \"jobs act\" introduced a few reforms into a system that still over-protects those with permanent jobs, encouraging companies to hire young people only on short-term contracts. However, the polls suggest that the voters, tired of years of austerity and PD infighting, will punish it at the polls. Barring a surprise, it will not be able to govern on its own.\n\nItaly is hopelessly stuck. The least bad way forward would be another \"government of the president\", a broad coalition underwritten by Sergio Mattarella, the head of state. For all the flaws of such a system, it has allowed Italy to muddle along since Mr Berlusconi stepped down at the height of the debt crisis in 2011. The current prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni of the PD, has been in office for just over a year, but has already shown the diplomatic skill to manage such an unwieldy beast. In Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy has been fortunate to have an astute finance minister who understands the need for fiscal discipline and reform. For Italy's sake, both of them deserve to stay in charge.",

                "title": "How the West got China wrong",
                "body": "LAST weekend China stepped from autocracy into dictatorship. That was when Xi Jinping, already the world's most powerful man, let it be known that he will change China's constitution so that he can rule as president for as long as he chooses -- and conceivably for life. Not since Mao Zedong has a Chinese leader wielded so much power so openly. This is not just a big change for China (see article), but also strong evidence that the West's 25-year bet on China has failed.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the West welcomed the next big communist country into the global economic order. Western leaders believed that giving China a stake in institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would bind it into the rules-based system set up after the second world war (see Briefing). They hoped that economic integration would encourage China to evolve into a market economy and that, as they grew wealthier, its people would come to yearn for democratic freedoms, rights and the rule of law.\n\nIt was a worthy vision, which this newspaper shared, and better than shutting China out. China has grown rich beyond anybody's imagining. Under the leadership of Hu Jintao, you could still picture the bet paying off. When Mr Xi took power five years ago China was rife with speculation that he would move towards constitutional rule. Today the illusion has been shattered. In reality, Mr Xi has steered politics and economics towards repression, state control and confrontation.\n\nAll hail, Xi Dada\n\nStart with politics. Mr Xi has used his power to reassert the dominance of the Communist Party and of his own position within it. As part of a campaign against corruption, he has purged potential rivals. He has executed a sweeping reorganisation of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), partly to ensure its loyalty to the party, and to him personally. He has imprisoned free-thinking lawyers and stamped out criticism of the party and the government in the media and online. Though people's personal lives remain relatively free, he is creating a surveillance state to monitor discontent and deviance.\n\nChina used to profess no interest in how other countries run themselves, so long as it was left alone. Increasingly, however, it holds its authoritarian system up as a rival to liberal democracy. At the party's 19th congress last autumn, Mr Xi offered \"a new option for other countries\" that would involve \"Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind.\" Mr Xi later said that China would not export its model, but you sense that America now has not just an economic rival, but an ideological one, too.\n\nThe bet to embed markets has been more successful. China has been integrated into the global economy. It is the world's biggest exporter, with over 13% of the total. It is enterprising and resourceful, and home to 12 of the world's 100 most valuable listed companies. It has created extraordinary prosperity, for itself and those who have done business with it.\n\nYet China is not a market economy and, on its present course, never will be. Instead, it increasingly controls business as an arm of state power. It sees a vast range of industries as strategic. Its \"Made in China 2025\" plan, for instance, sets out to use subsidies and protection to create world leaders in ten industries, including aviation, tech and energy, which together cover nearly 40% of its manufacturing. Although China has become less blatant about industrial espionage, Western companies still complain of state-sponsored raids on their intellectual property. Meanwhile, foreign businesses are profitable but miserable, because commerce always seems to be on China's terms. American credit-card firms, for example, were let in only after payments had shifted to mobile phones.\n\nChina embraces some Western rules, but also seems to be drafting a parallel system of its own. Take the Belt and Road Initiative, which promises to invest over $1tn in markets abroad, ultimately dwarfing the Marshall plan. This is partly a scheme to develop China's troubled west, but it also creates a Chinese-funded web of influence that includes pretty much any country willing to sign up. The initiative asks countries to accept Chinese-based dispute-resolution. Should today's Western norms frustrate Chinese ambition, this mechanism could become an alternative.\n\nAnd China uses business to confront its enemies. It seeks to punish firms directly, as when Mercedes-Benz, a German carmaker, was recently obliged to issue a grovelling apology after unthinkingly quoting the Dalai Lama online. It also punishes them for the behaviour of their governments. When the Philippines contested China's claim to Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, China suddenly stopped buying its bananas, supposedly for health reasons. As China's economic clout grows, so could this sort of pressure.\n\nThis \"sharp power\" in commerce is a complement to the hard power of armed force. Here, China behaves as a regional superpower bent on driving America out of East Asia. As with Scarborough Shoal, China has seized and built on a number of reefs and islets. The pace of Chinese military modernisation and investment is raising doubts about America's long-run commitment to retain its dominance in the region. The PLA still could not defeat America in a fight, but power is about resolve as well as strength. Even as China's challenge has become overt, America has been unwilling or unable to stop it.\n\nTake a deep breath\n\nWhat to do? The West has lost its bet on China, just when its own democracies are suffering a crisis of confidence. President Donald Trump saw the Chinese threat early but he conceives of it chiefly in terms of the bilateral trade deficit, which is not in itself a threat. A trade war would undermine the very norms he should be protecting and harm America's allies just when they need unity in the face of Chinese bullying. And, however much Mr Trump protests, his promise to \"Make America Great Again\" smacks of a retreat into unilateralism that can only strengthen China's hand.\n\nInstead Mr Trump needs to recast the range of China policy. China and the West will have to learn to live with their differences. Putting up with misbehaviour today in the hope that engagement will make China better tomorrow does not make sense. The longer the West grudgingly accommodates China's abuses, the more dangerous it will be to challenge them later. In every sphere, therefore, policy needs to be harder edged, even as the West cleaves to the values it claims are universal.\n\nTo counter China's sharp power, Western societies should seek to shed light on links between independent foundations, even student groups, and the Chinese state. To counter China's misuse of economic power, the West should scrutinise investments by state-owned companies and, with sensitive technologies, by Chinese companies of any kind. It should bolster institutions that defend the order it is trying to preserve. For months America has blocked the appointment of officials at the WTO. Mr Trump should demonstrate his commitment to America's allies by reconsidering membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as he has hinted. To counter China's hard power, America needs to invest in new weapons systems and, most of all, ensure that it draws closer to its allies -- who, witnessing China's resolve, will naturally look to America.\n\nRivalry between the reigning and rising superpowers need not lead to war. But Mr Xi's thirst for power has raised the chance of devastating instability. He may one day try to claim glory by retaking Taiwan. And recall that China first limited the term of its leaders so that it would never again have to live through the chaos and crimes of Mao's one-man rule. A powerful, yet fragile, dictatorship is not where the West's China bet was supposed to lead. But that is where it has ended up.",

                "title": "Bangladesh shows how to keep children alive",
                "body": "FOR adventurous travellers, it is merely an embarrassing nuisance. But among poor people diarrhoea is a killer. As many as half a million children are thought to die every year from enteric diseases, including cholera and dysentery. Repeated infections also weaken them, laying them open to attack from other killers such as pneumonia. Diarrhoea can even change a population's appearance. One reason Indian children are shorter than sub-Saharan African children from families of similar means is that they fall sick more often.\n\nSo it is delightful to report that one of Asia's poorest countries, Bangladesh, is making huge progress against this scourge (see article). In one part of the country with particularly good data, deaths from diarrhoea and other enteric diseases have fallen by 90% in the past two decades. Along with a far-reaching vaccination programme and steady economic growth, that has helped drive down the number of childhood deaths. In 1990 the under-five death rate in Bangladesh was 54% higher than the world average. Now it is 16% lower.\n\nIn a country with more than 160m inhabitants, this represents a vast decline in human misery. And Bangladesh's success holds lessons for other poor countries that are trying to beat back disease. The first is that cheap, simple, imperfect solutions are often good enough.\n\nIn an ideal world, with limitless cash and universally good governance, everybody would drink chlorinated water out of taps and flush their sewage through pipes into treatment plants. In the real world, however, you can go a long way with half-measures. Bangladeshi villages are studded with small pit latrines and tubewells for water. Most are built by the householders themselves, or by labourers whom they pay out of their own pockets. Although the tubewells are often alarmingly close to the latrines, that seems to be fine. Researchers have found that germs do not travel far underground. What matters is having lots of water pumps and lots of toilets. The more convenient they are, the more people will use them.\n\nA second lesson is that hardware is not enough -- the software of human behaviour is just as important. Bangladesh's neighbour, India, has subsidised and built a great many latrines. Despite that effort (and although the country is roughly twice as wealthy as Bangladesh per head) many Indians continue to defecate in the open. Bangladesh's government and charities have built latrines, too, but they have worked harder to stigmatise open defecation. Often they install latrines for the poor and then prod richer folk into following their example. A new, surprising, finding is that this works better than expecting people to copy their social superiors.\n\nMany lives have been saved by parents doing something simple. Beginning in the 1960s American military doctors and researchers in Dhaka developed a therapy for acute diarrhoea -- a sweet, salty oral rehydration solution. This is now dirt cheap and widely available. At the last count, fully 84% of Bangladeshi parents with stricken children fed it to them (only a third saw a doctor). Thinly populated African countries are struggling to match that. One promising idea is to distribute the sachets along with Coca-Cola -- which gets everywhere.\n\nBog standard\n\nThe simplest message is about the importance of basic hygiene. Bacteria often live on people's hands, and multiply on food. A mother in a poor country who hand-feeds cool porridge to her infant can introduce many more germs than the nipper would get from drinking water from a tap. Randomised controlled trials in Bangladesh and elsewhere have shown that teaching mothers to wash their hands and reheat food can wipe out most bugs. The training is cheap. The benefits, in disease avoided and lives saved, are enormous.",

                "body": "THE election in Egypt, which begins on March 26th, will have two candidates. One is Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the president, an ex-military man who seized power in a coup in 2013. The other is Moussa Mustafa Moussa, whose party fawningly supports Mr Sisi and who refuses to take part in a debate with the president because that would be disrespectful (see article). The election, in other words, is a farce.\n\nWhy, then, should Egyptians bother to vote? Mr Sisi's big claim is that he has restored order. In 2011 mass protests led to the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, a dreary despot. The next year Egyptians elected Muhammad Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, who tried to grab dictatorial powers and put his Islamist chums in charge of practically everything. He failed only because then-General Sisi toppled him. All this upheaval sent investors and tourists fleeing. Mr Sisi, who won an election in 2014, deserves credit for taking painful steps to stabilise the economy, such as cutting subsidies and devaluing the Egyptian pound. Without his firm hand, his supporters say, Egypt might have turned out like war-torn Iraq, Syria or Libya.\n\nThe fact that some other Arab countries are doing worse does not mean Mr Sisi is doing a good job, however. He oversaw the massacre of hundreds of Mr Morsi's supporters, and the jailing of tens of thousands of dissidents. Serious candidates who wanted to run against him were arrested or bullied into dropping out. Those journalists who have not been locked up are barred from asking Egyptians basic questions, such as \"Who will you vote for?\"\n\nFreedom will follow prosperity, says the president. But he is unlikely to bring much of either by the time he is mandated to leave office in 2022. Only after blowing through tens of billions of dollars of aid from the Gulf did Mr Sisi pursue economic reforms -- and then under pressure from the IMF, which bailed Egypt out in 2016. He is still throwing money at wasteful mega-projects, such as a dubious new capital in the desert, while Egypt's schools and hospitals crumble. The army is muscling into even more areas of the economy, crowding out private firms. Mr Sisi's vow to cut red tape has come to little.\n\nAs the largest Arab state, Egypt matters. That is why the West has lavished alms and arms on it, and overlooked its leaders' abuses. But donors' billions have not bought stability. Islamic State continues to attack churches and mosques and behead civilians in Sinai. A third of young Egyptians have no jobs. The police and security services routinely torture the innocent. This is a recipe for more upheaval one day in the future.\n\nNot another Mubarak\n\nEgyptian voters deserve a real choice. Alas, they will not get one. (And indeed, many are so fed up with turmoil that they say they prefer the predictable rule of a strongman to the messiness of democracy.) Given that Mr Sisi is sure to win, there are several things he can do to ease the tensions that threaten to rip Egypt apart. He could order the army to put more effort into fighting terrorists and less into dodgy money-making. He could help non-crony businesses grow and hire by tackling corruption and red tape. The IMF and other donors should twist his arm to pursue such reforms.\n\nMost important, Mr Sisi should overrule his most sycophantic supporters, who want to amend the constitution to let him run for a third, fourth or fifth term. Perpetual dictators bring stagnation and repression, not peace. Consider Mr Mubarak's 30-year reign -- and the way it ended. Egypt needs a system that allows the transfer of power from one leader to the next without violence. The constitution lays one out. Mr Sisi should obey it.",

                "body": "THE white beach of Dar es Salaam may seem enticing. Yet the bodies that have washed up on it, almost in sight of the city's glistening offices and hotels, are a sign of Tanzania's sickening lurch to despotism. Opposition politicians are being shot; activists and journalists are disappearing.\n\nUntil recently Tanzania's political stability drew investors and donors, spurring one of the fastest sustained streaks of economic growth in Africa. But John Magufuli, an authoritarian and erratic president in his third year in office, threatens to undo much that Tanzania has achieved over the past few decades. The rest of Africa, and the world, should not keep quiet.\n\nThe Teacher's flawed lessons\n\nTanzania matters, in part because of the aura of the late Julius Nyerere, its first prime minister, as a founding father of post-colonial Africa (he is still affectionately known as Mwalimu or \"Teacher\"). Like many other leaders of the time, he was an autocrat, instituting one-party rule on the ground that democracy was \"an over-sophisticated pastime which we in Africa cannot afford\". He impoverished a generation through his \"African socialism\". He nationalised companies and forced millions onto collective farms, burning their homes to stop them returning. The result was hunger and economic chaos.\n\nEven so, he sought to unite his country in a region where many clung to power by stoking tribal tensions. He was, in general, less repressive than many of his peers. And by sending his troops into Uganda, he got rid of Idi Amin, one of the world's nastiest dictators. More recently, with the restoration of multiparty democracy in 1994, Tanzania has been the darling of investors. Its output has grown on average by about 6.5% a year for the past decade. It has attracted foreign direct investment worth an average of 4% of GDP each year. Tanzanians are now about twice as rich as they were in 1990.\n\nYet this progress is imperilled by Mr Magufuli, who is transforming a stable, if flawed, democracy into a brutal dictatorship (see article). Officials have taken to making arbitrary demands for taxes. Businesses are shutting, exports are slumping, investors are fleeing and economic growth is forecast to slow.\n\nOutsiders have been shamefully mealy-mouthed. Africa is almost silent. America and the European Union recently expressed concern about political violence, but did not criticise the government directly. Nor did they threaten to take action if the repression continues. Some diplomats argue that a part-suspension of American aid in 2016 was ineffective. Aid officials worry that further cuts would hurt mainly the poor.\n\nThey could and should be more forceful. Three years ago European countries temporarily withheld about $500m over corruption. The government soon fired and charged officials who were implicated. Tanzania is Africa's third-largest recipient of Western aid (and the largest per person); 10-15% of its revenues come from Western countries as fungible \"budget support\". Multilateral donors are still tripping over one another to give it cheap loans and grants. The World Bank, for instance, has increased its allocation to Tanzania by $500m, to $2.4bn.\n\nFor Western donors to look away as Tanzania descends into oppression would be to discard much of its progress in recent decades. Most of all, Tanzania's neighbours need to act. Failing to stand up for the rule of law is to encourage other would-be despots to do their worst.",

                "body": "IN MOST countries a government that allowed $4.5bn to go missing from a state development agency would struggle to win re-election. If some $681m had appeared in the prime minister's personal account around the same time, which he breezily explained away as a gift from an unnamed admirer, the task would be all the harder. An apparent cover-up, involving the dismissal of officials investigating or merely complaining about the scandal, might be the last straw for voters. But in Malaysian elections, alas, voters do not count for much.\n\nUnder any reasonable electoral system, the coalition running Malaysia would not be in office in the first place. The Barisan Nasional, as it is known, barely squeaked back into power at the most recent election, in 2013. It lost the popular vote, earning only 47% to the opposition's 51%. But thanks to the shamelessly biased drawing of the constituencies, that was enough to secure it 60% of the 222 seats in parliament.\n\nThis ill-deserved victory, however, occurred before news broke of the looting of 1MDB, a development agency whose board of advisers was chaired by the prime minister, Najib Razak. America's Justice Department has accused him and his stepson, among others, of siphoning money out of 1MDB through an elaborate series of fraudulent transactions. Much of the money went on luxuries, it says, including paintings by Picasso and Monet, a private jet, diamond necklaces, a penthouse in Manhattan and a gambling spree in Las Vegas. In February Indonesia seized a $250m yacht that the Americans say was bought with Malaysian taxpayers' money. Authorities in Switzerland and Singapore have also been investigating.\n\nMr Najib denies any wrongdoing -- and of course he has loyal supporters. But his administration has not tried very hard to clear things up. Only one person has been charged in connection with the missing billions: an opposition politician who leaked details of the official investigation after the government had refused to make it public.\n\nAll this is unlikely to have improved Mr Najib's standing with voters. Yet an election must be held by August. Faced with the risk of losing power, the government is rigging the system even more brazenly. Parliament will soon vote on new constituency boundaries. The proposed map almost guarantees Mr Najib another term, despite his appalling record.\n\nHow to rig an election\n\nOne trick is gerrymandering, drawing constituency boundaries so that lots of opposition voters are packed into a few seats, while ruling-party supporters form a narrow majority in a larger number. Lots of this goes on in Malaysia, as elsewhere: the new boundaries put two opposition bastions in the state of Perak into the same seat. Gerrymandering is made even easier by another electoral abuse called malapportionment. This involves creating districts of uneven populations, so that those which support the opposition are much bigger than those that back the government. That means, in effect, that it takes many more votes to elect an opposition MP than it does a government one. The practice is so unfair that it is illegal in most countries, including Malaysia, where the constitution says that electoral districts must be \"approximately equal\" in size.\n\nNonetheless, the constituencies in the maps proposed by the government-appointed election commission range in size from 18,000 voters to 146,000 (see article). The Barisan Nasional controls all the 15 smallest districts; 14 of the 15 biggest ones are in the hands of the opposition. The average Barisan seat has 30,000 fewer voters than the average opposition one. And this is the election commission's second go at the maps -- the first lot were even more lopsided.\n\nUnfortunately, the electoral boundaries are not the only way in which the system is stacked against the opposition. The media are supine. The police and the courts seem more interested in allegations of minor offences by opposition figures than they are in the blatant bilking of the taxpayer over 1MDB and the open violation of the constitution at the election commission. The latest budget seems intended to buy the loyalty of civil servants, by promising a special bonus to be disbursed just after the likely date of the election.\n\nBut these biases, as bad as they are, are not the same as fiddling constituencies. As long as the electoral system is fair, Malaysians will be able to judge the government and vote accordingly. But a rigged system will rob their votes of meaning. That is the point, of course. Mr Najib may be venal, but he is not stupid. He fears that most voters would not return him to office if given a choice, so he is taking their choice away.",

                "body": "\"DESIGNED by Apple in California. Assembled in China\". For the past decade the words embossed on the back of iPhones have served as shorthand for the technological bargain between the world's two biggest economies: America supplies the brains and China the brawn.\n\nNot any more. China's world-class tech giants, Alibaba and Tencent, have market values of around $500bn, rivalling Facebook's. China has the largest online-payments market. Its equipment is being exported across the world. It has the fastest supercomputer. It is building the world's most lavish quantum-computing research centre. Its forthcoming satellite-navigation system will compete with America's GPS by 2020.\n\nAmerica is rattled. An investigation is under way that is expected to conclude that China's theft of intellectual property has cost American companies around $1trn; stinging tariffs may follow. Earlier this year Congress introduced a bill to stop the government doing business with two Chinese telecoms firms, Huawei and ZTE. Eric Schmidt, the former chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent, has warned that China will overtake America in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2025.\n\nThis week President Donald Trump abruptly blocked a $142bn hostile takeover of Qualcomm, an American chipmaker, by Broadcom, a Singapore-domiciled rival, citing national-security fears over Chinese leadership in 5G, a new wireless technology. As so often, Mr Trump has identified a genuine challenge, but is bungling the response. China's technological rise requires a strategic answer, not a knee-jerk one.\n\nThe motherboard of all wars\n\nTo understand what America's strategy should be, first define the problem. It is entirely natural for a continent-sized, rapidly growing economy with a culture of scientific inquiry to enjoy a technological renaissance. Already, China has one of the biggest clusters of AI scientists. It has over 800m internet users, more than any other country, which means more data on which to hone its new AI. The technological advances this brings will benefit countless people, Americans among them. For the United States to seek to keep China down merely to preserve its place in the pecking order by, say, further balkanising the internet, is a recipe for a poorer, discordant -- and possibly warlike -- world.\n\nYet it is one thing for a country to dominate televisions and toys, another the core information technologies. They are the basis for the manufacture, networking and destructive power of advanced weapons systems. More generally, they are often subject to extreme network effects, in which one winner establishes an unassailable position in each market. This means that a country may be squeezed out of vital technologies by foreign rivals pumped up by state support. In the case of China, those rivals answer to an oppressive authoritarian regime that increasingly holds itself up as an alternative to liberal democracy -- particularly in its part of Asia. China insists that it wants a win-win world. America has no choice but to see Chinese technology as a means to an unwelcome end.\n\nThe question is how to respond. The most important part of the answer is to remember the reasons for America's success in the 1950s and 1960s. Government programmes, intended to surpass the Soviet Union in space and weapons systems, galvanised investment in education, research and engineering across a broad range of technologies. This ultimately gave rise to Silicon Valley, where it was infused by a spirit of free inquiry, vigorous competition and a healthy capitalist incentive to make money. It was supercharged by an immigration system that welcomed promising minds from every corner of the planet. Sixty years after the Sputnik moment, America needs the same combination of public investment and private enterprise in pursuit of a national project.\n\nWhy use a scalpel when a hammer will do?\n\nThe other part of the answer is to update national-security safeguards for the realities of China's potential digital threats. The remit of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a multi-agency body charged with screening deals that affect national security, should be expanded so that minority investments in AI, say, can be scrutinised as well as outright acquisitions. Worries about a supplier of critical components do not have to result in outright bans. Britain found a creative way to mitigate some of its China-related security concerns, by using an evaluation centre with the power to dig right down into every detail of the hardware and software of the systems that Huawei supplies for the telephone network.\n\nSet against these standards, Mr Trump falls short on every count. The Broadcom decision suggests that valid suspicion of Chinese technology is blurring into out-and-out protectionism. Broadcom is not even Chinese; the justification for blocking the deal was that it was likely to invest less in R&D than Qualcomm, letting China seize a lead in setting standards.\n\nMr Trump has reportedly already rejected one plan for tariffs on China to compensate for forced technology transfer but only because the amounts were too small. Were America to impose duties on Chinese consumer electronics, for example, it would harm its own prosperity without doing anything for national security. An aggressively anti-China tack has the obvious risk of a trade tit-for-tat that would leave the world's two largest economies both worse off and also more insecure.\n\nMr Trump's approach is defined only by what he can do to stifle China, not by what he can do to improve America's prospects. His record on that score is abysmal. America's federal-government spending on R&D was 0.6% of GDP in 2015, a third of what it was in 1964. Yet the president's budget proposal for 2019 includes a 42.3% cut in non-defence discretionary spending by 2028, which is where funding for scientific research sits. He has made it harder for skilled immigrants to get visas to enter America. He and some of his party treat scientific evidence with contempt -- specifically the science which warns of the looming threat of climate change. America is right to worry about Chinese tech. But for America to turn its back on the things that made it great is no answer.",

                "title": "Welcome an electric world. Worry about the transition",
                "body": "OIL shaped the 20th century. In war, the French leader Georges Clemenceau said, petroleum was \"as vital as blood\". In peace the oil business dominated stockmarkets, bankrolled despots and propped up the economies of entire countries. But the 21st century will see oil's influence wane. Cheap natural gas, renewable energy, electric vehicles and co-ordinated efforts to tackle global warming together mean that the power source of choice will be electricity.\n\nThat is welcome. The electricity era will diminish the clout of the $2trn oil trade, reduce the choke points that have made oil a source of global tension, put energy production into local hands and make power more accessible to the poor. It will also make the world cleaner and safer -- reassuringly dull, even. The trouble is getting from here to there. Not just oil producers, but everyone else, too, may find the transition perilous.\n\nOil and electricity are a study in contrasts (see our special report). Oil is a wonder fuel, packed with more energy by weight than coal and by volume than natural gas (both still the main sources of electricity). It is easy to ship, store and turn into myriad refined products, from petrol to plastics to pharmaceuticals. But it is found only in specific places favoured by geology. Its production is concentrated in a few hands, and its oligopolistic suppliers -- from the Seven Sisters to OPEC and Russia -- have consistently attempted to drip-feed it on to the market to keep prices high. Concentration and cartelisation make oil prone to crises and the governments of oil-rich states prone to corruption and abuse.\n\nDifferent kettles of fuel\n\nElectricity is less user-friendly than oil. It is hard to store, it loses its oomph when shipped over long distances, and its transmission and distribution require hands-on regulation. But in every other way, it promises a more peaceful world.\n\nElectricity is hard to monopolise because it can be produced from numerous sources of fuel, from natural gas and nuclear to wind, solar, hydro and biomass. The more these replace coal and oil as fuel for generation, the cleaner it promises to be. Given the right weather conditions, it is abundant geographically, too. Anyone can produce electricity -- from greener-than-thou Germans to energy-poor Kenyans.\n\nTrue, the technologies used to produce electricity from renewable resources, and the rare earths and minerals that some, including solar panels and wind turbines, rely on, could be subject to protectionism and trade wars. China, which produces 85% of the world's rare earths, sharply tightened export quotas in 2010 with OPEC-like zeal. America and the European Union have slapped tariffs on Chinese solar-panel imports. Yet the vital substances involved in generating and storing electricity are not burned up like oil. Once a stock of them exists it can for the most part be recycled. And, even if today's output is concentrated, for most materials the planet has undeveloped deposits or substitutes that can thwart a would-be monopolist. Rare earths, for example, are not rare -- one of them, cerium, is almost as common as zinc.\n\nElectricity also rewards co-operation. Because renewables are intermittent, regional grids are needed to ship electricity from where it is plentiful to where it is not. This could replicate the pipeline politics that Russia engages in with its natural-gas shipments to Europe. More likely, as grids are interconnected so as to diversify supply, more interdependent countries will conclude that manipulating the market is self-defeating. After all, unlike gas, you cannot keep electricity in the ground.\n\nAn electric world is therefore desirable. But getting there will be hard, for two reasons. First, as rents dry up, authoritarian oil-dependent governments could collapse. Few will miss them, but their passing could cause social unrest and strife. Oil producers had a taste of what is to come when the price plunged in 2014-16, which led to deep, and unpopular, austerity measures. Saudi Arabia and Russia have temporarily stopped the rot by curtailing production and pushing oil prices higher, as part of an \"OPEC+\" agreement. They need high prices to buy time to wean their economies off oil. But the higher the oil price, the greater the incentive for energy-thirsty behemoths like China and India to invest in renewable-powered electrification to give themselves cheaper and more secure supplies. Should the producers' alliance crumble in the face of a long-term decline in demand for oil, prices could once again tumble, this time for good.\n\nThat will lead to the second danger: the fallout for investors in oil assets. America's frackers need only look at the country's woebegone coalminers to catch a glimpse of their fate in a distant post-oil future. The International Energy Agency, a forecaster, reckons that, if action to limit global warming to below 2°C accelerates in coming years, $1trn of oil assets could be stranded, ie, rendered obsolete. If the transition is unexpectedly sudden, stockmarkets will be dangerously exposed.\n\nThe tension is inescapable. On the one hand government policy should press forward with the transition as fast as it can. On the other, a rapid transition will cause upheaval. Expect the big consumers, especially India and China, to force the pace.",

                "title": "American foreign policy after Rexit",
                "body": "EVEN by the reality-TV standards of this White House, the manner in which Rex Tillerson was sacked as secretary of state was jaw-dropping. President Donald Trump fired him by tweet, saying that he would be replaced by Mike Pompeo, director of the CIA. He did not call him until much later, nor did he offer an explanation. Mr Tillerson's spokesman said that he had no idea why his boss had been fired. So he was fired, too.\n\nMr Tillerson was a poor secretary of state. Having run ExxonMobil, the tenth-biggest company in the world by revenue, he treated diplomacy like business and his department like a division ripe for restructuring. He seemed to regard his underlings as idle assets and they repaid him with their scorn (see article). So, too, did the president, at least after reports that Mr Tillerson had called him a \"moron\".\n\nThe new man, Mr Pompeo, has distinguished himself in Mr Trump's eyes by talking up a Trumpian, America First view of the world (see Lexington). The result may well be a more co-ordinated policy, with fewer public rifts between the State Department and the White House. But when you look at the two biggest tests facing American foreign policy, the new set-up does not inspire confidence.\n\nThe first of these is North Korea. Mr Trump's decision to kick-start negotiations by talking directly to Kim Jong Un is unconventional. A photo-op with the American president is a great prize for Mr Kim and, rather than holding it out as a reward, Mr Trump has chosen to give it away cheap. That is not necessarily a bad idea, given that other approaches have failed and that merely talking is a chance for him to reinforce deterrence by setting out his red lines.\n\nThe trouble is that, whereas the talks aimed at ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons will be delicate, complicated and technical, Mr Trump is impulsive and self-indulgent -- as this week's sacking of Mr Tillerson showed. Mastering the specifications of the North's programme and knowing how to blunt it require deep expertise. Any deal to ensure that the North does not cheat, as it has so often before, will need to be thorough and enduring. America must not enhance its own security at the cost of lower security for its allies in South Korea and Japan. And if the talks should come to nothing, as is likely, both sides will need to be sure that the bad blood does not lead to conflict.\n\nThe combination, to put it mildly, sits ill with Mr Trump's style of government. In a properly run administration, the fiddly stuff could be left to underlings. Yet America has no ambassador to South Korea and no under-secretary for arms control. Even if it did, it is not clear that Mr Trump would give them the time of day. He shows every sign of thinking that he has the flair to broker a breakthrough all by himself. There is a risk Mr Pompeo would seek to flatter his boss by agreeing.\n\nBy a curious symmetry, the second test of American policy involves a nuclear deal that Mr Trump seems determined to wreck. In May he is due to decide whether to stick with the agreement that curbs Iran's nuclear programme or pull out. Mr Pompeo, unlike Mr Tillerson, is a longtime opponent, as are many Republicans. A pull-out is therefore likely.\n\nThat would be a mistake. When it comes to deals, Mr Trump always believes that he can get a better one -- especially if they were negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama. But the Iran deal is already the result of hard-fought trade-offs. The chances that it can be substantially renegotiated are slim indeed. Opening it up in the hope that America can expand it to force Iran to limit its regional ambitions is almost certain to fail.\n\nIf America walks away, its European allies will stick with the deal but they will conclude that Mr Trump puts a low value on the transatlantic alliance. The nuclear agreement may not collapse immediately, but the odds would increase of a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East, as Saudi Arabia and Egypt began to prepare for the day when Iran had the bomb. And because of the symmetry, Mr Kim would surely be less willing to think he could trust an agreement struck with Mr Trump.\n\nIt's simple really\n\nTo hope that H.R. McMaster, the national-security adviser, who may shortly be fired himself, or James Mattis, the defence secretary, can be relied on to constrain the president is to clutch at straws. Mr Trump does not have a foreign policy so much as a worldview rooted in grievance and a belief that others must lose for America to win. He has his tariffs, his talks with North Korea and maybe soon a Middle East peace plan. The world is about to witness Trump unbound. What could go wrong?",

                "title": "Getting medicines to market faster",
                "body": "REGULATORS can be both a help and a hindrance to the medical industry. A strong regulator increases confidence in drugs and devices, reassuring payers and patients alike. That explains why the Chinese drugs regulator recently adopted tougher standards. Yet rules can also impose too great a burden on firms, slowing innovation and reducing competition.\n\nThe head of America's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Scott Gottlieb, has spent his first year in office tilting the balance away from rulemaking and towards efficiency. Some criticise Mr Gottlieb, who once worked in the industry, for still being its accomplice. Instead, he should be applauded. Nobody expects the FDA to solve America's messed-up health-care system, but its goal -- of making it cheaper and easier for promising drugs to reach patients -- is a step in the right direction (see article).\n\nOne thing Mr Gottlieb has been doing less of is issuing new regulations, which have dipped to a two-decade low. Instead, he has concentrated on two broad areas that will help the development of therapies and medicines. The first is to adapt the FDA to new technologies. There is a clinical revolution in such areas as gene therapy and printed organs. The FDA is keen to harness the potential of new technologies, whether that means using information from wearables in drug trials or enabling faster approval for new digital therapeutics.\n\nThe second focus has been on getting more drugs to market. The agency has approved a record number of generic drugs in the past year. By increasing the amount of competition, the idea is to bring the price of copycat drugs down. The profits of Indian generics firms, which have been making hay in the American market, are expected to suffer as a result.\n\nUnder Mr Gottlieb, the FDA is also doing its best to limit the extraordinary burden of introducing new drugs. The average cost of bringing a new medicine to market has jumped to $2bn, up from $1.2bn in 2010. After repeated expensive failures, many firms have cut funding for treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.\n\nIn response, the FDA wants to find ways to accelerate clinical trials. It is also looking at lowering the standard of efficacy, though not safety, which is required to approve certain treatments. Instead of having to demonstrate that long-term outcomes, such as cognitive function for dementia, are improved, a drugmaker might have to show only an improvement in a biological proxy for the disease, such as the presence of toxic proteins in the brain. This approach is already in place for cancer drugs. Its wider adoption ought to encourage innovation.\n\nInevitably, accelerating the path to market for pharma firms involves a trade-off. It may well be better to give people the option of a treatment in five years whose efficacy is known with 80% certainty than to wait 20 years for one with 99% certainty. But the shift increases the risk that money will be spent on new drugs that end up being no more effective than existing ones. This risk is particularly high in America, where the idea of paying for medicines on the basis of their actual performance is seen as an affront to patient choice. To get the benefit of faster innovation while minimising the risk of unnecessary spending, that attitude has to change. The FDA is doing its bit to speed innovation. But buyers of drugs need to do more to tie payments to health outcomes. The reality of paying too much for any new medical technology that does not work well is that there is less to spend on the things that do.",

                "title": "African countries are borrowing too much",
                "body": "TWO decades ago much of sub-Saharan Africa was frozen out of the global financial system. Reckless lenders had lent too much to feckless (and often unelected) governments. Crooked officials had stolen billions, stashed their loot abroad and left their fellow Africans with the bill.\n\nPlaces such as Ghana (with a public debt of more than 120% of GDP) and Mozambique (more than 200%), could not cover the interest payments on existing loans, never mind service new ones. Unable to borrow, such countries could not invest in roads, ports, schools and clinics. Pop stars and preachers campaigned for relief from \"odious debt\" that dictators imposed on their people. The IMF responded with a \"heavily indebted poor countries\" (HIPC) scheme, wiping out many of the debts of 36 countries, 30 of which were in Africa.\n\nIts success was remarkable. With the slate wiped clean, most African countries have been able to tap international markets for finance (see article). Helped by new loans and much better monetary policies, most sub-Saharan African economies have revived. Since 1990, three-quarters of them have posted at least ten years of uninterrupted growth (one-third have managed 20 years of it). Millions of children now attend schools financed with such loans. Millions more have had their lives saved because of vaccinations or clinics paid for with borrowed money.\n\nToo much of a good thing\n\nBad old habits have returned, however. As investors search desperately for yield, they have piled into African bonds. In 2013-16 the ratio of public debt to GDP in sub-Saharan Africa, as defined by the IMF, increased by an average of five percentage points a year for countries that do not produce oil, and eight for those that do. It is now above 50% in half of the countries in the region. That is modest by rich-world standards, but commercial interest rates are much higher in Africa. Since 2013 the number of countries that the IMF deems to be in \"debt distress\" or at high risk of it has doubled to 14.\n\nThis is hurting. Zambia now spends more on debt service than on education. Governments' insatiable appetite for debt is crowding out other borrowers. Local banks often find it easier to buy government bills than to do the hard work of assessing the creditworthiness of local businesses, which are asked to pay ruinous interest rates of 20-30%. The fate of banks is thus tied to the health of the government's finances, making the whole financial system brittle. Africa is not yet in a debt crisis. But if these increases are left to run for just a few more years, many African countries may find themselves stuck back in the debt trap they so recently escaped.\n\nHow then to avert such a crisis? The first step is for African governments to start tightening their belts. They should improve tax collection and borrow only to invest, not to fatten the pay of civil servants (as Ghana did) or to buy warships (as Mozambique did). Across sub-Saharan Africa, governments need to achieve fiscal consolidation of about 3-5 percentage points of GDP over the next five years, the IMF reckons.\n\nYet borrowers are only half the problem. Banks have been happy to arrange bond issues or loans for governments riddled with corruption despite warning signs that the money might be stolen. Many people suspect that is because they blithely expect the IMF to step in with bail-outs and austerity programmes that will mean that their lending is protected. And countries such as China have underwritten loans for infrastructure projects to project soft power and to keep their own construction firms busy.\n\nCurbing this moral hazard will not be easy. Rising global interest rates will limit borrowing, but increase the risk of default. Some creditors ought to suffer losses -- for example, those who threw money at obviously dubious state-owned ventures in Mozambique. The occasional default would make creditors more careful about handing out their money in future. But if too many countries were to stop paying loans, then risk premiums would rocket throughout Africa and starve the region of credit. That calls for organisations such as the IMF to speak out. They should resist the temptation to be tactful, and instead issue unambiguous warnings when countries are straying. It takes two to dig a debt trap, but only one to warn that it is time to stop shovelling.",

                "body": "WHEN Theresa May stood before the House of Commons on March 14th to set out her response to the use of a military-grade nerve agent to poison a Russian ex-spy, she seemed to describe what was almost an act of war by a rogue regime. The attack, she said, amounted to the \"unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom\". The attempt to kill Sergei Skripal, a former double agent -- and the poisoning of his daughter and a British policeman -- was \"an affront to the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons\".\n\nBritain's ultimatum for an explanation from Moscow had been contemptuously ignored. As a result, Mrs May announced a series of measures against Russia, starting with the expulsion of 23 members of the Russian embassy whom she identified as intelligence officers, the largest such clear-out in three decades (see article).\n\nWith a murky assassination attempt (see article), it was always going to be difficult for Britain to muster a credible response. Domestically, Mrs May certainly looked more the prime minister than Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, who seemed to want to minimise the blowback on Russia. In terms of deterrence, however, Mrs May has yet to rise to the gravity of the situation.\n\nBurden without proof\n\nThere may never be conclusive evidence that Russia's leader ordered the attack. Ambiguity and deception lie at the heart of his regime. Violence is often decentralised; the line between private and state is blurred. Russia, after all, is perfecting hybrid tactics short of overt warfare. All the Russian attacks listed by Mrs May -- the annexation of Crimea, the war in Ukraine, the meddling in elections, and the hacking of defence ministries in Denmark and Germany -- involved freelancers. That allows Vladimir Putin to claim, however implausibly, that he had nothing to do with them.\n\nBut Mrs May is surely right in arguing that the use of a nerve agent suggests either that the attack must have been carried out by the Russian state, or that Russia lost control of its stocks. A proper response must weave together the tools of government -- diplomatic, military, intelligence and, crucially, financial. On many of these Mrs May has responded more robustly than Tony Blair did following the fatal poisoning in 2006, with polonium, of another Russian ex-spook, Alexander Litvinenko. She is right, for instance, to take the attack to the UN Security Council, NATO, the European Union and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. She received plenty of rhetorical support. Action is less likely.\n\nMrs May can and should do more to go after the money of Mr Putin's cronies. She should expand the list of Russian figures and entities with which British businesses are banned from having dealings. Those on the current European sanctions lists have so far been mostly linked to the war in Ukraine. The list should more closely resemble America's register of \"specially designated nationals\" who are close to Mr Putin and derive their wealth from his favour. Those who loot the country and abuse human rights should be targeted.\n\nThe problem is partly one of will. Tougher sanctions may affect Britain's flagship oil producer, BP, which owns a 20% stake in Rosneft, Russia's state oil firm whose boss, Igor Sechin, is one of Mr Putin's closest allies (he is under American but not European sanctions). Britain also worries that more intrusive sanctions will affect the status of the City of London as a global financial centre. That fear is misguided. And yet, Britain's reluctance to act is likely to lead to impunity. To Mr Putin it will seem like weakness, and that may tempt him to attack again.",

                "title": "The Weinstein scandal is changing Hollywood for the better",
                "body": "IN OFFICES around the world, the scandal over Harvey Weinstein's depredations has obliged men to rethink their interactions with women. Many are struggling to decipher where the bounds of propriety lie (handshake or kiss?). In Hollywood itself, the furore has ruined reputations and ended careers. And film executives have been forced to reconsider not just workplace mores but the stories they choose to tell. It is a disorienting moment, but a promising one -- for female artists, the studios themselves and for their viewers.\n\nFor such a faddish industry, Hollywood can be amazingly ossified. Female characters may no longer be tied to train-tracks and rescued by mustachioed heroes, but they still tend to be stereotyped and marginalised. Male actors do most of the talking; women are far likelier to take their clothes off. That is in part because conventional wisdom among decision-makers holds that big-budget films with female leads are liable to underperform. Not coincidentally, from boardroom to writers' room to director's chair, the vast majority of those decision-makers are men. That the Academy Awards on March 4th will feature a woman nominated for directing is a rarity; that a woman has been nominated for cinematography is a first.\n\nNow the #MeToo movement has begun to redistribute power in Hollywood. Instead of being stymied by harassment, some women are being promoted; more are being given a chance to direct. At the same time there are signs that the studios are becoming squeamish about gratuitous sex and misogynistic violence, two staples of the silver screen (see article). To sceptics, those changes might look like woolly political correctness, or tokenistic positive discrimination. On the contrary, they are likely to be as good for movie-makers' profits as they are for female talent.\n\nThat is because Hollywood's chauvinistic assumptions about audience tastes are based less on scientific fact than on prejudice. Although women account for half of cinema-ticket sales in North America, for example, executives were so convinced that female-led action flicks were a turn-off that they hardly made any. The recent success of \"Wonder Woman\" -- the third-highest-grossing film in North America last year -- indicates a neglected market for strong female characters. Similarly, the triumph of \"Black Panther\", a chart-topper in the United States and abroad, has discredited another Hollywood shibboleth, namely that pictures with black casts could not succeed overseas.\n\nHappily ever after\n\nPerhaps female and minority viewers were once more tolerant of films that offered only caricatures of themselves, or omitted their likenesses altogether. Probably, many always felt short-changed, but Hollywood was too self-involved to notice. Now, however, the studios seem poised to learn from the hits these audiences turn out for, rather than dismissing them as outliers. Meanwhile women writers and directors are beginning to provide actors with more complex female roles -- a trend that the scandal has accelerated.\n\nAll this matters beyond Hollywood, because its products are not like other industries'. Television and films have vast power to shape the way their audiences see themselves and other people. If the Weinstein episode circuitously leads to more rounded depictions of women on screens around the world, this grim saga might find a sort of happy ending.",

                "title": "Treat Kim Jong Un's nuclear offer with caution",
                "body": "AFTER months when the prospect of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula seemed all too real, it is a relief that America and North Korea may soon start talking to each other. A flurry of diplomacy has paved the way for negotiations. North Korean athletes and cheerleaders attended the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang; South Korean officials went to Pyongyang and met the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un. However, when Mr Kim suggested on March 6th that talks might lead to him giving up his nuclear weapons, diplomats were astonished. The Trump administration's policy towards North Korea of \"maximum pressure and engagement\" has been all about the pressure. Here, many feel, is a chance to try some engagement.\n\nThat must be right. But past experience suggests that an ocean of scepticism is warranted (see article). In the past North Korea has used nuclear talks to win concessions and money in return for commitments it has then broken. Mr Kim, who inherited his throne from his equally despotic father and grandfather, may also have inherited their duplicity.\n\nDespite his macho posturing, Mr Kim is feeling the sanctions that America has applied as punishment for his testing of missiles and nuclear devices. China's unwillingness to risk the collapse of the North Korean regime has limited the bite of the sanctions, but new restrictions imposed by the UN are taking a toll. One sign was the scaling back of North Korea's winter military exercises, apparently to save fuel as imports of oil and refined petroleum products have become scarcer.\n\nThe rumours in Washington about a bloody-nose strategy to punish Mr Kim for testing nuclear weapons may also have got the dictator's attention. The administration denies having talked in those terms, but Mr Kim cannot rule out that President Donald Trump will order a pre-emptive strike on his nuclear facilities. The communist god-king knows he would have to respond, and for all his braggadocio he knows that escalation could lead to his own demise, as well as his regime's. Asked what had brought Mr Kim to the negotiating table, Mr Trump said: \"Me.\" For once, he may be right.\n\nNonetheless Mr Kim surely feels that he would enter talks from a position of strength. He already has a missile with the range to strike the United States and will probably soon be able to equip it with a thermonuclear warhead. He also has the conventional and nuclear firepower to devastate Seoul, South Korea's thriving capital. No one really wants to fight him.\n\nDon't hold your breath\n\nThe chances of the talks getting anywhere remain low. When Mr Kim suggests he would give up his nukes for the right security guarantees, he means the withdrawal of American forces from the south and the start of a process to reunite the peninsula on his terms. Neither is going to happen -- rich, democratic South Korea is not about to throw in its lot with a North still run by a tyrant. Still, Mr Kim hopes to divide the South from its American ally by making offers that will play well in Seoul, such as opening new lines of communication, bringing separated families together and co-operating on humanitarian projects. At the very least, he will be betting that he can give China and Russia the cover they need to relax sanctions.\n\nAmerica needs to show its allies (and China) that it is open to talks, while making clear that the demands North Korea is making in exchange for denuclearisation are unacceptable. Even if talks result only in measures that reduce tension and the risk of nuclear miscalculation, they will have been worthwhile. Alas, the State Department has just lost its point man on North Korea and it still has no ambassador in Seoul. Dealing with a despot requires diplomacy -- and diplomats.",

                "title": "Is inequality rising or falling?",
                "body": "WITH weak GDP growth and falling real wages, the government does not have much to shout about on the economic front. Ministers, however, have one choice boast. It may defy popular belief but Theresa May, the prime minister, says that \"inequality has been reduced to its lowest level in 30 years.\" Philip Hammond, the chancellor, likes to wheel out this figure whenever he can. He may do so again on March 13th when he delivers his spring statement, a half-yearly update on the economy, to Parliament. But there is one problem with the government's claim: it may not be true.\n\nIt is not that ministers are lying or massaging the figures. They appear to be referring to a release from the respected Office for National Statistics. The ONS's figures, in turn, have received the seal of approval from the official statistics watchdog.\n\nThe release reports the Gini coefficient, where 1 represents complete income inequality and 0 represents complete equality. Unlike some other measures of inequality, such as the ratio between incomes at the 90th and 10th percentile, the Gini takes in the entire income distribution. Many economists therefore like it. The ONS's measure suggests that in 2015-16 the Gini coefficient for disposable household income (that is, after tax is subtracted and welfare payments added), was 0.32. That is far higher than in the late 1970s, when the series begins. But it is indeed the lowest since 1986, as Mrs May claims.\n\nBut economists question the ONS's figures. Though the government collects a huge amount of data on incomes, taxes and benefits, most related statistics are calculated with the help of surveys. For its inequality statistics, the ONS uses an annual survey of about 5,000 households, in which, among other tasks, every participant aged over 15 keeps a detailed record of their spending for two weeks.\n\nSurveys, though, are far from perfect -- and they are particularly bad at capturing the very rich, who matter hugely to inequality, since they are responsible for a big share of overall incomes. Tax data suggest that the top 1% of earners rake in up to a tenth of total household income, a higher proportion than in previous decades.\n\nThe ONS's survey, small as it is, will cover perhaps 50 households in the top 1%. What is more, plutocrats may not report their incomes accurately in the survey. Rich people appear more likely to downplay their earnings. Research suggests that the top 1% under-report their incomes by 10-20%. The upshot is that the ONS's measure of inequality may be inaccurate. (The ONS plans to tackle the problem in part by raising the number of people surveyed.)\n\nWhat does this mean for the government's claim that inequality is at a 30-year low? An alternative measure suggests that it is wrong. Wonks at the Department for Work and Pensions estimate the incomes of the very richest by supplementing their survey with data from tax returns. Because of the adjustment to top-income data, the DWP's figures are the gold standard for measuring inequality, according to Adam Corlett of the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank. They show that inequality is higher than the ONS believes (see chart). And they contradict the government's claim: in line with popular perception, income inequality has been creeping up.",

                "title": "Saudi Arabia launches a charm offensive in Britain",
                "body": "THE habitual reaction was to shy away. Saudi Arabia's princes used to shrink from Britain's press like women in purdah. A critical BBC documentary prompted King Khalid to cancel a trip to Britain in 1980. Royal visits, after all, were hunting season, rich in opportunities to bash the kingdom. \"Truth about the savage House of Saud,\" roared the Daily Mirror during the late King Abdullah's visit in 2007, arguing that flags should hang at half-mast \"in shame\" to receive a monarch who \"squandered [his wealth] on whores, palaces and private jets\". The Saudis responded with silence. Eliciting a \"no comment\" was an accomplishment. Everything was banned in the kingdom -- journalists most of all.\n\nBy contrast Mohammed bin Salman, the young Saudi crown prince who began his first official visit to London on March 7th, has ordered a PR blitz. Bright young Saudi graduates of Western universities staff the ranks of a new Centre for International Communication in Riyadh. Ministries have press offices for the first time. The three-day London trip includes a \"celebration of culture\" showcasing Saudi art, music and film, forms of expression that in the old kingdom might have merited a lashing. Saudi lobbyists have taken out ads in the papers (including this one) and placed billboards hailing \"the united kingdoms\" along London's arteries. Pop-up ads litter the internet with portraits of the young prince, claiming that he is \"empowering Saudi Arabian women\".\n\nThe charm offensive is an uphill battle. Protesters again made their voices heard, particularly on Saudi Arabia's bombing of Yemen, which was loudly denounced by a modest crowd outside Downing Street. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, again called for Britain's arms sales to Saudi Arabia to be suspended. Many of the papers that ran the kingdom's ads published critical editorials alongside them.\n\nBut Theresa May's Brexit-bound government cannot afford to upset prospective trade partners. British defence firms have done £4.6bn ($6.4bn) of business with Saudi Arabia since the kingdom began its bombardment of in Yemen in 2015. The London Stock Exchange is vying to handle the flotation of Aramco, the national oil company, which could be the world's biggest. Downing Street said the two countries were eyeing £65bn of \"mutual trade and investment opportunities\" in \"the coming years\".\n\nBritish diplomats in the kingdom sometimes chide journalists for widening the gap between the reality of life in Saudi Arabia and the country's bloodthirsty image. Under Prince Mohammed, the kingdom has improved access for journalists and expanded personal freedoms, particularly for women. But it still flinches at anything other than a fawning press. It excludes reporters for making unfavourable documentaries and muzzles local naysayers.\n\nThe prince's personality cult dominates roadside billboards and the airwaves. The chattering classes, who once loudly complained, now switch off their phones and whisper. Plainclothes policemen pretend to take selfies, while filming café gossip. And opinion-makers risk arrest not just for criticising the prince, but for failing to tweet government talking-points, according to some who have fled or been jailed. While the PR campaign goes on in Britain, Saudis are getting the charm offensive too, only sometimes minus the charm.",

                "title": "Britain holds Russia to account over the Skripal affair",
                "body": "THERESA MAY kicked off a dramatic week on March 12th with her Commons statement on the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia by a powerful nerve agent in Salisbury, a quiet cathedral city. The prime minister pointed her finger directly at Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, saying that either the Russian state had sanctioned the attack or it had lost control of a deadly poison. She gave the Russians until the end of the following day to produce an explanation before she concluded that Britain had been the victim of \"an unlawful use of force\".\n\nThis marked the return of the feisty politician who all but disappeared after June's election disaster. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour's leader, was feeble in his response. He called for dialogue with Russia and then veered into an attack on the Tories for taking money from Russian billionaires. Labour backbenchers were embarrassed at his misjudgment of this national moment. The exchanges also set in motion a process that put Salisbury at the centre of an escalating diplomatic row. It is as if a bunch of John le Carré characters had invaded a Trollope novel and put Barchester at the heart of an espionage thriller.\n\nMrs May won early support from the leaders of France, Germany and the European Union. Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, expressed Germany's \"full solidarity\". Emmanuel Macron, the French president, promised to stand behind Britain as it prepared \"to take concrete measures against Russia's breach of international solidarity\" (though later France said that it needed definitive evidence before taking any action itself).\n\nAmerica's response was also strong. After some hesitation that prompted Russian state television to claim that \"Trump is ours\", the president said he would support Mrs May \"all the way\". On March 14th his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, declared that America stood in absolute solidarity with Britain.\n\nMr Putin made no attempt to meet Mrs May's deadline. Sergei Lavrov, his foreign minister, dismissed Mrs May's allegations out of hand, accused her of behaving like a Soviet-era prosecutor, and refused to co-operate unless he was given access to the nerve agent. Russia combined defiance with self-pity. How dare Britain insult a great nation? The Russian embassy mocked Mrs May's assertion that it was \"highly likely\" that Moscow was responsible for the attack by creating a hashtag, #HighlyLikelyRussia, and suggesting that it was \"highly likely\" that Russia was responsible for the recent snow.\n\nOn March 14th Mrs May set out Britain's response in a second statement. Britain will expel 23 Russian diplomats identified as intelligence operatives, the biggest expulsion for 30 years. It will freeze Russian state assets known to be supporting dubious activities. It will strengthen its border defences against suspicious characters. It will not send dignitaries to the football World Cup in Russia this summer. Mrs May's speech was forceful. She was careful not to offer something she could not deliver and she laid the foundations for increased pressure through co-ordinated action with allies. Her biggest omission was any plan to target the wealth of London-based Russians linked to the Kremlin.\n\nMr Corbyn's reply did nothing to allay his own moderate MPs' fears that foreign policy could be his Achilles heel. He refused to condemn the Russian state directly for the Salisbury attack. He focused obsessively on the management and control of chemical weapons as if the problem were the device used to commit the crime, not the crime itself. He echoed Russia's demand for access to the nerve agent. He even criticised the government for cutting the Foreign Office budget, as if more money would have prevented the attack.\n\nLabour pains\n\nA Corbyn spokesman then further muddied the waters. He refused to say whether Mr Corbyn accepted Russian responsibility for the attack, questioned the security services' competence (\"there is a history between WMDs and intelligence which is problematic, to put it mildly\") and suggested that a former Soviet Union country other than Russia might have been behind the attack. \"The break-up of the Soviet state led to all sorts of material ending up in random hands\", he said.\n\nThis failure to put Labour firmly behind the prime minister underscored a huge concern about a possible Corbyn premiership. This is that Mr Corbyn's long history of making excuses for anti-Western regimes, particularly Russia, make him an unreliable custodian of British national security. It may also have reignited the civil war within the parliamentary party that was halted by Mr Corbyn's election success. A string of Labour MPs stood up to support Mrs May rather than their leader.\n\nEven before Mrs May spoke, the government said it would reopen inquiries into the deaths of other Russian émigrés who have died in Britain in mysterious circumstances. Some newspapers reported that there had been as many as 14 suspicious deaths. On March 12th another was added to the list: Nikolai Glushkov, a former head of Aeroflot, Russia's national airline, and a close associate of Boris Berezovsky, an oligarch who fell foul of Mr Putin and was later found dead in his home west of London.\n\nWhy has Britain responded more assertively to the Salisbury incident when it has turned a blind eye to similar ones in the past? Part of the answer is that it fits into a menacing pattern of an out-of-control state acting abroad without sufficient pushback. Partly it is because this atrocity was so egregious. Three people, including a police officer, are in critical condition, 40 more are being monitored for health problems, and parts of Salisbury have been sealed off. And some in the British establishment also feel guilty about the weak response to the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, when Britain dragged its feet and then expelled just four diplomats.\n\nKeeping up momentum after this week will be hard. The West, including Britain, has a sorry recent history of behaving like a paper tiger when confronted with Russian aggression, as Crimea and Ukraine show. Mr Putin is good at playing on divisions and using oil and gas as a weapon.\n\nRussia also has two other things on its side. One is that, since it is impossible to prove the Russian state's complicity, it is easy to drop two questions into the conversation. Why would Mr Putin go after such a low-level operative? And why would he do so just before an election and not long before Russia hosts the World Cup? The second is Brexit, which means that Britain is engaging in tense negotiations over its departure from the EU just when it needs its European allies' support.\n\nThere are plenty of ways in which Mrs May could trip up in the coming months. Critics say she should have been tougher still, especially over money. Yet this week at least marked a start of efforts to hold a rogue actor to account for attempted murder. It has also reopened divisions inside the Labour Party. It is a long time since Mrs May has looked so strong at home -- and Mr Corbyn so weak.",

                "title": "Rough sleeping in England has more than doubled",
                "body": "THERE is a new sight in London's posh Sloane Square, and not one that the well-heeled commuters scurrying to work care to linger over: a huddle of dirty tents, just outside a luxury menswear store. These are rough sleepers.\n\nOne of them, Tom, wearily pops his head out on a sodden morning. Originally from Folkestone, he split up with the mother of his children and came to London some months ago. Probably no more than 30 years old, he is in a bad way; an empty bottle of pills lies discarded by his filthy sleeping-bag. He has no idea how to get any official help, or where the nearest hostel is.\n\nTom's experience has become much more common. The number of rough sleepers in England rose from 1,768 in 2010 to 4,751 in 2017. These official figures are based on a single-night snapshot estimated by local authorities each November. Researchers at Heriot-Watt University put the total in Britain at about 9,000, and expect that number to rise by three-quarters over the next decade unless action is taken. More than 200,000 households in England are recorded as homeless, lacking adequate permanent housing, according to official figures.\n\nThe sheer visibility of so many rough sleepers, often in hotspots such as Bedford, Brighton and Cornwall, together with a recent spell of Arctic weather, has pushed their plight up the political agenda. Action is, indeed, promised. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, has called the situation \"disgraceful\". If elected he proposes to give local authorities the power to seize properties that are kept vacant, to house people. Theresa May's government has promised to reduce rough sleeping by half by 2022, and end it by 2027.\n\nOn April 3rd the Homelessness Reduction Act will come into effect, and may help ministers meet those targets. The housing minister, for one, must be expecting it to work. On March 4th Heather Wheeler promised that she would resign if the number of rough sleepers continued to rise on her watch.\n\nThere is widespread agreement on the main cause of the climb in rough sleeping. The most common reason used to be a change in personal circumstance, such as Tom experienced. Now, the prime cause is being turfed out of private rented accommodation. In London, the proportion of those citing this as their main reason for being homeless has risen from 11% in 2010 to 40%. In England as a whole the figure has risen from 14% to 32%.\n\nAs a consequence of austerity, housing benefits have been cut. At the same time rents have been soaring, especially in the affluent south. Thus many tenants have had to give up their flats. Under current provisions, \"priority\" cases, such as mothers with dependent children, have to be found somewhere to stay by local authorities. But non-priority people, mostly single older men, have to fend for themselves. Meanwhile the number of hostel beds available to the homeless has dropped since 2010, from 43,655 to 35,727.\n\nThose involved in helping rough sleepers point to other factors. Matt Downie of Crisis, a charity, argues that the gig economy doesn't help. People with irregular incomes and zero-hours contracts cannot budget properly for paying rent, nor save much for in case things go wrong. A growing number of rough sleepers simultaneously hold down jobs. Tom O'Connor, the head of Providence Row, which helps rough sleepers in east London, says that the proportion of women among them is also rising.\n\nThe new legislation may well help. It will oblige local authorities to offer advice and help to all homeless people, regardless of their level of priority or whether they have any local connection. Furthermore, the period during which a person threatened with homelessness can apply for help will be extended, from 28 days to 56. The best way to end rough sleeping is to prevent anyone starting in the first place, since the longer a person sleeps rough, the less likely they are to stop.\n\nThe question is whether there will be enough money to back up the law's sensible proposals. Sarah Makhlouf of Providence Row points out that they will require many more case workers. The government has promised councils £73m ($100m) to fund the legislation. Given the scale of the problem, many fear that will not be enough. Tom, and thousands like him, must be hoping that it is.",

                "title": "The Sun is toppled as Britain's biggest newspaper",
                "body": "\"RETURNS are a very big part of my psyche,\" admits Ted Young, the editor of Metro. He measures his success by the piles of papers that remain at the end of the day; only the best front pages, like those when David Bowie and Prince died, produce no returns. \"I can't stand seeing free newspapers left over,\" he adds. Thankfully for Mr Young, they are becoming a rarer sight. Figures released this month showed that Metro now has the largest circulation of any British newspaper, with 1.5m copies handed out every weekday.\n\nIt is a symbolic moment in the decline of Britain's rumbustious popular press. In 1931 Stanley Baldwin, then leader of the opposition, complained that newspapers increasingly aimed at \"power, and power without responsibility -- the prerogative of the harlot through the ages.\" By and large, they achieved it in the following decades. At its apex in 1994, the Sun sold 4.3m copies a day, many to swing voters. It was not afraid to throw its weight around: \"IT'S THE SUN WOT WON IT,\" boasted its front page after John Major, its preferred candidate, won the general election in 1992.\n\nMetro is cut from different cloth. Like other tabloids, its stories are pithy and celebrities omnipresent. But unlike the rest, its news is presented without a political slant, and there are no opinion columns. Commuters \"don't want to be picking up something they profoundly disagree with\", explains Mr Young. The result is a less abrasive read. Pages 12 and 13 for instance, are normally dedicated to readers' musings (\"Can commuters stop having their breakfast on trains?\" implores Keith, from Brighton). Politicians know they won't be stitched up. Metro was rare in getting interviews with all three main party leaders in last year's general election campaign.\n\nBut it seems unlikely that other newspapers will follow Metro's example. For one thing, because it breaks few stories it fails to conform to ink-stained hacks' journalistic ideals. For another, market dynamics are pushing paid-for papers in a more partisan direction, says Charlie Beckett, a media expert at the London School of Economics. Remaining readers are more likely than before to expect their newspaper to reflect their political views.\n\nNot that Metro will mind. It was launched by the owner of the Daily Mail in 1999 only as a defensive manoeuvre to prevent a Swedish firm from starting a similar paper. For much of its life it was \"a dirty little thing in the corner\" at its parent company, says Adrian Addison, author of a history of the Mail. Mr Young admits he is \"not going to win a Pulitzer Prize any time soon\". But his newspaper is turning a growing profit and it is now the most-read in the country. A less humble paper would make a big deal of it.",

                "title": "It could happen in Britain",
                "body": "IN HIS dystopian novel of 1935, \"It Can't Happen Here\", Sinclair Lewis described the rise of an American Caesar, Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip. Buzz easily defeats Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency by promising to make America great again. He then sets about destroying the country's system of checks and balances, by fomenting fear and unleashing activists, while sensible Americans comfort themselves with the belief that their country is immune to authoritarian takeover.\n\nDonald Trump's election has propelled Lewis's novel back onto the bestseller list and provoked a lively debate on the question of \"Can it Happen Here?\", the title of a new book edited by Cass Sunstein, a Harvard professor and former adviser to Barack Obama. It is time for Britain to engage in a similar debate. The British are even more confident than the Americans about their immunity to extremism. Britain hasn't had a violent revolution since 1640-60. Rather than rallying to Oswald Mosley's fascists in the 1930s, the British treated them as figures of fun -- black shorts rather than blackshirts, in P.G. Wodehouse's satire. But the next five years could test Britain's immune system to the limits.\n\nOne threat to the liberal order comes from Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. Mr Corbyn is a classic left-wing populist, convinced that life is a never-ending struggle between the virtuous masses and the wicked elites. Some of his main advisers are Marxists who regard political institutions as instruments of class power. Mr Corbyn became leader by bypassing Labour MPs and appealing to party activists. He has warned right-wing newspapers that \"change is coming\". John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called for a million people to take to the streets to protest against the result of last year's general election. High among Labour's priorities is repealing legislation that prevents co-ordinated strikes.\n\nA second threat comes from the incendiary right. Brexiteers invoke the \"will of the people\" to suggest that anything but their own maximalist interpretation of Brexit is illegitimate. Theresa May has revived an ugly 1930s trope about \"citizens of nowhere\". The Daily Mail has described judges as \"enemies of the people\". In a recent tweet Nadine Dorries, a Tory MP, labelled Sir John Major, the leader of her party in 1990-97, a \"traitor\".\n\nSuch extremism is self-reinforcing. Angry people feed on each other's anger, sensible people retreat into private life, and institutions are weakened in the tussle. This is already beginning to happen. Political activists are increasingly willing to bully their way to power. MPs -- particularly moderate ones -- report an upsurge in threats and smears. Intimidation is becoming routine on university campuses. On March 5th a group of masked protesters invaded and disrupted a talk at King's College, London, put on by the college libertarian society.\n\nThe cycle of extremism could get worse very quickly. Imagine that Mr Corbyn wins the 2022 election -- the most likely outcome -- and starts putting into practice his policy of encouraging the democracy of the street as well as the debating chamber. The Conservative Party might well respond to this by embracing British nationalism and unleashing its own street warriors. An epidemic of strikes and demonstrations could have the British public crying for a blond beast to restore order.\n\nBritain has weak formal defences against authoritarian populism. It is one of the few countries, along with New Zealand and Israel, that doesn't have a codified constitution to protect basic rights. Since Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973, European law has filled that void. But, as Vernon Bogdanor of King's College points out in a new pamphlet, Brexit will remove those protections. Britain is the only advanced country that is weakening rather than strengthening constraints on legislative power (Israel, for example, is at work on a codified constitution). It is doing so just as illiberal populism is on the rise.\n\nAt the same time Britain is vulnerable to global shocks. It has an open economy with a huge financial-services industry, a flexible labour market that acts as a magnet to foreign workers, and a capital city that houses some of the world's richest people. This economy is about to be subjected to one big shock, in the form of Brexit, and may well receive a second, in the form of Prime Minister Corbyn. All respectable forecasters agree that leaving the EU will reduce the rate of economic growth at least in the short term. The question is by how much. The combination of Brexit and a far-left Labour government could lead to a flight of capital, as investors seek safer havens and more predictable political regimes.\n\nFasten your seat belts\n\nThe biggest threat to British institutions, however, comes from a growing sense that democracy has let people down. Stephen Holmes of New York University points out that liberal democracy is a \"time-tested system for managing political disappointment\" -- once you've lost patience with the existing elite you can vote them out. But disappointment is surging, at a time when democracy's ability to manage disappointment is declining. Young people have been encouraged by policymakers to borrow to go to university, and schooled by internet firms that satisfaction is only a click away. But stagnant wages and rising house prices mean that even graduates can't live as well as their parents. And democracy, by its nature, cannot offer the instant satisfaction of Amazon. Yascha Mounk of Harvard points to disturbing polls. The proportion of Britons who support a \"strongman leader\" has increased from 25% in 1999 to 50%. The under-25s are much more critical of democracy than people of the same age were two decades ago.\n\nIt is too early to head for the exits. Mr Corbyn's bark may be worse than his bite. Brexit may be manageable. And Britain's informal defences against extremism may prove strong. Only this week Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of the fiercest Brexiteers, gave a brilliant defence of free speech in Parliament. But anyone who doesn't know where the exits are is a fool.",

                "title": "The rise of the Teesside Tories",
                "body": "THE process of making a parmo is not for the faint-hearted. A chicken cutlet is pounded flat, breaded, deep fried, covered in béchamel sauce and a thick layer of cheddar cheese, then grilled. Served with chips it weighs in at 2,600 calories, slightly over the recommended daily allowance for a grown man. It is a hearty snack that Teessiders are proud of inventing. Little wonder Ben Houchen campaigned for the parmo to be given protected status, alongside champagne and feta cheese, during his push to become the region's mayor.\n\nIt worked. A staunch defence of Teesside's culinary heritage, coupled with a plan to nationalise the local airport and overhaul the police, was enough for the Tory candidate to shock Labour and become the first mayor of the Tees Valley Combined Authority last spring.\n\nSince then Mr Houchen has revelled in his municipal empire, which encompasses 700,000 people and stretches from Darlington to Hartlepool. An avid Brexiteer, he has noisily campaigned for the local port to become a \"free port\", with a carve-out from Britain's customs regime. He controls an investment fund of more than £500m ($700m). Threats of compulsory-purchase orders have been issued to those in his way. \"I'm everything that an MP is, but I also have executive power and a big pot of money to do it,\" he says.\n\nTwo tasks face Mr Houchen, a stocky 31-year-old. The first is justifying the existence of the mayoralty, for which there was little public enthusiasm. Turnout in last year's election was only 21%. Agreeing to have an elected mayor meant extra central-government funding, including £59m at the last budget. Andy McDonald, a local Labour MP, labelled it Hobson's choice.\n\nHis second task is to turn Teesside more broadly Conservative. The river Tees is the historic border between North Yorkshire, a sea of rural Tory seats, and Durham, which is solid Labour land. In the general election last June, this political levee was expected to break in favour of the Conservatives. All the constituencies in the Tees Valley had voted to leave, one by as much as 70%. Mr Houchen's surprise win a few weeks before, in May, suggested that the Tories' time had come.\n\nBut a late Labour surge meant the breakthrough never came. \"I never in my wildest nightmares thought Labour would increase their vote,\" says Simon Clarke, who narrowly won Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland for the Tories for the first time. Mr Clarke's breakthrough was offset by the Tories' loss to Labour of Stockton South, a seat they had held since 2010. The stalemate leaves Teesside resembling British politics at large: a story of reorientation rather than revolution, with neither Labour nor the Tories able to break out.\n\nTo end the deadlock, the Conservatives have doused the area with political and financial capital. The chancellor has promised £123m to redevelop 4,500 brownfield acres on the south bank of the Tees. After the collapse in 2015 of SSI, a Thai-owned steelworks that had employed 2,200 people, the area was repackaged last year as the South Tees Development Corporation, under the aegis of the mayor. Although businesses such as the rump of British Steel remain, the area resembles an industrial graveyard with a defunct steelworks as a hulking metal tombstone.\n\nIt is here that the mayor's combination of bully pulpit and real powers, such as compulsory-purchase orders, comes into its own. Mr Houchen has a simple message for landowners: \"Play ball, or you can sod off.\" Theresa May, the prime minister, came for the South Tees site's grand opening last year. \"I am not blowing my own trumpet,\" says Mr Houchen, \"but I am the Tory in the north with the largest electoral mandate.\" There are six metro mayors in Britain, compared with 650 MPs. Their relative novelty opens doors to ministers.\n\nBeing a Tory mayor in Labour territory has its pitfalls. Mr Houchen must work with five Labour councils, which can be uneasy. Local MPs are sceptical about his plan for the airport, leading to the strange spectacle of Labour politicians -- including the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald -- opposing a Conservative-led plan for public ownership. \"The airport is the only thing in this country he [Mr McDonald] doesn't want to nationalise,\" wails Mr Houchen. But most planned works, such as upgrades to Darlington's railway station, are widely supported. Even the free-port plan is backed by local Remainer MPs such as Anna Turley (who notes that they are allowed in the EU).\n\nNot everyone agrees with the strategy. Dragging heavy industry back to Teesside risks tying the area to its history rather than preparing it for the future, says Paul Swinney from the Centre for Cities, a think-tank. There is a tendency to wallow in the past: the fact that a Teesside firm built the Sydney Harbour Bridge nearly a century ago is mentioned more often than the fact that today the area hosts a laboratory 1km underground off the coast at Redcar that is involved in the search for dark matter.\n\nMr Houchen would not be the first local politician to overpromise. A former mayor of Middlesbrough vowed to turn the area into Dubai-on-Tees. Optimism, however, is what the area needs, says Mr Houchen. Now it his job to justify it.",

                "title": "A growing share of offenders have dozens of crimes to their name",
                "body": "ON FEBRUARY 12th Patrick Ryan was sentenced to 12 months in prison for two counts of public disorder. He had been drunkenly ranting on a tram in Manchester about how everyone hates the Irish. At the hearing, the crown court judge noted that the defendant had been a \"persistent public nuisance\". In his 62 years Mr Ryan has racked up more than 500 offences.\n\nMr Ryan is an extreme example of a growing trend. The share of offences in England and Wales committed by those with more than 15 previous convictions or cautions increased from 13% in 2007 to 25% in 2017. A recent analysis by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) shows that petty crimes like theft are the most common among prolific offenders. As a result, they do short stints in and out of prison. The median length of their most recent time in custody is about six months, and the average gap between offences just over two years.\n\nExperts do not know exactly what is behind the shift. One explanation may be that police officers are choosing to pick up more serious and repeat offenders, rather than other criminals, says Harvey Redgrave of Crest Advisory, a consultancy. More crime exists than police forces can deal with, so they must be selective when picking their targets.\n\nAnother factor is that those convicted are more likely than before to serve time. Judges and magistrates have lost confidence in community service and dish out more prison sentences as a result. In 2007 community sentences were the most common form of punishment for serious crimes, making up 35% of the total. By 2017 that had fallen to 20%, as immediate prison sentences became more popular. An MOJ study found that community sentences led to less recidivism than custodial ones, when the type of crime is accounted for.\n\nPrison sentences are getting longer, too. The average stretch for robbery was 33 months in 2006. In 2016 it was 45. Other offences follow the same pattern. And as prison conditions have deteriorated, crime on the inside has spread. Longer, more violent stints may make it harder for prolific offenders to break the cycle, argues Frances Crook of the Howard League, a penal reform charity.\n\nPrisoners are then released to a stretched probation service. Reforms in 2015 meant that those serving less than a year were placed on probation after their release. As a result, they are under more scrutiny and thus more likely to be caught reoffending and hauled back to prison. At the same time, the probation system is struggling to offer basic services to help keep recently released prisoners on the straight-and-narrow. One in ten has no home to go to.\n\nWhat can reverse the trend toward prolific offending? One option is to send fewer people to prison, as Scotland is doing. Courts there operate on a presumption against sentences of less than three months. Last September Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, announced plans to extend the notional minimum to one year.\n\nReliable housing, steady work and strong family ties all help prisoners after their release. But they have to want to go straight too, says one ex-convict from London who had served two spells in jail for drug dealing. His old gang friends, many of whom are still frequently in and out of prison, laugh when he suggests they should clean up their act. He says he was lucky to be approached by Switchback, a charity, which helped him find work and stay out of trouble.\n\nHe was also fortunate to break the cycle after only a few convictions. The likelihood of reoffending increases with each new crime. Those with no previous record have a 7% chance of reoffending. For those with over 11 offences, the chance is 50%. By the time people have hundreds of convictions to their name, like Mr Ryan, another stint inside is almost inevitable.",

                "title": "Northamptonshire council has gone bust. Who is to blame?",
                "body": "THE glossy new offices of Northamptonshire County Council suggest an organisation on the up. Opened last October at a cost of £53m ($75m), One Angel Square looks more like the base of a tech giant than a local bureaucracy. Purple and lime-green walls spice up the open-plan workstations and obligatory atrium.\n\nIn fact the council is distinctly down on its uppers. Last month it was declared, in effect, bankrupt. A stop was put on all new spending except on vulnerable people, the first time this had happened to a council for nearly 20 years. On March 15th an official report recommended that the council should be dissolved, such is the magnitude of its failure. This prompted the resignation of Heather Smith, its Conservative leader. One Angel Square is to be sold, as part of an economy drive that will also close 21 of the county's 36 libraries.\n\nAfter years of being taunted by the Tories for the spendthrift antics of loony-left councils, it is payback time for Labour. Jeremy Corbyn, the party's leader, floored Theresa May at prime minister's questions on March 21st by asking whether the collapse of Northamptonshire was the fault of \"Conservative incompetence\" at a local level, or at a national level. In truth the episode exposes elements of both, and some fear that it will not be the last such case.\n\nThe government-commissioned report is scathing about the financial shenanigans in Northamptonshire. Budget management was \"an exercise of hope rather than expectation\"; the council's approach was \"sloppy, lacking in rigour and without challenge\". The rot set in after a damning inspection of children's services in 2013, where failures have so far cost £60m to put right. Most services were subsequently outsourced in an innovative \"Next Generation\" model, to save money, but this was poorly implemented.\n\nCircling the wagons, the county's seven Tory MPs have strongly backed the report, and its recommendation that two new unitary authorities should be set up to replace the county council. Others, though, argue that by blaming councillors for the disaster, the report lets the government off lightly. Jim Harker, the Tory leader of Northamptonshire until 2016, called it a \"whitewash\". Simon Edwards, head of the County Councils Network (CCN), a lobby group, agrees that it \"glosses over\" the government's role. The relentless cuts in central government support for local authorities, he argues, have contributed as much as anything to Northamptonshire's demise.\n\nSince 2010 all councils' budgets have been savaged. Central government funding for local authorities has fallen by about half since 2010. County councils have suffered most. The CCN calculates that county councils will see a 93% reduction in their biggest government support grant from 2016 to 2020; by the end of the decade they will be receiving an average of £161 per person, whereas the figure for London boroughs, for example, will be £459. Matt Golby, acting leader of Northamptonshire, estimates that since 2010 it has lost £390m, cumulatively, from its budget.\n\nMeanwhile, demand for services has risen. Northamptonshire's population of over-65s grew by 12.5% in 2013-16, the fastest rate in the country, increasing the pressure on social care. The county has also added 16,000 school places since 2010. These are mostly funded centrally, but local government still has to pick up a tab.\n\nNorthamptonshire compounded its problems by freezing its council tax, already low, for three years. To make ends meet, it dipped into its reserves. The National Audit Office has warned that other councils are doing the same, a practice that is not \"financially sustainable\". It estimates that a tenth of all councils with responsibility for social care could empty their reserves within three years if they carry on spending at the rate they did in 2016-17.\n\nWhat happens next in Northamptonshire is up to the communities secretary, Sajid Javid. He could send in commissioners to turn the council round. In the longer term, however, Mr Golby argues that politicians must acknowledge the \"massive impact\" of austerity, and agree that the country needs a \"fundamental review of government funding of local councils\".",

                "title": "The trouble with open v closed",
                "body": "ONE of the biggest ideas to hit the political world in recent years is that politics is increasingly defined by the division between open and closed, rather than left and right. Openness means support for both economic openness (welcoming immigration and free trade) and the cultural sort (embracing ethnic and sexual minorities). Closedness means the opposite.\n\nThis argument, which The Economist explored in a cover article a couple of years ago, has recently been reinforced by the launch of a new think-tank, Global Future. Global Future marked its arrival with an opinion poll which suggests not only that the open-closed division is the most salient one in British politics, but that \"open\" has time on its side. There is a 51-percentage-point difference between the under-45s and the over-45s on the question of whether immigration is a force for good, for example.\n\nOpen v closed clearly matters. Donald Trump won by promising to put America first. But Bagehot is reluctant to give it the same force as the old distinction between left and right. The division is too self-serving for comfort. It looks more like ammunition for a political war than dispassionate analysis, and thereby contributes to the polarisation that it claims to diagnose. There are also too many facts that don't fit.\n\nConsider Brexit. Remainers regard it as the quintessential revolt against the open society. Yet some of the most prominent Leavers, such as Daniel Hannan and Douglas Carswell, are classical liberals who regard the European Union as a protectionist bloc that is bent on subsidising inefficient industries. It is true that the UK Independence Party thrived on fears of immigration. But at the height of its popularity it received only 4m votes, whereas 17m voted to leave. A poll of 12,000 Leavers found that their main motive, cited by 49%, was democratic self-government. By their own lights they were voting against a closed elite in favour of open and accountable government.\n\nThe most obvious problem with the open-closed theory is that the divide is so slippery. Few people support entirely open societies -- it would be perverse to allow Ebola victims to cross borders unimpeded. By the same token, few people advocate becoming a hermit kingdom like North Korea. Nor are open and closed necessarily opposites. Having a strong border can make people more open, by giving them a sense that they can manage openness. Historically, most of the world's great centres of commerce have been walled cities. Constantinople, the crossroads between east and west, boasted not just a formidable wall but an outer and inner harbour.\n\nAnd different forms of openness and closedness don't always go together. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is open when it comes to transgender rights and immigration, but closed when it comes to foreign companies owning British utilities, or trade unions operating closed shops. Many Brexiteers are the opposite.\n\nThe biggest problem with the open-closed divide, however, is that open people often aren't as open as they think -- indeed, they are open in so far as it serves their interests and no further. The young cosmopolitans celebrated by Global Future are closed when it comes to giving a fair hearing to social conservatives. Try opposing gay marriage in a college bar and you will discover the meaning of Herbert Marcuse's phrase \"repressive tolerance\".\n\nThis is even clearer in economics, where open people cluster in industries that have been less affected by globalisation than manufacturing. Steelworkers have been upended by competition from China. Public-sector bureaucrats have not been touched. Supposedly open people have also protected themselves from competition by constructing a wall of licences, restrictions and other barriers to entry. The post-1979 deregulation of the economy was one-sided. Working-class closed shops, such as that of the printworkers, were broken, while professional closed shops, notably for barristers, were left to thrive.\n\nAcademics like to think of themselves as open to their core. But academia is rife with restrictive practices. The most highly prized commodity in academic life is tenure -- that is, the right to an income for life whatever happens to the world. University towns have some of the strictest planning laws around, so that insiders see the value of their most important asset soar. Academic publishers make their profits by rolling several sorts of rent-seeking together. They get free content because academics have to publish to get tenure, and a guaranteed market because academic libraries have to buy their books and journals. Bankers have similar double standards. Critics rightly point out that they are arch-globalists when the market is on the up, but then turn to national governments when it crashes. But the problem runs deeper. Like other industries, finance is rigged from the inside by firms that invest in lobbyists and hire ex-politicians who still wield influence.\n\nThe real divide\n\nThere is a better explanation of political polarisation than the open-closed split. It is the gap between exam-passers and exam-flunkers. Qualifications grant access to a world that is protected from the downside of globalisation. You can get a job with a superstar company that has constructed moats and drawbridges to protect itself, or with a middle-class guild that provides job security, or with the state bureaucracy. Failing exams casts you down into an unpredictable world of cut-throat competition.\n\nExam-passers combine a common ability to manage the downside of globalisation with a common outlook -- call it narcissistic cosmopolitanism -- that binds them together and legitimises their disdain for rival tribes. Exam-flunkers, meanwhile, are united by anger at the elitists who claim to be open as long as their jobs are protected. They are increasingly willing to bring the system crashing down. Talking about open v closed is a double error. It obscures the deeper forces dividing the world, and spares winners by playing down the legitimate concerns of losers.",

                "title": "Britain is slowly acquiring a pro-vax movement",
                "body": "MANY parents may have fond-and-itchy memories of chickenpox parties. At these events infected children played with healthy ones, helping to strengthen immune systems. Now such shindigs face dwindling guest lists as more people pay to be vaccinated against chickenpox and other diseases.\n\nChildren are entitled to free vaccinations on the National Health Service for some diseases, like polio. For high-risk groups, such as those with long-term conditions, the list is extended. But where jabs are not covered, parents must pay.\n\nNo organisation tracks data for private immunisation, but the industry reports that demand is rising, on the back of more awareness. Emma Caudwell of MASTA, a vaccination provider that operates in over 170 private clinics, says that annual sales of chickenpox jabs have grown by about 10% in each of the past two years. Superdrug and Boots, two pharmacists, and MSD, a pharmaceutical firm, also note growing demand. So do doctors in private clinics.\n\nOne reason is that chickenpox can be quite severe, says Claire Friel, a mother from Glasgow whose daughter was vaccinated last year by a private doctor. Parents are keen to shield children from this. Convenience also plays a part. The share of children growing up in households where all adults work has risen from 49% in 1996 to 59% in 2017. Fewer parents can stay home to nurse a child. They may prefer to stump up £130 ($181) for a chickenpox vaccine. Ms Caudwell notes that the market is growing fastest in affluent areas.\n\nAdults are also receiving more shots privately. That is partly because more Britons are travelling abroad, often to exotic places, says Katy Peters, head of the London Vaccination Clinic. The number of foreign trips by British residents has risen 70% since 1996. That boosts sales for travel vaccines unavailable on the NHS, such as yellow fever. And, with the average wait to see a family doctor now around two weeks, some happily pay to avoid delay.\n\nAnother increasingly popular vaccination is for Meningitis B, a rare but potentially deadly disease. The NHS offers the vaccine to children born after May 2015. But for older children, the jab costs about £220. In February 2016 two high-profile cases of children contracting the disease triggered a surge in interest. James Moore, head of a private clinic in Exeter, says that in the week after the stories broke the phones were jammed. The next week, it had a waiting list of over 800.\n\nThe unexpected uptake led to a national shortage of Meningitis B jabs, with some clinics sourcing pricier vaccinations from abroad. Such setbacks are common. Only a handful of companies make vaccines, which can take a few years to cook up. Firms struggle to meet sudden surges in demand. Problems with batch production, such as failing safety tests, can also interrupt supplies.\n\nPharmaceutical firms influence demand, too. This was highlighted in a chickenpox campaign by GlaxoSmithKline, a drug firm. Posters showed a pox-ridden and forlorn-looking child with a caption reading \"Mummy, you said spots wouldn't hurt me\". For a growing number of parents, the image strikes a chord.",

                "title": "The troubling surge in English children being taken from their parents",
                "body": "NOBODY in the courtroom looks glad to be there. Not the social worker, nor the barristers, nor the judge, and certainly not the mother with learning difficulties who is about to have her baby taken from her. She was neglected by her own mother, an alcoholic, and raised partly by foster carers. \"I had a horrid life,\" she tells the court. Now she is struggling to look after her own baby. The official solicitor, who represents people who lack mental capacity, neither supports nor opposes the council's case. The baby will be put up for adoption; the mother will have no further contact, save for a letter twice a year. \"I wish you well,\" says the judge. \"I'm very sorry that's the outcome.\" The hearing lasts 50 minutes.\n\nSince the English courts lost the power to sentence people to death in 1965, arguably the most invasive ruling judges can make is the removal of a child from his or her parents. For much of the 20th century, judges used this power often. But the number of cases fell sharply in the 1980s and early 1990s as policymakers began to argue that families should be kept together.\n\nNow the pendulum has swung back. English councils are asking judges to make more care orders than at any time in the past three decades. In the last fiscal year they made 134% more such requests -- mostly to place children with foster parents, and sometimes to adopt them -- than they did ten years ago (see chart). More than 100,000 children were in the care of the state at some point last year, more than half of them because of abuse or neglect. Comparative data are sparse, but Britain appears to foster more children than most rich countries; it adopts far more domestically born children than the European average, though fewer than America.\n\nAre more children in need of protection than before? The child homicide rate, one grisly measure of welfare, has been falling. And the number of children indicated by councils as being at risk of physical or sexual abuse has dropped in most years since 1995. Yet the number listed as being at risk of neglect (the main reason why children are removed from their parents) or emotional abuse, has risen. Anthony Douglas, head of Cafcass, a government agency that represents children in care cases, thinks the rise in care orders is a \"very good thing\", since it means more children are being removed from \"deeply traumatic\" situations.\n\nSome argue that deep spending cuts since 2010 have made it harder for the poorest families to cope. Whereas councils are required to provide emergency child-protection, they have no duty to teach parenting skills or to offer respite care or other services that could help to stop struggling parents from becoming neglectful ones. As their funding has been cut, many councils have pruned such programmes. About 1,800 centres for children and young people have closed since 2010, claims the Association of Directors of Children's Services, a group of social workers. Some councils that have maintained spending have managed to buck the trend of rising care orders. In Leeds the number of care applications has fallen by 7% over the past decade, which the council attributes to the fact that it has continued to fill social-worker vacancies and keep children's centres open.\n\nYet an alternative interpretation of the national rise is that it does not reflect growing need so much as greater risk-aversion among social workers. Failure to take vulnerable children into care has resulted in some highly publicised tragedies. The London borough of Haringey was blamed for failing to prevent the death in 2007 of Peter Connelly, a toddler known in court as \"Baby P\", who suffered more than 50 injuries over an eight-month period. In 2008 Haringey's director of children's services, Sharon Shoesmith, was sacked (unfairly, a tribunal later found). The next year, care applications across England rose by 36%.\n\nThe government has responded to cases like Baby P's by encouraging teachers and police officers to make more referrals to social services. Today nearly one in ten children in England is referred for assessment each year. There is a danger that a bogged-down system will make mistakes. The risk-prediction model councils use for such assessments was introduced in 1988. A study that year of 10,000 families suggested that, under the model, 97% of parents whom the system would have flagged as potential abusers did not go on to harm their children (meanwhile, the system failed to highlight the risk posed by 17% of parents who later did).\n\nInspections of the council departments responsible for making the decisions do not inspire much faith. Nearly two-thirds of social-services departments were given the lowest two ratings (out of four) in their most recent inspection by Ofsted, the regulator, according to an analysis by the Social Market Foundation, a think-tank. Those councils taking more children into care tended to score worse. Only six of the 20 councils with the biggest increases in care orders won a \"good\" or \"outstanding\" billing, compared with a dozen of the 20 councils with the greatest decreases.\n\nHappier families\n\nSome believe the system needs an overhaul. In most cases parents do not dispute that they have neglected their child. The role of the court, then, is to balance options: would the child be better off with their parents or in care? \"You're gazing through a crystal ball,\" one social worker says. \"To do that in an adversarial court is just ridiculous.\"\n\nA big flaw is that social workers must juggle two sometimes contradictory functions. They begin as a family's helper but can morph into the chief witness against them. The adversarial system is also expensive, since the state pays for barristers for the council and the parents.\n\nIn Scotland cases are heard by a jury-like panel of volunteers. In Denmark the social worker submits a report to be evaluated by a panel of experts, politicians and a judge. Only the parent has legal representation and their child may be removed only if four of the five panellists agree. Yet barristers argue that such invasive cases require skilled legal experts on all sides.\n\nMore pragmatic reformers champion the broader take-up of two innovative schemes. One is Pause, which runs in 18 of 152 English councils and aims to prevent mothers who have already lost one child to social services having subsequent children taken away. Nearly a quarter of mothers in care cases have previously lost a child, and sometimes several (in one instance, eight children were taken in turn from the same mother). Women on the Pause scheme use long-acting contraceptives for 18 months, while receiving counselling and support to meet their housing or educational needs. The scheme's advocates argue that this leaves them better able to care for any children they may later choose to have.\n\nBecause Pause was piloted only in 2013, it is still too early to tell whether it is effective in the long term. But an evaluation last year by the Department for Education found that it had prevented at least 21 pregnancies among its initial cohort of 125 women. That alone will save councils at least £1.2m ($1.7m) a year, it calculated.\n\nA second initiative is family drug-and-alcohol courts, which 22 councils offer to addicted parents as an alternative to care cases. Parents see a judge fortnightly for six months for \"therapeutic\" rather than adversarial hearings. According to a report by Lancaster University in 2016, 37% of parents kept their children after going before such courts, compared with a quarter after conventional hearings.\n\nAt one drug-and-alcohol court, a mother arrives for her first hearing, cradling one nine-month-old twin in her arm as she pushes the other in a pram. Everyone sits in a semicircle. The judge tells the mother to picture herself at the school gate in five years' time, on her children's first day at school. \"It's not an unrealistic dream, is it?\" he asks. \"It is your right and we should be very careful before stopping a mother or father having that right. Work with us and make it happen.\"",

Eyn, a British startup, hopes to speed things up with a phone app. Passengers use the app to take a picture of their passport, then scan the chip which contains their facial biometrics. Finally, they take a selfie, to ensure the two faces align. Tapping their phone on electronic gates at the airport is then all that's required. Eyn reckons such gates might not even be needed, if sensors prove capable of reading passengers' faces instead. The firm is in talks to test its technology at the border.\n\nGovtech, or digital technology to improve public services, is a relatively new field in which Britain is busy. The amount of venture capital invested in govtech projects in Britain is on a par with that in the rest of Europe combined, according to PwC, a consultancy. Investment in the industry could grow from £6.6bn ($9.2bn) last year to £20bn by 2025, believes Public, which finances govtech startups, including Eyn.\n\nCalipsa, another startup on Public's books, is developing artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor CCTV. Humans struggle to monitor multiple screens at once, with the result that much CCTV goes unwatched. Using AI to spot potential infractions or suspicious behaviour, such as cars in bus lanes or people doing dodgy deals in dark alleys, frees human operators to focus on clips that have already been flagged. It could also cut costs. Calipsa reckons its software could reduce government spending on traffic surveys, for example, by 80%.\n\nNesta offers an incubation programme connecting startups to government departments. It is working with London councils on a pilot that uses machine learning to pinpoint landlords who are letting property without a licence. Nesta is also involved in a project to develop the use of drone technology in five cities. It says drones could help police to monitor crowds, or even deliver emergency medicine. Drones are already used by fire brigades; some helped to survey for damage at Grenfell Tower after the calamitous fire last year.\n\nOpaque procurement processes have made it hard for startups to win government contracts. The Cabinet Office is working on a service to put startups in touch with civil servants. The government has set up a £20m fund for startups interested in public-sector innovation. Later this year a team in the Government Digital Service will begin work to identify services that could benefit from technology. Andy Street, the mayor of the West Midlands, is offering a £20,000 prize and three-month pilot to startups with ideas for how to improve housing, employment and other areas. The test will be whether such pilots take off.",

                "body": "DURING the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016, gloomy economic forecasts by the Treasury were dismissed by Leavers as \"Project Fear\". Many now gleefully note that, at least in the short run, they proved spectacularly wrong. Ministers like Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, insist there are no downsides from Brexit.\n\nIt is thus odd that, unlike then, the government refuses to produce any official forecasts for Brexit. In December David Davis, the Brexit secretary, who had boasted of his department's rigorous impact assessments, told the Commons Brexit committee that they did not in fact exist. Yet early this year he had to share a leaked confidential draft of the government's own EU exit analysis with the committee, which has now published it on its website.\n\nThe analysis is comprehensive, looking at tariffs and non-tariff barriers as well as migration effects. It is based on three models for post-Brexit trade relations. These are the European Economic Area (EEA), which means staying in the EU's single market like Norway; a free-trade agreement (FTA) similar to the EU's with Canada; and trading only on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. Cumulative GDP growth in 15 years' time is trimmed in all three cases, by an average of 1.6 percentage points for the EEA option, 4.8 points under an FTA and 7.7 points on WTO terms (see chart). These numbers are similar to most outside forecasts.\n\nThe sectoral and regional effects of the models are striking. The industries that suffer most include chemicals, food and drink, cars and retailing. The areas of the country hit hardest include the north-east, the north-west and the West Midlands, all of which voted heavily for Brexit. London escapes relatively lightly. The public finances suffer too. The FTA option will add £55bn ($75bn) to annual public borrowing in 15 years' time.\n\nThe analysis also finds that offsetting gains from putative trade deals with third countries are relatively small. It concludes that an FTA with America would increase GDP by 0.2%. Free-trade deals with China, India, other Asian countries and Australia and New Zealand add only a little more. The model also finds that unilateral British trade liberalisation, a policy favoured by many Brexiteers, may mitigate losses under the WTO option by only 0.2% of GDP.\n\nMinisters offer two responses to these gloomy figures. One is that the work is incomplete and forecasts 15 years out are unlikely to be accurate. This is a fair point. Yet revisions are just as likely to make the results worse as better. In addition, the analysis does not include knock-on effects from lower productivity growth. It also assumes that Britain replicates all the EU's free-trade agreements, which may not be easy.\n\nThe second response is that the analysis does not model the government's preferred Brexit outcome, set out in Theresa May's Mansion House speech, for a more comprehensive free-trade deal than Canada's, including services as well as goods, with extra benefits from managed regulatory divergence. This too is a fair point. Yet in its draft negotiating guidelines for the future relationship, the EU rejects Mrs May's proposal. Instead, it suggests an FTA like Canada's, although it does propose to avoid any tariffs on goods.\n\nThe damage from Brexit is also highlighted in a new joint study from Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, and Clifford Chance, a law firm, that looks at business costs from tariffs and non-tariff barriers under a WTO-only option. The annual extra cost to British exporters is put at £27bn, or 1.5% of gross value-added. The burden falls mainly on chemicals, cars, food and drink, consumer goods and financial services. The hit to the EU is significant but lower, at 0.4% of gross value-added.\n\nSir John Major, a former Tory prime minister, has said he knows of no precedent for a government enacting a policy that makes the country poorer. Those talking up Project Fear would be more honest if they conceded that Brexit will do this, but argued it is a price worth paying.",

                "title": "Britain's stringent rules on medical cannabis harm patients",
                "body": "SATIVEX comes in a small brown glass vial. Each spray, delivered under the tongue or to the cheek, emits 100 microlitres of a solution including alcohol, peppermint oil and a mixture of THC and CBD, the active ingredients in cannabis. GW Pharmaceuticals, its manufacturer, insists it is a \"cannabis-based medicine\", not \"medical marijuana\", since it is made to exacting pharmaceutical standards. It nevertheless contains extracts from Cannabis sativa, the cannabis flower and plant, and some users report a mild high. It can be prescribed by doctors, most often to sufferers from multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nPartly as a result, fuzzy fronds are flourishing in British greenhouses. In 2016 Britain harvested 95 tonnes of legally grown cannabis, twice as much as a year earlier, and more than any other country. The International Narcotics Control Board, an independent monitor linked to the UN, reckons that Britain is the world's largest exporter of legal cannabis (in the form of medical products). And GW has another product, for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, under consideration by regulators in America and Europe.\n\nBut, unlike in some American states, those who use cannabis in its most basic leaf form to treat other illnesses run the risk of prosecution. Jon Liebling of the United Patients Alliance, a campaign group, recalls being busted a few years ago for growing a plant for him and his friends to treat illnesses, including anxiety and MS. \"The government had taken my medicine,\" he complains. Last October MPs joined activists smoking joints at a \"cannabis tea party\" outside Parliament to call for the legalisation of cannabis for medical use, which some define as having the right to grow their own.\n\nOthers hope for regulatory change, arguing that the road to market is too costly and unwieldy for a cheap herbal product. It requires approval by both the medicine authority and the Home Office. One policy adviser notes that GW Pharmaceuticals has an enormous first-mover advantage, having emerged from the process with a number of patents. Gavin Sathianathan of Forma Holdings, a firm that invests in medical-cannabis companies, says that Britain's restrictive laws are hindering the growth of the next big biotech industry.\n\nThe lack of competition not only denies patients access to medicine, it also pushes up prices. Although Sativex is licensed for the treatment of MS, in 2014 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises the National Health Service, decided its benefits were not worth the cost (a different decision was reached in Wales, where the drug is still available on the NHS).\n\nCutting red tape may thus be a sensible move by the government. \"If we're going to fight the war on drugs,\" says Mr Sathianathan, \"we should at least get the sick off the battlefield first.\"",

                "title": "Labour's problem with anti-Semitism",
                "body": "\"JEWS have no better friends in this country than the Labour Party.\" So said the Jewish Chronicle in 1920. Almost a century on the newspaper's tone has changed. When it emerged that Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was a member of a private Facebook group littered with anti-Semitic abuse, the Jewish Chronicle's editor penned a note of despair. \"We run far, far less about [Mr Corbyn] and Labour's anti-Semitism issue than the story probably deserves, precisely to avoid it dominating the paper.\"\n\nThere has certainly been plenty that could fill its pages. Mr Corbyn's \"unwitting\" membership of the Facebook group was the latest anti-Semitism row to embroil the party since he became leader in 2015. Earlier this month, the race to become general secretary was marred by anti-Semitic abuse of Jon Lansman, founder of the left-wing pressure group Momentum. A row over dealing with party members suspended for alleged anti-Semitism has rumbled for months. In 2016 Ken Livingstone, a former mayor of London, was kicked out of the party for suggesting that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism \"before he went mad and ended up killing 6m Jews\".\n\nNot everyone is willing to accept that Labour has a problem. Len McCluskey, the boss of Unite, Britain's biggest union and a strong supporter of Mr Corbyn, dismissed allegations of anti-Semitism as \"mood music\" and an attempt to undermine the leader. Even when senior figures admit the party's troubles, caveats soon follow. Andrew Murray, one of Mr Corbyn's advisers, told an audience of activists and left-wing hangers-on that \"there is anti-Semitism in the Labour Party\". But he added that such allegations, while justified, were also meant to \"destabilise the party and this needs to be challenged as well\". Instead, he went on, what was needed was a lesson in the differences between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.\n\nIsrael and Palestine loom large in the party's tortuous relationship with Britain's Jews. Mr Corbyn has dedicated much of his career to fighting for the rights of Palestinians. This has sometimes brought him into proximity with people who hold unsavoury views of Jews. While Mr Corbyn has never himself been accused of anti-Semitism, he has shared platforms -- and Facebook groups -- with those who have.\n\nThe struggle to disentangle anti-Semitism from fraught discussions over the Middle East is not unique to Labour, points out David Feldman, a historian of anti-Semitism at Birkbeck, University of London. Where parts of the left sometimes fail \"is in recognising anti-Semitism when it is in front of them\", he adds. \"The commonplace idea that racism is power can leave people poorly equipped to identify racism when it is directed at Jews in Britain.\" This blind spot is particularly egregious in a party that prides itself on its anti-racism, says Richard Angell, who runs Progress, a centrist Labour caucus. \"We would not tolerate it for any other group,\" he says.\n\nInternal rows about anti-Semitism have already hit the party electorally. While Labour made gains across London in last June's general election, Labour struggled in the \"bagel belt\" -- a group of constituencies in the north-west of the city with large Jewish populations. Data are sketchy, but a poll taken just before the election suggested that only 13% of Jews intended to vote Labour. Some 77% backed the Conservatives.\n\nLabour's attempts to solve its problem have been patchy. A report into anti-Semitism in the party by Shami Chakrabarti, a human-rights lawyer turned Labour peer, suggested such reforms as banning the term \"Zio\" and clearer disciplinary proceedings. Although it was derided as a whitewash by some, John Mann, a Labour MP who leads the all-party parliamentary group against anti-Semitism, welcomed the report. His only demand was that the party hurry up and implement it. Efforts to root out those accused of anti-Semitic slurs online have been slow and attracted unhelpful cries of witch hunts from a minority. A party should not be judged by its cranks, but by how it handles them. On this, Labour still falls short.",

                "body": "IT HAS been a dismal year for Britain's beleaguered high streets, and it is only March. After a barely festive Christmas, the intervening months have seen the collapse of Maplin, an electronics retailer, and Toys \"R\" Us in Britain. New Look, a fashion retailer, is struggling to survive after announcing the closure of 60 stores with the loss of 1,000 staff. Debenhams is axing a quarter of its management positions. Marks & Spencer, Tesco and other supermarkets are also shedding jobs. On March 8th the John Lewis Partnership, owner of John Lewis and Waitrose, announced that its profits last year had dropped by 77%.\n\nThe big stores and supermarkets have been struggling for a while, but it was once thought that restaurants and pubs might escape the carnage. One theory had it that consumers were spending more on going out and less on TVs and bed linen. Not so. Restaurant chains, in particular, are feeling the pain as much as anyone. In recent weeks Byron Burgers, Prezzo and Jamie's Italian have all started closing outlets (Prezzo 94 of them) as part of restructuring plans. Some may not survive. Posh Carluccio's has called in accountants to \"assess its options.\" On March 12th Casual Dining Group, owner of the Café Rouge and Bella Italia chains, unveiled an increased loss of £60m ($85m) for the year to May 2017.\n\nA rise in costs has aggravated the problem. Like retailers, restaurants have had to absorb new government-imposed burdens, including the national living wage, the apprenticeship levy for employers with a wage bill of over £3m and higher pension contributions. Restaurants have also been hit by the devaluation of the pound since the Brexit referendum, which has driven up the price of imported ingredients such as tomatoes and olive oil.\n\nHowever, it is also clear that some of the chains have brought troubles on themselves by expanding too fast. The number of restaurants with over ten employees rose by 13% in 2014 and 10% in 2015. Last year growth was still a robust 7%. The market has become saturated, especially for mid-market Italian eateries.\n\nRestaurants have also been slow to respond to the rapid rise in delivery services offered by firms like Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats. Cyril Lavenant, director of NPD Group, a market-research firm, has found that, whereas the restaurant market was flat in 2017, the home-delivery market grew by 11%. Deliveroo, which now has 15,000 delivery riders, claims that restaurants that have partnered with it have seen revenues grow by 30%. Yet while delivery firms are good for small restaurants, Mr Lavenant says that they create a dilemma for chains. Most profits in a restaurant come from alcohol and accessories like bottled water, so simply selling their food online risks cannibalising the business.\n\nRestaurants have also lagged behind retailers in offering \"experiences\", as the trade jargon has it, rather than the usual broccoli. This is how the more innovative retailers now try to differentiate themselves in a crowded market. It also lets them do something with their underused floor space.\n\nJohn Lewis, for instance, opened its 49th store in October with 20% of the space dedicated to eye tests, children's car-seat fittings and free styling services for men. Selfridges, another big department store, marked the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death in 2016 by performing \"Much Ado about Nothing\" in store, and last year it staged concerts. Waitrose hosts yoga classes, and Marks & Spencer mental-health drop-ins called Frazzled Cafés.\n\nRestaurants, argues Mr Lavenant, will have to offer more than just food. A few are already doing so. Pizza Express is converting more of its premises to live music and comedy venues. Some pubs now have \"escape rooms\", an idea imported from America. Whatever it takes.",

                "title": "Global Britain or globaloney",
                "body": "THE idea of a global Britain has become the foundation stone of Britain's post-Brexit foreign policy. Theresa May says Brexit \"should make us think of global Britain, a country with the self-confidence and the freedom to look beyond the continent of Europe and to the economic and diplomatic opportunities of the wider world\". Boris Johnson, Britain's foreign secretary, declares that \"whether we like it or not we are not some bit part or spear carrier on the world stage. We are a protagonist -- a global Britain running a truly global foreign policy\".\n\nBut what does the phrase mean? The Commons foreign affairs committee, newly energised under Tom Tugendhat, summoned the great and the good of the foreign-policy establishment to answer this question. The results were disappointing. Some confessed that they hadn't a clue. The Foreign Office submitted a memorandum consisting of little more than a set of aspirations with no details about how to put them into practice. Mr Tugendhat's committee worries that \"global Britain\" cannot be the basis of foreign policy because it is little more than an \"advertising slogan\". This columnist thinks the problem goes deeper. Global Britain is three badly thought out ideas rolled into one.\n\nThe first is that, thanks to its long history as a trading nation and imperial power, Britain is an irreducibly global country. Britain has a first-class army and a Rolls-Royce diplomatic service, with 154 embassies around the world. It is one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Britons play an outsized role in the most global markets -- not just finance but consulting, art and pop music. Britain is home to 91 Forbes 2000 companies, 52% more than France and 78% more than Germany. Even Britain's national sport, football, is thoroughly globalised, with foreign owners and foreign players.\n\nAll this is true up to a point. But Britain's diplomatic and military establishment is a bit like an aristocratic family that has inherited a crumbling pile in the country and insists on keeping up appearances. The defence budget has fallen by 20% in real terms since 2007. The Foreign Office's budget has fallen by even more. Many embassies in Africa consist of one man (or woman) and a dog. Look beneath the surface of Britain's global companies and you find a long tail of ill-managed firms that know nothing of global markets. Talk of \"global Britain\" fosters dangerous illusions. It encourages grandiloquent promises about intervening here and providing aid there. It also distracts attention from serious economic problems. A sensible government would try to do something about dismal companies that trap people in unproductive work, rather than dream of freeing Britain's successful multinationals from the (often imaginary) shackles of Brussels.\n\nThe second idea is that being global means embracing emerging markets. Since 2000 these have accounted for more than 60% of the world's economic growth. The European Union is the economic equivalent of a \"legacy system\": locked in the past, overburdened by entitlements and regulations, terrified of the creative destruction at the heart of capitalism. The emerging world, by contrast, is a bubbling cauldron of new opportunities and new consumers. The world's economic centre of gravity has moved from the Azores in 1980 to Iran today and is likely to reach Tibet by 2050. Britain needs to move with it.\n\nYet this idea rests on a false antithesis. There is nothing about EU membership that prevents Britain from taking advantage of these booming markets, as Germany does rather more successfully. Emerging countries can also be difficult places to do business with, sometimes because they are run by problematic regimes, sometimes because they are riddled with corruption. In recent years Britain has swallowed its principles to attract Russian business. Now it has little choice but to engage in a costly diplomatic row at a time when, thanks to Brexit, the false choice between Europe and the world is in danger of becoming real.\n\nThe Anglosphere delusion\n\nThe third idea is that \"global Britain\" means the Anglosphere. This embraces countries around the world that share a common culture because they were once part of the British empire. \"Outside the EU, the world is our oyster\", a Brexiteer once put it poetically. \"And the Commonwealth remains that precious pearl within.\" Supporters of this idea argue that the Anglosphere has deep roots in British history: in \"The History of the English-Speaking Peoples\", Winston Churchill argues that England is a global island, scattering its people around the world. But they also point out that it is attractively modern. It is global where the EU is regional, networked where the EU is bureaucratic, bottom-up where the EU is top-down. In short, it is a ready-made alliance linked by a common belief in free trade and by technologies that increasingly render distance obsolete.\n\nPankaj Ghemawat, of New York University, says there is some truth in this. All else equal, a common language boosts trade to 2.2 times what it would be without a common language, and colonial links can boost it to 2.5 times. But then the qualifications start. Excluding Britain, the Commonwealth's GDP is only 55% as big as the EU's. The effect of distance trumps the effect of culture by a significant margin. And colonial links cannot be relied on. Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, is less sentimental about British rule than his predecessor, Manmohan Singh, for example, and the American elite is less Anglophile than it was.\n\nThe phrase \"global Britain\" is well intentioned, designed to send a message that Britain is not withdrawing from the world by leaving the EU. It remains open for business, active on the world stage, bouncily cosmopolitan. But Britain needs to do more than remain open for business. It needs to work out ways of engaging without overstretching its abilities and of embracing globalisation without forgetting that it has downsides as well as upsides. Talking globaloney isn't going to help.",

                "body": "FROM behind the counter of his optician's shop on the north bank of the Kabul river, Noorullah looks anxiously at his ten-year-old son. He fears for the boy's education under the current government and -- worse -- for his life. In the past month terrorists from Islamic State and the Taliban have run amok in the city, killing 150 civilians. Police recently found a suicide vest at a nearby checkpoint. \"These attacks are good for the government,\" he says bitterly. \"They are the only reason it is still surviving. People are afraid to go on the streets and protest.\"\n\nPressure is building on the government of President Ashraf Ghani nonetheless. He has labelled a recent suicide bombing, which killed 105 civilians, as his \"9/11\". But the government does not seem capable of stopping the attacks. Its haplessness is emboldening critics. Mr Ghani remains in a stand-off with the governor of the northern province of Balkh, Atta Muhammad Noor, who in December refused his order to resign. On February 25th Mr Noor blamed the \"irresponsible\" and \"narcissistic\" government for the attacks.\n\nThe foundations of this administration were flimsy to begin with. When the presidential election of 2014 produced a stalemate between Mr Ghani and his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, America brokered a vague \"power-sharing agreement\" by which Mr Abdullah became chief executive (a post invented to mollify him). This staved off the threat of civil war. But it left the government in chaos as the pair vied for control, blocking or duplicating one another's appointments. It did not help that the two-headed administration emerged just after the departure of 125,000 foreign troops, an exodus that caused the economy to slow dramatically and prompted the Taliban to redouble their efforts to topple the government.\n\nMr Ghani's theoretical training for his job is unparalleled. In 2008, the thin, combustible academic co-authored \"Fixing Failed States\", a summary of his life's research into the construction of institutions in war-torn countries. The former World Bank official has since put some of his theories into action, stabilising the economy, opening up new trade routes with Iran, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, and recruiting a cadre of spreadsheet-friendly ministers.\n\nThe president is now trying to reduce bloodshed by offering to negotiate with the Taliban. This week he said he would be willing to recognise them as a political party and allow them to contest elections if they agreed to a ceasefire and worked within the constitution. The Taliban, who recently called for negotiations with America, have not yet responded to the offer.\n\nIn the meantime Mr Ghani is seeking to free Afghan politics from the half-nelson of strongmen. Whereas his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, used to entertain former warlords in the presidential palace, Mr Ghani has shunned them. His disdain is understandable. They treat state revenues as their own and consider themselves above the law. Among those he has sidelined is the vice-president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, who was accused last year of ordering henchmen to sodomise a political rival with an AK-47 rifle.\n\nBut the face-off with Mr Noor shows how difficult such figures are to dislodge, and how easily they can stir up trouble. Mr Noor has refused to surrender control of the main border crossing with Uzbekistan, from which he is thought to be earning around $90m a year. Instead, he is stoking divisions between Pushtuns like Mr Ghani and the country's many smaller ethnic groups, who formed the bulk of Mr Abdullah's voters in 2014. He has also joined an alliance of peeved strongmen, the grandly named Coalition for the Salvation of Afghanistan. At best the row is a distraction from the president's reforms, says Michael Kugelman of the Woodrow Wilson Centre, a think-tank. If it turns into a more concerted rebellion, he says, it will pose a grave threat to the country's stability.\n\nInstitutional reforms might help to defuse some of the political tensions. Under the power-sharing agreement, Mr Ghani and Mr Abdullah were supposed to have agreed on various constitutional amendments within two years, in part to formalise the position of chief executive (or prime minister). But it is not possible to amend the constitution without holding elections for local district councils, because the councils select delegates to a loya jirga, or constitutional convention. Local elections have, in turn, become mired in a dispute between the president and the legislature.\n\nAnother helpful step would be to allow candidates for the national parliament to run as representatives of a party, rather than as individuals. This could help Mr Ghani subdue the strongmen, says Tabish Forugh, a former official at the Independent Election Commission, by offering voters the chance to pick a platform, rather than a personality. Institutionalising parties would also make it possible to adopt a system of proportional representation, which might give those excluded from power under the current first-past-the-post system more of a stake in electoral politics.\n\n\"The next administration, with more credibility, can deal with these issues,\" says one official, who points out that it will be a tall order to hold the parliamentary election on time, under any electoral system. Plans to produce a proper electoral roll are well behind schedule, even though the vote is due in July.\n\nMeanwhile, ordinary Afghans see little improvement in their daily lives. Outside his tyre shop in central Kabul, Hassan Ali nervously wipes a knife against his knee. \"Even in the civil war I could eat,\" he says, \"but now I go hungry most nights.\" According to a survey conducted last year by the Asia Foundation, a think-tank, 33% of Afghans feel optimistic about the country's future; 61% are pessimistic. When Mr Ghani took office in 2014, the optimists outnumbered the pessimists by 55% to 40%.",

                "title": "Anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka signal a new social fissure",
                "body": "THE trigger was supposedly a road-rage incident, said to have involved members of Sri Lanka's Muslim minority, near the popular tourist destination of Kandy. A lorry driver from the country's biggest ethnic group, the Sinhalese, ended up dead. Angry Sinhalese mobs, urged on by Buddhist monks, began attacking mosques and businesses owned by Muslims, hurling rocks, burning tyres and setting fires, leading to at least two more deaths. In response Maithripala Sirisena, the president, declared an island-wide state of emergency on March 6th.\n\nThe emergency, which grants wide powers to the police and army, is preventive in nature and intended to reassure vulnerable groups, an aide to the president said. On March 7th authorities restricted access to social media to prevent the spreading of rumours and fomenting of further violence. Rajitha Senaratne, a cabinet spokesman, said the attacks had been organised, with many of the perpetrators bused in from other areas. He hinted that supporters of Mahinda Rajapaksa, a former president under whom Sinhala-Muslim clashes at Aluthgama in 2014 left several dead, were to blame.\n\nMr Rajapaksa, who relies strongly on Sinhalese nationalist backing, has enjoyed a recent resurgence in popularity. A new party he founded won 239 out of 340 contests at local elections on February 10th. In comments to media, he denied that the violence was part of a political conspiracy and blamed the government's failure to respond to social tensions.\n\nIt is the second time in as many weeks that violence has flared between Muslims and Sinhalese. On February 26th mobs rampaged in Ampara on the east coast after a video of a Muslim restaurant-worker confessing to adding \"sterility pills\" to food sold to Sinhalese women went viral.\n\nMuslims make up close to 10% of the population, with a high concentration in Kandy and the east. Sinhalese Buddhists account for 70%. The mostly Hindu Tamils constitute around 13%.\n\nThe biggest faultline in Sri Lankan society remains between Sinhalese and Tamils. In 2009 the Sri Lankan army ended 26 years of war by defeating the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who were fighting for an independent Tamil homeland in response to claimed discrimination by the Sinhalese. There is some mistrust between Sinhalese and Muslims too: many Sinhalese believe, wrongly, that the slightly higher birth rate among Muslims poses a threat to the continued demographic supremacy of the Sinhalese. But throughout the civil war Muslims and Sinhalese mostly coexisted peacefully.\n\nPolitical analysts fear that Sinhalese extremists are trying to transfer lingering hostility against Tamils onto Muslims (most of whom speak Tamil as their mother tongue). Many are small businessmen, easily painted as exploiting poor Sinhalese. Tisaranee Gunasekara, a columnist, warns, \"If we, the Sinhalese, fail Muslims as we failed Tamils, history will not forgive us, and will punish us with a new and a worse war.\"",

                "title": "Japan is trying to get doddering drivers to give up their licences",
                "body": "AFTER nearly half a century behind the wheel, Hisao Matsumoto, who is 85, is not ready to stop driving. He and his wife depend on their car to escape the confines of Hakone, the lakeside town where they live. Horror stories of pile-ups involving elderly drivers do not ruffle him. \"I'm not that old yet,\" he says. \"I still have 15 more years to go till I reach 100.\"\n\nMr Matsumoto is one of more than 5m drivers in Japan aged 75 or older. A million more will be on the roads by 2021. Unnerved, the police are trying to coax many out of their cars. Over-75s are twice as likely to cause a fatal accident as younger drivers, says the National Police Agency (NPA). Nearly half of older drivers who caused fatal accidents last year had signs of cognitive impairment.\n\nHundreds of older drivers turn the wrong way into motorways every year. In January an 85-year-old man steered his vehicle into oncoming traffic on a country road, hitting a car and mowing down two schoolgirls. Police believe he mistook the accelerator for the brake. The man's family said he had long resisted their pleas to hand over his keys.\n\nSuch stubbornness is common, notes Kazunori Iwakoshi, who heads an NGO that supports elderly drivers. Motorists now in their mid-70s were born after the war and helped drive Japan's economic rebirth, he says. Many have never had an accident and resent being cast aside.\n\nSince last March over-75s renewing their licences must take cognitive tests to screen for dementia. Tests are also mandatory after telltale violations, such as ignoring road signs. The NPA expects these changes to take 15,000 drivers off the road each year. It would also like to limit elderly drivers to cars with automatic braking systems.\n\nNagging families may be more effective. More than 250,000 over-75s surrendered their licences last year. Many were pushed down to the local police station by relatives, says Mr Iwakoshi. His organisation publishes a checklist for elderly drivers, aimed at getting them to gauge their responses themselves.\n\nThe Matsumotos are lucky. Hakone gives pensioners unlimited access to public transport for ¥10,000 ($94) a year. Thousands of elderly people are stuck in rural communities with no buses. Next year, Mr Matsumoto says, he may give up his car, which costs him over ¥500,000 a year. But he'll keep his licence just in case. He has just passed his driving test again.",

                "title": "In South Asia, Chinese infrastructure brings debt and antagonism",
                "body": "AT THE southern end of Laamu atoll in the Maldives, the palm-covered island of Gaadhoo guards the One and a Half Degree Channel, the passage for a good portion of the shipping from Africa to Asia. In 2015 Abdulla Yameen, the president, ordered Gaadhoo's several hundred villagers to move to the atoll's main island, Fonadhoo. Today Gaadhoo's jetty has crumpled into the sea, and copies of the imam's last sermons flutter about the floor of the abandoned mosque.\n\nIt does not look like a fulcrum of world events. Yet Gaadhoo, Maldivian politicians and foreign diplomats contend, will be the scene of the next stage of the Indian Ocean's great game. They say Mr Yameen has secretly promised the island to China, which will use it as a future military base. Excitable observers note that both India and America appear to be keeping an eye on the island. How else to explain the Indian air force pilots flying helicopters on behalf of the Maldives from the atoll's airstrip, or the nearby American-owned farm cultivating sea slugs for the Chinese market that is, surely, a CIA outpost?\n\nChina makes no secret of its interest in the Indian Ocean, which contains vital sea lanes along which a large share of its imports and exports pass. It has not been shy about trying to curry favour with littoral and island states through its Belt and Road Initiative, a massive project to invest in infrastructure along ancient and modern trading routes. The initiative is usually presented as a development scheme (see Free exchange) but has obvious geopolitical implications, too.\n\nSouth Asia could certainly do with better infrastructure, especially of a sort that might boost regional trade. Although the subcontinent has fast-growing economies and a population of 1.7bn, it is the least integrated region in the world. According to the World Bank, intra-regional trade accounts for less than 5% of the total, compared with 35% for East Asia and 60% for Europe. Intra-regional investment is less than 1%. That makes China's promise to build lots of roads, ports and railways especially alluring.\n\nIn the Maldives, a tourist mecca, China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) is building a 1.3km bridge that will link the airport island with Malé, the capital. Passengers currently make the crossing on rickety launches. CCCC, which has also built the Maldives' longest road, all 18km of it, is overseeing a massive expansion of the airport and the construction of a 25-storey hospital as well. In Hambantota in southern Sri Lanka, China has built both a gleaming (if empty) airport and a huge port. It is also completing an expressway linking the two to the capital, Colombo, where it has expanded the container port as well.\n\nThe Chinese commitment is greatest in Pakistan, an old ally, in the form of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Over $60bn has been promised, mostly for power stations to improve the country's infamous electricity supply but also for roads, industrial zones, pipelines and a deepwater port at Gwadar.\n\nYet doubts are growing as fast as debts -- China lends to countries rather than makes grants, and rarely at concessional rates. A condition of many loans is that Chinese companies get the business. A new paper by the Centre for Global Development in Washington, DC, identifies eight belt-and-road countries worldwide at \"particular risk of debt distress\". They include the Maldives, whose debt is probably over 100% of GDP, and Pakistan. (Other countries on the critical list include Djibouti, where China has its first overseas military base, Laos and Mongolia.)\n\nThe nature of the lending is usually murky. A Pakistani minister promises Gwadar will \"benchmark\" Singapore, but the port is controlled by a Chinese company, China Overseas Port Holding Company, about which almost nothing is known beyond a Hong Kong nameplate and the claim on its website to be \"emerging and fast growing\". Even before Mr Yameen shut down politics in the Maldives with a state of emergency last month, parliament had no oversight of contracts awarded to Chinese companies. \"We have no idea how much we really owe,\" says one MP.\n\nSri Lanka offers an idea of what happens next. The Hambantota schemes were vanity projects for the then-president, Mahinda Rajapaksa. His closeness to China was one reason for his surprise defeat in elections in 2015. A rising interest bill forced the government of his successor, Maithripala Sirisena, to agree on a debt-for-equity swap that gives China a 99-year lease on the port.\n\nHawks in India, the region's historical power, note that Hambantota, Djibouti and Gwadar, to which China has also won a long lease, are all close to those trade-clogged sea lanes. To them, debt default looks a handy way for China to win influence, and perhaps eventually bases, around the Indian Ocean. The arrival in Colombo of a Chinese submarine in 2014 was a wake-up call.\n\nOnly connect\n\nTo divine a long-planned Chinese conspiracy, however, is to run ahead of events. It is true that indebted South Asian countries will have no choice but to negotiate with China. But Pakistan insists Gwadar is not open to the Chinese navy. And India still holds cards, even as it fails to offer an economic alternative to Belt and Road. Under Indian pressure, Sri Lanka will not allow Chinese submarines back soon -- the Hambantota deal also excludes the Chinese navy. India has also helped raise concerns, notably in America, Japan and Australia, about Chinese intentions. The four are looking for ways to come together over a still vaguely defined \"free and open Indo-Pacific\", as a counter to China.\n\nThe danger, as Andrew Small of the German Marshall Fund, an American think-tank, argues, is that competition in the Indian Ocean becomes a zero-sum contest. To people in Delhi, China's investments seem intended to encircle India. Meanwhile, humiliating debt restructurings and rumours of corruption alienate locals. Far from spurring development and stability, Mr Small concludes, in South Asia Belt and Road risks stoking antagonism.",

                "body": "IT SOUNDS almost too ridiculous to be true. Two Burmese journalists are invited to dinner by the police, who hand them documents. As soon as they leave the restaurant, the pair are arrested by different policemen, apparently lying in wait. They are accused of breaking a colonial-era official-secrets law, enacted in 1923 and barely used since. In the early stages of the trial one of the policemen involved admits he burnt his notes. Another witness writes the name of one of the journalists on his hand, along with the street where the police say they arrested them, to help him remember what to say. The restaurant's owner says she never saw the two men, but then admits she would not have been able to see them from where she sits anyway.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not fiction. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who work for Reuters, were jailed in December and denied access to lawyers for two weeks. On March 7th they were hauled into court for the latest hearing. If found guilty they could face a prison sentence of up to 14 years. Their trial demonstrates just how far press freedom, which had seemed to be improving, has retreated under the government of Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy advocate whose National League for Democracy took over from a military regime in 2016.\n\nAt the time of their arrest Mr Wa Lone and Mr Kyaw were looking into the killings in September of ten men from the Rohingya Muslim minority in a village in Rakhine state. The report, published in February by Reuters while the two journalists were behind bars, suggests the army was responsible. In January the army released a statement acknowledging that soldiers had killed some captured \"Bengali terrorists\", although it claims they were under attack from 200 Rohingya militants at the time -- a claim Reuters could not find anyone to corroborate. The documents the pair say they were handed by the police relate to the conflict in Rakhine, from which 700,000 Rohingyas have fled since August.\n\nThe trial is not an isolated incident. Ms Suu Kyi appears to have little regard for freedom of the press. By one count, 29 journalists have been arrested since she came to power, although most have been released. Others have faced online abuse and death threats from Buddhist nationalists. In November two foreign journalists were charged under a similarly obscure law, the Aircraft Act of 1934, for flying a drone over the parliament building. Defamation laws are also being used more often. Other forms of dissent are being squashed too. On March 5th hundreds of people marched in the city of Yangon against proposed legal changes that would make public protests even harder to organise. Even if Mr Wa Lone and Mr Kyaw are acquitted, or if the case is dropped, the message to journalists is clear: report on the army's misdeeds, and risk years behind bars.",

                "title": "South Korea's president brought the Trump-Kim summit about",
                "body": "FOR good or ill, the fact that Donald Trump has agreed to meet Kim Jong Un, North Korea's dictator, is thanks in large part to the president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in. It was he who seized the hand proffered by Mr Kim early this year and used the Winter Olympics to cement goodwill. Mr Moon's announcement of a summit with Mr Kim next month -- only the third top-level meeting between the two Koreas and the first since 2007 -- was news enough when it broke. A hotline will also be established between the leaders of two countries that have exchanged more munitions than words in recent years.\n\nMr Trump's bombshell put those accomplishments in the shade. But it would not have happened had Mr Moon's envoys not returned from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, with an assurance from Mr Kim that he would put his nuclear weapons on the table. That is just what America has always demanded as a precondition for talks.\n\nNot even Mr Moon's friends -- and certainly not his detractors -- predicted his agility. At home, to be sure, the wind appeared to be at his back following his election last May. He came to power on the crest of popular protests that had led to the impeachment for influence-peddling of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye. To many South Koreans he represented a fresh start. For the young especially, Mr Moon's optimism, his squeaky-clean reputation and his intention to heal economic divisions promised much. But his talk about reaching out to the North Koreans had appeared naive, even dangerously ideological.\n\nSouth Korea's allies were wary. Mr Moon, who emerged from the pro-democracy student movement of the 1970s, cut his political teeth with the late president Roh Moo-hyun, an advocate of a \"sunshine\" policy towards North Korea. Some sunshiners were inclined to see the best in the North's brutal rulers. A few even saw the North's Stalinist state as more legitimate than South Korea's young democracy, tainted as it was by the original sin of American-backed dictatorship (Ms Park's late father was the longest-serving of the strongmen).\n\nThe sunshine policy sought to warm relations with the North in part by secretly transferring hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kims. It failed on its own terms, in that relations soon became chilly again. Worse, the money, in effect, helped pay for the North Korean nukes that are now at the heart of the peninsula's crisis.\n\nIn Tokyo those close to Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, spoke of Mr Moon with undisguised scorn. He was, they said, a nationalist of the worst sort, a weaselly leftie. Proof was his desire to reopen agreements reached between Ms Park and Mr Abe on the contentious issue of South Korean women forced into prostitution by imperial Japan. But the really serious issue, as seen from Tokyo, was the North Korean threat. It is over Japan, not South Korea, that North Korean missiles have flown. Mr Abe has been the strongest backer of Mr Trump's policy of \"maximum pressure\" towards the North. The likeliest wrecker of such a policy -- because he would cosy up to the North -- was Mr Moon.\n\nAmerican hawks also mistrusted Mr Moon. He has struggled to find a personal chemistry with Mr Trump, too -- unlike the golfing Mr Abe. Yet Mr Moon has defied expectations. As North Korea raised tensions with frequent missile tests last summer, he dropped his hug-the-North language. He firmly backed sanctions at the UN championed by America. He stood his ground in the face of bullying by China, which organised boycotts of South Korean firms in an effort to coerce Mr Moon into sending home American anti-missile batteries that it does not like. He revived an intelligence-sharing agreement with Japan and, though he complained of the sex-slave issue, appears not to want to reopen it. The reward for much of this was embodied in the extraordinary sight at the White House last week of a representative of another country -- Mr Moon's national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong -- announcing Mr Trump's agreement to a summit. Not bad for a pinko peacenik.\n\nFor now, Mr Moon will grow only more indispensable, not only because his summit with Mr Kim will lay the ground and set the tone for Mr Trump's, if it happens. Crucially, the Americans are handicapped in preparing for negotiations in that they have few channels of communication into Pyongyang. Like it or not, they must rely on South Korea to do much of the talking for them.\n\nSunshine and rain\n\nMr Moon's real challenges are still to come. The sceptics are surely right that Mr Kim, like his father and grandfather before him, aims to drive a wedge not only between South Korea and its American and Japanese allies, but also into South Korean politics, which is still riven between conservatives and progressives.\n\nOn the first, Mr Moon is trying his hardest to soothe. He dispatched his intelligence chief to Tokyo this week to persuade Mr Abe that South Korean and Japanese interests remain aligned. Reports from the Japanese side suggest that Mr Abe, deeply alarmed by all the summitry, came away reassured. He will nevertheless head to Washington next month to convince Mr Trump that Japan cannot accept letting North Korea keep its current arsenal, even if it promises to shelve its intercontinental missiles. He may also warn of the risk of sensitive military intelligence flowing from Mr Moon's camp to Pyongyang as ties warm.\n\nAs for South Korea's divisions regarding the North, perhaps passions are ebbing. The young who voted in numbers for Mr Moon have few of the uncritical hopes their parents held for the sunshine policy. In a recent poll over 80% of those in their 20s wanted engagement, but 74% said they mistrusted the North. When a professor asked his students during a recent lecture whether they thought North and South Korea would be reunified during their lifetime, only the foreigners put up their hands. South Korean scepticism may prove an antidote to Moonshine.",

                "title": "How Malaysia's next election will be rigged",
                "body": "\"IF AN election is voters choosing politicians, gerrymandering is politicians choosing voters,\" explains Wong Chin Huat of the Penang Institute, a Malaysian think-tank, to a small group of concerned citizens. They are gathered in a windowless meeting room in Kuala Lumpur's decrepit centre to bemoan the Election Commission's (EC) redrawing of constituency boundaries. The new maps, Mr Wong explains, will help the ruling coalition, the Barisan Nasional, maintain its stranglehold on power after 44 years in office.\n\nAn election must be held by August. The last parliamentary session before the vote ends on April 5th. Before they adjourn, lawmakers are expected to vote on the new boundaries for their seats, which are filled on a first-past-the-post basis.\n\nMalapportionment -- the creation of seats of wildly unequal size -- worries critics most. This involves packing urban and minority voters, who tend to support the opposition, into highly populated constituencies, while the largely rural and Malay backers of the Barisan Nasional occupy depopulated provincial seats. As a result, it takes more votes to get an opposition MP elected than it does to elect one from the ruling party. At the most recent election, in 2013, the Barisan Nasional won 60% of seats despite receiving a minority of votes, thanks mainly to this ploy.\n\nRather than making constituencies more balanced, the EC is making them even less so. In peninsular Malaysia there will be 15 parliamentary seats each containing more than 100,000 voters, according to Tindak Malaysia, an organisation that supports electoral reform. Fourteen of them are represented by members of opposition parties. All but one of 30 of the smallest constituencies, the tiniest of which has fewer than 18,000 voters, support Barisan Nasional (see chart).\n\nThe constitution says that constituencies should be \"approximately equal\" in size. It originally stipulated that, within each of Malaysia's states, they should not vary in size by more than 15%. Later this was amended to 33%. In 1973 the rule was abolished altogether. Since then malapportionment has been rife, but the latest electoral maps are particularly bad, says Maria Chin Abdullah, until recently the head of Bersih, an alliance of groups which campaigns for fair elections.\n\nGerrymandering adds to the problem. This involves redrawing constituency boundaries to pack opposition voters into a few seats, while ruling-party supporters form a narrow majority in a larger number. The EC at first produced maps for state assemblies that appeared to sort voters into ethnic ghettoes. The revised versions, although less racially divisive, remain partisan. One example is the suggestion that the seat of Beruas in Perak state, which went to the opposition at the last election, should absorb an opposition stronghold from an adjoining constituency. Concentrating opposition supporters in the one seat should more than double the incumbent's winning majority, but makes it harder for the BN's critics to compete next door.\n\nThe proposals have prompted lots of objections and several court cases, especially in swing states such as Johor and Perak. \"The Election Commission has totally ignored us. They don't want to see us,\" says Ms Chin Abdullah, who has left Bersih to stand in the impending election as an independent. Judges, likewise, have refused to interfere, saying the constitution gives parliament the right to redraw the maps. One appeal is pending in Selangor, a state run by the opposition, but even the activists involved express little hope for their cause.\n\nThere are other concerns. The rolls seem to include voters living in unlikely places, like the middle of a palm-oil plantation or the toilet block of a factory. In Selangor alone, the EC does not seem to have addresses for 36,000 registered voters. Postal voting may also be a problem. The government allows certain categories of public employees to vote by post in case they cannot get to the polls on election day. They include police officers and soldiers. But Ambiga Sreenevasan, a lawyer and activist, points out that there is little oversight of the storage and counting of such votes. Nonetheless, the EC quietly added nine new categories of postal voters last year, including workers unlikely to be on the front lines of an emergency on election day, such as the staff of the Immigration Department. And then there is the indelible ink, designed to stain voters' fingers for a week to identify those who have already cast their ballots. A government minister admitted after the last election that the ink was too easily washed off.\n\nMr Najib, meanwhile, has been showering voters with handouts. Some 7m poorer Malaysians will receive three payments of up to 1,200 ringgit ($308) in total over the course of the year. Civil servants also received a special bonus in January and can expect another in June. But the government's zeal to diminish voters' say in the election suggests it does not have total faith in its ability to win them over.",

                "title": "North Korea says it is ready to talk to America",
                "body": "THE speed with which Kim Jong Un, North Korea's dictator, has developed missiles, now believed to be capable of hitting America, has been startling. Since the start of the year, the pace of diplomacy with the rogue state has been similarly rapid. On March 6th South Korean envoys returned from meeting Mr Kim in his capital, Pyongyang, with a message for America. He is willing, they said, to sit down and talk, even about denuclearising the Korean peninsula -- an American condition for talks that North Korea had rejected just days before. The North has not contradicted the South Korean statement, although its media talk of \"open-hearted\" talks without mentioning denuclearisation.\n\nThe southern delegation's two-day visit came hot on the heels of North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics in the South Korean resort of Pyeongchang, during which northern officials met Moon Jae-in, the South's president. This week the two sides agreed to hold a summit next month between Mr Moon and Mr Kim. The two leaders will also set up a hotline.\n\nChung Eui-yong, Mr Moon's national-security adviser, said Mr Kim had been exceptionally flexible, promising not to test any missiles during negotiations. Nor did he demand a suspension of joint military exercises by America and South Korea. It is striking that Mr Kim has agreed to meet on the South Korean side of the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas, whereas past South Korean leaders were forced to go to Pyongyang to meet Kim Jong Il, Mr Kim's father.\n\nThe North Korean leader was also exceptionally hospitable. He wined and dined the envoys at the headquarters of the Workers' Party, no less. His mysterious wife, Ri Sol Ju, was present too.\n\nSome explain Mr Kim's sudden overture as a response to President Donald Trump's policy of \"maximum pressure\" on North Korea, which has involved heightening both rhetoric and sanctions against the regime. (When asked why Mr Kim had made his offer, Mr Trump answered \"Me\"). \"Mr Kim wants to lower tensions on the Korean peninsula after last year,\" says Paik Hak-soon of the Sejong Institute, a South Korean think-tank.\n\nOthers deny that North Korea is offering to talk from a position of weakness. After all, Mr Kim has almost, but not quite, perfected a nuclear missile that can hit America -- the point where he would have maximum leverage over Mr Trump. Most see the overture as a stratagem. North Korea has reneged on every deal it has ever signed. Most recently, in 2009, it backed out of an agreement struck in 2005 that offered it security guarantees, electricity from the South and other economic benefits in exchange for dismantling its nuclear programme. \"Two words: Dad's playbook\", Jung Pak, a former CIA analyst, tweeted.\n\nIndeed, North Korea's offer to discuss denuclearisation came on the condition that \"military threats against the North are resolved and the regime is secure.\" In the past North Korea has suggested it will not consider itself safe until America scraps its alliances with South Korea and Japan, and removes all its forces from the region -- steps America would not countenance.\n\nThere is \"no way in hell\" that Mr Kim will give up his nuclear weapons, says Brad Glosserman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, an American think-tank, who thinks he is simply after money, a reduction of pressure and the prestige that comes with dialogue with America. Nuclear weapons are written into North Korea's constitution and Mr Kim seems to see them as essential to his survival. Chosun Ilbo, a South Korean daily, cautioned that the last time North Korea promised to denuclearise, it was a \"deceiving stunt\" used to \"fool the world\".\n\nAmerica has been cautious. Mr Trump welcomed \"possible progress\" but warned of \"false hope\". Still, even the many sceptics say Mr Trump should accept the North's offer. Talks might give some insight into its intentions and priorities. They might also calm, if only temporarily, a combustible situation that at points last year seemed ready to explode into an accidental nuclear war. Then again, Messrs Trump and Kim may not like mundane negotiations as much they appear to enjoy insulting each other's physiques and boasting about the size of their nuclear buttons.",

                "title": "The chief justice of the Philippines is under attack",
                "body": "IN THE back room of a chicken restaurant famous for its banana ketchup, the small, neat, bespectacled chief justice tells a swarm of journalists that she has done her best \"to fight for justice\". Maria Lourdes Sereno has been having to fight harder than usual in recent weeks. Congress is initiating impeachment proceedings against her, while the government is attempting to nullify through the courts her appointment as chief justice almost six years ago. On March 1st she took a voluntary leave of absence from the Supreme Court while she tries to defend herself. It is not yet clear when she will return.\n\nMs Sereno's detractors have come up with no fewer than 27 complaints against her, from claiming unduly lavish expenses to failing to file all the necessary paperwork during her previous job as a university professor. But many believe the real reason for the campaign to remove her is her outspoken criticism of the government's violent campaign against drug-dealers and -users and its extension of martial law on the troubled island of Mindanao. Rodrigo Duterte, the president and architect of both policies, has denounced her as \"the kingpin of the judiciary\".\n\nThe president says he is not responsible for her troubles, and that impeachment cases are \"not my style\". But his supporters in Congress are pressing on, regardless. On March 19th a committee of the House of Representatives approved six articles of impeachment against Ms Sereno. The full House is expected to vote to send her for trial in the Senate soon. Ms Sereno's sympathisers there will be wary. \"Dissent is seen as a destabilisation,\" explains Francis Pangilinan, an opposition senator. Still, it remains unlikely that two-thirds of the 24 senators will find her guilty, the margin required to remove her from office.\n\nThe uncertain situation in the Senate may explain why the government has opened another front against Ms Sereno. The solicitor-general has filed a petition at the Supreme Court in recent weeks to nullify her original appointment as the country's top judge. He argues that her failure in certain years during her two-decade career at the University of the Philippines to file annual financial declarations required of all government employees should have made her ineligible for office. (Ms Sereno filed the mandatory statements of her assets, liabilities and net worth only in 1998, 2002 and 2006).\n\nUnder the constitution, certain officials, including the chief justice and the president, can be removed from office only through impeachment. Critics therefore question the legality of the petition as a ploy to get around this stricture -- although only one of Ms Sereno's 14 colleagues on the Supreme Court has objected. Ms Sereno also ridicules the idea that her sporadic filings constituted a deliberate effort to conceal ill-gotten riches. \"You cannot accumulate wealth at the University of the Philippines. Your problem is unexplained poverty, not hidden wealth!\" she jokes.\n\nGiven the uncertain prospects of both the impeachment and the petition, it would be far more convenient for the government if Ms Sereno were simply to resign. On March 12th dozens of legal colleagues published a statement urging her to do so. She says she has no intention of acceding to their request. The row threatens to distract lawmakers from other pressing matters, such as tax reform and the president's plan to institute federalism by amending the constitution.\n\nThe furore also comes at a tricky time for Mr Duterte's administration. Filipinos are fuming at a shortage of subsidised rice. The president's joke that the Philippines should become \"a province\" of China has not gone down well, either. A controversial procurement contract has already led to the removal of the head of the navy and is causing trouble for an aide to Mr Duterte.\n\nMs Sereno denies any wrongdoing, but has yet to give a detailed response to all the allegations against her. She says she is preparing a thorough defence and welcomes the opportunity to clear her name. Turning a vocal critic into the star of a televised courtroom drama might do the government more harm than good. Then again, it is unlikely to have Ms Sereno's sympathy if she manages to remain in office.",

                "title": "Not all Japanese towns and villages are atrophying",
                "body": "THERE was nothing wrong with Chika and Takeshi Ota's life in Osaka, Japan's liveliest city, where she worked as a shop manager and he as a driver. But a visit to Tasmania, in Australia, convinced Chika of the superiority of rural life. In May last year, with two tiny children in tow, they moved to Shimanto, a sprawling town in Shikoku, the smallest of Japan's four main islands. Sitting in one of the sparse buildings that make up Kleingarten, a community of 22 basic houses with allotments they now call home, the couple, who are in their late 30s, describe how they hope to make a living through farming. \"It is a risky choice, but we are happy,\" says Chika.\n\nJapan's population is shrinking and ageing. Both trends are especially pronounced in the countryside, since young people tend to move to cities to find jobs, romance and good restaurants. The net inflow of Japanese to Tokyo rose from 96,500 in 2013 to 120,000 people last year, notes Ayumi Ito Rai of the cabinet office's department for revitalising local areas. The city's population continues to creep up. But there was net emigration from all but seven of Japan's 47 prefectures last year. The population of Kochi prefecture, where Shimanto sits, peaked in 1955 at 883,000. By 2015 it had fallen to 728,000.\n\nBut even as young country-dwellers seek their fortune in cities, a small but growing number of their urban counterparts are packing up and heading for the paddyfields. In the last nine months of 2017, 139 people settled in Shimanto, up from 73 in 2016 and 45 in 2015. There are no up-to-date nationwide statistics, but in 2017, 33,165 people contacted the Furusato Kaiki Shien Centre, an NGO supporting people who want to move to rural areas -- a more than threefold increase on 2013.\n\nIt used to be older folk who headed to the countryside, often the retired returning to their childhood homes. Today those interested in moving are increasingly young. The trend is reflected in popular culture. Last year \"Gifu ni iju\", a TV drama, followed two women in their 30s who moved to Gifu, an area in central Japan full of small mountain towns. Josei Seven, a magazine for young women, recently wrote about moving to the countryside. All but one of the 73 people who moved to Shimanto in 2016 were under 50.\n\nThat is good news for the receiving towns and villages. A report in 2014 suggested that by 2040 depopulation would wipe out nearly 900 municipalities, almost half the total. That panicked the government. The next year Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, set out a plan to revive dying areas, one pillar of which was encouraging migration.\n\nThe rustic revival is thanks in part to public programmes, such as one that sends young people to work in rural areas for two or three years, in the hope they will then settle. Also important, says Tokumi Odagiri of Meiji University, were the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, which killed some 18,000 people. The disasters \"caused young people to re-evaluate their lives\", he says. Many are looking for peace and quiet, or simply cheaper homes. Another draw is better work-life balance, says Junichi Yanagi of Living in the Countryside magazine.\n\nYoung people can revitalise an area, says Nakao Hironari, the mayor of Shimanto. In part, that is because they work. Many go into farming or learn traditional crafts. Yu and Miki Kikuchi left their jobs as a factory worker and a nurse; he is now training to be a blacksmith, while she hunts game.\n\nIt helps that young people are the ones who have babies, too. Shimanto offers subsidised child care and housing for new arrivals. In contrast, Yoshiro Yamauchi, a pensioner who three months ago moved from Saitama, a city of 1.3m close to Tokyo, to Hirado, a town of 31,000 on the island of Kyushu, says: \"It's pretty run down here, and you only really see old people.\"\n\nMr Odagiri says government policies to combat depopulation focus on infrastructure and subsidies, or on deterring people from moving to the cities. Instead, he says, research shows that people are attracted to areas where there is a positive mood and a sense of community. That creates a virtuous cycle, as immigration begets more immigration. In Shimanto, at least, that cycle may be taking off. After living there for three years, Naofumi Takase, who is 31, is planning to start a bed-and-breakfast business. Mayu Kase, 22, who left her job as a hotel receptionist in Chiba, an area east of Tokyo, wants to open a cake shop. \"I love it here,\" she says.",

                "title": "Why billboards are under attack in Pakistan's business capital",
                "body": "GONE are the 20ft-long bars of Dairy Milk. Gone the models with Veet-shaven legs. And gone the handsome cricketers, inviting you to open a refreshing can of Pepsi. Over the past 20 months officials have stripped Karachi, Pakistan's throbbing business capital, of all billboards on public property. On a drive through its traffic-clogged streets, fresh views of concrete highways and pedestrian overpasses greet the eye. \"The city is barren by comparison,\" beams Sumaiya Zaidi, who campaigned for the purge.\n\nThe clean-up jars with Karachi's reputation, for two reasons. First, the local government usually fumbles even basic tasks. Mafiosi sell water to many of the city's 15m residents, driving tankers down pot-holed or unpaved roads. Second, the megacity is the heart of Pakistan's retail market, whose latest annual growth of 8.2% is about the fastest in the world, according to Euromonitor, a market-analysis firm. Keen to hawk their wares within its bounds are the country's biggest businesses and its most outrageous hucksters (including one entrepreneur arrested for painting stray dogs and selling them as pedigree chums).\n\nWhy, then, the ban? \"Civil rights\" is the official answer. In 2016 the Supreme Court vaguely claimed that a rash of billboards endangered the \"life and property of the common man\". Local media had reported injuries after monsoon winds blew over rickety structures. Pedestrians complained about the blocking of pavements. And during the trial a judge warned that the sight of a giant woman eating a biscuit could distract male drivers, causing them to crash.\n\nYet the unofficial answer aligns better with Karachi's cut-throat reputation. The rate that established firms in the outdoor advertising industry had been able to charge for a billboard had plummeted before the ban, notes a retired official. A clutch of small businesses had been making signs using cheap laser printing and illegally flinging billboards up across the city. The fact that the concerned citizen who originally petitioned the Supreme Court seems to have vanished has fuelled speculation that he was acting on behalf of struggling advertising firms, says a journalist, Mahim Maher.\n\nThe ban has hurt the trade's small fry. Only a few workers remain in Al-Karam Square, a cavernous building that used to thrum with flex-fitters, steel-workers and laser-printers. \"I had to let go of 90% of my staff,\" sighs the despondent Naeem, whose unventilated workshop reeks of paint fumes. Around 125,000 labourers are thought to have lost their jobs. Some, drawn by the still-billboard-strewn streets of Pakistan's other big cities, have moved.\n\nThere is also a political dimension to the ban. It feeds into a long-running battle for control of the city between the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), a party of migrants from India which dominates the city government, and the liberal Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which rules the province of Sindh, of which Karachi is the capital. The city government manages to collect only a tenth of the municipal taxes it is due, the World Bank estimates. It used to earn around a seventh of its revenue by letting space for billboards. Some advertising firms say they also paid the MQM bribes equal to the official fee. Today the party is split, demoralised and cash-starved. MQM leaders claim the PPP engineered the ban to sabotage its preparations for a general election this summer.",

                "title": "How Bangladesh vanquished diarrhoea",
                "body": "IN THE 27 years since he became headmaster of a school in Trishal, in northern Bangladesh, Mohamed Iqbal Baher has noticed some changes in his pupils. Although boys and girls are often absent because they are helping their parents in the fields, they miss fewer lessons because of illness. Mr Baher does not recall an outbreak of cholera in the past ten years. And, although he cannot be sure, he thinks that pupils are taller than they used to be.\n\nIf so, it is probably because they were healthier infants. In 1993-94, 14% of Bangladeshi babies aged between 6 and 11 months had suffered an attack of diarrhoea in the previous two weeks, according to their parents, who were responding to a household survey. That is an important stage in a child's development, but also a period of great vulnerability to stomach bugs, as babies are weaned. By 2004 the proportion of stricken babies had fallen to 12%, and in 2014 it had dropped below 7%. Stunting -- being extremely short for one's age -- has declined roughly in parallel.\n\nThe abating of enteric disease, together with the growing use of salty rehydration solutions to treat it, has spared many lives. In Matlab, a part of Bangladesh with good data, deaths from diarrhoea and dysentery have dropped by about 90% since the early 1990s (see chart). That decline helps to explain how Bangladesh has pulled off a remarkable feat. Though it is still one of Asia's poorest countries, with only half the GDP per person of India, Bangladesh now has a child-mortality rate lower than India or Pakistan, and indeed lower than the world average.\n\nThe most obvious explanation for Bangladesh's success is the proliferation of outhouses in Trishal and other villages. Made of tin or palm fronds, these conceal simple pit latrines -- concrete rings sunk into holes in the ground, with toilets on top. Between 2006 and 2015 a sanitation programme run by BRAC, a charity that is ubiquitous in Bangladesh, helped more than 5m households build a toilet.\n\nWhat charity started, village one-upmanship has accelerated. A group of women in Trishal explain that a household toilet is now a symbol of respectability, to the extent that marriages have been called off when a groom's family is discovered not to have one. Even in the districts where BRAC operates, two-thirds of the latrines built between 2006 and 2015 were constructed not by charities or the government, but by ordinary people.\n\nMore important, people use the latrines. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the proportion of Bangladeshi households that defecate in the open has fallen to zero. That is probably overstating things. Other studies suggest that about 5% of households still resort to woods or roadsides, or use toilets overhanging rivers. But Bangladesh has certainly done better than other poor countries. According to the WHO, 40% of Indians defecate outdoors. The Indian government, which is in the midst of a fierce campaign against open defecation, disputes that, and claims to have cut the number of rural people relieving themselves outside from 550m to 250m since 2014. Either way, that is still far behind Bangladesh.\n\nJanir Ahmed, a sanitation specialist at BRAC, says that villagers were reluctant to use outhouses at first. They complained about the smell and felt uncomfortably enclosed. BRAC discovered that the poorest people were more willing to listen to experts. The charity built latrines for them, then gently (and sometimes not so gently) shamed wealthier villagers into following suit. Mushfiq Mobarak, an economist at Yale University who has researched sanitation decisions, suggests that better-off people may be more likely to copy poor people than the other way round. If a wealthy person has something, you do not necessarily feel ashamed not to have it.\n\nThe other striking thing about Trishal is the abundance of drinking water. This village of 270 households has 33 water pumps. As with the outhouses, the great majority were paid for privately. Bangladesh has a thriving boring industry -- teams of men who will drill tube wells dozens or hundreds of feet deep, depending on the height of the water table and levels of arsenic in the area. The water pumps are unnervingly close to the outhouses. But Mohammad Sirajul Islam, of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Bangladesh, suggests that this does not matter. By testing groundwater around pit latrines, he has found that bugs can barely travel more than two metres underground.\n\nMr Sirajul Islam has also discovered something else. Whereas groundwater is pretty clean, the water that comes out of pumps is not. And the water stored in people's homes is often filthy, as is the food that mothers have set aside to feed to their babies. If Bangladeshis can be persuaded to wash water pumps, pots and their hands, and to reheat food that has been allowed to cool down, all as a matter of routine, rates of enteric disease ought to decline even further. A mass killer has already been reduced to the level of a hazard. It could yet be turned into an occasional nuisance.",

                "body": "SUDIRMAN SAID is smiling and shaking hands with shopkeepers selling everything from meat carcasses to herbal tonics. The crowded market in Semarang, the capital of Central Java, is not the sort of place one would expect to encounter a smartly dressed 54-year-old accountant. But as the opposition's candidate to be governor of the province, Mr Sudirman must campaign in every corner to stand even a slim chance of victory. Few others were brave enough to seek the nomination. \"They didn't want to be losers,\" Mr Sudirman chuckles. \"Am I willing to be a loser?\"\n\nMillions of Indonesians will go to the polls on June 27th to choose governors, mayors and other officials. All three of the country's most populous provinces -- West, East and Central Java -- face elections. The island of Java accounts for less than a tenth of Indonesia's territory but almost half of its 190m-plus voters (the overall population is 266m, making Indonesia the world's fourth-most-populous country). Moreover, Java played a pivotal part in the most recent presidential election, in 2014, when Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, narrowly beat Prabowo Subianto. The upcoming vote is the biggest test for the president since then and before next year's parliamentary and presidential elections.\n\nJokowi had a setback last year when the opposition won Jakarta, the capital. Even in Central Java, the president's own province and a stronghold of his party, PDI-P, the opposition sniffs a chance. The two big electoral coalitions in the province are not exactly the same as the ones at the national level, but the resemblance is close enough that the campaign for governor may provide clues as to how next year's presidential poll might unfold.\n\nIn Jakarta, the opposition prevailed by stirring up racial and religious rancour against the ethnic-Chinese, Christian incumbent. That may not work in Central Java. Its governor, Ganjar Pranowo, is a Javanese Muslim. Campaigns against \"loose morals\", and the president's failure to enforce a stricter sort, might go down well in conservative places but do not resonate with Central Java's more relaxed voters. The version of Islam practised here owes more to the moderate views of Nahdlatul Ulama, a mass Muslim organisation with roots in the countryside, than to the more doctrinaire teachings gaining ground elsewhere in Indonesia. So the opposition is focusing instead on public disenchantment with Jokowi's government, especially its seeming inability to curb corruption.\n\nThis plays to Mr Sudirman's strengths. As Jokowi's energy minister in 2014-16, he won fame as an advocate for clean government. Sensationally, he released a recording in which the Speaker of parliament at the time appeared to try to extort shares from the local head of Freeport McMoRan, an American firm that runs a huge copper-and-gold mine in the Indonesian part of New Guinea. The Speaker said variously that the request for shares was a joke and that it was made at the president's behest (which the president denies), but he resigned his post. A court later declared the tapes inadmissible as evidence. The former Speaker is now on trial in a different corruption case. Mr Sudirman, for his part, was dropped from the cabinet.\n\nMr Sudirman suspects he was sacrificed to preserve Jokowi's alliance with Golkar, the second-largest party in parliament, which the Speaker then chaired. \"Golkar made a bargain,\" he says. Reckoning that Jokowi's government was no longer serious about reform, Mr Sudirman defected to Mr Prabowo's camp. \"At the national level there is a changing political landscape. When people are tired, they look for something new. That is also happening in Central Java,\" he says.\n\nAt a hotel conference room in Semarang Mr Sudirman kneels solemnly as Christian priests crowd around, reciting prayers. Christians, many of them ethnic Chinese, are only 3% of Central Java's 34m people, but Mr Sudirman says he has a \"special interest\" in listening to their worries, to counter claims that he wants to stir up the religious and ethnic tensions of Jakarta's election. \"I have to prove I am not in that mood,\" he says.\n\nHowever ecumenical his behaviour, it still seems unlikely that Mr Sudirman will prevail in Central Java. Jokowi hails from a town in the province. In 2014 he won 67% of the local vote. Flags emblazoned with the symbol of PDI-P, a red-eyed bull, are a common sight. Opinion polls are not always reliable in Indonesia, but the latest one puts Mr Ganjar, the incumbent, almost 70 percentage points ahead of Mr Sudirman. After all, points out Ari Setiawan, a 50-year-old with a wispy white beard eating a bowl of rice gruel at a roadside stall, \"Central Java is the home of the red bull.\" But it could still provide some pointers for the opposition.",

                "title": "The culling of kangaroos divides Australia",
                "body": "AUSTRALIANS are not, as they sometimes joke, the only people to eat their iconic national animal. Swedes munch on moose; in Spain, bull-tail stew is a delicacy. But the culling of kangaroos divides opinion Down Under. Many view the marsupials as pests which destroy pasture and cause crashes by hopping in front of cars. Animal-rights types counter that killing them is inhumane, and that kangaroo meat is rife with bacteria. Both sides are hopping mad about a new film, which shows botched slaughters and suggests that hunting is diminishing the population. \"We've learned how polarising the subject is in Australia,\" Mick McIntyre, one of its makers, told a local paper.\n\nAnnual aerial surveys suggest that there are more than 47m kangaroos bounding through the outback, making them some of the most abundant large vertebrates on earth. Their natural predators, such as dingoes, are scarce, so when the vegetation they eat is abundant, their numbers jump. State governments have long set \"harvesting\" quotas to keep the four most populous species in check. But some ecologists suggest that the culls are damaging, and that the population estimates are over-optimistic.\n\nThose in favour of culling point out that Australia earns $175m annually from the carcasses, which are butchered in struggling rural towns. Some scientists argue that kangaroos are a more sustainable source of protein than cows or sheep. Yet the industry is under pressure abroad. Cuddly campaigns have turned shoemakers such as Adidas against kangaroo leather and sapped foreign appetite for the meat. In 2016 California reinstated an embargo on kangaroo products. Russia, once the biggest consumer of kangaroo meat, has imposed an intermittent ban out of concern for food safety. In the eight years since it first did so, the value of Australia's kangaroo-meat exports has fallen by more than half.\n\nAs a result, professional hunters receive a lower price for every carcass they deliver. They killed 1.4m kangaroos in 2016, a fifth of the permitted maximum. But a higher kangaroo population simply means that more will die in the next drought, says George Wilson of the Australian National University. Worse, he says, if skilled hunters lay down their arms, rookies will take over. In Queensland, landholders have been accused of poisoning kangaroos and erecting fences to prevent them from reaching water. The back and forth is endless. As Mr McIntyre says, \"A good way to destroy any dinner party is to bring it up.\"",

                "title": "Hun Sen, Cambodia's ruler, has been in power too long",
                "body": "A COUNTRY boy, Hun Sen gets up early and works hard. He is said to spend hours every morning on his treadmill, to counter the ravages of his earlier years as a field commander and chain-smoker. Like the best autocrats, Cambodia's prime minister understands the importance of social media. Aware that dull state television repels viewers, he lives on Facebook, buying what followers he cannot attract -- he now has 9.6m of them.\n\nHe also attends to his constituents. Twice a week he goes down to the garment factories that have burgeoned around the edges of Phnom Penh, the capital. They were once a heartland for the opposition, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). But he now delivers long, exhortatory speeches to the textile workers, without notes. He has put up their minimum wage to $170 a month, provided health care and even promised maternity leave.\n\nSince you cannot be too careful, Mr Hun Sen has also abolished the opposition. In November the Supreme Court agreed that the CNRP was part of a foreign plot to overthrow the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP). Many members have fled the country. Those who remain are disqualified from running in elections in July. Since September the CNRP's president, Kem Sokha, has been in detention without trial. Anyone who crosses power is at risk. In 2016 Kem Ley, an activist and outspoken critic, was shot dead in broad daylight.\n\nJust getting started\n\nThough Mr Hun Sen has ruled for 33 years, as strongmen go he is a whippersnapper at 65. He will need to live half as long again to be of Robert Mugabe's vintage. He made his mark as a commander for the genocidal agrarian utopians of the Khmers Rouges, losing his eye and gaining his glassy squint during their assault on Phnom Penh in 1975. Two years later, as the regime's purges intensified, he fled with his battalion over the border to Vietnam. In 1979 he returned with an invading Vietnamese army.\n\nMr Hun Sen was made foreign minister in the new puppet government before he was even 30 -- picked out because, though uneducated, he was a quick study and always attentive to Vietnamese interests. By 1985 he was prime minister, a post he refused to give up even after UN-supervised elections in 1993 produced a hung parliament with the royalist party, FUNCINPEC, holding the largest number of seats. He grudgingly shared power with the royalists' leader, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, until 1997, when he ousted him in what was, in essence, a lightning civil war.\n\nPrince Ranariddh has recently made his peace with the strongman. He spends languid days with cigars and claret at the colonial-era Raffles Hotel. His even softer-edged half-brother, Norodom Sihamoni, who studied film-making in Pyongyang and taught ballet in Paris, is the titular king. But Mr Hun Sen is the real one. His regal paternalism is intended to suggest that an earlier order has been restored after decades of horrors, from American bombing in the early 1970s to the civil war of the 1980s, not to mention the Khmers Rouges' grotesque Year Zero.\n\nMr Hun Sen, along with his overcoiffed wife, Bun Rany, sit at the centre of cosmic relations like the rulers of old Angkor, as Sebastian Strangio puts it in \"Hun Sen's Cambodia\". The roads, pagodas and, above all, the thousands of \"Hun Sen schools\" are proof of his virtue. The website of the Cambodian Red Cross, of which Ms Bun Rany is honorary head, is a paean to her saintliness as she tends to her poor.\n\n\"Meritorious benefactors\", among them tycoons and government officials (the distinction not always clear), contribute to Mr Hun Sen's beloved projects and are awarded ornate titles and sinecures in return. Authority is handed down and money up, the whole elite nexus of business and political families cemented through tactical marriages. It is such families' wealth -- made, out of sight, from deals in banking, agribusiness, logging, resource extraction and the like -- that clogs Phnom Penh's streets with supersized SUVs.\n\nWith the economy growing by almost 7% a year, some analysts are ready to overlook the elites' excesses. Yet Hunsenomics carries costs. A ravaged natural environment is one, high-handed land grabs from subsistence farmers another. The counterpoint to what Mr Strangio calls the elites' \"mirage money\" is real money draining out of the formal economy. Handing tycoons the right to import and sell cigarettes or booze on favourable terms means less tax revenue. Those Hun Sen schools are crumbling, and pupils hoping to pass their exams have to bribe ill-paid teachers. The poorest get little health care. Inequality remains extreme. Even Mr Hun Sen's minimum wage for garment workers risks pricing the country's only competitive industry out of global markets.\n\nMeanwhile, as the election approaches, foreign criticism of Mr Hun Sen's shutdown of democracy continues. Last weekend protests railed against him on the fringes of a South-East Asian summit hosted in Australia. He affects not to care. The old fox is surely right in calculating that Europe will not end preferential access for Cambodian textile exports. More important, he has China at his back, providing money and (a)moral support. Yet Cambodia's international isolation is growing. Even members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations have harsh words in private about his sycophantically pro-China stance.\n\nAs for his grip at home, some wonder whether it is quite as sure as it seems. Last year his veteran henchman, Sok An, died of ill health, and he appears to feel the loss profoundly. Sok An, moreover, was one of the few who knew how to handle Mr Hun Sen's increasingly erratic temper. The expansion of the CPP's central committee last year by more than 300 cronies smacks of trying to please everyone. The government is packed with enough dead wood as it is. Fawning courtiers orbiting a king and his consort: that is no way to run a country. Whenever and however Mr Hun Sen goes, he will have been on the throne too long.",

                "title": "If Donald Trump does meet Kim Jong Un, a lot could go wrong",
                "body": "A BACKHANDED compliment to Donald Trump lurked in a recent editorial in the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North Korean Workers' Party. A splenetic call to lock America's president in an asylum, the piece described Mr Trump as \"dolt-like\" and an \"old lunatic\". But it also called him \"the boss of gangsters\", hinting at a different view. As rulers of a literal gangster-state, three generations of the Kim dynasty have yearned to be treated as equals by America. If they must deal with the West, they want to talk to the boss.\n\nThat explains the mixed emotions of diplomats, spies and foreign officials who work on North Korea after Mr Trump accepted an invitation to meet the country's 36-year-old leader, Kim Jong Un. The offer was passed on by South Korean envoys and has yet to be publicly confirmed by the North. But Mr Kim is reportedly ready to discuss getting rid of his nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees. Anyone who has negotiated with North Korea \"knows that at some point there has to be a leader-to-leader meeting, because on their side only one person can decide\", says a former official from George W. Bush's administration, making a case for cautious optimism about a Trump-Kim summit. But Korea-hands also fear that, by agreeing to meet, Mr Trump has offered a big concession up front.\n\nThe president's supporters insist that North Korea has been brought to the table by harsh sanctions, imposed after Trumpian tough talk at last scared such laggards as China and Russia into curbing trade. More cautious voices, such as Evans Revere, a former Asia expert at the State Department, suggest that the North opened the door \"in anticipation\" of a further tightening of sanctions which, if done right, could take the Kim regime \"up to the edge of its ability to survive, politically and economically\". Either way, more pressure is being applied now than in 2005, the last time that North Korea promised to dismantle its nuclear-weapons programme under international supervision in exchange for aid and American pledges not to invade. The North, of course, broke that promise, as it has all undertakings about its weapons programme.\n\nNonetheless, James Clapper, a former Director of National Intelligence and no swooning Trump fan, sees value in a top-level summit, arguing: \"We need to hear from Kim Jong Un himself what it would take for him to feel secure.\" The North believes in the power of great men, says Joseph DeTrani, a former CIA official and America's special envoy to multilateral disarmament talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006. Even as they haggled and wrangled, he recalls, North Korean diplomats would push for meetings with President Bush, saying: \"If your president could just meet our leader, they could cut through a lot of all this.\" Back then, Team America would reply that leaders meet at the end of talks.\n\nThe most optimistic see a Nixon-to-China-style opening for Mr Trump to forge a North Korea deal that American conservatives might spurn from another president. Trump voters are a chin-jutting bunch: 84% told a new Economist/YouGov poll that they support military action against North Korea, even if it leads to war with China. Yet at a rally on March 10th, supporters meekly stopped booing mentions of Kim Jong Un when Mr Trump told them that a summit could be \"very positive\".\n\nWhat could go wrong\n\nAll the same, there are endless pitfalls. The Kim regime is full of officials who have negotiated with America, starting with the foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho. Mr Trump has not nominated an ambassador to South Korea and the top North Korean envoy at the State Department recently resigned. Mr Trump sacked his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, without consulting him about his decision to agree to a summit.\n\nAmerican experts on Korea and concerned foreign allies alike expect their advice to be shrugged off by the president, a man bored by briefings, suspicious of alliances and focused (his own advisers admit) on quick wins that make him look good. Mr Trump scorns all those involved in past dealings with North Korea as chumps whose weakness explains why the Kim regime is still around.\n\nDaniel Russel, a career diplomat, ran North Korea policy under President Barack Obama. If briefing Mr Trump, he would stress that America is strengthened by its alliances with South Korea and Japan. When North Korea talks about America needing to abandon \"hostile policies\", that is a trap, he adds: code for removing American troops from Korean soil and ditching defence treaties with Asian allies.\n\nKorea-hands worry that it is de-escalation that Kim Jong Un is selling, not denuclearisation. They fear he wants his country to be accepted as a nuclear-armed power, in keeping with his yearning to meet America's president as an equal. One possible ploy might be to forswear missiles that can hit American cities but to preserve a small nuclear arsenal, perhaps under international supervision. Such a deal could cause other Asian countries to seek nuclear arms and raise the spectre of nuclear smuggling. China, meanwhile, is jumpy about any Trump-Kim deal, for fear that Mr Trump, no longer constrained by his desire for China to enforce sanctions, might become pushier about trade.\n\nLast year Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, quoted the president as saying that any war to stop Mr Kim should be fought in Asia, so that, \"If thousands die, they are going to die over there.\" Faced with such ruthlessness, America's allies in Asia may overcome their misgivings about the summit.",

                "title": "India's gender gap is closing in some respects, but remains vast",
                "body": "POLICE in Haldwani, a small town where the Gangetic Plain bumps against the Himalayas, shrugged when Kamini Sen lodged charges against her husband last October. What could be more ordinary than wife-beating and dowry extortion? The case got hotter when the 29-year-old, who holds masters degrees in both English and psychology, added that her spouse had also secretly married a younger woman. But only the final twist, revealed later when police tracked and caught Krishna \"Sweety\" Sen, shocked India. The two-timing swindler, said to like cursing, smoking and motorbikes, confessed that he was not a man but a woman.\n\nGrowing numbers of Indian women are, like Ms Sen, breaking traditional gender barriers. India's defence and foreign ministers are women. A woman recently stepped down as head of its biggest bank. There have been a female president and prime minister, as well as female chief ministers in various states. Women are becoming better educated, better paid and healthier than they were. Literacy among 21-year-old women leapt, for example, from 60% in 1990 to 85% in 2011.\n\nYet traditional practices still hold Indian women back. The problem is not just specific customs, such as the payment of dowries or living with in-laws. Deepa Narayan, a development consultant, argues in a new book titled \"Chup\" -- meaning \"be quiet\" in Hindi -- that women across social classes are still conditioned from early childhood to be subservient.\n\nIndian women suffer handicaps at every stage of life, starting with birth. Although determining the sex of a fetus has been banned since 1994, and in spite of an intensified campaign to stress the value of daughters under the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, parents wanting sons have continued to find ways to abort girls. The skewed sex ratio for newborns has not improved since Amartya Sen, an economist, calculated 28 years ago that India had some 40m \"missing women.\" In recent years it has got worse (see chart 1). In some districts the sex ratio at birth has fallen below 800 girls for every 1,000 boys. Disturbingly, too, widening gaps occur in some of India's richer regions, suggesting that rising income enables more parents to act on their prejudices.\n\nGirl glower\n\nThe Indian government's authoritative annual Economic Survey posits another alarming figure: the country may have an additional 21m \"unwanted\" -- and often neglected -- female children. This number was reached using research conducted by two economists, Seema Jayachandran of Northwestern University and Rohini Pande of Harvard, who examined the order of births. They found that the last child born to Indian families is far more likely to be male, since sex preference prompts parents to keep trying until they have a boy, and then to stop. In Indian states with a strong preference for boys, the Economic Survey calculates that, when a firstborn child is the last a couple has, the likelihood that it is male stands at nearly 2 to 1. The figure for \"unwanted\" girls was calculated using the gap between normal sex ratios at birth and the actual sex ratio for families that had more than the average number of children -- very likely because they kept trying to have a boy.\n\nBeing \"unwanted\" can be measured in other ways, too. Recent reports from India's 700 SNCUs (Sick Newborn Care Units), which were set up in a successful government effort to bring down infant mortality, show that parents are far more likely to bring in boys for treatment. Nationwide, boys accounted for 59% of patients in 2017, but in the most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, no less than 63% of the cases treated in SNCUs were boys. Ms Jayachandran has shown in other research that Indian girls are more likely than boys to be shorter than global norms. She posits numerous reasons for this, one being that mothers wanting a boy may prematurely stop breastfeeding girls.\n\nIndian officials are rightly proud of boosting female literacy and school attendance. Gender gaps do remain in education, though. Notably, girls are far more likely to drop out of secondary school than boys (see chart 2). Perhaps more tellingly, an annual survey of education results for 14- to 18-year-olds, published in January, found differences in educational attainment. Whereas 82% of boys could count money and 66% could tell time in a simple test, the corresponding proportions for girls were 70% and 53%.\n\nAlthough impressive numbers of Indian women now go on to higher studies, with ever more venturing into fields that were long male preserves such as engineering, their efforts may not bring similar rewards. One survey of college students across northern India found that whereas a sadly low 26% of men said that they themselves, and not their parents or others, chose their careers, the proportion for women was lower still, at 11%. And while women with college degrees are more likely to work than those with just high-school certificates, the number of them with jobs is still under 30%. In fact, the proportion of women in the workforce has been steadily dropping for more than a decade, reflecting both a steep decline in farm jobs and a preference among newly urban families to show that their womenfolk do not need to work (see chart 3).\n\nOf all the hurdles Indian women still face, sex and marriage may be the highest. The vast majority of marriages are still arranged by families, and some 94% of them among Hindus are within the same caste. Women are expected, by and large, to become part of the husband's family, and to bring along a sweetener. In-laws can press their demands in unsubtle ways. Aside from an annual average of around 8,000 \"dowry deaths\" -- wives killed because they have not coughed up enough money -- recent newspaper reports tell of such persuasive methods as beating with hockey sticks, stealing a kidney and blackmailing with sex tapes. More broadly, violence against women in various forms appears to be on the increase (see chart 4), although this may chiefly be the result of an increased tendency to report such crimes.\n\nIf so, the change is desperately needed. A research paper from 2014 that compared police records of sexual violence with survey results estimated that less than 6% of such crimes outside the home, and less than 1% of sexual assaults by husbands, are officially reported. Out of some 340,000 crimes against women reported in 2016, 110,000 were cases of cruelty by a husband or his relatives. And family health surveys reveal that 52% of women believe that husbands are entitled to beat their wives.\n\nPart of the trouble lies with the caste system. The compartmentalisation of society into narrow layers negates what should be a supply-and-demand empowerment of women due to their shrinking proportion. In essence, women's families still compete to ensnare the best husbands within a relatively limited pool. The conservative Hinduism of the northern Hindi-speaking heartland does not help, either. In parts of the south, Hindus have a long tradition of matriarchy. By the same token, Muslim and Christian minorities have long given women rights to inheritance and property. But Hindu inheritance law was only substantially reformed in 2005, and in the patriarchal north it is still considered proper for sons alone to hold property and perform religious rites. The north also happens to be the heartland of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which can make it awkward for the government to campaign too forcefully for women's rights.\n\nIn important respects, however, not just numbers but attitudes are definitely changing. Within Indian homes, women are winning more respect: between national health surveys in 2006 and 2016, a striking number reported stronger participation in family decision-making. Ever more Indian women are also voting. In the national election of 1991, 10% more men than women voted. At the most recent election, in 2014, this gap was down to 1.5%.\n\nCanny politicians such as Mr Modi have not failed to notice, and increasingly tailor their policies accordingly. His project to equip households with cooking gas to replace solid fuel not only saves thousands of lives that would otherwise be lost to smoke inhalation, it also directly targets women voters. Mr Modi has also courted Muslim women by attacking \"triple talaq\", an arcane tradition long since abandoned in most Muslim-majority countries, which permits a man to divorce simply by saying the word three times.\n\nFemale voters have helped put issues such as public safety, underage marriage, alcohol abuse and sanitation at the centre of national politics. \"We might be on the cusp of a real transition,\" says Yamini Aiyar of the Centre for Policy Research, a think-tank in Delhi. \"From the way people dress -- rural women have dropped their dupattas [gauzy scarves] and now wear kurtas [long shirts] over jeans -- to changing marriage expectations, to forging a woman-centred political narrative, the pace is speeding up.\" The two-timing Ms Sen should have realised that men can't get away with what they used to.",

                "title": "A politician's downfall shows the strength of #MeToo in South Korea",
                "body": "ON THE morning of March 5th Ahn Hee-jung, then still the governor of South Chungcheong, one of South Korea's richest provinces, made a speech in support of the country's \"#MeToo\" movement, which, as elsewhere, has encouraged women to speak out about sexual harassment. \"We have been living in a male-dominated society where one's power defines rank. Violence that stems from manipulating this power is simply harassment and discrimination,\" he said. \"Everyone should take part in the movement.\"\n\nEleven hours later, Mr Ahn's secretary heeded his appeal. On live television, Kim Ji-eun accused the governor of sexually harassing her for the past eight months and of raping her on four occasions. \"The relationship was not consensual and I am sure he knew it,\" she said. Mr Ahn's office initially claimed that what had gone on was, indeed, consensual. But soon afterwards, he published a Facebook post in which he sought forgiveness for \"foolish behaviour\" and said that he would step down.\n\nMr Ahn's downfall is testament to the growing power in South Korea of \"#MeToo\", which Ms Kim credited with encouraging her to speak out. The movement has recently been gathering pace. In January Seo Ji-hyeon, a public prosecutor, was the first prominent woman to talk on television about her experience of harassment by a colleague.\n\n\"Her example was a big trigger,\" says Lee Na-young, a professor of sociology at Joongang University. \"People thought, if this can happen to a powerful person just because she is a woman, then what about ordinary women?\" In February Lee Yoon-taek, a famous theatre director and school friend of Moon Jae-in, the president, resigned after several women accused him of sexually harassing them.\n\nIncreasingly, women who come forward find they are being listened to. This is partly because the issue has gained traction around the world after the Weinstein scandal. But \"#MeToo\" also shows the recent progressive tilt of South Korean politics. The success of mass protests in bringing about the impeachment of Park Geun-hye, the previous president, has emboldened activists of all stripes. As part of a broader package of labour reforms, Mr Moon's government has toughened penalties for sexual harassment at work. In January Mr Moon himself expressed his support for \"#MeToo\" and called for a broader movement to promote women's rights.\n\nAwkwardly, Mr Ahn is one of Mr Moon's closest political associates. Even worse, he is part of a generation of former democracy activists who tend to think of themselves as occupying the moral high ground on questions of social progress. Although he lost the Minjoo party's nomination for the presidency to Mr Moon last year, he was seen as a contender for the presidency in 2022. The party moved quickly to contain the damage, expelling Mr Ahn and apologising to the public.\n\nThe conservative opposition will find it difficult to exploit the case, being itself vulnerable to similar revelations, says John Nilsson-Wright, an expert on East Asia at Cambridge University. But South Koreans voting in elections for governors and mayors this summer will doubtless wonder whether other politicians are guilty of the sort of hypocrisy displayed by Mr Ahn. On the morning he resigned, an irate member of Minjoo expressed his anger by smashing a window of the governor's residence with a baseball bat. Others may express theirs in the polling booth.",

                "title": "A persistent scandal ensnares Japan's prime minister, again",
                "body": "SHINZO ABE, Japan's prime minister, has often appeared to have more lives than a cat. Last year he survived the revelation that a regional branch of the finance ministry had sold a plot of land at an extraordinarily cheap rate to Moritomo Gakuen, an ultra-nationalistic education company run by a friend of his wife, Akie. The allegation -- denied by Mr Abe -- is that the land, which was intended for a school, was discounted because of the connection. But the scandal has returned to plague Mr Abe again, in a more virulent form.\n\nOn March 12th Taro Aso, the finance minister, confirmed a report from Asahi Shimbun, a daily newspaper, that his ministry had deliberately misled the Diet, Japan's parliament. When the Diet was looking into the Moritomo Gakuen scandal last year, 14 of the related documents the ministry handed over as evidence turn out to have been doctored. The ministry removed Ms Abe's name from several of them, as well as comments she had made praising the new school (Ms Abe resigned as the school's honorary president after the scandal first broke last year). The altered documents also deleted references pointing out that Mr Abe, Mr Aso and Yasunori Kagoike, the head of Moritomo Gakuen, are all linked to Nippon Kaigi, an organisation that espouses the same sort of nationalism as the education company. (Moritomo Gakuen's curriculum includes daily bowing to pictures of the emperor, disdain for China and South Korea, and a reinstatement of the Imperial Rescript on Education, a patriotic tract recited by all schoolchildren until Japan's defeat in the second world war.)\n\nThe government is blaming the finance ministry, which in turn is suggesting that responsibility lies with a few of its bureaucrats. One of them has resigned. No evidence has emerged to prove that Mr Abe or Mr Aso ordered either the cut-price sale or the dissembling to parliament. (It is not uncommon in Japan for minions to try to predict what their boss might want and to do it without being asked.) But a different newspaper is now reporting that another finance ministry official who committed suicide earlier this month left a note claiming that he had been ordered to falsify documents -- an allegation the police have neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nMr Aso, a former prime minister, has so far refused to resign, although 71% of Japanese think he should do so, according to polls. Some within the LDP are saying the prime minister should take responsibility for the fiasco. Such calls will multiply if the government's approval rating falls further. It is down six percentage points since last month, but remains a solid 45%. It does not help that Mr Abe himself pledged to resign last year as both prime minister and an MP if he or his wife were shown to have intervened on Moritomo Gakuen's behalf.\n\nThe timing is especially awkward for Mr Abe, who is running for re-election as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party this autumn. His victory had previously been considered a foregone conclusion (indeed, the party changed its rules to permit him to run for a third term). Party bigwigs who had decided against challenging him may now reconsider. And if Mr Aso, the leader of a powerful faction within the party, ends up having to resign to relieve pressure on the prime minister, he might choose to side against Mr Abe in the election.\n\nMr Abe has suffered other defeats of late. Earlier this month the government was forced to withdraw a portion of the labour reforms it had presented to the Diet after the data underpinning them were found to be flawed. The ruckus the opposition is making over the scandal is stalling the government's agenda.\n\nEven if the saga does not strip Mr Abe of his cherished aim of becoming Japan's longest-serving post-war prime minister, it might hinder his controversial plans to amend the clause of the constitution that commits Japan to pacifism. Then again, Mr Abe has that catlike quality.",

                "title": "A state election stirs a row about renewable energy in Australia",
                "body": "A TUMBLEDOWN farmhouse from Australia's pioneering days has unlikely new neighbours. Giant wind turbines owned by Neoen, a French company, loom over it in the dusty red scrubland outside Jamestown, north of Adelaide, the capital of the state of South Australia. The world's biggest lithium-ion battery sits a stone's throw away. Elon Musk, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, installed it last year through his company, Tesla, to store energy from the turbines and feed it back to the grid when other supplies run short. About 100km to the west, across the Spencer Gulf, Sanjeev Gupta, a British billionaire, is also pouring money into renewable energy. He is building solar and pumped-storage hydropower plants to revive a failed steelworks at Whyalla that he bought six months ago.\n\nWith just 7% of Australia's population, South Australia has become a testing ground for a political argument about how hard the government should push to replace fossil fuels with cleaner energy. The projects at Jamestown and Whyalla loom large in the state election on March 17th. The rest of Australia, too, is paying more attention than it normally would. The last coal-fired power station in South Australia closed two years ago. While the bigger eastern states still rely on coal for most of their electricity, South Australia now gets almost half of its power from wind and solar, the highest proportion in the country. (The rest comes mainly from gas.)\n\nJay Weatherill, the state's Labor premier, recently set an even higher renewable-energy target: 75% by 2025. The federal government, a coalition of the (conservative) Liberals and Nationals, has dismissed this as a \"big experiment\". Josh Frydenberg, the federal energy minister, likens Mr Weatherill to a \"problem gambler chasing his losses\". He says too much renewable power will lead to blackouts and push up power prices. Instead, his latest energy plan calls for reliable electricity from any source, although the details remain unclear. Critics see this scepticism as a bid to guarantee a future for coal, a big industry in Australia. The federal renewables target, about two-thirds lower than South Australia's, expires in 2020.\n\nSouth Australia has long been connected to a grid encompassing four other states in eastern Australia with 40,000km of transmission lines. But in 2016 a freak storm disconnected it, leading to a statewide blackout. A smaller outage followed five months later. To Mr Weatherill, the drama meant the national electricity market was \"failing\". He launched a plan a year ago for South Australia to \"take charge\" of its own energy with A$550m ($430m) of public money, by building a gas-fired plant and financing green projects. Private investors are keen. Solar Reserve, a Californian company, will start work on a solar thermal power plant at Port Augusta, near Whyalla, this year. Tesla will build a \"virtual power plant\" by fitting 50,000 homes with solar panels and batteries.\n\nNeoen now owns and runs the giant battery next to its 99 wind turbines on the edge of the Flinders Ranges, one of Australia's windiest places. The device started operating in December, in the middle of a hot summer, when demand for air-conditioning is high. Since then, says Franck Woitiez of Neoen, it has kicked in several dozen times in response to \"unexpected failures\" at coal-fired plants as far away as Queensland, in north-east Australia. The Australian Energy Market Operator, which oversees the national system, seems to approve of South Australia's initiatives. Audrey Zibelman, its head, says the battery is \"faster than traditional generators\" and dependable: \"That's important to us.\"\n\nThe scale of foreign investment in South Australia's projects also seems to defy sceptics. Mr Gupta alone, through his company GFC Alliance, is spending about A$1bn on the Whyalla steelworks. He has also bought a majority stake in Zen Energy, an Australian renewables outfit, to power the works. He thinks South Australia can become a \"hub of renewables industries\".\n\nBut South Australia has higher wholesale electricity prices than other states. Its unemployment rate, 6%, is Australia's second-highest, partly because of the closure of its last car factory last year. Steven Marshall, the Liberal candidate for premier, says scrapping Mr Weatherill's renewable-energy targets would reduce power prices and so boost the local economy. He wants to focus instead on improving transmission lines to the rest of the country.\n\nMr Weatherill argues the reverse: that turning the state into a renewables powerhouse will mean more jobs and lower power prices. A recent poll showed more people approve of his renewable-energy target than disapprove. But the election could still be close. Labor has been in power for 16 years (with Mr Weatherill as leader for just over six). To further muddy the waters, Nick Xenophon, a former independent federal senator, is fielding candidates for SA-Best, his new state party, in most seats. His energy policy is woolly, and his support appears to be waning, but he could still take votes from both big parties. The field is confused enough, in short, that the result is unlikely to resolve the debate about renewables, whichever party ends up in charge.",

                "title": "Ukraine convinces Ryanair to return",
                "body": "ALMOST one year ago to the day, Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, announced plans to begin serving Ukraine. The eastern European country had been a glaring hole in the airline's route network, deliberately avoided because of the anti-competitive advantages afforded to Ukraine International Airlines (UIA), the flag carrier based in Kiev, the capital city. A new infrastructure minister, Volodymyr Omelyan, brokered the deal between Ryanair and Boryspil Airport, Kiev's main gateway and home base of UIA. But it collapsed within months. Now, Ryanair, the government and the airport are trying again.\n\nOn March 23rd Ryanair announced that it will launch ten routes to Kiev and five to Lviv in October. The most recent move marks a scaling up of Ryanair's original plan. The airline never lost interest in serving Ukraine, but said its business confidence was \"dented by the Kiev experience\". As Gulliver previously reported, that experience comprised of Boryspil Airport amending its contract at the eleventh hour, UIA filing lawsuits to block the low-cost carrier's entry, and both companies' management denigrating Ryanair in the local press. \"It was sabotaged and unfortunately it was done in a very rude way,\" Mr Omelyan recalled at the time.\n\nUIA's opposition to Ryanair was entirely understandable. The flag carrier is owned by Ihor Kolomoisky, an oligarch who has near total control of the country's aviation sector. Opening the market to low-cost competition will take money directly out of Mr Kolomoisky's pockets. But Boryspil Airport's opposition was more perplexing. Its boss, Pavlo Riabikin, claimed that the discounted user charges promised to Ryanair would cost his airport money.\n\nYet the success of Ryanair's business model elsewhere in Europe suggests otherwise. Its demand-catalysing low fares have been shown to create widespread benefits: for passengers, who can travel more freely, for governments, whose economies grow more rapidly, and for airports, whose retail shops, restaurants and car parks bustle with activity. Mr Omelyan directly accused Mr Riabikin of pandering to UIA, his main customer, at the expense of the country. He called for the airport boss to go, insisting: \"You can't make good reform with bad people.\"\n\nWhat has changed this time around? Nothing has shifted at the top level of Boryspil Airport's management structure. Mr Riabikin, who remains in charge of the facility, was sitting side by side with Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, as the new deal was signed. But the political pressure on him has ramped up markedly. Last time, Mr Riabikin and Mr Omelyan gave differing accounts of the commitments and objections voiced by Boryspil Airport when the deal was inked. This time, Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's president, stood beside the airport boss as he put pen to paper. Another change of heart by the airport would not simply be an affront to the infrastructure ministry, it would be a public act of defiance against the country's top leaders. Even close friends of oligarchs cannot get away with that.\n\nLocal media reports also claim that a new system for incentivising and rewarding passenger growth is being implemented-not just with Ryanair, but with all airlines at the airport. If true, this means that airport fees will only be discounted when airlines can quantify the net benefit of their presence. That should assuage Mr Riabikin's purported concerns about Ryanair costing the airport money, as well as giving UIA the opportunity to expand on equal terms.\n\nInforming its readers about Ryanair's return to Kiev, the Sun, a British tabloid, described the city as a \"stag-do favourite with beds from £3 a night and beers as low as 50p\". That is well and good. Budget holidaymakers of all stripes will find a warm welcome in Ukraine. But liberalising air travel with Europe serves a higher purpose too. At present, barely 5% of Ukrainians can afford the luxury of flying. Cheaper tickets with Ryanair will not only enable more of them to take to the skies, it will also tie the country closer to the EU, where all the new routes go. At a time when Russia is doing its utmost to drag Ukraine towards its sphere of influence, that is no bad thing.",

                "title": "Forty-four African countries sign a free-trade deal",
                "body": "\"LET'S get together,\" sang the choir to the rhythm of Bob Marley, as a succession of African leaders signed an ambitious, continent-wide free-trade agreement in Kigali on March 21st. Although all 55 members of the African Union (AU) had been involved in negotiations around the grandly named Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA), not all were ready to sign as one. On the day, 44 put pen to paper. Among the holdouts was Nigeria, Africa's largest economy. Paul Kagame, Rwanda's president and the host of the AU summit, had no time for sceptics. \"Some horses decided to drink the water. Others have excuses and they end up dying of thirst.\"\n\nThe logic of the deal is sound. Trade in Africa is still shaped by relationships and infrastructure dating back to the colonial era. Countries mostly sell primary commodities to other continents. Only 18% of their exports are traded within Africa, where they often face high tariffs. The CFTA is meant to change that by creating a \"single continental market for goods and services\". UNCTAD, a UN agency, reckons that eliminating import taxes between African countries would increase regional trade by a third and lift African GDP by 1% over time. Currently, nearly half of this trade is in manufactured goods. Services would also be opened up.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced. Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria's president, cancelled his flight to Kigali amid domestic pressure. An official says Nigeria was given just a few days to read the text, which he worries will hurt incumbent businesses.\n\nSome protectionists fret that importers will slap \"Made in Africa\" labels on goods from elsewhere. \"It will kill our industry and kill our jobs,\" says Ayuba Wabba of the Nigeria Labour Congress. Such instincts run deep in Nigeria. Its biggest company, Dangote Cement, was nurtured with import restrictions, which shielded it from foreign competition. Chiedu Osakwe, Nigeria's chief negotiator, is nevertheless confident that his country will sign in due course. Big countries such as Nigeria stand to gain most from the deal, which will help their firms expand regionally.\n\nMany of the details of the accord are still to be agreed upon. Countries are supposed to eliminate tariffs on a list comprising 90% of products (although they have not yet agreed what will go on this list). In practice, however, that could allow them to leave unchanged duties on most of their current imports, which are concentrated in a narrow range of goods.\n\nTariffs are not the most important barrier to trade. A bigger obstacle is that standards and licences are different across Africa. Take the example of a large South African retailer with stores elsewhere on the continent. It has a big warehouse where employees take products such as tubes of toothpaste out of the cartons that are used in South Africa and repack them into ones that comply with labelling rules in other countries. Red tape also slows things down. The Trade Law Centre, a South African think-tank, looked at the time taken for customs and port handling in Africa and in Singapore, and then imagined closing the gap by a fifth. The economic gains would be roughly double those expected from eliminating tariffs. The CFTA will try to lower these hurdles to trade, though there is little sign of the EU-style machinery that makes Europe's single market work.\n\nBig plans can go stale. A mooted free-trade area for the Americas is now defunct. This one will come into force only when it has been ratified by 22 signatories. Trade patterns will not change until countries start making things that their neighbours want to buy. But some countries are galloping ahead, hopeful the rest will catch up.",

                "body": "WHEN Anna Campbell heard that Kurdish women were fighting the jihadists of Islamic State in Syria, she left her job as a plumber in Britain and joined them. Ms Campbell (pictured), who was privately educated, said she wanted to defend the \"revolution of women\" in Kurdish-held parts of the country -- even though the British government regards such volunteers as, in effect, terrorists. On March 15th a missile killed her as she fought with the Women's Protection Units (YPJ), the Kurds' all-female militia, against the Turkish army.\n\nKurdish women first took up arms in the early 1990s, as members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long war for self-rule in Turkey. Inspired by Murray Bookchin, an obscure American philosopher, Abdullah Ocalan, the PKK's leader, sought to empower his female comrades. \"The 5,000-year-old history of civilisation is essentially the history of the enslavement of women,\" wrote the now-imprisoned Mr Ocalan, whose ideas are also embraced by Syria's Kurdish leaders.\n\nThe first volunteers struggled, amid mockery and abuse by the men in their ranks. Few were given weapons. But the YPJ is now celebrated for its battlefield prowess; some women even command men. In January a female fighter blew herself up to destroy a Turkish tank. The death of another sparked outrage when Syrian rebels fighting alongside Turkey mutilated her body.\n\nThose who join the YPJ must swear off sex and romance. They are like fighting nuns, says a Dutch academic. That has won over conservative Kurdish men, many of whom oppose other forms of progress for women. Over their objections, the ruling Democratic Union Party has banned forced marriages and polygamy. Honour killings and domestic abuse are harshly punished. Party rules mandate that women make up at least 40% of every governing body and that each is headed by a man and a woman.\n\nKurdish children in Syria are taught that self-rule will come only after the oppression of women stops. Yet Kurdish women enjoy more freedom in Turkey, in part because they are better educated. For Syrian Kurdistan to live up to Ms Campbell's hopes for the region, more progress must occur off the battlefield.",

                "title": "Most of Nigeria's kidnapped Dapchi schoolgirls are freed",
                "body": "IT WAS a crisis that ended as suddenly as it began. On the morning of March 21st gunmen from Boko Haram, a jihadist cult, swept back into Dapchi, a remote town in north-east Nigeria, and dropped off most of the 110 schoolgirls they had snatched a month earlier. The return was a rare victory for Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria's president. It is also a sharp contrast to the kidnapping of 276 girls from Chibok, another remote town, in 2014. Many of them remain in captivity.\n\nThe abduction of the \"Chibok girls\" by Boko Haram drew international attention and came to define the administration of Mr Buhari's predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan: incompetent, detached and corrupt, unable even to provide security to threatened schools. That played no small part in Mr Jonathan's defeat at the ballot box in 2015, the first by an incumbent president since the end of military rule in 1999.\n\nA year ahead of presidential elections scheduled for February, the Dapchi kidnapping seemed as if it might be a similar millstone for Mr Buhari. The former general had campaigned on a pledge to end an insurgency in which thousands of people have been killed and more than a million have been forced from their homes. Since he came to power, the army has made progress in driving the insurgents away from the main towns and roads in the north-east of Nigeria. But it has not secured large areas of the countryside.\n\nThe government fumbled its initial response to the kidnapping. Amnesty International, a human-rights group, says the army did not respond to multiple calls warning that a convoy of insurgents was travelling towards (and asking for directions to) the school in Dapchi.\n\nBut thereafter the government moved more quickly. Sources say that the army, working with intelligence agencies using drones and satellite imagery provided by Western governments, blocked the routes the kidnappers were trying to use to escape across the border into Chad and their strongholds on islands in Lake Chad.\n\nDenied their favoured haven, the kidnappers were boxed in to the inhospitable terrain of rural Yobe State and cut off from the bases of other Boko Haram factions in the Sambisa forest. \"We were able to create an environment where dialogue was able to resolve the situation quickly from a group that ran out of options,\" says a security official in Abuja.\n\nNo arrests have been made in connection with the kidnapping. Lai Mohammed, Nigeria's information minister, says no ransom was paid, nor were prisoners released in exchange for the girls.\n\nAlthough the immediate crisis over the kidnapping is drawing to a close, it highlights the many security challenges facing Mr Buhari's government. Large parts of the north-east are lawless, with only the lightest of government footprints. Farmers and villagers still crowd into camps or big towns for safety. Many are unable to till their fields. Farther south, in the Middle Belt, bloody clashes occur regularly between herders and farmers. To bring peace Nigeria needs to focus not just on its army, but on rebuilding the state in those parts of the country where it has failed.",

                "title": "After taking Afrin, Turkey looks for new targets in Syria",
                "body": "FOR President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the timing of Turkey's victory in the Afrin region of northern Syria could not have been better. After a two-month offensive against Kurdish militants, Turkish troops took control of the enclave's main town on March 17th. The next day Turkey celebrated the anniversary of the battle of Gallipoli, the only big Ottoman victory of the first world war. True to form, Mr Erdogan rolled the two conflicts into one, accusing Western powers of backing the Kurdish forces against Turkey. \"In Gallipoli they attacked us with the most powerful army,\" he said. \"Now that they do not have the courage to do so, they come at us with the world's basest, bloodiest, specially trained and equipped terrorist organisations.\"\n\nCapturing Afrin was easier than expected. By the time Turkish tanks rolled into the main town, the Kurdish militia known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG, had melted away. Nearly 200,000 residents had already fled, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Britain-based monitoring group says 289 civilians died over the course of Turkey's offensive, along with more than 1,500 Kurdish fighters and 46 Turkish soldiers. America and Germany have condemned Turkey for adding to Syria's misery. But Mr Erdogan dismisses their criticism. \"We have not caused a single civilian to bleed from his nose,\" he says.\n\nTurkish officials say they now intend to bring the war against the Kurdish militants to Syria's north-east and Iraq, where the YPG's mother organisation, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), has bases. Turkey does not distinguish between the two groups. It has been fighting the PKK, which seeks self-rule in Turkey, for over three decades. But there is a big problem with Turkey's plans. In the Syrian Kurds' eastern strongholds, which stretch from Manbij to the Iraqi border (see map), they are flanked by as many as 2,000 American troops. The YPG, backed by America's air force, has pushed the jihadists of Islamic State (IS) to the brink of defeat. Now Turkey wants America, its NATO ally, to get out of the way so that it can go after the YPG, considering it no less a threat than IS.\n\nManbij may hold a solution -- or become a flashpoint. America long ago promised Turkey that Kurdish forces, who wrested the ethnically mixed town from IS in 2016, would withdraw. They have not. America sees them as crucial to security in the area. A deal might see the YPG pull back to east of the Euphrates river, while Turkey and America work with local leaders to keep the peace.\n\nThe other pressing question is what Turkey will do in Afrin. Mr Erdogan has suggested returning it to its \"rightful owners\", raising fears that he may use it to settle some of the 3.4m (mostly Arab) Syrian refugees living in Turkey; or to absorb future refugees from Idlib, a rebel-held province that is under attack by the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Syria's president.\n\nMr Assad's forces are close to capturing rebel-held Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus. Syrian bombs have killed at least 1,400 civilians in the area in the past month. Similar massacres are expected once the regime and its Russian allies focus their attention on Idlib. \"The refugee exodus this would produce is something Turkish policymakers would prefer to deal with outside Turkey,\" says Ahmet Han of Kadir Has University in Istanbul. Afrin might offer them a chance to do just that.",

                "title": "Did Kenya get a loan to build a railway, or vice versa?",
                "body": "WHEN Kenya launched its new railway last year, connecting the coastal city of Mombasa to the capital, Nairobi, passenger tickets sold out. Travelling between the country's two biggest cities overland had meant crowding into a bus for 12 hours, or riding the old British-built railway, which might have taken 24 hours. The new line, run by Chinese engineers who wander up and down the carriages, has cut the journey to between four and six hours, depending on the number of stops. The seats are comfortable and, at just 700 shillings (about $7), affordable. Lucky passengers see elephants along the way.\n\nShuttling passengers, however, is not what the new line was built for. When Kenya borrowed $3.2bn from China for the railway in 2014, the aim was to move freight efficiently between the capital and the port at Mombasa, 484km (301 miles) apart. Unlike the passenger service, the cargo one has been a disaster. The second train out of Mombasa arrived a day late, because it didn't have enough goods to leave the port. Passengers may find the biggest elephant on their journey is the white one they are riding.\n\nIn theory the line should move about 40% of the freight coming inland from Mombasa. The cargo is loaded straight from ships onto trains, which take it to a depot near Nairobi. There it is processed by customs officials. The goal is to relieve congestion on the roads and lower transport costs. One day, it is hoped, the railway will connect all of east Africa. For now, officials would settle for enough revenue to cover the running costs and repay the loans.\n\nBut getting importers to use it is proving harder than expected. In its first month the line moved just 1,600 containers out of roughly 80,000 processed in Mombasa. Though the trains go faster than lorries, the line is far less efficient at moving cargo, says William Ojonyo of Keynote Logistics, a Nairobi-based cargo-clearing firm. There have been delays in loading trains. Customs processing at the inland depot is less reliable than in Mombasa. \"We are more comfortable dealing with the devil we know, the container on a truck,\" he says.\n\nFees were cut after the first slow month, but traffic did not improve much. On March 1st James Macharia, the transport secretary, sacked 14 out of 16 heads of department at the Kenyan Port Authority, alleging that \"cartels\" had been obstructing the new railway. Cargo that is not directed to a specific clearing depot in Mombasa has been ordered onto the railway automatically, regardless of its final destination. Importers have arrived in Mombasa to pick up containers, only to find that they have been sent to Nairobi.\n\nFew in Mombasa are pleased by the idea of cargo being sent straight to the interior, bypassing the armies of agents based in the port city. Hassan Joho, Mombasa's governor, a fierce critic of the new railway, has stakes in two container-storage depots in the city, which the railway could undermine. By moving freight straight to Nairobi, \"you're killing the economy down here,\" says Mr Joho's spokesman.\n\nA bigger issue than cartels in Mombasa ought to be economics. Even if traffic increases, the line will probably not make enough money to repay its debts. In 2013 the World Bank said that a new railway would be feasible only if it were able to move at least 20m tonnes of cargo a year, just about everything that goes through the port. At best, the new line will transport half of that. Some fear that it may not make enough to cover its running costs. If the authorities then skimp on maintenance, the railway could deteriorate quickly.\n\nBefore the new line Kenya already had a functional railway -- the old British one. In the 1980s it moved about 5m tonnes of cargo a year. It could have been refurbished for perhaps a quarter of the cost of building a new one. But that would not have come with a big Chinese loan or the cash that was splashed out on subcontracts and the land purchases needed for the new line. Some cynics in Nairobi say that building the railway was a way to get a loan, rather than the other way round.",

                "body": "ON THE sweltering afternoon of March 18th some 2,000 people crammed the narrow streets of Maré, a favela in the north of Rio de Janeiro, to protest against the murder of a friend. Marielle Franco, a city councillor who grew up in Maré, was shot dead four days earlier in the city's centre (along with her driver) after a meeting she had organised for young black women. \"She was killed for trying to make things better,\" said Diony, a supermarket employee watching the protesters parade slowly through Maré.\n\nThe assassination of Ms Franco, a young, black, gay activist, has reverberated far beyond her birthplace. It was the subject of 3.6m tweets in 34 languages in less than two days. Thousands of people marched in cities across Brazil. In February the president, Michel Temer, made Rio's crime a national issue when he ordered the army to take control of the state's police, prisons and fire services until the end of this year. This is the first such intervention since the end of military rule in 1985. Ms Franco's murder will help keep crime uppermost in Brazilians' minds when they vote in elections scheduled for October.\n\nSeventeen of the world's 50 most violent cities are Brazilian, according to Security, Justice and Peace, an NGO. In poor neighbourhoods, drug gangs battle for turf while the state stands by. In 2016 the number of murders nationwide was a record 61,600. Measured by its murder rate, the city of Rio does not even rank among the top 30 in Brazil. But the state of which it forms a part is uniquely dysfunctional. Three of its past four governors have been charged with corruption. Its government could not pay its bills in 2016 and was bailed out by the federal government.\n\nRio's \"military police\", its crime-prevention arm, says it has 2,000 fewer officers than it needs. Just half its fleet of patrol cars are in service. A community-policing scheme, which helped cut the murder rate in 2015 to its lowest level in 25 years, has been gutted. The state's penury weakens a police force already compromised by corruption. \"There's practically no serious crime in Rio without police participation,\" says Luiz Eduardo Soares, a former federal secretary of public security.\n\nLast year, with competition among drug gangs increasing, 6,731 people were killed in the state of Rio, the highest number since 2009. The city itself has ten times as many murders as London but less than half its homicide investigators.\n\nMr Temer, weakened by allegations of corruption, has offered himself as Rio's saviour. In the past the army has reinforced police forces, but it has never before commanded them. Now Walter Braga Netto, a general, is in charge of Rio's security. The state is \"a laboratory for Brazil\", he says.\n\nThe deployment of the army made political sense. It allowed the federal government to avoid humiliation in a congressional vote on its most important economic measure, a constitutional amendment to reform the pension system. (Such amendments cannot be voted on during federal interventions.) Sending the army looked like a way to undercut support for Jair Bolsonaro, a demagogic congressman from Rio who believes that \"a good criminal is a dead criminal.\" He is the second-most popular contender to succeed Mr Temer as president (after Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a left-wing former president who has been convicted of corruption and may not be able to run). Three-quarters of Brazilians support the army's intervention.\n\nBut there is scant reason to believe that the army will succeed where Rio's police have failed. It has \"limited training in arrests, crowd control or street-level operations that minimise casualties\", says Robert Muggah of the Igarapé Institute, a think-tank. Reluctant to brave the gangs, the army has so far mainly patrolled the streets by day. In one favela, Vila Kennedy, it has removed barricades put up by gangs to allow state services to enter. To do much more will require extra money. The federal government has said it will provide the army with 1bn reais ($300m) to police Rio; the army says it needs 1.5bn. Its deployment does nothing to reform the police. Four-fifths of Rio's residents say that the army has made no difference so far.\n\nMs Franco, a member of a small left-wing party, was a fierce critic both of the army's deployment and of the police. She was a member of a city-council commission that oversees the intervention and she accused the police of abuses in the weeks before her murder. On the day before she died she tweeted her suspicion that the military police had killed a young black man, Matheus Melo, as he left church.\n\nMany suspect that the murderers of Ms Franco are members of \"militias\" controlled by serving and former police officers, which run extortion rings in some favelas. In 2011 Patrícia Acioli, a judge who jailed around 60 police officers belonging to militias and death squads, was shot dead. Six military-police officers were convicted of the crime.\n\nMs Franco's murder, and the suspicion that police may be the culprits, have changed the tenor of Brazil's debate about crime. Mr Bolsonaro has said nothing about the killing, presumably because in its wake his harsh rhetoric would alienate centrist voters whose support he will soon need. Mr Temer's military response is starting to look simplistic. Rio, along with other cities and states, needs healthier finances, better-run police and schools and services that steer children away from crime. With luck, voters will demand that from the politicians they elect in October.",

                "title": "The short unhappy presidency of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski",
                "body": "PERU'S president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, left office on March 21st much the way he had governed during his 20 months in power. He walked out of the massive doors of the presidential palace and started waving to onlookers before taking a call on his mobile phone and ducking into a car. It was a low-key exit for the former banker, who was elected with one of the slimmest majorities in recent history and had little support in congress or among the 30m Peruvians he governed. Most had little idea how Mr Kuczynski planned to help Peru become a solidly middle-class country with strong institutions, as he had promised. His administration, like his departure, seemed distracted.\n\nWhat felled him, though, was his connection with Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction firm at the centre of multiple scandals across Latin America. In December congress obtained evidence that Westfield Capital, a company owned by Mr Kuczynski, had worked with Odebrecht while he was finance minister and prime minister in a government that awarded contracts to the company. He had repeatedly denied that he had had any contact with the firm. Congress, in which Mr Kuczynski's party has just 15 of the 130 seats, started impeachment proceedings.\n\nMr Kuczynski fought off that assault in December, apparently by striking a cynical deal. Kenji Fujimori, a congressman from the opposition Popular Force party, abstained along with nine others, which scuppered the impeachment. Days later, Mr Kuczynski pardoned Mr Fujimori's father, Alberto, a former president who was serving a 25-year jail sentence for human-rights violations. The agreement left Mr Kuczynski friendless. He had fought the election as a foe of fujimorismo, against the former president's daughter (and Kenji's sister) Keiko, who leads Popular Force. The pardon alienated his anti-Fujimori base without placating Keiko, who still controls the largest faction in congress (and expelled her brother from it).\n\nCalm comes from Canada\n\nOpposition congressmen resumed their attack this month, citing further evidence of questionable dealings with Odebrecht. Wilbert Rozas, from the left-wing Broad Front coalition, said the president \"showed zero understanding of the need to separate politics from his business life\". His downfall became inevitable on March 20th, when a video surfaced that showed Kenji Fujimori apparently promising another congressman public-works projects in his constituency in exchange for voting against impeachment. Mr Kuczynski's allies in congress then abandoned him.\n\nIn a seven-minute resignation speech, he blamed the opposition, saying it had undermined him from the day he took office. He accepted no responsibility himself.\n\nWith Mr Kuczynski gone, things may calm down. His successor is the vice-president, Martín Vizcarra, who was also serving as ambassador to Canada. As governor of the small southern region of Moquegua, he improved education (pupils in the region get the highest marks in Peru on standardised tests). He also brokered an agreement to develop a big copper mine between Anglo American, a mining company, and nearby communities, no easy task. He will be the first president in decades who has made his career outside the capital, which will appeal to a lot of voters.\n\nOpposition congressmen forced Mr Vizcarra out of his job as transport minister in May as part of their campaign of sabotage against Mr Kuczynski. They are likely to treat Mr Vizcarra more gently now, pundits predict. Few want to face another general election, which could be triggered if the chaos continues.\n\nMr Vizcarra must show soon that he is different from his ill-fated predecessor. \"He will fail quickly if he keeps the same kind of cabinet, with bland ministers who seem more interested in their business deals than governing,\" says Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at the Catholic University in Lima. And he will have to prove that, unlike Mr Kuczynski, he can get things done. \"When you ask people what the Kuczynski government did, they stare back at you. They have no response,\" says Mr Dargent. An early chance for Mr Vizcarra to shine will come on April 13th-14th, when Peru is due to host a regional summit. Donald Trump says he will attend.\n\nThe Odebrecht scandal will test Peruvians' faith in politicians and institutions. The company's former director in Peru testified in February that it financed campaigns for the last four presidents, including Mr Kuczynski. Mr Vizcarra must ensure that investigations proceed unimpeded, however painful the results.",

                "title": "Why Canada's prime minister is homeless",
                "body": "MOST heads of government have an official residence. It is normally an uncontroversial perk. Not so in Canada. Since 1951 the country's prime ministers have lived in 24 Sussex, a 34-room limestone mansion in Ottawa. Justin Trudeau, the current prime minister, did as a child, when his father, Pierre Trudeau, had the job. But he has taken up residence at Rideau Cottage on the neighbouring estate of the governor-general, the queen's representative in Canada. The problem is that 24 Sussex is too run-down to house Mr Trudeau, his wife and three children. And he does not want to take the political heat for approving repairs.\n\nNo one doubts that the 150-year-old house, built by a lumber baron, needs work. Ceilings and walls are impregnated with asbestos, a mineral so carcinogenic that Canada will ban its export next month. Some of the paint is lead-based. The place is infested with mice, which may be why Mr Trudeau's predecessor, Stephen Harper, liked cats. The auditor-general warned a decade ago that the plumbing was clapped out, the 50-year-old knob-and-tube wiring was near full capacity and heat was escaping through loose windows. The house needed C$10m ($10m) in repairs immediately, she said.\n\nRecent prime ministers have preferred to cope with the quirks of a house that last got a big renovation nearly 70 years ago. Jean Chrétien, who governed from 1993 to 2003, used buckets to catch rain. He blew a fuse when he plugged in a heater to supplement the feeble central heating. Paul Martin, his successor, made light of his discomfort on a satirical television show by visiting Canadian Tire, a hardware store, to buy plastic wrap for the windows. Mr Harper, a fiscal conservative, said his family would wear sweaters to ward off draughts. When he left, his moving boxes carried mould warnings.\n\nUnlike the White House or 10 Downing Street, 24 Sussex has no government function. It is just a residence, managed by the National Capital Commission (NCC), a government agency. Mr Trudeau works in an office block across the street from Parliament. Soon after he became prime minister in 2015 the NCC suggested several options for housing Canada's first family, from extensive repairs on 24 Sussex to knocking it down and building an environmentally friendly showpiece residence in its place. Suggestions have poured in from ordinary Canadians. A home-makeover reality television show called \"Reno my Reno\" offered to help fix the house up.\n\nBut Mr Trudeau is unconvinced. No prime minister wants to be accused of spending taxpayers' money to make his life more pleasant, he said recently. Mr Martin, who endured 24 Sussex for two years, suggests setting up a non-political body to keep up the house. Neither Mr Trudeau's office nor the NCC will say what they think of that idea. He seems resigned to spending his prime ministership as the governor-general's guest while his childhood home moulders across the street.",

                "title": "Mauricio Macri fights Argentina's tradition of handouts for votes",
                "body": "JUST off Leonardo da Vinci Avenue, a long street of modest shops and foul-smelling gutters in the district of La Matanza outside Buenos Aires, stands La Juanita, a co-operative. Founded by unemployed workers in 2001, it occupies a former school. It runs a free kindergarten, a microcredit programme, a call centre and, nearby, a large community bakery, all with the aim of helping the unemployed get work. Since Mauricio Macri, a former businessman of the centre-right, was elected as Argentina's president in 2015 La Juanita has become part of a political experiment.\n\nLa Matanza is in the heart of the conurbano, a sprawl of poor and crime-ridden suburbs around Argentina's capital which contains some 10m people. It was a bastion of support for Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the populist Peronist president from 2007 to 2015. Peronism long controlled the conurbano through clientelism, providing handouts in return for political loyalty. This system stopped offering social mobility, argues Héctor \"Toty\" Flores, a founder of La Juanita. The conurbano has become home to an underclass preyed on by drug gangs and dirty cops.\n\nMr Macri has attracted attention for his effort to stabilise and open Argentina's economy while avoiding shock therapy. Yet in the medium term his impact on his country's politics may be even bigger. The victory of Mr Macri's Cambiemos (\"Let's Change\") coalition in a legislative election last October means that everybody except diehard kirchneristas now thinks he will become the first elected president who is not a Peronist to finish his term since the movement was founded by Juan and Eva Perón in the 1940s. Barring accidents, he has a good chance of winning a second term in 2019. \"He has created a new equilibrium in the party system,\" says Juan Cruz Díaz, a political consultant.\n\nIt helps Mr Macri that an ally, María Eugenia Vidal, unexpectedly won election as governor of Buenos Aires province (which includes the conurbano) in 2015 against a weak kirchnerista candidate. Mr Macri and Ms Vidal promise a new kind of politics, with two pillars.\n\nThe first is more efficient delivery of public services to places that lack them. Mr Macri has built a rapid-transit bus line in La Matanza. \"People didn't even demand sewerage here because they couldn't get it,\" says Mr Flores. \"In a year they will have it.\" Officials say that they are able to spend more on public works, even while reducing the fiscal deficit and taxes, because they are cutting out waste and corruption. Marcos Peña, Mr Macri's chief of staff, cites a big tender for medicines this month, which he says came in 80% below the previous cost.\n\nLa Juanita now gets official support. A dozen of its members draw government salaries. The labour ministry has set up a small office there to help the unemployed draw up CVs. An IT training school will open next month. Ms Vidal's people see La Juanita as a model. \"If they can do it here, we can do it in other places,\" said Gabriela Besana, a visiting provincial legislator.\n\nThe second change is philosophical. The state will do different things. Mr Macri's people stress pre-school education and changing the physical and social environment in poor areas. The government will soon require jobless welfare recipients to attend school or training programmes. \"We don't ask anything [else] in return,\" says Mr Peña. \"Clientelism demands the subjection of the poor, rather than lifting them out of poverty,\" he adds. \"Our main aim is to offer these people the dignity of the middle class.\"\n\nPlenty could go wrong. Cambiemos has won over former Peronist political operators and risks lapsing into the same methods. La Juanita could itself become a vehicle for clientelism. Mr Flores is a congressman for Cambiemos. Then there is corruption. \"Off the record, this is a very honest government,\" says a political scientist, who fears any such statement in Argentina is a hostage to fortune.\n\nMr Macri's bet on economic gradualism could also be derailed. The middle class -- Mr Macri's own political base -- has felt the squeeze of higher utility bills as subsidies are withdrawn, but not yet many benefits from an economy that is growing at a rate of less than 3% per year. On the streets of La Matanza scepticism still outweighs hope. The divided Peronists may unite around more moderate policies. Perhaps the biggest risk is that success goes to the heads of Mr Macri's team of bright young technocrats.\n\nYet the potential prize for Cambiemos -- and for Argentina -- is great. Mr Macri is building a movement founded on the values of opportunity and aspiration, not dependence. If he succeeds, his example will echo around Latin America.",

                "title": "Britain pulls off a diplomatic coup against Russia at the EU",
                "body": "ONE question confronting Britain and the European Union is how to maintain foreign-policy and security co-operation after Brexit. Theresa May, Britain's prime minister, often notes that failure to find agreement would harm the security interests of both sides. On March 22nd that observation found a pointed form of expression at an EU summit in Brussels, following the recent nerve-agent attack on a Russian émigré and his daughter in Salisbury. After some agile British diplomacy the EU's 28 leaders issued a joint statement declaring that the only plausible explanation for the attack was that Russia was responsible for it.\n\nThis language, tougher than Mrs May had dared to hope, clears the way for further collective EU action, including on beefing up defensive instruments against Russian hybrid warfare, later this year. Nor was the European response limited to words. The EU's ambassador to Russia has been temporarily withdrawn to Brussels, and on March 26th several countries, possibly including France and Germany, are expected to announce that they are following the British example and expelling Russian diplomats. Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, reportedly asked her fellow leaders to state which of them would agree to do so.\n\nMrs May, whose experience inside the EU over the past 18 months has largely been one of humiliation, can chalk this up as a diplomatic win. EU leaders jealously guard their foreign-policy prerogatives (which is one reason why some of the promises to expel Russian spies may vanish on contact with domestic reality). To obtain tough language and common diplomatic action looked far from inevitable earlier this week. \"Russia is challenging the values we share as Europeans,\" declared the prime minister as she left the summit on March 23rd. \"It is right that we are standing together in defence of those values.\" Boyko Borisov, Bulgaria's prime minister and no Russia hawk, declared that: \"Despite Brexit, the UK and EU showed they are one and the same.\"\n\nOn first glance Mrs May's success looks like one in the eye to Remainers who suggested that Brexit would leave Britain diplomatically isolated. It is true that on everyday business British influence inside the EU has dwindled almost to nothing, much to the regret of traditional allies like the Dutch. But the summit demonstrated that Britain can still forge alliances and score diplomatic wins when it counts (especially welcome when its American ally looks increasingly unreliable). Contrast this with the experience after 2006, when Tony Blair's government was disappointed by the lukewarm support it received from its European allies over the Kremlin-sponsored poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian-born exile in London.\n\nSince then a lot has happened, including Russia's incursions into Ukraine and its support for Bashar al-Assad's atrocities in Syria. But if EU membership does not guarantee solidarity, it certainly helps. The statement of March 22nd was agreed by the 28 leaders only after Mrs May had convened Mrs Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, France's president, for a brief pre-dinner discussion. The trio issued a firm statement that prepared the ground for the subsequent debate. Over dinner, concerns from countries that tend to be dovish on Russia were overcome in various ways; Greece and Cyprus, for instance, were softened up with the promise of a tough EU stance on Turkish naval incursions and the recent arrest of two Greek soldiers who had strayed across the border. At its best, this is how matters are supposed to proceed inside the EU: leaders thrashing out differences, balancing competing interests and prioritising concerns before arriving at a common line.\n\nBut consider whether the same result could be obtained after Brexit. Mrs May would not have been in Brussels to convene impromptu summits with her French and German counterparts, let alone to make her case before all 28 leaders. British diplomats would have had no role in the multitude of decision-making groupings that constitute the inner workings of the EU, and would be unrepresented at ministerial meetings. The informal diplomatic treadmill would have to be worked with particular vigour. The prime minister would have to ask allies to engineer the sorts of diplomatic pirouettes that made statements such as these possible, and cross her fingers that they would deliver.\n\nIt should be possible, one way or another, to keep Britain plugged in to the EU's decision-making machinery after it leaves. Among other things, its European allies want to maintain access to British terrorist databases and intelligence assessments that undergird much of the EU's sanctions policy. The negotiating guidelines for Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the EU, signed off by the remaining 27 leaders on the morning of March 23rd, call for \"strong EU-UK co-operation\" in foreign and security policy. So Britain will not be isolated after Brexit. But its government will find it much harder to conjure support from outside the tent.",

                "body": "THE attack appears depressingly similar to several others in recent years in France. On March 23rd a young man, reportedly of north African origin and of declared allegiance to the so-called Islamic State, spread terror by shooting random unarmed victims: the occupants of a passing car in the south-western town of Carcassonne; policemen out jogging; and finally shoppers in a supermarket in Trèbes, a village of 5,000 people a few kilometres to the east. He might have imagined the police would be slow to react in such a small community.\n\nThe attacker, who screamed \"Allahu akbar\" (God is great) as he went about his work, tried to prolong the assault by taking hostages, a tactic used by other violent extremists in France and elsewhere, most notably at the Bataclan theatre in Paris in November 2015, where 90 people died. The goal, in such cases, appears to be to attract as much attention as possible, and to stir up public frustration if police are slow to respond. This time, the reaction was relatively swift. By mid-afternoon, three hours after the first reported shots, police had killed the gunman at the supermarket. By then three people (besides the attacker) were reported dead, and several more injured.\n\nThe French authorities have long been concerned that lone attackers, radicalised either through visits to Syria's civil war or at home by exposure to extremism online, are hard to spot before they act. President Emmanuel Macron, speaking after the gunman was killed, talked of a persistent terrorist menace in the country, as \"dangerous individuals\" are influenced by Islamic State or other \"exterior forces\". Ministers named the gunman as Redouane Lakdim, a 26-year-old. It was not clear how he had been radicalised, nor if he had been on a police watch list.\n\nFor Mr Macron, who became president last year, this was the most serious test of how his government handles an attack, and the first since France lifted its 719-day-long state of emergency, imposed after Bataclan, last November. Last October a man who also claimed allegiance to Islamic State stabbed two young women to death at Marseille train station. Police promptly shot him. Three attacks in Paris, in June and August, led to injuries but no deaths, other than that of one of the perpetrators.\n\nThe young president has mostly taken a muscular approach to violent extremists. Unlike his predecessor, François Hollande, Mr Macron does not talk of conducting \"war\" against terrorism. But he does promote tough security measures that -- say opinion polls -- are popular. Opération Sentinelle, which involves the deployment of 10,000 heavily armed soldiers on streets, is widely liked. An anti-terrorism law, passed last November to replace the state of emergency, made permanent some of the government's emergency powers. For example, the interior ministry, rather than judges, now has the final say on orders restricting the movements of suspects. Officials, not courts, can order the closure of places of worship deemed suspect.\n\nMr Macron has also promised the security services more resources. He pledged last year that France will have 10,000 extra police by 2022. And in June a new intelligence centre co-ordinating efforts against extremists was set up in the Elysée Palace, the president's residence and office. The new National Centre for Counter-Terrorism, led by a former chief of counter-espionage, Pierre de Bousquet de Florian, is supposed to have made French officialdom more professional in dealing with threats. As ever, though, the security services get little attention from the public however many attacks they foil. (Supposedly over 30 were stopped while the state of emergency was in effect.) Any failure to prevent an attack, though, grabs the headlines.",

                "body": "IN AN era of deep partisan division in America, is there anything about which Democrats and Republicans still agree? A new working paper by Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, finds a few remaining areas of common ground. His study relies on surveys conducted by YouGov, a pollster, which asked 2,500 Americans to rate on a scale from zero to ten how favourably they view different individuals and social groups. A zero corresponded to \"extremely unfavourably\" and a ten corresponded to \"extremely favourably\".\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most polarising groups are those that tend to divide the major parties: Democrats, for instance, are not big fans of the National Rifle Association, while Republicans tend to frown upon Black Lives Matter. Politicians usually draw the ire of the opposing party. Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, manages to draw the contempt of both parties.\n\nEven subjects that don't typically feature in campaign ads show yawning partisan gaps -- for example, Democrats are much more likely to admire the United Nations than Republicans are. The few topics that received high scores from both parties tended to be blandly unobjectionable, such as nurses and farmers. Perhaps the strongest point of concurrence was that respondents from both parties found Congress equally distasteful.",

Wang Qishan, who has led Mr Xi's crackdown on corruption, was made vice-president, a hitherto ceremonial position that may now be beefed up to oversee relations with America. Liu He, Mr Xi's economic adviser, was named as one of four deputy prime ministers and given the brief of supervising the People's Bank of China and other regulatory bodies. The PBOC, in turn, will be headed by Yi Gang, another new appointment, who, like Mr Liu, has studied in America. See article.\n\nChina's aircraft-carrier entered the Taiwan Strait again. This was probably as a show of defiance to America, which has angered Beijing by passing a law that encourages contacts between American and Taiwanese officials. Taiwanese ships tracked the vessel.\n\nThe diplomatic effort to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula continued apace. Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, held open the possibility of three-way talks with America and North Korea if a summit planned for April between the South and North is productive. Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced that South Korea and the United States will resume joint military exercises that were postponed during the Winter Olympics.\n\nMyanmar's president, Htin Kyaw, resigned with immediate effect. Rumours have swirled for months that he is in poor health. Htin Kyaw was the country's first civilian president since the early 1960s and is a confidant of Aung San Suu Kyi, who is the de facto head of Myanmar's government, even if the president is constitutionally in charge.\n\nA suicide-bomber targeted crowds at a shrine celebrating the Persian new year in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, killing at least 31 people.\n\nOut of captivity\n\nMost of the 110 Nigerian schoolgirls who were recently abducted by Boko Haram in the town of Dapchi were freed. The government insists that it did not pay a ransom for their return. The jihadists warned the girls' parents not to put them back in school. See article.\n\nDozens of African leaders signed an ambitious free-trade deal. All 55 members of the African Union negotiated the agreement, but 11 did not sign, including Nigeria, the continent's largest economy. See article.\n\nFor the first time Israel admitted to bombing a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria in 2007. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, said the attack showed that Israel will prevent its enemies from developing nuclear weapons.\n\nTurkey captured the northern Syrian region of Afrin after a two-month battle with Kurdish fighters. Meanwhile, Syrian government forces took back more territory in besieged Eastern Ghouta, the last rebel stronghold near Damascus. See article.\n\nHe's gone\n\nPedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned as Peru's president after 20 months in office. The country's congress was threatening to impeach him based on evidence that a company he founded had worked with Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company that bribed officials across Latin America. He had served as finance minister and prime minister in an earlier government that awarded contracts to Odebrecht. Mr Kuczynski will be succeeded by the vice-president, Martín Vizcarra. See article.\n\nTens of thousands of Brazilians protested against the execution-style murder of Marielle Franco, a left-wing city councillor in Rio de Janeiro. Ms Franco, who was black and gay, had accused the police of abuses and was a critic of the decision by Brazil's government to put the army in charge of security in the state of Rio. See article.\n\nAmerica toughened sanctions against Venezuela's authoritarian regime. It added four current and former officials to the list of 49 whose American assets are frozen. Donald Trump signed an executive order barring Americans from buying or selling the petro, a crypto-currency issued by Venezuela's government. Only the most risk-hungry investors were buying it in the first place.\n\nCruel and unusual punishment\n\nThe sacking of Andrew McCabe at the FBI, where he was deputy director until January, was seen by many as an attempt to discredit him as a witness in Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling. Mr McCabe was on paid leave and was fired for an alleged lack of \"candour\" in dealings with the media. He had been the target of much of Donald Trump's invective. Last December the president tweeted that Mr McCabe was \"racing the clock\" to retire with a full pension. He was sacked 26 hours before he was due to receive that pension.\n\nCongress hurried yet again to pass a bill that would avoid a government shutdown.\n\nThe suspect behind several explosive devices, mostly contained in packages, that left two men dead and injured several other people in or near Austin, Texas, blew himself up during a police chase. Police are investigating the motive.\n\nQuelle surprise\n\nVladimir Putin easily won a fourth term as Russia's president, taking more than 77% of the vote. However, there were widespread allegations of stuffed ballot-boxes, and the main opposition candidate, Alexei Navalny, was not allowed to stand. Despite this, Mr Putin was congratulated by Donald Trump and by Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. See article.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy, a former president of France, was placed under formal investigation as part of a probe into allegations that he received millions of euros in illegal election funding from the regime of the late Libyan dictator, Muammar Qaddafi.\n\nIn Slovakia,the government headed by Robert Fico collapsed in the face of widespread protests over the murder of a journalist who was investigating government corruption.\n\nBritish and European Union negotiators approved the details of the Brexit transition proposals that were agreed in December. Britain will formally leave the EU in March 2019, but be bound by its regulations until the end of 2020. During the transition trade deals can be negotiated with other countries. But the Irish border question remains unresolved; the \"backstop\" solution that keeps Northern Ireland in the EU customs union is in the document, for now. In Britain Leavers said the deal betrayed the fishing industry, and threw fish into the River Thames outside Parliament in protest. See article.",

Cambridge Analytica allegedly used the data to create voter profiles during the 2016 presidential election in America, enabling the Trump campaign to craft messages to potential supporters. Facebook banned the app in 2015. It said it had been \"deceived\" and promised to tighten up its rules on data. Politicians in America and Britain called for tighter regulation of social media. Facebook's share price swooned. See article.\n\nInvestors worried about Alphabet, the parent company of Google, being caught up in any regulatory blowback about data privacy also sent its share price down. That helped Amazon, which has seen its share price rise by a third since the start of the year, pass Alphabet to become the world's second-most-valuable listed company. Amazon is worth $770bn (still some way behind Apple, at $870bn).\n\nThe European Commission proposed levying a 3% tax on revenues of big technology companies, such as Google and Facebook, that operate in Europe, but have \"little or no physical presence\" in the region. The proposal is an interim measure and requires unanimity among the EU's member states to be adopted. See article.\n\nAmid strong demand, Dropbox raised the price of its IPO on the NASDAQ exchange to between $18 and $20 a share, from the $16 to $18 it had initially announced.

AT&T argues that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (the FAANGs) have completely transformed the relationship between content providers and distributors, and that it needs to buy Time Warner and its stable of broadcast programming to stay in the game. The Justice Department is challenging the deal on antitrust grounds, an unusual move given that the merger is a vertical one, combining two businesses that do not compete directly.\n\nSalesforce, the world's fourth-largest software company, made its biggest acquisition to date by agreeing to buy MuleSoft in a deal valued at $6.5bn. MuleSoft provides a platform for businesses to integrate data from the cloud as well as from in-house servers.\n\nThe Federal Reserve raised the range for its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to between 1.5% and 1.75%. The Fed signalled that rates may increase more than expected over the medium term because of the strengthening economy, but stuck to its expectations of two more rate rises this year.\n\nBritain's inflation rate fell sharply, to 2.7%, but wages grew by 2.6%, the fastest pace in nearly two-and-a-half years.\n\nLloyd's reported an annual pre-tax loss of £2bn ($2.6bn), its first since 2011. Lloyds, an insurance market based in London, was hit by £4.5bn in claims related to natural disasters in 2017, including the worst hurricane season in years, earthquakes in Mexico and wildfires in California.\n\nA tragic first\n\nA driverless car being tested by Uber killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona. It is not the first fatal collision involving autonomous cars, but it is the first accident resulting in the death of a pedestrian. Police and federal safety agencies launched investigations, and Uber suspended all driverless testing. Critics raised concerns that safety has been compromised in the rush to get autonomous vehicles on the road. Many American states allow testing but require a person to be in the car, as happened in this instance, in the event that anything goes wrong. See article.\n\nIvan Glasenberg, the boss of Glencore, said that Western carmakers were falling behind China in stockpiling supplies of cobalt, one of the key elements in the batteries that power electric cars. Glencore has signed a contract to provide a Chinese firm with a third of its cobalt output over the next three years. Mr Glasenberg suggested he was prepared to sell Glencore's cobalt mines to China if the price was right, and warned that China would use the material to boost its own electric-vehicle industry. See article.\n\nLet us pay\n\nThe Church of England decided to give parishioners the choice of making contactless payments. Faster ways of paying for events like weddings and christenings may appeal to younger people, who tend to be less keen on cash. But offerings in the aisles have yet to move with the times.

                "body": "IN THE original Godzilla movie, made in Japan back in 1954, the testing of American nuclear weapons leads to the creation of a giant dinosaur that threatens to destroy not just Japan, but the rest of the world. Now Asians face another American creation that seems to be laying waste to all around it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has already pulled out of the TPP (the Trans-Pacific trade pact) and the Paris climate change agreement. Now he appears determined to roll back the international trade arrangements that have been in place since 1945. Yesterday's announcement of tariffs on $60bn of Chinese trade threatens to launch a trade war between the world's two largest economies (the Chinese have already suggested retaliatory measures). Small wonder that Asian markets have taken a hit today (March 23rd); Japan's Nikkei was down 4.5%, China's Shanghai Shenzhen dropped 2.9%; Hong Kong's Hang Seng 2.5%. European markets have opened nearly 2% lower.\n\nAll this could be bluster; Godzilla, after all, is usually subdued by the end of the film. The recent announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports has been followed by a wide list of exemptions including the EU. President Trump's strategy seems to be to threaten and then to withdraw those threats in return for small concessions from the other side; that way, he gets kudos from his political base without causing any economic damage.\n\nOn the other side of the Pacific, Elsa Lignos of the Royal Bank of Canada says that \"China will opt to under- rather than over-react.\" Capital Economics says the damage to the Chinese economy from the tariffs will be only 0.1% of GDP.\n\nBut that was not the only thing President Trump did yesterday; he appointed John Bolton as his third national security adviser in 14 months. Mr Bolton, a noted hawk, argued the case for a first strike on North Korea less than four weeks ago. Ms Lignos views this appointment as \"a more rational concern\" than a trade war. Citigroup concludes that, together with the tariffs, \"These developments unambiguously raise short-term market risks.\"\n\nBluster or not, investors are understandably concerned. Just two months ago, virtually none of the fund managers polled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch picked a trade war as the main market risk; in the latest survey, it tops the polls at 30%. It is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which things go rapidly downhill from here. Investors have been dismissing the bearish implications of a flattening yield curve (often a sign of recession) and the widening gap between the Libor rate and the swap rate. Nor should they generally welcome a situation where President Trump's tactics are deemed to be successful. That might only encourage further rampages. After all, there have been 31 Godzilla movies so far.",

                "body": "TOM RACHMAN'S latest novel is the story of a great man and the wreckage greatness leaves in its wake. It chronicles the life and legend of Bear Bavinsky, a painter of enormous appetites and all-consuming ego, largely through the eyes of his son, Charles (known as Pinch). Their names capture the complexion of their fraught relationship. Bear lumbers through life heedless of his impact; Pinch shrinks, unable to escape the giant's shadow, hoping only to avoid being trampled underfoot.\n\nPinch is far from the only victim of the Bavinsky legend. Speaking to Natty, his current wife -- Pinch's mother, and a potter whose insecurities provide the perfect foil for his overbearing personality -- Bavinsky proclaims: \"You are a talent, my Natty. If you want to be. All it takes is a bit more oomph.\" Bear is oomph incarnate. He charms and bullies, holds forth and rages, occupying physical and psychic space. Even his encouragement turns out to be another way to assert dominance, proving how far those close to him have fallen short of his own achievement.\n\n\"The Italian Teacher\" unspools over more than 60 years and across two continents. One of Mr Rachman's gifts is his ability to evoke a time and place in a few deft strokes, whether that is the seedy charm of post-war Rome or the New York art scene of the late 1960s, when Abstract Expressionist sincerity was giving way to Pop irony. He captures the disorienting social and economic shifts of Italy in the 1950s through the Bavinskys' downstairs neighbours, \"a family of carpenters who, for generations, carved ornamental altarpieces but whose sons are now selling West German vacuum cleaners\". He gets to the heart of Thatcher-era London, with its \"thin surface of civility covering deep pools of aggression\".\n\nDespite its breadth, though, the book is intimate, subtly exploring its characters' inner lives. Though Bear bestrides the narrative, it is Pinch who commands the reader's respect. An \"insubstantial man\", as he himself admits, he is diffident, filled with self-loathing, incapable of standing up to his bullying father. Like Natty, he is all damage and insecurity, a victim of Bear's insatiable needs.\n\nYet he turns out to be far more than the sum of his failures. He is redeemed by his honesty, intelligence and wit, plus his determination to spare neither himself nor others the verdict of his finely tuned sensibility. His struggle to find meaning amid the rubble becomes a surprisingly suspenseful quest. For all his faults, Pinch is gifted with wisdom, as is the author of this sad, funny and moving novel.",

                "body": "THE zombies that appear in Chinese legends are not quite the same as their Western counterparts. They feast on blood, not brains, and hop about rather than staggering forwards. The differences extend to economics. Chinese officials, like their Western peers, openly fret about zombie companies -- insolvent firms kept alive by banks -- but are far less willing to kill them off. This small excursion into the world of the undead is one of many gems in Dinny McMahon's new book, a vivid account of China's economic problems, from debt to falsified data.\n\nMr McMahon, a veteran financial correspondent in China, most recently with the Wall Street Journal, wears his knowledge lightly, whether discussing ghost stories or balance sheets. His book, \"China's Great Wall of Debt\", is notable for two reasons. It is one of the clearest and most thorough statements of an argument often made about the country: that its government has relied on constant stimulus to keep growth strong, an addiction that is bound to backfire. Second, he comes closer than any previous writer to covering the Chinese economy as Michael Lewis, the hugely popular author of \"The Big Short\", might do. His analysis is informed but accessible, animated by anecdotes and characters, some colourful, some verging on tragic.\n\nIn a chapter on government meddling, he introduces a hedge-fund analyst who accused a publicly listed Chinese silver-mining company of fraud. Police arrested him, kept him awake for three days and jailed him for two years; he was ultimately found guilty of \"impairing business credibility\". In a chapter on the deadweight of state-owned companies, Mr McMahon visits a factory owned by Erzhong, a machinery-maker that built the world's biggest hydraulic press forge, used for pounding out metal. But the forge, based on Russian designs from the 1980s, is outdated and the country oversupplied. These days retired workers harvest vegetables planted on unused land along the factory's walls. In a chapter on financial bubbles, Mr McMahon tracks the boom and bust in Moutai, China's most prized brand of baijiu, a grain-based spirit, through the story of an auctioneer.\n\nAs with any financial mess, there is plenty of blame to go around for these excesses. Reckless investors, greedy lenders and lax regulation have all played a part. But Mr McMahon shows that China's political system is at the heart of the dysfunction. Short of tax revenues, local governments treat land as free money, expropriating it cheaply and then selling it at inflated prices. Since the promotions of officials are traditionally based on economic growth, they are encouraged to spend public money first and ask questions later. Implicit guarantees make for financial distortions. Few think big state-owned banks will ever be allowed to fail or that large state-owned firms will ever be pushed into bankruptcy.\n\nYet for all the undeniable weaknesses in China's economy, the central argument of the book is debatable. In his introduction Mr McMahon explains that he will neither delve into the government's efforts to clean up bad loans nor examine bright spots such as the tech sector. That makes sense as a way to keep the narrative sharp. Nevertheless, the clean-up and the bright spots matter. Over the past year the government's economic priority has been to defuse debt risks. It has made some headway, not least by thinning the ranks of zombie factories. Meanwhile the blossoming of the tech sector is one example of how China retains the ability to transcend its past mistakes.\n\nMr McMahon is among the most compelling of the many analysts who conclude that China's economic miracle will end painfully. But until now such forecasts have served as inadvertent testaments to the country's resilience. Despite so much in its economy that looks so deeply rotten, China may yet emerge from its boom stronger than the doomsayers predict.",

                "title": "A symbolic struggle over ancient manuscripts",
                "body": "THE pages crackle, specks of parchment falling to the ground like snowflakes. Wrapped in a white shawl, the book open on his knees on an embroidered velvet cloth, Father Teklehaimanot turns the sheets fastidiously lest the leather ligature tear them. Inside the text is dull and faded. By contrast, the colours of the illustrations are brilliant, rich purples and blues that brighten the gloom of the monastery. On the floor lies the cloth in which the volume is usually enfolded; beside it, the pile of boxes on which it rests. This is where one of the world's most precious religious artefacts is kept, as it has been for as long as the monks can remember.\n\nThe Garima Gospels are not easy to see. These illuminated Christian manuscripts -- at around 1,500 years old, perhaps the oldest of their kind in existence -- belong to Abba Garima monastery, which is perched on a remote outcrop in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia. The roughly 100 monks store the two books in a circular treasure-house next to the church. Down a slope, just beyond the cloister, is a small museum, built six years ago with the help of the French government, but it is almost empty. The gospels were placed there only briefly before the monks removed them to their customary home. Visiting researchers are occasionally admitted -- as The Economist was after lengthy negotiation -- but tourists are rarely welcomed.\n\nThe ongoing dispute over where and how the gospels should be kept, and who may see them, is intensely local yet symbolic. It revolves around the age-old traditions of an isolated monastery, but it exemplifies the scepticism sometimes aroused by Western heritage programmes. It encapsulates the rival claims of sacred rites and secular scholarship, raising questions about the aim of preservation and the ultimate ownership of a nation's culture.\n\nAccording to legend the gospels -- written in the ancient language of Ge'ez -- are the work of Abba (Father) Garima, a Byzantine prince who founded the monastery in the 5th or early 6th century. The monks have protected the relics from Muslim invaders, colonial armies and fires. The monastery has been sacked or looted at least four times, most recently by the occupying Italians in 1936, each time being rebuilt.\n\nIt is unlikely the gospels have ever left its walls. They were unknown to the outside world until Beatrice Playne, an English artist, visited in the late 1940s. Women are not allowed inside the compound, so the manuscripts were brought out to her. In recent years scholarly interest in them has surged. Vital restoration work was carried out by the Ethiopian Heritage Fund, a British charity, in the mid-2000s. Today a trickle of foreign academics arrive at Abba Garima's gates seeking the gospels' clues to the early history of eastern Christianity.\n\nBut the monks' suspicions run deep. A long history of cultural theft has scarred Ethiopia. In April riches plundered by the British in 1867-68 go on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, despite long-standing calls for their return. During the Italian occupation many artefacts were taken from Ethiopian churches to museums in Rome, afterwards vanishing. Lately there has been an uptick in low-profile thefts, driven by a flourishing black market in Ethiopian antiquities. \"People come here with permission from the government, but then we find them doing other things,\" says Father Teklehaimanot warily.\n\nThe monks' unease reflects a broader move against researchers by the Ethiopian Orthodox church. Scholars say it has become almost impossible to study ancient manuscripts. Photographing them is generally forbidden. Efforts by European and American libraries to digitise hundreds of thousands of Christian codices have ended abruptly, often bitterly. For some in the church, a deficit of trust is compounded by a concern over authority: control of texts confers it, sharing them dilutes it. \"There is a feeling that if these manuscripts are made too accessible the church will lose its secrets,\" says Michael Gervers, a historian at the University of Toronto. Some see digitisation as akin to robbery.\n\nThe moving of sacred objects to profane settings arouses particular anxieties. \"Museums necessarily re-contextualise the objects on display,\" says Michael Di Giovine, author of \"The Heritage-scape\", a book about heritage and tourism. In the Catholic and Orthodox faiths, he points out, veneration often involves touching, kissing, burning incense and audible prayer, \"things you simply cannot do in a Western-style museum\". He points to the case of St Pio of Pietrelcina in Italy, whose body was exhumed in 2008 and displayed in a glass sarcophagus; distressed pilgrims tried to sue the church authorities for commercialising the shrine. Father Columba Stewart, an American Benedictine monk who digitised the Garima Gospels in 2013 for the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library in Minnesota, observes a similar worry in Ethiopia -- that the placing of manuscripts under glass takes them too far from their role in religious ceremony.\n\nDust to dust\n\nConversely, researchers fret about the gospels' future in their current setting. When Jacques Mercier, a French art historian, visited in 1995, the second volume of gospels seemed to have gone missing (it turned up later). As their custodians become aware of their financial value, the temptation to profit grows. Some monks can be bribed to produce the parchments for viewing, risking damage. \"Every time you open the book the edges turn to dust,\" says Mr Gervers. \"So bit by bit they will fall apart.\"\n\nAt bottom this is a fundamental disagreement about heritage. To whom, in the end, do jewels such as the Garima Gospels belong? Since at least the 1960s Western ideas of conservation have emphasised humanity's common inheritance and the ideal of universal access. This view replaces the principle of ownership with one of stewardship. Thus Mr Gervers suggests UNESCO should intervene to protect the gospels. Others think they should be taken into temporary custody by the church authorities. \"It's a matter not of who owns them, per se, but whether they are available to the public to study and examine,\" says Getahun Girma, an Ethiopian scholar. \"The monasteries don't have the resources -- the knowledge, the money, the organisational set-up -- to do this.\"\n\nBut this universalist approach is not common in Ethiopia, even if the church officially encourages the keeping of antiquities in museums. In any case, an Ethiopian monastery is an island, the writ of the outside world barely reaching its gates.\n\nAbba Garima's isolation has helped keep the manuscripts safe for centuries. The treasure-house may be cluttered and dirty, but it is bone-dry and closely guarded. \"Many things were lost through history, but they kept these treasures,\" Daniel Seife-Michael, a scholar and priest of the Ethiopian Orthodox church, says of the monks. \"They would die to protect them.\"",

                "title": "A child bride who longed to dance",
                "body": "A HOME-COOKED Ethiopian meal is a sensual journey, which extends beyond the warm flavours of ginger and cardamom that spice the languidly served stews. There is also the tactile joy of tearing and rolling injera, a spongy and bubbly flat bread, before using it to mop up sauces. Best of all is the whiff of green coffee beans roasted in a cast-iron skillet, which is carried around the table to give each guest a full measure of its aroma.\n\nTo read Aida Edemariam's \"The Wife's Tale\" is to savour the life of her grandmother, Yetemegnu. It is a life scented with ginger and garlic, cardamom and basil, which spans emperors, revolutions, invasion, conquest and liberation. Rather than cataloguing Ethiopia's turbulent modern history, Ms Edemariam stitches together the fragmentary memories and experiences of a single woman.\n\nAs is the paradox of memory, some of the oldest are the most vivid. Yetemegnu is married, aged just eight, to Tsega, a religious student more than 20 years older than her; she remembers the calls of children playing outside, and wishing she was with them. After the ceremony, at the start of two weeks of feasting, when someone starts to beat a drum, the sound is quickly silenced. Yetemegnu aches to dance, but her mother says that would attract the evil eye. \"She would always remember that no one danced at her wedding,\" Ms Edemariam writes. \"And for the rest of her life she would try to make up for it.\"\n\nDuring Yetemegnu's first years of marriage she is not altogether a child, but also not an adult. Bossed about by servants who refuse to play with her, she watches out of the windows as donkeys, slaves and nuns walk past. Her education, such as it is, consists of being taught to sing the alphabet, psalms and set texts by a blind teacher. He advises Tsega that his wife should not be allowed to read, because she is too quick to learn and quotes the Bible in her own defence. So the lessons stop, and the physical abuse begins.\n\nTsega -- who later rose to high office in the church -- first beats her when she runs to a neighbour to borrow a pot. After his anger passes he soothes her, comforting her in her grief after her mother dies by promising to be a mother to her himself. By 14 she, too, has a child.\n\nAs she endures pregnancies and labours perfumed by incense, Ethiopia changes around her. In 1930 Haile Selassie becomes emperor. Five years later he flees the Italian invaders. Yetemegnu is swept along by her husband and household as they move to the mountains and back to the cities, seeking sanctuary. Her tale is filled with sadness and loss. \"When were you happy?\" the author once asked her grandmother. \"I'm never happy, came the answer...All of my life is painted in tears.\"\n\nYet hers is also a life of fortitude and freedom. With motherhood and maturity, Yetemegnu grows in confidence. At about 20 she is preparing to visit a neighbour when Tsega tells her to stay. This time, after the beating, she gathers her children and leaves. She returns only after a deputation of village elders convinces her that he will not hurt her again. When, some time later, he raises a stick against her, she stares him in the eye until he lowers his arm. For all the violence in her marriage, it also contains love, courage and fealty. When Tsega is arrested and unjustly jailed, Yetemegnu petitions first the governor and then the emperor. After his death in prison, she mourns him as the man who had plaited her hair when she was a child: \"my husband, who raised me\".\n\nDecades later, after the fall of the emperor, while retrieving banknotes she had hidden in the pages of a child's book, she looks down at the letters and suddenly words leap out at her. A woman who until then could only painstakingly scratch out her name finds sentences unfolding. As for the child who was not allowed to dance at her own marriage ceremony? Attending the wedding of two of her brothers, she sees a circle of women clapping their hands. She joins it, hands on hips, shoulders down, and dances, faster and faster, until she can barely move.",

                "body": "LAST September Mamadou Ndiaye swam for 24 hours in the Atlantic Ocean. As he contended with the powerful currents, his head bobbing in the waves, his eyes became bleary with exhaustion. Mr Ndiaye, a swimming instructor from Saint-Louis in Senegal, was tracked and filmed by boat and drones over the four days of his exertions. This month his image was beamed onto a giant fabric screen at the Dutch National Opera, as a chorus of 115 singers, illuminated in the background like ghostly apparitions, performed Hans Werner Henze's surging oratorio \"Das Floss der Medusa\". The evening drew connections across different art-forms, and between historical woes and modern tragedy.\n\nHenze's work was inspired by Théodore Gericault's painting of 1819, \"The Raft of the Medusa\" (pictured). That depicts a calamity of three years earlier, when the Méduse , a French naval frigate, ran aground off the West African coast. After the top brass boarded the available lifeboats, the remaining crew hastily constructed a raft, tying it to the boats. Making no headway, the commanding officer ordered the tow-lines to be cut; the more than 150 men and one woman on the raft were set adrift. Sustained by only a few casks of water and wine, they resorted to suicide, murder and cannibalism. Only about ten survived. Gericault's painting portrays a moment when an African crewman, Jean-Charles, raises a red flag to signal to a distant ship.\n\nThe Méduse became an international scandal. The oratorio, meanwhile, has a tumultuous history of its own. Henze intended it as a requiem for Che Guevara. Its premiere in Hamburg in 1968 drew political protests that devolved into a riot; the debut was cancelled before it began. The music was eventually heard for the first time in 1971, in Vienna. It has been performed only a handful of times, and never staged -- until the new production in Amsterdam by Romeo Castellucci, a radical Italian director. For him the work reflects the plight of the thousands of migrants who each year drown in the Mediterranean in their bid to reach Europe. \"The 'Raft of the Medusa' is a metaphor of the human condition, for the poor and miserable of the Earth who are constantly abandoned by the powerful,\" he argues.\n\nOne reason for the music's infrequent performance, he says, is that it requires a huge chorus. In Amsterdam the voices of the National Opera were fortified by two other choirs, Capella Amsterdam and the New Amsterdam Youth Choir. The chorus remained behind the screen, rising and falling on an unseen lift, so that it appeared to be floating. The three lead singers -- Charon (the ferryman to the underworld), La Mort (Death) and Jean-Charles, the sailor -- travelled between the worlds of the dead and living. On the screen Mr Ndiaye swam, splashed and gasped. The constant motion of the waves left some members of the audience feeling sea-sick. \"The music is quite cold and fragmented,\" says Mr Castellucci. \"It's built like a raft, with different pieces collected with parts from a shipwreck. You can feel the sense of crisis but also the sense of salvation.\"\n\nHis main challenge was to maintain dramatic momentum despite the lack of action. \"In opera there's a story,\" notes Mr Castellucci. \"An oratorio is closer to the idea of ritual in which everything is still\" -- much like Gericault's painting, he says. As part of his preparation he visited the site of the Méduse's shipwreck. He recruited Mr Ndiaye in Senegal, instructing him to enter the water at precisely the spot where the raft was set adrift, then to swim to the point of exhaustion. \"It's an icon of our time: the head of a black man floating above the water, trying to survive,\" Mr Castellucci reckons. \"I wanted the audience to be face to face with this struggle.\"\n\nThe name of the ship adds a further resonance to this encounter with adversity. In Greek mythology, Mr Castellucci recalls, Medusa is changed into a monster, with snakes for hair and a face that turns its beholders to stone. \"The Medusa in mythological memory is the image you cannot see because...you will be petrified,\" he says. \"How can we look at all these events on the sea? The spectator is a part of all of this, not just an observer.\"",

                "title": "Tacita Dean big year makes the case for the warmth of film",
                "body": "BALZAC had some unusual ideas about photography, a new invention in his time. The Frenchman believed that all objects were \"made up of a series of ghostly images superimposed in layers to infinity,\" and that the camera captured one of those layers. Tacita Dean's eerie new exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, on until May 28, in which flickering cinematic screens float in the middle of dark rooms, like layers caught in suspension, seems to encourage such spiritual notions as Balzac's.\n\nMs Dean was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1998, and found success as part of the generation of so-called Young British Artists. But unlike her contemporaries Damian Hirst and Tracy Emin, Ms Dean is not quite a household name. Her standing in the art world, though, is immense. It would be hard to find another living artist able to pull off the trick that Ms Dean has done: three shows at once in three of London's most important cultural institutions, each focusing on a different genre: still-life at the National Gallery, landscape at the Royal Academy and portraiture at the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nEarly in her career Ms Dean became known for making enigmatic short films, often displayed in galleries on loop. One project of hers in 1996, \"Disaappearance at Sea\" dealt with the story of Donald Crowhurst, who vanished from his boat while faking a winning course in a round-the-world boat race. The incident, which happened in 1969, was the subject of a Hollywood film starring Colin Firth released this year; Ms Dean's treatment of the subject, a mesmeric 14-minute film of a lighthouse at sunset, with no discernable narrative, was decidedly un-Hollywood. More recently Ms Dean has become known for her innovative techniques, 3D-printing special camera parts which allow her to expose different sections of the same film reel at different times, leading to a kind of film collage. Her vast film projection for the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in 2011 used this method.\n\nIndeed, though she paints, draws, takes photographs and makes installations, Ms Dean is best known for her work using traditional 16mm, 35mm and 70mm photochemical film, a fast-disappearing medium for which she is something of an evangelist. In 2006 she made \"Kodak\", a 16mm looping film shot in a French Kodak factory that was then closing down, as consumers turned to digital and stopped buying film in their millions. More parts of the photochemical film industry on which she relies have since been dismantled, including her European developing lab. But her commitment to the medium is far from wavering. \"It is different,\" she says with uncommon zeal. Her campaign group to save the original cinematic medium has found a high-profile ally in the form of Christopher Nolan, who shoots on film, and who even arranged for his recent blockbuster, \"Dunkirk\", to be projected on traditional 70mm in many cinemas last year.\n\nMany films are today shot on film and then edited and projected digitally. But Ms Dean, more hard-line than Mr Nolan, stipulates that all her films must always be shown as film prints on traditional projectors; as a result the halls of her National Portrait Gallery show hum with the sound of over a dozen of these increasingly rare machines, throwing out her films in flickering loops.\n\nObsessed with this old medium, Ms Dean is often charged with nostalgia. It is a charge she denies. Her art, she says, \"deals with what is happening now,\" and that she is \"not a luddite\" -- she has a smartphone like everyone else. It is possible, however, to be nostalgic and not be a luddite. While Ms Dean's use of 3D printing proves she is not in protest about the modern world, many of her films certainly have a richly nostalgic feeling to them -- being ruminative portraits of ageing artists, writers and actors who themselves represent a fast-vanishing age. These films are certainly elegiac, and occasionally a little bit earnest.\n\nThat does not means she cannot indulge in the occasional joke. Take her film portrait of Claes Oldenberg, a legendary Danish sculptor, seated in his private museum of everyday objects, carefully cleaning a clockwork plastic sushi roll; or that of Michael Hamburger, a poet and translator, talking for just a bit too long about his obsession with apples in the film portrait Ms Dean made of him in 2007.\n\nIndeed \"Michael Hamburger\" is possibly Ms Dean's finest film currently on show in London, beautifully and simply shot in the poet's home on a windy day, as the sun comes and goes through his bay window. It seems hard to argue with Ms Dean's unwavering commitment to old-fashioned film when the results, in terms of colour, light and shade, are this striking.",

                "body": "Since 2015 the World Health Organisation has released an annual list of up to 10 \"blueprint priority diseases\" requiring immediate attention based on their epidemic potential or lack of sufficient countermeasures. The list has consistently contained now-well-known deadly viruses such as Ebola, Zika and SARS, as well as less-known diseases such as Lassa fever and Marburg virus disease. The difference this year is that included among the regulars is something called Disease X. What exactly is this mysterious disease and why has it been included?\n\nThe WHO's selection, known as the 2018 R&D Blueprint, was started as a response to the Ebola crisis in 2014, which has since infected nearly 29,000 people and killed more than 11,000. The list serves as a warning to governments that research and development needs to be an integral part of the response to epidemics. No one was ready for Ebola when it hit West Africa at that time. By listing Disease X, an undetermined disease, the WHO is acknowledging that outbreaks do not always come from an identified source and that, as it admits, \"a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease.\" Experts now recognise that moving fast to find a vaccine involves creating so-called \"platform technologies\" in advance. These involve scientists developing recipes for vaccines that can be customised. When an outbreak happens, scientists can sequence the unique genetics of the particular virus and enter the correct sequence into the platform to create a new vaccine. In the case of Ebola, this meant an effective vaccine could be developed and tested in 12 months rather than the usual 5-10 years.\n\nDisease X could strike at any time. It could be a mutation of an already known disease, such as influenza. The infamous Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, one of the deadliest in history, infected half a billion people and killed more than 20m. Or it could be a yet undiscovered disease transmitted to humans from animals, such as HIV, which spread from chimpanzees and has infected 70m people and killed more than 35m since 1983. Disease X could also be deliberately developed and spread by humans. Biological warfare is nothing new. In 1346 the Mongols catapulted the corpses of people who died of bubonic plague into the Crimean town of Caffa which they were besieging. In modern times 16 countries including the United States, have had or are suspected of having biological weapons programs.\n\nDespite the existence of the 1972 biological weapons convention, North Korea is not only believed to be in possession of 13 agents, including anthrax, smallpox and the plague, but also capable of weaponising them. In 2014 a captured Islamic State computer was found to contain instructions on how to use plague, gleaned from infected animals, as a weapon of mass destruction. The recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in the English city of Salisbury reiterated the fact that biological weapons such as nerve agents are not all safely under governmental lock and key, and revealed there has been woeful underinvestment in chemical and biological warfare defence-preparedness. In 2002 America's then Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, was derided for his talk of \"known unknowns\". Today, one of them is called Disease X, and no one is laughing about it.",

                "title": "H.R. McMaster out, John Bolton in",
                "body": "IN PROFESSIONAL wrestling, a fake form of combat mistaken for the real thing by some fans, a \"carpenter\" is a skilled wrestler of middling fame, whose job is to make rising stars look strong and intimidating.\n\nRemember that jargon -- and President Donald Trump's long-standing love of professional wrestling -- when trying to understand the seemingly bizarre appointment of John Bolton as the third national security adviser of the Trump administration, replacing Lieutenant-General H.R. McMaster, a hard-charging army officer and intellectual who rubbed his president up the wrong way.\n\nJudged as an act of high statecraft, the appointment is one to furrow brows in capitals worldwide. Mr Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations under George W Bush, is a ferocious war hawk who is one of the few men in public life still willing to defend the Iraq invasion of 2003. He is an implacable critic of President Vladimir Putin and gleeful fan of the NATO military alliance. In an op-ed for The Hill in February Mr Bolton called for a \"decidedly disproportionate\" cyber campaign on Russia, right here and right now, in retaliation for what is already known about Russian subversion and attacks on the 2016 presidential elections. He further urged the White House to get Mr Putin's attention by letting Russia's president \"hear the rumble of artillery and NATO tank tracks conducting more joint field exercises with Ukraine's military.\" He urged similarly robust American muscle-flexing in the Middle East to push back against \"Russia's probes\" in that region, including what he scorned as Mr Putin's propping up of Bashar Assad's dictatorship in Syria.\n\nMr Bolton believes to his bones that Mr Putin is a liar and that Russia cannot be trusted, any more than China can, or Iran or North Korea or a long list of foes who he believes need to take seriously the possibility that America might reduce their cities to dust. Contemplating the recent rapprochement between North and South Korea during the Winter Olympics, Mr Bolton cleared his throat, cracked his knuckles and cranked out a treatise in the Wall Street Journal entitled \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First,\" making an argument for a preventive strike on the Stalinist north, before it perfects missiles that can hit American cities.\n\nIn contrast, Mr Trump is a blustering showman who would always rather cut a deal than fight a war, and who calls the invasion of Iraq \"the single worst decision ever made,\" akin to \"throwing a big fat brick into a hornet's nest.\" Mr Trump has repeatedly grumbled about the costs of NATO and suggested that America's defensive alliances with its members are conditional on their paying more for their own defence.\n\nMr Trump is the man who, though he talks of raining down fire and fury on North Korea, also impulsively accepted an apparent suggestion to meet the North's leader Kim Jong un, as soon as April. This week Mr Trump not only congratulated Mr Putin on his re-election as president, reportedly against the pleading of his own advisers, but during that call failed to rebuke the Russian leader for election-meddling. America's president also declined to raise Russia's alleged use of a deadly nerve agent in a British country town to try to murder a former KGB spy -- an act of Trumpian reticence that horrified the British government.\n\nIn a pair of defensive tweets on March 21st, Mr Trump declared: \"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing. They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didn't have the \"smarts.\" Obama and Clinton tried, but didn't have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!\"\n\nHow could the man who tweeted out those words hire Mr Bolton? Part of the answer lies in Mr Trump's love for spangly-costumed wrestlers, with their staged fights and feuds. Mr Bolton is being hired as a carpenter. His unfeigned hawkishness is to be deployed to make Mr Trump, the rising star, look strong and intimidating.\n\nPart of the answer is that Mr Bolton is also an ambitious conservative partisan, who badly wanted this job. In that February article in The Hill, he twisted himself into knots to hail the special counsel, Robert Mueller, for \"powerfully\" making the case in an indictment against 13 Russians and three Russian internet outfits used online saboteurs to sow discord among voters in the election of 2016. Yet he then somehow managed to find that \"the safest conclusion based on currently available public information is that Russia did not intend to advantage or disadvantage any particular candidate.\" This despite the evidence laid out in Mr Mueller's indictment, quoting Russian bosses ordering Russian saboteurs to work harder to help Mr Trump and harm his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. This despite Mr Mueller's uncovering of emails from Russians hiring unwitting American conservatives to dress up as Mrs Clinton in a prison jumpsuit and ride to a political rally in a mock prison-cell.\n\nTo those two cynical explanations for Mr Bolton's hiring, a more heartfelt one can be added. And it is this last explanation that frightens America's allies the most. For all their obvious differences, Mr Trump and Mr Bolton do agree on one big thing about the world: that it is nasty, dangerous and full of foreign foes ready to jump on any sign of American weakness. Mr Bolton may be more respectful of post-war alliances than Mr Trump, who thinks that magnanimity is for losers. But the two men are as one in thinking that Barack Obama was a chump and a knave when he extended a wary hand of friendship to America's foes -- notably when he agreed to lift sanctions on Iran in exchange for a freeze on Iranian nuclear activities. Given the choice, both Mr Trump and his new national security adviser would rather be feared than loved.\n\nThat could have consequences very soon. Under American law Mr Trump must endorse the Iran nuclear freeze brokered by Mr Obama and other world powers, or walk away from it. The next deadline falls in May. Mr Trump calls it a \"terrible\" agreement that expires in several years' time and that fails to rein in Iranian missile programmes and broader mischief-making in the Middle East. Other signatories to the deal, led by Britain, France and Germany, have all warned America that Iran is in technical compliance with the nuclear freeze that lies at the heart of the agreement. Those allies could imagine side agreements opposing missile work and even declaring that the signatories do not intend allowing Iran to resume nuclear work. But they see no legal grounds for reneging on the pact or unilaterally declaring it indefinite.\n\nAlas for Western unity, Mr Trump just sacked his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who was a prominent advocate for preserving the Iran deal. The next secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is an Iran hawk. Mr Bolton is an Iran hawk. That leaves just James Mattis, the defence secretary and last sober voice of reason in the president's inner circle, to make the case that fixing the Iran deal is a better idea than blowing it up.\n\nTo that urgent crisis add one last worry: Mr Bolton's record as a much-feared, much-disliked manager when he was ambassador to the United Nations. For the job of heading the National Security Council is one of the most important in the American government. The national security adviser acts as an honest broker in disputes between such power centres as the Pentagon, State Department and CIA, as a trusted intermediary with foreign governments and as a filter, ensuring that only the most important decisions reach the president's desk, and that they arrive there accompanied by the highest-quality intelligence and analysis.\n\nMr Trump, of course, has shown that he does not care. He boasts of liking drama and conflict in his inner-circle, though he is less keen on being reined in, and actively hates it when aides correct him in any way that makes him feel slighted. He is the star. Chafing at mixed reviews for his foreign policy, he has hired a war hawk who will make him look tough. Hope that this is more showmanship, and that Mr Bolton's belligerent instincts will not have full rein. But anything is possible now.",

                "title": "Egypt's sham election features two candidates, but no choice",
                "body": "SINCE one in four Egyptian voters cannot read, political candidates pick symbols to identify themselves on the ballot. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the president, chose a star. It shines down from billboards across the country alongside his ubiquitous visage, smiling on a farm or peering through binoculars aboard a warship. His opponent in the coming election, Moussa Mustafa Moussa, chose an aeroplane. Walking past a poster of Mr Moussa, a man laughs at his choice: \"It's because he'll need to fly away if anyone votes for him.\"\n\nThere is little else to say about the election itself, which begins on March 26th and lasts three days. Mr Sisi will win. His opponent has lived up to a promise not to challenge the president. Across the whole of Cairo your correspondent has seen only four banners in support of Mr Moussa. The only question is whether the electorate will turn out in greater numbers than they did for the last presidential election, in 2014, when 47% voted. Mr Sisi's critics have called for a boycott.\n\nThis will be Egypt's ninth national ballot since the revolution that toppled Hosni Mubarak, a previous strongman, in 2011. It is also the most depressing. The first votes were fair, with raucous campaigns and a range of candidates. Egyptians handed the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group, the presidency and a plurality in parliament in 2012. But in mid-2013 Mr Sisi, then the defence minister, overthrew the Brothers in a coup that had popular support. Now Egypt is back to the days of strongmen like Gamal Abdel Nasser, when elections were for show. The pointless Mr Moussa was the only candidate allowed to run. Others were arrested or intimidated into dropping their bids.\n\nMr Sisi inherited a mess. Investors and tourists had fled after years of turmoil. The central bank spent more than half its foreign reserves propping up the Egyptian pound. The president deserves some credit for taking painful steps to stabilise the economy. He has cut fuel subsidies and introduced a value-added tax in order to trim the budget deficit. He also allowed a big devaluation of the currency in 2016. Foreign reserves are now above their pre-revolution levels. Annual inflation is down from its peak of above 30%. Tourists are trickling back, too: 8.3m visited Egypt last year, up from a low point of 5.4m in 2015.\n\nBut Mr Sisi took most of these steps as a last resort, to secure a much-needed loan from the IMF. His broader economic vision is muddled. Private-sector job growth is minimal, while the armed forces play an ever-larger role in the economy. The men in uniform have overseen the construction of nearly two dozen new highways. When mothers complained of baby-formula shortages in 2016, Mr Sisi put the army in charge of distributing it. Meanwhile, public debt has surged: Egypt owes $81bn to foreign creditors, up from $46bn when Mr Sisi took office. The state is pouring much of this into dubious mega-projects, such as a new capital city and an unnecessary expansion of the Suez Canal.\n\nIn February the central bank reduced its main interest rate by one percentage point, the first cut since the devaluation. But, at over 18%, it is still a big obstacle for businesses wanting to invest. High prices have caused many Egyptians to spend less. Meat has become an unaffordable luxury for the poor. The middle class has cut back on everything from groceries to education.\n\nAs discontent simmers on the mainland, Sinai boils over. The army has been tormented by a jihadist insurgency in the northern part of the peninsula. Egypt's allies in the West support it with a steady stream of arms, but many are ill-suited for the battle. The conflict, which has spilled into other areas and involves regular massacres of civilians, undermines Mr Sisi's claim to have stabilised Egypt.\n\nIn the last days of Mr Mubarak's rule, an oft-repeated joke was that God dispatched the angel of death to fetch the president, but he was caught and tortured by state security. Weeks later, when Azrael returned to heaven, God blanched: \"You didn't tell them I sent you, right?\" Still, Mr Mubarak allowed some political debate during his 30-year reign, if only as a safety valve.\n\nNo one jokes about Mr Sisi's repression. Tens of thousands of political prisoners languish in jail. Last year Mr Sisi signed a law that bars NGOs from working on human rights and restricts the funding even of apolitical charities. Journalists are arrested and harassed by the police. The death penalty, in effect suspended after the revolution, is back. Mr Sisi accelerated executions after an attack in November on a mosque in North Sinai that killed more than 300 people. Almost every week since, the state has led groups of mostly Islamist prisoners to the gallows on what activists call \"Hanging Tuesdays\".\n\nYet for all this, Mr Sisi's grip on power is not secure. Another revolution is unlikely, but he could face a challenge from within, by military and business elites unhappy with his policies. Sami Anan, a former army chief, briefly tried to run for president. He accused Mr Sisi of undermining civilian government and placing too big a burden on the army. Though he was arrested within days, his attempt was a sign of internal dissent.\n\nThis should, anyway, be Mr Sisi's last election, since the constitution allows only two four-year terms. Some MPs have offered to amend it. But even many ardent supporters think Mr Sisi should step aside after his second term and make way for a successor. As the chairman of a private bank puts it: \"Even if you love mango, you cannot eat mango all day long.\"",

                "title": "Why Uber in Istanbul is costlier than a cab",
                "body": "COMPETITION between Uber and the taxi industry tends to be fierce everywhere. In Turkey it has turned violent. Over the past month, some Uber drivers in Istanbul, the only Turkish city where the ride-sharing firm operates regularly, have been beaten, and on at least one occasion shot at, by disgruntled cabbies. A union of taxi drivers has taken Uber to court, asking the authorities to block access to its app. (The country has already banned Wikipedia and Booking.com, an online travel agent, as well as thousands of other web pages.) The union's boss recently accused Uber of being part of a \"thieving Jewish lobby\".\n\nMost of Istanbul's cabbies are perfectly nice people who resort neither to violence nor to anti-Semitism when faced with new market entrants or afternoon traffic. But too many are swindlers, chain-smokers and speed addicts. On a recent trip across town, your correspondent spent 15 hair-raising minutes trying to calm an elderly driver who regularly succumbed to a series of twitches, popped out of his seat and punched his dashboard when overtaking other cars, and impersonated a cannibal at the mention of an African country. He slowed down only after being steered into a chat about his grandchildren.\n\nThis partially explains Uber's local appeal. In most places, the company lures passengers mainly by offering low prices. In Istanbul it gets away with charging more than a normal taxi, as much as double for a trip to the airport, by offering cleaner cars and better service.\n\nUber enjoys a powerful advantage in Istanbul, since its drivers do not have to acquire extortionately expensive cab licences. Since the 1960s, as the city's population has swollen from 2m to 15m, the number of such licences has remained capped at about 18,000. Predictably, their price has rocketed, reaching nearly 1.7m Turkish lira ($430,000) today, more than twice the cost in New York or Paris. Since few cabbies have access to that kind of money, outsiders have stepped in.\n\nSuch investors now fear that competition from Uber will drive the licence price down, as it has in other parts of the world, wrecking their investment. But the market may just be big enough for both sides. Some passengers will pay a premium for comfort. Others will pay less, and risk an adventure.",

                "title": "Why controlling chemical weapons is so hard",
                "body": "IN THE sort of movie where global agencies are attacked by arch-villains with superpowers, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) would make a perfect target. Its concrete and glass headquarters sits amid a cluster of high-minded international institutions in The Hague, down the street from the tribunal where Yugoslavia's war criminals were tried and not far from the International Court of Justice. The OPCW has been busy over the past decade, destroying chemical-weapons stockpiles in Libya, Iraq and Syria, for which it won the Nobel peace prize in 2013. But the use of a nerve agent in the attempted assassination of a Russian ex-spy in Britain this month has dragged it into tricky waters.\n\nThe mission of the OPCW is to support the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, which bars countries from possessing them. (Using them has been illegal since The Hague Conventions of 1899, signed just across town -- though that did not stop Germany and Britain from gassing each other's troops during the first world war.) But the OPCW is not an independent enforcement agency. In theory, a country that has ratified the convention can demand an inspection on another signatory's territory if it suspects it of stockpiling weapons, but this has never happened. Instead, the OPCW is called in only when a country agrees to eliminate its stockpiles.\n\nThe OPCW's biggest effort to date came in Syria. In 2013, after a series of chemical-weapons attacks by the regime, Russia persuaded its ally to join the convention and eliminate its stockpiles in order to fend off America's threat to attack. The OPCW set up a process in which weapons were transported under Russian and Chinese supervision to Norwegian and Danish ships and destroyed on board an American naval vessel. But, says Derek Chollet, an American assistant secretary of defence at the time, the agency \"has no independent coercive power. It is only as powerful as countries allow it to be.\"\n\nThat became clear in 2015, when chemical attacks in Syria resumed months after the OPCW confirmed that all the weapons the country admitted to possessing had been eliminated. The UN Security Council approved joint investigations that let OPCW inspectors return to Syria to find out who was at fault. But Russia disputed the inspectors' conclusion that it was the Syrian government. When the investigations came up for renewal last November, Russia vetoed them. OPCW experts still carry out fact-finding missions in Syria after chemical attacks, but are not allowed to investigate who is to blame.\n\nThis week the OPCW sent experts at Britain's request, to provide independent confirmation of the agent used. The British say it was the Russian nerve poison Novichok. Russia's furious denials resemble its attacks on investigators' conclusions in Syria, where it threw up a barrage of unconvincing challenges with little evidence.\n\nRussia cannot block OPCW technical aid. For that it would need the support of two-thirds of the 41 countries on the organisation's executive council. But while the agency's experts may help determine what chemicals were used in the attack, they will not be able to lend their authority to any conclusion on the most important question: who did it?",

                "body": "WHEN the Berlin Wall fell, Europe began repairing its sundered east-west transport networks. A revived Paris-Moscow train heralded the new era. Berlin's cathedral-like main station, opened in 2006, became the continent's new hub. But old north-south bottlenecks are back in the spotlight. Of the nine \"Core Network Corridors\" currently earmarked for EU investment, six are more vertical than horizontal. The centrepiece of this strategy is the \"Scandinavian-Mediterranean corridor\" from Sweden and Finland, through Denmark, Germany, Austria and Italy to Malta in the south. This programme -- jointly funded by the EU and member states -- includes railway electrification, port modernisation and the two largest engineering projects on the continent.\n\nThe greatest progress has been at the route's northern end. The Oresund link, a 16km road-and-rail, bridge-and-tunnel link from Malmo to Copenhagen that opened in 2000, has knitted the two cities into one region. The next step is to link them to Hamburg with a tunnel bearing two train tracks and a four-lane highway under the Fehmarn Strait (\"Fehmarnbelt\" in German), explains Lars Friis Cornett, deputy director of the forthcoming Fehmarnbelt project, soon to be the biggest construction site on the continent. This would create a new regional economy dubbed \"STRING\".\n\nWhy is it necessary? With their tightly interlinked shipping lanes and industrial supply chains, Copenhagen and Hamburg are already one economy in many senses. But getting between them is a hassle. The land route -- taken by hundreds of lorries a day -- is a six-hour drive. There is a sea link, but this too is tortuous. After the short run from Copenhagen to the southern Danish coast, the train slows as it enters the port of Rodby. On special rails it enters a ferry alongside the cars and trucks. Passengers disembark and hurry to the on-board shop (alcohol and cigarettes can be sold only in German waters, which account for just 17 minutes of the trip). After an hour the ferry docks at Puttgarden and passengers return to the train, which pulls out onto German tracks and speeds on to Hamburg. The whole journey between the two cities takes four hours, 33 minutes.\n\nThe Fehmarnbelt project was agreed on by German and Danish governments in 2007, and endorsed by Danish planning authorities in 2015. Now it just remains for German planners to give it the green light by 2020, when construction is to start. Despite protests, the planners are confident that they will have clearance by next year. Funded by the Danish government, which will recoup its money from toll charges, construction will involve sinking large sections of tunnel units into the seabed; the \"Lego principle\", Mr Cornett calls it. When completed in 2028, this will be the longest immersed tunnel in the world. With associated road and rail improvements it will cut the Hamburg-Copenhagen train ride to two hours, 40 minutes. Builders expect road traffic across the strait in 2030 to be more than double what it was in 2011.\n\nFrom Hamburg the immediate journey south is smooth on Germany's autobahns and high-speed train tracks. The southward rail fork via Berlin was accelerated by a recent upgrade of lines through Saxony and northern Bavaria. On December 8th Angela Merkel joined other dignitaries for a train ride of less than four hours from the German capital to Munich, down from more than six hours.\n\nThen, though, the journey slows drastically. From Innsbruck in Austria the train creeps up to the Brenner Pass, through which 40% of all trans-Alpine traffic travels along a narrow, steep shelf that winds along the side of a valley. The train goes so slowly that passengers can observe Alpine flowers peeping through the snow. Not until two hours after leaving Innsbruck, at Fortezza in Italy, does it speed up downhill, snow giving way to vineyards and the plains of the Po valley. The roads are no better: 1m lorries a year travel through the pass and long tailbacks are common.\n\nHence the impending Brenner Base Tunnel, 40% funded by the EU and the rest by the Austrian and Italian governments, which at 64km from Innsbruck to Fortezza will be the longest in the world when it opens in 2026. It could transform intra-European trade by increasing the daily number of trains through the pass from 240 per day to 591, mostly carrying goods.\n\nFrom Fortezza the speed picks up thanks to the Italian rail network. Since 2009 sleek Frecciarossa and Frecciargento (red and silver arrow) trains have cut Milan-Naples travel times from eight hours to just over four. But from Naples the investment stops. There is a slow, twice-a-day service to Sicily with a ferry from Salerno, and one a day from Villa San Giovanni. The contrast with Europe's north is stark: the Strait of Messina is half as wide as the Oresund crossing, but a bridge to Sicily has been a glint in politicians' eyes for decades. The island remains too poor for it to be economical to build such a link and run high-speed trains to Palermo, its capital.\n\nThat is a reminder to European politicians, who are fretting about the revival of the east-west divide. That rift is about politics, a product of historical happenstance. It is soluble. But the continent's north-south rift is in many ways deeper: it involves intransigent barriers like high mountains and foaming seas, as well as deep cultural and economic differences. In its own way, the Malmo-Palermo express would be as great a political achievement as its Paris-Moscow counterpart.",

                "title": "Catholics are keeping a low profile in Ireland's abortion referendum campaign",
                "body": "WHEN Ireland first voted on abortion, back in 1983, there was no doubt as to who was behind the push for a full constitutional ban. The Pro Life Amendment Campaign, which persuaded 67% of voters to approve the 8th Amendment to Ireland's constitution, was a coalition of Roman Catholic organisations supported by the pope and his bishops. Rosaries and crosses were proudly borne to its marches and rallies.\n\nNow, 35 years later, as Ireland prepares to vote, in May or June, on a proposed repeal of the amendment, overt Catholicism has all but vanished from the scene. Although the religious affiliations of many activists are, of course, known, contemporary pro-life groups like the Iona Institute, the Pro Life Campaign, the Life Institute, and Save the 8th present themselves as non- or multi-denominational, or simply leave such matters vague.\n\nWith good reason. Since 1983 a long series of scandals has battered the church's moral authority. These include the sexual abuse of children by clerics; the confinement of marginalised women in industrial-scale \"Magdalene Laundries\" (institutions for what were termed \"fallen women\"); and forced adoptions and undocumented mass burials at \"mother and baby\" homes.\n\nIn the years since then, conservative Catholics have unsuccessfully opposed the legalisation of contraception, divorce and most recently gay marriage, and came out on the losing side in four referendums that they hoped would further strengthen the ban on abortion, for instance by banning travel abroad for one. Patsy McGarry, a veteran religious-affairs correspondent for the Irish Times, says the church and its followers are still heavily involved in the new abortion campaign, but are deliberately downplaying religious arguments. \"They are trying to appeal to a younger generation that are not so impressed by traditional Irish Catholic values,\" he said.\n\nBut new global forces and methods are moving into the space vacated by traditional Catholicism. This week Save the 8th confirmed that it has hired Kanto Systems, a London-based political consultancy with links to the campaign for Britain to leave the EU, the embattled Cambridge Analytica (a British firm at the heart of a Facebook data row) and Donald Trump's election. In January it was reported that the Pro Life Campaign had hired uCampaign, a conservative American outfit that has produced apps for Mr Trump, the National Rifle Association and Vote Leave in Britain.\n\nOn the pro-choice side, the Abortion Rights Campaign has been forced to return a $25,000 grant from George Soros's Open Society Foundations, after a regulator deemed it an illegal foreign political donation. Amnesty International Ireland, also campaigning for repeal, faces the same problem in relation to its own donation. Pro-life campaigners are also believed to have raised funds abroad, mainly in America, but have yet to face any such sanction.\n\nThe Transparent Referendum Initiative, a group of tech activists, says that the paid Facebook posts which were a feature of the Brexit and Trump campaigns have now begun to show up in the Irish referendum. Storyful, a Dublin-based consultancy that authenticates online content, says there has been a recent upsurge in suspicious new Twitter accounts that talk about abortion in Ireland. All, so far, oppose abortion, said Storyful's Padraic Ryan. Some of these are linked to overseas accounts pushing far-right, anti-liberal and pro-Trump messages. Others note the appearance of \"fake news\" -- demonstrably untrue claims that the anti-abortionists refuse to repudiate. More such cyber-shenanigans are surely to be expected.",

                "title": "Israel is cultivating new friends in the Balkans, but quietly",
                "body": "ALTHOUGH it was in use from 1497 to 1943, the Jewish cemetery in Bitola, Macedonia's second city, had long been forgotten. No longer. Not only is the site now being restored and a new memorial built, but on March 11th a couple of thousand people, including Macedonian and Israeli ministers, marched through town to pay homage to the Macedonian Jews who were rounded up exactly 75 years earlier and sent to the death camp at Treblinka. At the same time Israeli developers held a \"hackathon\", dreaming up ideas for digital memorials with Macedonian fellow geeks. It is typical of the way Israelis are quietly discovering the western Balkans.\n\nBitola's Jewish cemetery is on a steep hill, and over time its flat tombs became covered by soil. In the past few years 4,300 have been excavated; there could be as many as 10,000. Jews remember Bitola by its Ottoman name of Monastir, but most people in Bitola have forgotten that their down-at-heel town was once a thriving and prosperous place for Jews, Christians and Muslims. \"I am trying to use our past,\" says Maria Geras Dochovska, co-ordinator of the cemetery project. Bitola has been \"dying for 100 years\". If what she is doing brings interest and investment to the town, she says, \"then maybe our young will have a chance to be connected to the world.\" And perhaps they will stay, rather than emigrate as so many Macedonians are doing. She may be right. Winners of the hackathon will visit Israel and meet people from its thriving tech sector.\n\nIn the past decade, whatever most outsiders -- the Turks say, or the Russians -- do in the region has been accompanied by media fanfare and raucous debate about what they are really up to. Israel's interest, apart from cultivating friendly countries, is more low-key. The Bitola event went unnoticed in the outside world. Even so, according to the Israeli embassy in Belgrade, Israelis have invested or committed almost €1.8bn in Serbia since 2000. Their political consultants are often hired to advise the region's parties during elections.\n\nIn Macedonia an Israeli company now trains military helicopter pilots. This year Israel hopes to clinch a deal to sell F-16 fighter jets to Croatia. In 2016 intelligence co-operation thwarted an attack on an Israel-Albania football match. Balkan countries almost certainly receive Israeli intelligence on their jihadists returning from Syria. The number of Israelis coming to the region, mostly for long weekends in Belgrade, was up by 171% last year compared with 2016, in part because they no longer feel comfortable in Turkey.\n\nThe leaders of Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Albania have all been on official visits to Israel. Kosovo's leaders have been lobbying Israel to recognise it. According to Eliezer Papo of Ben Gurion University, academic co-operation, which used to be \"non-existent\" has exploded. Politically, he says, many western Balkan leaders think Israel is a place to emulate. They consider their countries to be like Israel: surrounded by enemies, but determined to prosper anyway. They mostly pay lip service to the Palestinian cause, but often forget it. Israel and (mostly Muslim) Albania are \"natural allies\" in the fight against violent extremism, said Edi Rama, Albania's prime minister, on March 4th. From cyber-security to water technology, says Mr Papo, \"everyone thinks that there is a lot to gain.\" But no one wants to make a big fuss about it.",

                "title": "Greece is set to leave its bail-out programme. Its troubles aren't over",
                "body": "ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greece's left-wing prime minister, is getting along better these days with his country's big creditors, the EU and the International Monetary Fund. One reason is that Athens is likely to complete its current bail-out programme in August, on time and with funds to spare. Another is that the economy is growing, albeit more slowly than forecast.\n\nBut Mr Tsipras is under growing pressure at home. His Syriza party's unlikely coalition with Independent Greeks (Anel), a small populist party led by Panos Kammenos, a blustering right-winger, is in danger of falling apart. Mr Kammenos, the defence minister, opposes Mr Tsipras's efforts to resolve a 25-year dispute over what Greece's poor northern neighbour, officially known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, should henceforth be called. Mr Kammenos has also broken ranks with Syriza over how to handle Greece's latest flare-up with its historical rival, Turkey, a NATO ally with a policy of contesting Greek sovereignty over a clutch of small Aegean islands.\n\nMr Tsipras may have hoped that some attention could be diverted from these problems. Syriza has launched a parliamentary probe of ten senior politicians, including two ex-prime ministers, Antonis Samaras and Panagiotis Pikrammenos, the current central bank governor and Greece's EU commissioner. The politicians are accused of accepting a total of €50m in bribes from Novartis, a Swiss drugs firm, between 2010 and 2015.\n\nBut the scandal has failed to gain traction, after outraged denials by the accused and talk of government influence over the judicial process. The allegations of bribe-taking, according to opposition members of an all-party committee, may even have been faked. They are based on testimony to the anti-corruption prosecutor by three anonymous whistleblowers placed in a witness-protection scheme. \"The transcripts [of the whistleblowers' testimony] are not exact. The three apparently didn't witness any bribe-taking themselves,\" said a committee member.\n\nMr Tsipras's talk of economic success is also starting to look threadbare. The economy grew last year by only 1.4%, compared with a budget forecast of 2.5%. This year's growth target has already been cut to around 2%.\n\nThe prime minister's hopes of a clean exit from the bail-out in August look unrealistic, too. Greece is already committed to lowering the income-tax threshold and making another round of pension cuts in 2019. A deal with the EU on debt-relief measures, due to be wrapped up in June, will include a slew of conditions to keep reforms on track and prevent backsliding.\n\nSome pundits predict that Mr Tsipras will cut his losses and call an election in October, almost a year before his government's term expires. The centre-right New Democracy has a lead of ten percentage points in opinion polls. Whether ND can win an overall majority depends on how many voters smaller parties can woo away from Syriza. Meanwhile, Mr Tsipras's advisers insist their boss is \"not a quitter\" and that there is still plenty of time to win back disaffected left-wing voters.",

                "title": "Donald Trump launches attack on Chinese trade",
                "body": "Now for the real fight. After unveiling tariffs on steel and aluminium which barely grazed China earlier this month, President Donald Trump took direct aim at Beijing on March 22nd. His move to hit China for its trade practices is designed to land three jabs. The first will take the form of tariffs of 25% on up to $60bn of Chinese exports to America. This, Mr Trump argues, is only a fraction of the economic damage China has done to America by stealing or forcibly extracting its companies' intellectual property. The second blow will come in the form of investment restrictions on Chinese companies, to stop the Chinese from hoovering up American ideas and gaining a strategic advantage. The third will involve litigation at the World Trade Organisation.\n\nChina has broken the rules, the president thinks, and needs to be held to account. Plenty agree on that. China has not lived up to the expectations many had of it when it joined the World Trade Organisation back in 2001 (see briefing). Its challenge to American technological supremacy is real enough (see briefing). The metal tariffs have been handled chaotically and were controversial even within the administration; the desire to curb China's bad behaviour commands much more consensus.\n\nThat does not make the Trump administration's strategy on tariffs a good one. Mr Trump thinks that America's position in a trade battle is stronger than that of the Chinese, because they send more stuff to America than goes the other way. But imports benefit Americans too. Slapping tariffs on over 10% of Chinese goods exports to America will hit shoppers. Even outfits who are hawkish on China, such as the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech-industry-funded think-tank, are critical of the idea of imposing tariffs on ICT products from China. It warns that this would hurt American productivity growth and benefit China's competitors rather than bringing any jobs back to America.\n\nWhat would make matters much worse is Chinese retaliation. On the day of Mr Trump's announcement, Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to America said \"if people want to play tough, we wil play tough with them.\" American agriculture exporters look especially vulnerable. Paul Burke, regional director of the US Soybean Export Council in North Asia, has heard talk of the Chinese commerce ministry meeting soybean consumers to ask how they would cope if access to American soybeans were to be curtailed. On March 20th the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper, published an editorial clamouring for tariffs, arguing that subsidised American soybeans were \"an important reason for the world's soybean oversupply\". Mr Burke thinks that soybeans are an example of how trade with China is working. Now it looks like the exporters he represents will be caught up in the fray.\n\nSuch is the self-destructive logic of trade wars. Mr Trump claims to be trying to avoid a scenario of punch and counterpunch. As he signed the punitive measures, he boasted that he was knee-deep in negotiations with the government in Beijing to lower America's trade deficit with China by $100bn, from $375bn (in goods) in 2017. Set aside the question of whether Mr Trump's dislike of deficits makes sense (it doesn't). His latest action is unlikely to help those talks. The Trump administration has signalled that it would defend the interests of American farmers if the Chinese were to treat them unfairly. One blow always tends to lead to another.",

                "title": "What works to reduce gun deaths",
                "body": "THE young people who will march to protest against gun killings in Washington, DC and other cities on March 24th would appear to be wasting their time. Since December 2012, when Adam Lanza murdered 20 children and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School, America has experienced some 240 shootings that injured or killed people on school or college campuses. From 2012 to 2016 fully 108,100 people used guns to take their own lives and 63,600 were shot dead by others. Yet the House of Representatives has not voted on a single measure to prevent gun violence, let alone passed a law. In some states the law has loosened. Students at public colleges in Texas can now carry concealed handguns.\n\nThe marchers should not succumb to gloom. Congress will probably not pass sensible gun laws, it is true. But some state assemblies and city governments have already done so. These laws seem to be saving lives; if adopted in other states, the toll of guns would almost certainly diminish. They fall into three categories.\n\nThe first group of laws increase scrutiny of gun buyers. Federal law requires background checks for anyone purchasing a firearm through a licensed dealer, but says nothing about private sales or transactions at gun shows. Many buyers slip through this loophole. A survey of 1,613 gun-owners published in 2017 found that 42% had acquired their most recent weapon without a background check. The internet has made sales even harder to police. A probe by private investigators hired by New York city in 2011 found that 62% of online private sellers agreed to sell guns to people who stated they \"probably could not pass a background check\".\n\nNineteen states and Washington, DC, now require background checks for at least some private gun sales. Most people seem to comply. In states that regulate private sales, 26% of gun-owners who bought their guns privately said they did so without a background check, compared with 57% in states without such regulations.\n\nThe Giffords Law Centre to Prevent Gun Violence, a pressure group co-founded by Gabrielle Giffords, a former congresswoman who was shot in the head in 2011, found that between 2009 and 2012 states with universal background-check requirements on handguns had 35% fewer gun deaths per person than states with looser regulations. Other research shows that in states that require background checks for private handgun sales women are less likely to be shot by their partners, police are less likely to be killed by handguns, and gun suicides are rarer than in states with laxer laws.\n\nDaniel Webster, director of the Centre for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, believes that requiring gun-buyers to apply for permits or licences might be even more effective. Twelve states and Washington, DC have such laws, several of which require would-be handgun-buyers to pass safety training. Some require people to turn up at their local sheriff's office or police department. This may deter so-called \"straw purchases\", in which someone stands in for a debarred buyer.\n\nIn a study published in 2014, Mr Webster and others scrutinised what happened after Missouri scrapped its permit-to-purchase law, which required all handgun purchasers to obtain a licence confirming they had passed a background check. Controlling for changes in poverty, unemployment, crime, incarceration, policing levels and other factors, they found that the repeal was associated with a 23% increase in gun homicide rates. A study conducted by Mr Webster's colleagues in 2015 found that 75% of Americans (and nearly 60% of gun-owners) support licensing laws. Almost everyone wants broad background checks.\n\nThe second thing states have done is to create \"red-flag\" laws. The need for these has become clearer since February 14th, when Nikolas Cruz allegedly killed 17 people in his former high school in Florida. (Mr Cruz is not speaking; a judge has entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf.) In the decade before that horror, the Broward County sheriff's office received at least 45 calls related to Mr Cruz or his brother. Mr Cruz uploaded photos of weapons and dead animals on social media, and seems to have written \"I am going to be a professional school shooter\" under a YouTube video.\n\nToday six states -- California, Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, Indiana and, as of March 9th, Florida -- have \"extreme-risk protection order\" laws. These allow cops to petition courts to remove guns temporarily from those thought to pose a risk to themselves or others. In the first three states, family members can petition, too. Judges can order guns to be impounded for a limited time and, in some states, can bar people from buying new ones. An order can be extended for a year if the judge is given additional evidence that the person continues to be a threat.\n\nConnecticut's law, which was enacted in 1999, seems to have saved lives. One study published in 2017 estimated that for every 10 to 20 gun seizures in the state between 1999 and 2013, one suicide was averted. On average, the police removed seven guns from each person. Earlier this year American State Legislators for Gun Violence Prevention, a coalition of lawmakers worried about gun violence, announced that members in 30 states had introduced or were planning to introduce extreme-risk protection order bills. Even before the Parkland shooting, at least 19 legislatures were considering such bills.\n\nThird, some states have tightened rules on gun storage. Whereas Israelis whose weapons are stolen can be prosecuted, most Americans have little to fear. A survey by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has found that 54% of American gun-owners did not store their firearms safely.\n\nThis invites trouble. David Hemenway at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has estimated that 380,000 guns a year are stolen from gun-owners. Data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shows that licensed dealers lost 18,394 weapons in 2016. Stolen guns often find their way to dangerous criminals. Even if they are not stolen, unsecured guns are dangerous. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, a government agency, has reported that about 20,000 people under 18 were killed or seriously hurt in accidental shootings between 2004 and 2015. News reports suggest that children under four shoot about one person a week -- often themselves.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins researchers classified secure storage as locked in a gun safe, cabinet or case, locked into a gun rack, or stored with a trigger lock or other device on the gun itself. Some states, including California, Connecticut and New York, require guns to be securely stowed if they are anywhere near people who are barred from possessing them. Massachusetts is stricter. If a firearm is not kept \"secured in a locked container or equipped with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock or other safety device\" the owner could face fines up to $20,000 and up to 15 years of imprisonment. The law seems successful at keeping guns out of the hands of minors. Only 9% of suicides among young people in Massachusetts involve a gun, compared with 39% nationally. The state's youth suicide death rate is 35% below the national average.\n\nSoon after a mass shooting in Las Vegas last October, a poll found that 77% of those asked supported a requirement that all gun-owners should store their guns safely. Such a law would not have prevented that particular atrocity, nor will the other measures mentioned above avert every future suicide, homicide or mass shooting. That is a poor justification for doing nothing.",

                "title": "Why Stormy Daniels is so dangerous",
                "body": "THE humourist P. J. O'Rourke once made these distinctions. \"There is parody, when you make fun of people who are smarter than you; satire, when you make fun of people who are richer than you; and burlesque, when you make fun of both while taking your clothes off.\" Stormy Daniels's \"Make America Horny Again\" tour, which the porn star recently took to strip clubs in Texas and Florida, arguably constitutes a rare triple-whammy. And if power can be substituted for smarts, which Stephanie Clifford, as Ms Daniels is properly known, appears to have in abundance, the case is indisputable. Not since a Mikhail Gorbachev impersonator enticed a fawning Donald Trump onto 5th Avenue has anyone made such a monkey of the president.\n\nMuch has been made of a moment in West Palm Beach last month when Mr Trump's motorcade, en route between Mar-a-Lago and a golf club, roared past a strip joint advertising Ms Clifford's tour in neon lights. But irony did not die that night, as some have suggested. It is thriving at Ms Clifford's shows, which sound a lot like a Trump rally. Both feature stirring, slightly eccentric, entrance music; \"Li'l Red Riding Hood\" for Ms Clifford, who appears wearing a red cape; \"Nessun Dorma\" for Mr Trump, who wears a red tie. Both performers are over-the-top assertive and racing against time. (Fear of death is an under-considered explanation for Mr Trump's belligerent insecurity, and the 39-year-old Ms Clifford is now the oldest stripper in the club.) Both offer their fans a sugar rush of instant gratification. Mr Trump invites his to shout, \"Lock her up!\" Ms Clifford pours molten wax on herself.\n\nMr Trump's titillating, debasing speeches are the apogee of what a conservative columnist once described as the \"pornificaton of politics\". Ms Clifford, in her shows, but even more in her offstage comportment since news broke in January of a scandal linking her to the president, is in a sense the inverse. Immune to his bullying, she has emerged as a powerful emblem of Mr Trump's vulnerabilities. Benjamin Wittes, editor of the influential Lawfare blog, hails her as \"the icon of our time\".\n\nThere are three big reasons for Ms Clifford's effectiveness as a Trump-mocker. The first is that the star of \"Big Busted Goddesses of Las Vegas\" appears, through no plan of hers, to have put the president in serious jeopardy. That is not because of her alleged months-long affair with him, which took place long ago and reveals nothing new about Mr Trump. Rather, in the usual way of political sex scandals, it is because of the blundering way he, or his retainers, tried to cover it up. Two weeks before Mr Trump's election his lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid Ms Clifford $130,000 in return for an agreement not to speak of the alleged affair, which the president denies. When this was revealed, Mr Cohen claimed, almost incredibly, that he had taken the step on his own initiative, using his money. Ms Clifford then sued to be released from the non-disclosure agreement, claiming Mr Cohen had broken its terms by talking about it and the president had done so by failing to sign it. She has recorded an interview with CBS's show \"60 Minutes\", which is expected to air on March 25th.\n\nThis appears to have put Mr Trump in a bind. He can let Mr Cohen try to enforce the agreement with Ms Daniels, which might look like an admission of guilt and would risk her aggressive lawyer, Michael Avenatti, airing further revelations in court. Or he can let the matter lie. But that would signal to any other woman bound by a non-disclosure agreement with the president -- and Mr Avenatti claims to know of two -- that it can be safely ignored.\n\nThat would in turn risk highlighting Mr Trump's broader problem with women, including the 18 who have accused him of molesting them. Indeed, the striking degree to which Ms Clifford's case contains echoes of Mr Trump's wider legal troubles is another reason she is proving such a thorn in his flank. A hint that she might have certain mementoes of Mr Trump is also illustrative of this. It recalls speculation that Mr Trump's history of sexual indiscretion could leave him open to Russian blackmail, as was alleged by Christopher Steele, a former British spy. So too, the way Mr Trump seems to have used Mr Cohen as a blunt instrument, while keeping him at arm's length for plausible deniability, is a familiar pattern. This was evident last year in the president's cackhanded attempt to sack Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating him, through two stages of intermediary.\n\nYet the main reason Ms Clifford is running rings around the commander-in-chief reflects what a nightmarish matchup for him she is personally. The president's recipe for political success is to appear more down-to-earth than his effete critics in the media, and so robustly transactional that his political rivals appear hypocritical by comparison. Yet Ms Clifford is no smarmy British comic or slippery senator. She is a self-made Republican-voting woman from Louisiana who has sex for a living. In a pre-agreement interview, she suggested she had indulged Mr Trump not because she was attracted to him (\"Would you be?\"), but because he had promised to make her a TV star. She out-Trumps Trump.\n\nA storm in a DD-cup\n\nBesides blunting the president's strengths, she also shows up his biggest weakness. He is at once thin-skinned and unembarrassable, a combination that explains most of his Twitter rages and boasting. After years of dealing with misogynist insults, by contrast, she appears so cheerfully thick-skinned as almost to be operating on a higher plane. This is also apparent on Twitter, where Ms Clifford dispatches the slurs Mr Trump's fans hurl at her with wry wit (\"You know you're supposed to read that Bible and not smoke it, right?\") and no tolerance for poor English. \"Commas are our friend. Don't forget them,\" she advised one critic.\n\nThe effect is devastating, a rapier to the president's bludgeon. Ms Daniels has not merely ridiculed and perhaps imperilled Mr Trump more effectively than anyone else. She has done so, most crushingly of all, while coming across as perfectly pleasant.",

                "title": "In Illinois politics, money talks",
                "body": "MONEY did not talk during the Democratic and Republican primary elections held in Illinois on March 20th -- it screamed. The incumbent Republican governor, Bruce Rauner (pictured), who splashed out some $50m on his campaign, saw off a strong challenge from a right-winger, Jeanne Ives. He will face an even richer opponent in the general election in November, because J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire who poured almost $70m into his own campaign, easily won the Democratic primary for governor. Wealthy candidates also prevailed in many of the primary races for Illinois's 18 congressional seats and other positions, held on the same day.\n\nHigh-level politics is increasingly a game for wealthy people. Roll Call, a political newspaper owned by The Economist Group, calculates that America's senators and congressmen were worth $2.43bn when the 115th Congress began -- 20% more than the previous Congress. Ten house members and three senators are worth more than $43m each (many politicians are not required to state the value of their properties). Not all contribute to their own campaigns, though, and few are as spendthrift as would-be governors of Illinois. The race, which has already cost about $160m, could well become the most expensive non-presidential campaign in history, exceeding the $280m spent in California's governor's race in 2010.\n\nIt is easy to see why the Democratic establishment, including county chairmen, big unions and elected politicians, embraced Mr Pritzker's candidacy. The millions he is spending on his own campaign mean more cash can be spent on crucial legislative races. Daniel Biss, a state senator and former maths teacher who was defeated by Mr Pritzker, wondered during the campaign whether Illinois is engaged in \"an auction or an election\".\n\nEnormously wealthy people have competed in Illinois elections before. But until Mr Rauner's victory in 2014 \"they did not really do well\", says Christopher Mooney of the University of Illinois at Chicago. In 2004 Barack Obama saw off two richer opponents: Blair Hull, a former securities trader who had pumped $29m into his campaign, and the Republican Jack Ryan. Both were felled by personal scandals.\n\nThe trouble with rich neophytes, explains Mr Mooney, is that they are not properly vetted. Mr Pritzker has already hit a couple of bumps. In February the Chicago Tribune unearthed tapes of a conversation in 2008 between Mr Pritzker and Rod Blagojevich, then governor of Illinois, who is now in prison. In the conversation Mr Pritzker called Jesse White, a well-liked secretary of state, the \"least offensive\" black candidate. On March 14th the same newspaper revealed the businessman's ties to offshore companies.\n\nThe bulk of the millions spent on the battle for the governorship so far has come from four men: Messrs Rauner and Pritzker themselves; Ken Griffin, a hedge-fund billionaire, who lavished $20m on Mr Rauner; and Richard Uihlein, an entrepreneur who used to finance Mr Rauner but recently gave $2.5m to Ms Ives because he was upset about Mr Rauner signing a bill that expands public funding of abortions. It is almost enough to make one wish for the old days, when Illinois was run by a corrupt Democratic machine. Almost.",

                "body": "FEW pieces of legislation sound more anodyne than the Taiwan Travel Act. The bill, which both houses of Congress passed unanimously and President Donald Trump signed into law on March 16th, aims only to \"encourage visits between officials from the United States and Taiwan at all levels\". Yet it risks triggering a diplomatic brouhaha. China regards the prospect of visits between American and Taiwanese officials as a violation of America's \"one-China policy\", under which America pledged to maintain only unofficial relations with a place that China regards as a renegade province. \"We urge the US side to correct its mistake,\" says a spokesman from China's foreign ministry.\n\nSteve Chabot, a Republican congressman from Ohio and author of the bill, says that his legislation has \"no provocative intent\". Taiwan, after all, is America's 11th-biggest trading partner, outstripping Brazil. And the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 commits America to helping Taiwan defend itself. Mr Chabot worries that insufficient communication between the two sides could hurt Taiwan's, and by extension America's, security in the face of a more assertive China.\n\nSince 1979 only six American cabinet-level officials have visited Taiwan, but no president has. When Gina McCarthy, then head of the Environmental Protection Agency, travelled to Taiwan in 2014, it was the first time an American cabinet official had visited the island in 14 years. When Taiwanese officials travel to America they must keep a low profile. Taiwanese presidents have usually been granted only \"layovers\" in America, which allow them to stay for just a day or two. Taiwanese leaders have had to lobby hard just for the privilege of making a pit stop in the lower 48 states. In 2006 American officials refused to grant Chen Shui-bian, then Taiwan's president, a layover in New York or San Francisco, offering him instead a refuelling stop in Alaska or Hawaii. His dignity slighted, Mr Chen called off the trip.\n\nAmerica's longstanding reluctance to send officials to Taiwan and overbearing rules concerning the hosting of Taiwanese officials are self-imposed restrictions. Nothing in American law touches on the legality of high-level exchanges between America and Taiwan. Rather, it seems that past practices have become institutionalised. It is also unclear how, by merely encouraging (as opposed to mandating) more visits between officials from the two nations, America contravenes its one-China policy. That policy is \"a flexible construct\", says Richard Bush of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank.\n\nEven so, some analysts warn against antagonising China just when America needs its co-operation on North Korea's nuclear programme. Shortly after America granted a visa to Lee Teng-hui, then president of Taiwan, in 1995, China launched missiles into the Taiwan Strait. America had to send in two aircraft-carrier battle groups to persuade China to back off. It was America's biggest military showing in the region since the Vietnam war.\n\nAmerica has been quick to act on the new law. On March 20th the State Department dispatched Alex Wong, a deputy assistant secretary, to Taipei for a three-day visit. On the agenda is a dinner with Taiwan's president. The next day China sent its sole aircraft-carrier through the Taiwan Strait. That might not be a coincidence.",

A few carry backpacks with rifle barrels poking out. Gunfire echoes from the building, as pistols are fired on 25-metre and 50-metre ranges. Those with rifles pick out targets 300 metres away.\n\nSince 1474 Geneva's male residents, obliged to defend the city, have met for regular weapons practice here. Jacques Vo-Thanh, smoking outside after training, says guns are \"embedded in the social life\". Though membership has declined, he estimates the club has 500 regulars and 2,000 retired members. Children as young as ten may learn to shoot. The government subsidises ammunition.\n\nPro-gun types in America have long pointed to Switzerland as a country with supposedly lax rules, widespread ownership of arms, proud hunting and shooting cultures and few resulting criminal problems. As of late last century some 40% of Swiss households had a weapon, usually a military-issue rifle or pistol in a cupboard. Almost all men, having been conscripts, were familiar with small arms. They kept weapons at home because they had to refresh their shooting skills each year.\n\nYet Switzerland is not a gun-lover's paradise. In fact, it is a model for the benefits of restricting gun use. Ownership rates have tumbled in this century, especially after the army cut the number of conscripts by four-fifths. It now puts recruits through psychological checks to weed out the violent, depressive or criminal. Soldiers may still store weapons at home, but no longer with ammunition. On leaving the army, ex-soldiers must be cleared by police before buying their military-issue weapons. As a result, fewer do so. Civilian buyers need police permits too, while juries screen applicants at shooting clubs. \"It is a bit state and a bit social responsibility. It works very well,\" says Mr Vo-Thanh.\n\nOne spur to tighter rules was a mass shooting, in which 14 people died, in Zug in 2001. Public enthusiasm for guns has declined. Although voters rejected seven years ago a proposal to ban home-storage of weapons, fewer people do so. According to an estimate in 2016, only 24% of Swiss own guns. Increasingly it is the elderly who attend shooting clubs. Many store their weapons there.\n\nThe reduced availability of weapons has coincided with -- and helps to explain -- steadily falling rates of suicide and murder in which guns are used, as well as lower levels of all types of killings. The rate of gun homicides in 2015, 0.2 per 100,000 people, was roughly half the level of the late 1990s. In contrast, America's figure was 4.0; and over the same period it has barely budged.",

                "body": "EVERY day around 100 people are killed on America's roads, including 16 pedestrians. Each death is a tragedy, but that of Elaine Herzberg, who died after being hit by a car in Tempe, Arizona on the evening of March 18th, was a tragedy of a new kind. It was the first known case of a pedestrian being killed by a self-driving car. The accident has raised questions about whether America's rules surrounding the testing of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are too lax.\n\nThe vehicle that struck Ms Herzberg was being tested in \"autonomous mode\" by Uber, a ride-hailing firm. Local police say it was travelling at 38mph (61kph) on a road with a speed limit of 45mph, and that video from the vehicle shows Ms Herzberg, who was wheeling a bicycle by the side of the road, stepping suddenly into the car's path. A human safety driver in the vehicle did not anticipate the collision and had not taken manual control. The police and federal safety bodies have launched investigations, during which Uber has suspended operation of its AVs in Arizona, Pittsburgh and San Francisco.\n\nMany American cities and states permit the testing of AVs on public roads, with varying degrees of licensing and oversight. Boston, for example, requires AVs to pass a driving test in a limited area before heading out into the wider city. California requires companies testing AVs to provide annual safety reports. Arizona is a particularly attractive environment for AV-makers, because its streets are regular grids, the weather is reliably dry and warm (snow can confuse the LIDAR sensors AVs use to scan their surroundings) and its regulators have been unusually welcoming. Since 2015, no special permits or licences have been needed to operate AVs in Arizona, though the governor announced a tweaking of the rules on March 1st.\n\nThose new rules will now come under intense scrutiny, as will legislation, currently in the works in Washington, DC, to introduce federal safety standards for AV testing. This proposes exempting AVs from some existing safety standards, and would prevent states from introducing their own rules for AVs. The aim is to spur innovation by simplifying the regulatory environment. But in the wake of the accident in Tempe, road-safety advocates have called for the rules around AVs to be tightened, not loosened. Boston has asked nuTonomy, an AV firm, to suspend testing. Toyota said it would have a voluntary pause in the testing of AVs on American roads. The firm said it was concerned about the emotional effect of the Tempe accident on its safety drivers.\n\nProponents of AVs often cite the safety benefits of vehicles that can drive themselves, noting that 94% of accidents are caused by human error. General Motors, America's biggest carmaker, has set a goal of \"zero crashes\". But developing the technology means testing it on public roads, where accidents involving AVs and other road users are inevitable. AVs will never eliminate road deaths, and expecting them to do so is to hold them to an impossible standard. A more realistic goal, suggests Amnon Shashua of Mobileye, a maker of AV technology, is to reduce the number of road deaths a thousandfold. But in a paper published last year, he warned of the danger of a \"winter of autonomous driving\", suggesting that because of regulatory uncertainty, fatal accidents involving fully autonomous vehicles could plunge the industry into legal limbo, or kill it altogether.\n\nThe extent to which Ms Herzberg's death will change attitudes towards AVs, or influence the regulation of the industry, depends to a large extent on the findings of the various investigations. It is important to avoid unnecessary risks when developing and implementing what promises to be a life-saving technology. But the sad truth is that there are bound to be fatal accidents on the road to a driverless world.",

                "title": "Saturn's rings and several of its moons may be recent creations",
                "body": "NOT everything looks lovelier the longer and closer its inspection. But Saturn does. It is gorgeous through Earthly telescopes. However, the 13 years of close observation provided by Cassini, an American spacecraft, showed the planet, its moons and its remarkable rings off better and better, revealing finer structures, striking novelties and greater drama.\n\nCassini's observations, which ended last September when the craft was crashed into Saturn's atmosphere, also provided further evidence that, as might be expected of such delicate beauty, the rings are quite new to the world. This idea is not novel, but has been put on a firmer footing than before. And a new theory proposes that the cataclysm which created the rings may also have brought into being quite a few of Saturn's moons.\n\nBy and large the big things in the solar system -- planets and moons -- are thought of as having been around since the beginning. The suggestion that rings and moons are new is, though, made even more interesting by the fact that one of those moons, Enceladus, is widely considered the most promising site in the solar system on which to look for alien life. If Enceladus is both young and bears life, that life must have come into being quickly. This is also believed to have been the case on Earth. Were it true on Enceladus, that would encourage the idea that life evolves easily when conditions are right.\n\nOne reason for thinking Saturn's rings are young is that they are bright. The solar system is suffused with comet dust, and comet dust is dark. Leaving Saturn's ring system (which Cassini has shown to be more than 90% water ice) out in such a mist is like leaving laundry hanging on a line downwind from a smokestack: it will get dirty. The lighter the rings are, the faster this will happen, for the less mass they contain, the less celestial pollution they can absorb before they start to discolour. And, though the final figures have yet to be published, on March 19th Jeff Cuzzi, a scientist at America's space agency, NASA, who helped run Cassini, told the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston that combining the mass estimates with Cassini's measurements of the density of comet-dust near Saturn suggests the rings are no older than the first dinosaurs, nor younger than the last of them -- that is, they are somewhere between 200m and 70m years old.\n\nThat timing fits well with a theory put forward in 2016, by Matija Cuk of the SETI Institute, in California and his colleagues. They suggest that at around the same time as the rings came into being an old set of moons orbiting Saturn destroyed themselves, and from their remains emerged not only the rings but also the planet's current suite of inner moons -- Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus and Mimas. (Tethys and Enceladus are pictured, along with the rings.)\n\nDr Cuk and his colleagues used computer simulations of Saturn's moons' orbits as a sort of time machine. Looking at the rate at which tidal friction is causing these orbits to lengthen they extrapolated backwards to find out what those orbits would have looked like in the past. They discovered that about 100m years ago the orbits of two of them, Tethys and Dione, would have interacted in a way that left the planes in which they orbit markedly tilted. But their orbits are untilted. The obvious, if unsettling, conclusion was that this interaction never happened -- and thus that at the time when it should have happened, Dione and Tethys were simply not there. They must have come into being later.\n\nThe first blush of youth\n\nHow could this be? Dr Cuk's explanation relies on another form of orbital perturbation called an evection. Orbits have a property called precession. The point at which a moon and its planet come closest together, known as periapsis, is not constant. On each of a moon's orbits, periapsis shifts a little farther around the planet until it eventually returns to where it was. When the period of this precession matches the time it takes the planet itself to orbit the sun, the sun's gravity will distort the moon's orbit. This is evection.\n\nDr Cuk and his colleagues think that Saturn started off with two moons close to it that, between them, weighed a bit more than Dione and Rhea, the biggest of today's inner moons. Their orbits would have expanded slowly for billions of years until the radius of the more distant one's orbit was 8.3 times that of Saturn -- at which point it would have entered a powerful evection and started swinging around like a wild thing. Eventually it would have smacked into its sibling, destroying both and creating a vast disc of debris. Reasonably quickly, gravity would have clumped almost all of this debris back together, to produce a new set of moons. These are the ones seen today. But within a certain orbital radius, known as the Roche limit, moons cannot form. There, the disc would have remained a disc -- the disc of the rings.\n\nIf Dr Cuk's theory is correct, it makes Enceladus even more interesting. One of Cassini's most provocative discoveries was that Enceladus has an ocean under its icy exterior, plumes from which are sprayed into space on a regular basis from rifts in the ice at its south pole. Cassini showed that this ocean contains hydrothermal sites which could provide chemical energy, and that there are organic molecules in it.\n\nMany believe that the presence of these things was all that was required for life to get started on Earth. Now, Enceladus looks as youthful as Earth was then. Old enough for life to have begun. Young enough for nothing dire to have happened to it. Enceladus has become an even more enticing subject for a long, close inspection than it was before.",

                "body": "THEY couldn't say they weren't warned. Thick and fast the gags came. \"The first thing the manager said to me was, 'Crack on, Dodd. I've got to get this theatre cleared by 2am.' I told him, 'Looks like we'll have to do the second half outside the town hall, then'.\" \"Are you looking at your watch, sir? You don't need a watch, you need a calendar. We should be finished by Tuesday.\" \"The sooner you laugh at the jokes, the sooner you can go home. But they say the breakfast here is good.\" \"This isn't television, Mrs. You can't turn me off.\"\n\nThey couldn't turn Doddy off (or not for five hours or so) because once the audience was warmed up he couldn't bear to stop. \"You all represent the crème de la crème. That's French for evaporated milk.\" \"Hello, Mrs. Is this your husband with you, or is it novelty night?\" Between the 1960s and the 1990s he averaged 100,000 miles a year, playing nearly every theatre in Britain. Though he starred on TV too, it didn't suit him. The Varieties at Liverpool's Shakespeare Theatre, his boyhood passion, were his ideal. He was the last of the front-cloth comedians, meaning they dropped a cloth behind you while they cleared up the stage from the Liberty Horses and got it ready for the man who pulled doves out of his jacket, and there you were, but with an act that had been burnished until it was a jewel. And he knew he was the last, for all the greats, from Max Miller on, had crossed the boards before him.\n\nNot that this lessened his plumptiousness. \"What a beautiful day!\" he would cry. A wonderful day to beat a big drum, in true trouper style, in a shaggy red greatcoat or a mustard-yellow suit (\"My tailor is colour-blind\"), his hair like a bats' nest and his teeth, bucked when he'd tried to ride a bike with his eyes closed, going proud before. (\"My mother used to use me for crimping the pastry.\") His chief prop was a tickling-stick, a red, white and blue feather duster extendable into the stalls to get those chuckle-muscles working and reduce the hall to that beautiful thing, helpless laughter. \"How tickled I am, under the circumstances! Tell me, Madam, have you ever been tickled under the circumstances?\" He brought on dancing children as the Diddymen of Knotty Ash, his home suburb in Liverpool, and smoothed his hair to sing sentimental ballads in a light baritone. One of these, \"Tears\", topped the charts for five weeks in 1965; he was good at crying songs. But then he resumed the gags. He held the world record for cracking them, 1,500 in 3 hours 7 minutes, with no script. Just off the top of his wild tousled head.\n\nJokes about fat ladies.\"An official told my big Auntie Nellie to come off the beach, because the tide was waiting to come in.\" Repairmen: \"On Friday there was a tap on the door. Funny sense of humour, that plumber.\" Mothers-in-law: \"I haven't spoken to mine for 18 months. I don't like to interrupt her.\" Men: \"How many men does it take to change a toilet roll? Nobody knows, it's never been tried.\" And himself. \"I do exercises every day in front of the television. Up, down, up, down, up, down. Then the other eyelid.\" \"It's ten years since I went out of my mind. I'd never go back.\" His life (in fact coal-merchant's son, left school at 14, sold pans and detergent out of a van, first professional gig as Professor Yaffle Chuckabutty at the Nottingham Empire in 1954) was made as mythical as Knotty Ash itself, which acquired treacle wells and black-pudding plantations. \"I was born one day when my mother was out. We were so poor, the lady next door had me.\"\n\nIt seemed scatty, but every joke and gesture was rehearsed and re-rehearsed. In each new town he scoured the public library for books about comedy and the psychology of wit. His house in Knotty Ash was full of them. He read Schopenhauer and Freud. \"Freud said, Laughter is the outward expression of the psyche. But he never played the Glasgow Empire on a Saturday after both Celtic and Rangers lost.\" In dozens of notebooks he recorded his jokes, where told, and how they'd gone down. In the Black Country he had to unfold them slowly. Nottingham liked picture gags. The south coast enjoyed a bit of spice, but Wigan didn't. His favourite photo of himself was a back view, walking across a theatre car park in red-and-white striped stockings, tickling-sticks in hand, thinking: \"I could have told that one better.\"\n\nCash in the attic\n\nHis buoyancy was tempered only once, when the Inland Revenue in 1989 found that in his attic, together with Charlie Brown, his first ventriloquist's puppet, and a life-raft, and a giant bottle of stout, and box upon box of scripts, there was also £336,000 in cash that he hadn't declared for tax. More sat in shoe-boxes under the bed. He'd put some of his earnings in offshore accounts, but he didn't trust banks. He kept his money close to remind him that he'd played the London Palladium for 42 weeks in the mid-1960s, another record. To prove he was somebody. Everyone acquitted him, and the joke-book benefited. \"Self-assessment? I invented that.\" \"I told the Inland Revenue I didn't owe them a penny, because I lived by the seaside.\"\n\nBy then he was invulnerable, part of the national fabric. It was just the music-hall tradition, old-style variety, that was dying on its feet. And jokes about death never went down well. Apart from the one about the mother-in-law and the sharks...the taxman and the boa constrictor....",

                "body": "We read Lexington's column on Emmanuel Makender, one of the first \"Lost Boys\" from Sudan to come to America in 2000, with great interest (March 3rd). We are Emmanuel's \"American parents\". Our family will never forget the day we picked up Emmanuel at the airport. Our overwhelmed hearts imbued with fear, wondering what in the world were we thinking when we said we would welcome a refugee into our already child-filled home?\n\nI am not sure who was the most scared. The Lost Boys huddled in the middle of the circle, or the group of host families surrounding them. Our fears were quickly dispelled when Emmanuel came home. Our kids showed their new \"brother\" how light switches work, how to turn on a faucet and a host of other amazing inventions, including the telephone, hot-water heater, a computer, and Emmanuel's favourite, a hot shower.\n\nWe helped Emmanuel through school, with homework, studying for vocational tests, getting his first job, opening a bank account, wiring money to Sudan. A group of families in our church helped him with things both small (clothes, shoes, home-baked goodies) and large (several families contributed towards the down payment on Emmanuel's first home a few miles from our house).\n\nBut we can honestly say that Emmanuel gave us more than we ever gave him; a deeper appreciation for perseverance amid suffering, resilience amid disappointment, industriousness amid opportunity and love amid hateful violence.\n\nSo now, 18 years later, Emmanuel is still smiling. His photo is on a shelf next to those of our other six children. We talk regularly. I joke, \"Emmanuel, you drive a nicer car than me.\" He smiles and admits, \"it is true.\" Lexington concludes that refugees \"make the country stronger, as well as better.\" That is true indeed.\n\nBagehot's column on the incoherence of the government's policy of a post-Brexit \"global Britain\" was excellent (March 17th). But one factor not mentioned that may further undermine Britain's hope that it can trade alone is its legacy in its former colonies and other emerging-market countries. My family has strong connections with Indian businesses, and we are told time and again that Britain left India much poorer at the end of the Empire. When I was researching in China six years ago, a fair chunk of my interviewees, who were all graduates of the London Business School, reminded me bitterly that the British burnt down their Imperial Summer Palace in 1860.\n\nThese negative beliefs and attitudes can matter in business, and are widespread.\n\nSchumpeter claimed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is \"enough of a conundrum to perplex even the world's greatest value investor\" (March 10th). Yet Berkshire is run with the taxable shareholder in mind. Its practice of acquiring companies at purchase-price discounts and holding them forever produces enormous cumulative deferred taxes. By reinvesting the resulting capital, rather than paying dividends, shareholders are spared the related taxes. Even if Berkshire only beat an index fund by one point, it would be the clearly superior investment after tax.\n\nMoreover, and contrary to Schumpeter's assertions, Berkshire avoids competitive takeovers that stoke premiums, rarely pays much more than market value, and very often obtains a purchase-price discount precisely because, as noted, many \"families and entrepreneurs are happy to pass on their crown jewels\" to Berkshire's stewardship.\n\nNor do the ages of Mr Buffett and Charles Munger, the vice-chairman, produce a \"conundrum.\" The company boasts dozens of exemplary leaders with proven track records in acquisitions and capital allocation. Schumpeter has joined a long list of critics declaring that Warren Buffett has lost his touch, from the mid-1970s to the present day.\n\nThe market for non-alcoholic drinks has indeed been long ignored (\"Only the beer gets drunk\", February 17th). Yet the trend towards sobriety continues. A poll from YouGov showed that 3.1m Britons attempted Dry January this year and 72% of those who took part are likely to maintain lower levels of drinking six months after. Demographically, 16-24 year olds drink less than any other age group.\n\nBut the marketing of low-alcohol versions of beer and wine is wrong. Simply watering down or removing alcohol from the staple offerings of beer and wine reinforces the perception that drinking alcohol is the desirable norm. It shows a lack of understanding of the positive reasons why people choose to forgo alcohol. The brands that can come up with exciting propositions that aren't defined solely by their lack of alcohol will be the winners in this new market. A non-drinker is far more likely to champion a product made with their tastes in mind, and not just promoted as \"booze-free booze\".\n\nLUKE D'ARCY\n\nUK President\n\nMomentum Worldwide\n\nLondon\n\nAs an accidental teetotaller, the problem isn't so much the availability of choice; it is mixing those who do drink with those who don't. Since I quit drinking I have been amazed to find how little even practised tipplers need to drink before their conversation becomes repetitive and their ability to listen deteriorates. It takes just two drinks. Of any kind. Then it's, \"You're not listening to me, it's like this\".\n\nWhat we need are abstinence crèches in pubs, areas where teetotallers can meet other non-drinkers and don't feel wildly out of whack with one's drinking companions. I shall hang on to my pints of lime and soda.\n\nLUCY SAUNDERS\n\nLondon\n\nDarling it's better down where it's wetter\n\n* In concluding that ocean plastic pollution \"seems less bad than other kinds of pollution\" and \"doesn't look hugely alarming\" (\"Too much of a good thing\", March 3rd), you underplay this growing environmental challenge. As you rightly state, there are major gaps in our understanding of the impacts on both marine and human life, however there are three facts that we can say for sure.\n\nFirst, a healthy ocean provides food security for a billion-strong coastal community, regulates our global climate, provides a home for unimaginable biological diversity and inspires many of us as a natural playground and source of wonder. Second, plastic pollution is not reversible once it reaches the ocean, as even the most optimistic clean-up efforts only claim to recover a negligible percentage of the plastic that enters the ocean every year. Third, it is a cumulative force, as the millions of tons of plastics that enter the ocean this year alone will still be there hundreds of years from now.\n\nArmed with these basic facts, it seems that the governments, CEOs and consumers referenced in your article have come to the same common-sense conclusion: we must keep plastics out of our ocean. Solutions to this global challenge are at our fingertips. Investments in waste collection and recycling in emerging economies provide benefits for livelihoods, tourism and public health. In fact, a whole new industry can be built on the back of recycled plastic resourcess. Global companies increasingly see the benefits from engaging their staff and customers in a \"race to the top\" as they move away from linear single-use models of plastic packaging towards new circular economy approaches characterized by smart design of business models, products and packaging and far higher rates of packaging recovery and recycling.\n\nWe faced down a similar global environmental challenge before, when we realised that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were causing a hole in the ozone layer and coordinated positive action by governments and businesses under the 1987 Montreal Protocol. Thirty years on, we have another chance to shine.\n\nMARTIN R. STUCHTEY\n\nFounder and Managing Partner\n\nSYSTEMIQ\n\nLondon\n\nRussia's one-track record\n\nWhile spring cleaning, I came across The Economist from July 26th 2014. Your leader on Russia, \"A web of lies\", was particularly prescient given recent events. Your chilling portrayal of Vladimir Putin spreading falsehoods to whip up support at home and blunt any Western response was spot-on. You recognised that Russia's propaganda campaign is to sow doubt on all sources of information: \"In a world of liars, might not the West be lying, too?\" If this had been heeded by politicians perhaps your other prediction would not have come true. If the world \"does not stand up to him today, worse will follow\".\n\nBRANDON DUNCAN\n\nSan Francisco\n\nOn behalf of righteous cephalopods everywhere, I must express my indignation.

                "title": "Li Ka-shing cedes a sprawling empire to his son",
                "body": "\"TOO long\" was how Li Ka-shing, known fondly by locals as chiu yan (Superman) for his business nous, described his working life when he announced on March 16th that he would be retiring in May. Asia's pre-eminent dealmaker has been around for longer than his fictional namesake, scoring and selling assets in ports, telecoms, retail and property to amass a fortune estimated at $36bn.\n\nFew expect Mr Li, who will turn 90 this summer, to hang up his cape for good. He says he will stay on to advise his eldest son, Victor Li, who will inherit his two main businesses. The first is CK Hutchison, a conglomerate with interests in power plants, perfume and much in between. It runs 52 ports and owns 14,000 high-street stores, including Watsons at home and Superdrug in Britain. The second is CK Asset, one of Hong Kong's biggest property developers. Combined they are worth $79.7bn.\n\nAt the press conference the younger Mr Li made all the right noises. \"When I return to work tomorrow, it will be the same,\" he told investors. They took it well -- shares in the two CK businesses dipped only modestly at the news. His father's willingness to cut him off and answer reporters' questions himself may have reassured them that he really will stick around.\n\nSuccession is a delicate matter. Joseph Fan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong has found that family-run firms in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan lose 60% of their value on average in the years before and after a change. Many a tycoon has proved hopeless at planning for his departure. Discussing death is regarded as unlucky. Most cling on past their prime.\n\nNot so the meticulous Mr Li. As early as 2000 it became clear that Victor would inherit his empire, after his second son, Richard, stepped down as deputy chairman of Hutchison Whampoa (now CK Hutchison) and went his own way. In 2012 Mr Li made this line of succession official.\n\nAccording to Oliver Rui of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, Mr Li also simplified a complex holding structure in 2015 with thehandover in mind. He split property holdings from other assets, boosting both firms' valuations and making it easier for his son to sell off bits of the empire in future.\n\nMr Li has also been reinvesting his fortune in stable, cash-generating assets in Europe. These now account for close to two-thirds of CK Hutchison's operating profit, compared with just 16% from Hong Kong and mainland China. In November he sold a 73-storey skyscraper on Hong Kong island for $5.2bn, and since 2013 has parted with $3bn-worth of commercial properties in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.\n\nAlthough both father and son speak of continuity, many in Hong Kong see Li senior's exit as the end of an era -- and not just for his empire. Mr Li came to Hong Kong as a wartime refugee, fleeing Guangdong with his family in 1940 at the age of 12. His father died soon afterwards, and he was taken out of school and put to work. In 1950 he was among the first in the British colony to get into the plastics business. His plastic flowers were a hit. (His future wife came from a well-off industrial family, helping with credit and connections.) When property prices slumped during riots in 1967 he pounced, setting up his first property company in 1971. The timing was propitious; Hong Kong's economy grew by 9% a year on average in that decade.\n\nHe went on to operate container ports, and belonged to the first wave of outsiders to invest in China when it opened up in the late 1970s. In Hong Kong he bought into everything from groceries to pharmacies, and supplied swathes of the city with electricity. Through Hutchison, an old British trading house that he bought in 1979 (the first time a Chinese took control of a British firm), he expanded abroad in a way no other local tycoon has. Unusually for a head of a family firm, he sought out professional managers, many of them foreign.\n\nThe incoming boss has worked with some of them for decades. Victor is credited with CK Hutchison's push into overseas utilities, including three big recent investments in energy infrastructure in Australia, Canada and Germany. Still, if he has his own vision for the business, it may not become apparent for two to three years, says Mr Rui.\n\nIt could use fresh thinking. Two decades ago, Mr Li's stocks were among the ten most actively traded on Hong Kong's exchange, according to Bloomberg, a data provider. Now they are outside the top 30. A foray into biotech has been ho-hum.\n\nAs for Hong Kong, it is less fertile ground for would-be tycoons than before. Oligopolies are entrenched locally. Mainland China, meanwhile, produces a dollar billionaire every five days. Pony Ma and Jack Ma, (unrelated) founders of Tencent and Alibaba, two tech giants, are richer than Mr Li. A new Li Ka-shing is more likely to rise in next-door Shenzhen than in Hong Kong.",

                "title": "The EU wants to tax tech giants' revenues",
                "body": "IT IS a choice that would make Thomas Hobson proud. European officials this week unveiled plans for a quick and dirty tax policy to apply to big digital firms, in theory by the end of the year. The idea, promised since September, would ditch a tradition of taxing profits and instead let collectors in member states take a share, 3% for starters, of the firms' local revenues. There is a lively debate about where exactly the tech giants create taxable value. Is it where their programmers sit? Or the intellectual property? Or users? The firms have become so adept at tax avoidance that the European Commission is not going to hang around until the argument is settled.\n\nPierre Moscovici, the commissioner overseeing the proposals, was at pains to say on March 21st that the turnover tax would be an \"interim\" fix. He denied Americans are his targets. Between 120 and 150 companies would be affected, around half of them American and a third European. (Apple, Google and other American giants would surely get the biggest bills.) Only those with global revenues of more than €750m ($920m), and EU revenues of more than €50m, would be covered. Earnings in the sights include those from ads and marketplaces.\n\nCrucially, firms would pay taxes where they generate revenues, which are harder to sequester abroad with the sorts of intragroup loans and other accounting wheezes often used to book profits in lower-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland or Luxembourg. Regulators say that this practice helps explain why digital firms pay an estimated effective tax rate in Europe of just 9.5%, compared with 23.3% for bricks-and-mortar ones. The new tax could raise €5bn a year.\n\nFrance under President Emmanuel Macron has pushed hardest for the plan. But it hardly signals \"the right environment for modern business\" that Mr Moscovici brags about. Tax on revenues could backfire -- it is unclear what a loss-making firm with whopping turnover is supposed to do, for example. Nor will the proposal easily become reality: tax changes in the EU require unanimity. France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain welcomed the plans. But they will have to strong-arm smaller, low-tax countries, which have most to lose. America, unsurprisingly, is also opposed. Steve Mnuchin, its treasury secretary, told the New York Times this week that gross taxes on internet companies are \"not fair\".\n\nWhy push a reform that might hobble the sort of digital economy European officials call the future? Enter Hobson: doing so makes another proposal, announced by Mr Moscovici on the same day, look more appealing. His preferred outcome is for firms to pay taxes locally on a share of their digital profits, not revenues. To make that possible he says countries should pass laws to identify companies' \"digital presence\". This would be defined as having online revenues worth €7m or more, 100,000 customers or more than 3,000 business contracts in any given country. The EU is fuzzier on how to determine what share of profits derives from these revenues.\n\nThat may be fleshed out by various obscurely named efforts to draw up global standards for taxing profits. The EU has an existing proposal, called CCCTB (don't ask), for common rules for calculating firms' taxable profits across Europe. However, such plans progress agonisingly slowly, perhaps because digital firms (and their army of lobbyists) prefer the lucrative status quo. The real gain from threatening a turnover tax might therefore be to speed up plans to tax profits better.",

                "title": "Indian drugmakers need a new prescription",
                "body": "A SINGLE pill of Abilify, a drug used to treat manic depression, costs $30 or so in America. Or you could try gAbilify (the g stands for \"generic\"), better known to chemists as Aripiprazole. Thrifty pharmaceutical companies, many of them in India, can provide it for less than $1 a pop since the drug's patent expired in 2015. That is bad news for Otsuka and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the two labs that formulated Abilify and got it approved by authorities in the 1990s. Everyone else, from patients to insurers to the public purse, is correspondingly better off. Generics-makers have thrived, particularly in India. But the prognosis for the industry is less rosy.\n\nIndia became the world's biggest exporter of generics almost by accident. Lax intellectual-property rules in the 1980s allowed its firms to crib drugs patented elsewhere for its huge domestic market. Trade deals gradually opened markets abroad. As patents for a wave of drugs from the 1980s expired two decades later, sales of Indian generics surged.\n\nTheir off-brand pills, vaccines, patches and syrups help contain health-care costs in rich countries and supply poor ones with once-unaffordable drugs to combat AIDS and other scourges. Firms like Cipla, Sun Pharmaceutical, Lupin and Dr Reddy's have become pharma's quiet titans. Indian pharma companies sold $29.6bn-worth of pills and potions in 2017.\n\nAmerica accounts for two-fifths of that. Sales there have grown by 30% a year for the past decade. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which licenses medicines, has embraced generics and made rapid approval easier for copycat drugs. Nearly 550 labs in India supply the lucrative American market, which is now 90% generic by volume. From virtually nothing at the start of the century, around a billion prescriptions made out by American doctors every year are fulfilled with drugs from companies based in India.\n\nThe FDA's approval came with conditions attached, however. Notably, these included site visits carried out by its dozen-plus inspectors in India. Several plants have flunked these because of poor hygiene or deficient processes, such as a failure to keep track of manufacturing glitches. A giant factory in Halol owned by Sun Pharmaceutical, the biggest Indian firm, has been unable to export new drugs to America since 2015.\n\nThe FDA also wants to see more competition in generics. The agency is licensing ever more foreign drugs and labs -- including Chinese ones -- for imports to America, undercutting Indian incumbents. It wants to see multiple generics approved for each medicine, to limit pricing power. Wholesalers, distributors and retailers of drugs in America (such as hospitals and pharmacies) have merged or ganged up in consortia to help contain rising drug costs.\n\nThe side-effects are already showing in India. Indian companies' sales of generic drugs have been flat for the past two years, and profits in the most recent quarter were down by a third compared with a year ago. Analysts expect profits from America to erode by around 10% annually. Prosecutors in 45 American states suspect that price-fixing helped to fatten margins earlier this decade. That could result in large fines for guilty firms. As easy-to-copy blockbuster drugs become rarer, moreover, manufacturers of copycats may see their lifeblood threatened. An index of Indian pharma companies has fallen by a quarter in two years, at a time when the broader market grew by 40%.\n\nThere is no obvious cure. Prospects for growth in other markets look mixed. Europe and Japan are less keen on generics than America, for now. Patients in poor countries are popping more pills as their incomes rise. But regulators there have a tendency to cap prices -- a phenomenon which has crimped Indian pharma at home for years.\n\nIn response to these pressures, Indian firms have turned to more intricate products, such as patches and inhalers, as well as to more complex drugs. These are trickier to develop but offer better margins. Research-and-development costs have crept up as a result, although the top seven labs in India jointly spend around $1.5bn a year on innovation -- about a fifth of what a large Western pharmaceutical company splashes out.\n\nMore dramatic treatment may be in order. Consolidation has helped generics giants elsewhere to cut costs. Teva, based in Israel, and Mylan, an American company, both slashed their workforce after recent takeovers. But Indian firms, though listed, are still controlled by their founders. Many are run as family businesses, which tend to be averse to mergers.\n\nThe industry's panjandrums insist that a new culture of compliance will make FDA site closures a thing of the past. Once in denial over challenges to their business model, the generics-makers now acknowledge the symptoms afflicting them. It is not yet clear that they know how to cure the underlying condition.",

                "body": "DREW HOUSTON and Arash Ferdowsi must have few regrets since they turned down an offer for their startup from Apple's then boss, Steve Jobs, in 2011. Dropbox hasn't done too badly in the interim. It rakes in over $1bn in revenue by allowing users -- 500m at the last count -- to store and share data in the cloud. On March 23rd it is due to go public, making it the biggest firm to do so since Snap, a messaging app, floated in early 2017. Dropbox's range for its share price values it at between $8bn and $9bn. That will comfort other \"unicorns\", the tag given to startups valued at over $1bn, that are considering listing.\n\nTrue, the valuation is less than its early backers were hoping for when they valued the company at $10bn in 2014, when it last raised equity. But as Matthew Kennedy from Renaissance Capital, a research firm, points out, the previous valuation coincided with peak investor exuberance for tech firms. The adjustment may also reflect some doubts about the firm's long-term prospects.\n\nIts challenge, common to many unicorns, is to convince users to part with cash. Dropbox gives away a basic level of storage for nothing but charges for premium services, including pricier business subscriptions. In order to increase revenues, it either needs to convert more users into paying ones, or encourage existing subscribers to upgrade. So far only 2% of users pay anything, and average revenue per paying user is flat. In 2017 it posted a loss of over $110m. The firm is counting on a shift away from individual users and towards firms to deliver profits.\n\nIt will have to do battle with the giants. Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft all now offer either consumer or enterprise storage services. They bundle together a wider range of offerings than Dropbox can. Jobs's reported description of the firm as a \"feature, not a product\" might not have been sour grapes. If the behemoths were to slash prices for storage, Dropbox's margins would be squeezed.\n\nThat said, the firm has enough going for it to keep investors interested. It is not losing out to rivals yet; revenues grew by a third last year. The market for the management of corporate information is wide open, says Terry Frazier from IDC, a market-research firm. Most businesses have yet to make the leap from storing data on their premises to the cloud. An agreement with Salesforce, which offers corporate online services and is buying $100m of its shares, could give Dropbox a shop window for new business customers. And if Dropbox manages to acquire some of them, the cost of moving data to other platforms means they could stay loyal for some time. Messrs Houston and Ferdowsi may continue to confound the giants for a while yet.",

                "title": "The world's three biggest engine-makers hit a snag",
                "body": "IT USED to be the world's two biggest makers of airliners that would invariably deliver new designs late and over budget. A decade ago the cost of Airbus's A380 superjumbo soared by about €5.5bn ($6.6bn) after engineers got its 330 miles of cables in a jumble. Boeing's rival 787 Dreamliner exceeded its forecast costs by a whopping $20bn, give or take; its parts, once assembled, did not fit together properly. But just as both planemakers are mending their ways -- Airbus's A350 and A320neo and Boeing's 737 MAX arrived in a much more timely and economical manner -- manufacturers of the engines which power the aircraft are beginning to stall.\n\nOn March 15th Boeing revealed that the new engines, the largest ever made, for its new 777X wide-body airliner had completed their first test flight. But GE, the American engineering giant that built them, is already three months behind with their development, because of hiccups with the engine's compressor.\n\nGE is not the only engine-maker with problems. Pratt & Whitney, a rival owned by UTC, an American conglomerate, has had a catalogue of problems with its new engines for the A320neo. The latest, a fault with knife-edge seals on some of them, forced American and EU safety regulators to limit their use. On March 12th regulators in India, where 40% of the world's A320neos fly, grounded all aircraft with faulty engines. That forced IndiGo, India's largest airline, to cancel 5% of its flights.\n\nWorse still are errors made by Rolls-Royce. Warren East, the embattled British company's chief executive, fessed up this month that replacing faulty turbine blades in engines on 787s will cost it £580m ($800m) over the next two years. The defect has forced airlines, including ANA of Japan and British Airways, to cancel flights. Repairs could take four years or more.\n\nEngines are complicated pieces of machinery, so teething troubles are not new, points out Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group, a research firm. Problems with Pratt engines in 1969 delayed the development of Boeing's 747 jumbo jet. Rolls had to be bailed out in 1972 because of costs associated with design faults in its RB211 engine. But as technology matured over the next 40 years glitches became rarer.\n\nA new generation of engines is stretching designs and materials to their limit. At Rolls's new engine factory in Singapore, lightweight titanium fan blades similar to the faulty ones on 787s are baked into shape in ovens. Some 150 measurements are then taken to ensure that the curves are accurate to the width of a human hair. Be off by more than that and you risk a catastrophic failure.\n\nStrict safety rules mean defects have so far been spotted before they have caused an accident. And demand from airlines for the new generation of engines remains robust, thanks to their high fuel efficiency (over 85% of the fuel savings for the Boeing 737 MAX comes from the engines).\n\nHowever, shifting more motors is not how engine-makers turn a profit. Engines are like razors, explains Adam Pilarski, an economist at Avitas, a consultancy. They are sold at a loss -- of £1.6m for each one Rolls churns out, for example. The money is recouped by lucrative service contracts and data analytics, which used to command margins of up to 35%.\n\nNo longer. Slight errors in forecasts, such as underestimating repair costs or overpromising how long engines will last, can push a programme into the red, says Sandy Morris of Jefferies, a bank. That could easily happen on Rolls's 787 engine if, for instance, the replacement blades do not last as long as expected. Moving production to cheaper countries like China or Russia could cut production costs but puts intellectual property at risk.\n\nAirbus and Boeing pose another threat. The planemakers want to grab a share of servicing and analytics contracts to leaven their own margins. They are finding other ways of gouging the engine-makers, too, for instance by forcing them to pay billions of dollars to help develop new planes in exchange for the exclusive right to supply engines for them. For engine-makers, the sky has more limits.",

Companies offer to look after employees for life in return for a willingness to dedicate that life to the company, including \"service\" (ie, unpaid) overtime or moving house on demand. People hesitate to leave the office before their peers, and certainly before their boss. Some sleep at their desks. Convenience stores sell shirts for workers who have no time to go home and change.

The Diet (parliament) is debating a bill which would cap monthly overtime at 100 hours.\n\nThe government hopes that relaxing the work culture will boost productivity (where Japan underperforms the OECD, a club of rich nations) and maybe even combat deflation (it has pushed the idea of freeing workers at 3pm on some Fridays so they can go shopping). Businesses, for their part, are under pressure to attract employees, especially women, amid a severe labour shortage at home.\n\nSome big names are changing their ways. An employee at the national broadcaster, NHK, notorious for all-nighters, says hours have got better and that bosses are nervous about overloading staff. Hitachi, a conglomerate, is leasing co-working spaces so workers don't have to commute to the office from afar. Clerks at 7-Eleven's convenience stores are getting flexible hours.\n\nYuka Sanui, who heads Panasonic's efforts, admits that \"change is slow\". Not many of Ms Abuta's colleagues are taking advantage of the company's schemes. In most places, few workers opt for holidays or child-care allowances. Shaking up Japan's work culture requires deeper labour reforms, says Yumiko Murakami of the OECD. Paying for performance rather than seniority would be a start, by making employees less hesitant to leave oppressive firms and to seek out friendlier ones. In her previous life at an investment bank Ms Murakami toiled endless hours most days. \"But I knew if I didn't like it, I could go elsewhere.\"",

                "body": "WHEN it comes to companies and their passports, there is a flutter of activity in the air -- and a reek of hypocrisy. This month Qualcomm, an American-domiciled tech giant which does 65% of its business in China, booked most of its profits last year in Singapore, and pays little tax at home, successfully lobbied the Trump administration to block a hostile takeover on the ground that its independence was vital to ensure American strategic supremacy over China. The predator was Broadcom. It is listed in America but domiciled in Singapore, where it gets tax perks. On November 2nd, four days before its bid, it announced a burning desire to shift its legal base to the home of the brave.\n\nIn Europe, Unilever, which a year ago demanded that the British authorities help it fend off an unwelcome takeover by Kraft Heinz because it was a national treasure, is shifting its sole base to the Netherlands (at present it is split between London and Rotterdam). The consumer-goods firm says it wants to simplify its structure. But it has been an outspoken critic of London's open takeover regime, and is probably relieved to shelter behind more protective Dutch rules. In Asia, Alibaba, a Chinese internet giant that has its domicile in the Cayman Islands, its principal office in Hong Kong and its listing in New York, has been invited by China's government to float its shares \"at home\" in Shanghai, an offer it cannot refuse.\n\nIt is easy to view these events as just more examples of companies being opportunistic, cynical or both. But in fact a bigger trend is afoot -- corporate flag-waving. After years of having more than one identity (rather like fictional spies having a safe-deposit box full of passports) companies are electing, or being forced, to show more allegiance to a particular country.\n\nFor three decades, a golden era for globalisation, the trend has gone the opposite way. Companies have unbundled their nationality from operations in the pursuit of efficiency or strategic advantage. The slicing and dicing of identity has occurred in at least half a dozen dimensions.\n\nTake, for example, the frequent difference between where firms put their legal headquarters, where they put their de facto headquarters and where their decision-makers reside. When Anshu Jain was co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank between 2012 and 2015, it was often said that the German lender was run from London. ArcelorMittal, a steel firm based in Luxembourg with French, Belgian, Indian and Indonesian roots, is run by the Mittal family, who live in Britain. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, the boss of Schneider Electric, a French industrial firm with global interests, is based in Hong Kong.\n\nThe tax residence of firms is similarly unmoored. Apple is run from California but routes its foreign profits through Ireland, where it says key subsidiaries reside. Nor do regulators need to be physically close to their charges. HSBC, a global bank based in London, relies on profits from subsidiaries supervised in Hong Kong. Companies create intellectual property abroad; foreign pharma firms do most research in America. Then there is the final dimension of nationality: where a firm's shares are listed. Dozens of Chinese internet companies are quoted in New York. In 2011 Prada, an Italian fashion house, chose Hong Kong over Milan.\n\nThis unbundling of nationality had a powerful logic. A firm might achieve a higher valuation by listing its shares in one country, get a lower tax bill by domiciling subsidiaries in another, and offer a better quality of life for its executives in a third. In some cases having multiple passports also allowed firms to win the support of more than one government, or undertake mergers that would have otherwise raised nationalistic hackles. Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi has taken this idea to an extreme, operating as an alliance of firms with their own corporate governance that are linked by cross-shareholdings and some common management.\n\nToday it is still possible to find firms keen to transcend nationality. On March 14th Prudential, an insurer that operates in Asia and America, said it would spin off its European unit, maintain its domicile in London but no longer be supervised by British regulators. SoftBank, a Japanese telecoms and tech firm, has set up a $100bn investment fund that is domiciled in London but mainly invests in Asia and America. But the overwhelming trend is for companies to shed their multiple passports, for three reasons.\n\nFirst, some shareholders argue they are too expensive to maintain. BHP Billiton, a mining firm with listings in Sydney and London, has come under attack from an activist fund to simplify its structure. Analysts gripe that Renault's alliance is too fiddly to value. Second, some firms are seeking the protection of one government -- as in the case of Qualcomm and, perhaps, Unilever. Third, as a more protectionist climate takes hold, governments want firms to locate more activity \"at home\". A recent example is Saudi Aramco, which was due to list in London or New York, but is now most likely to float its shares only at home. One reason is to help catalyse Riyadh's development as a financial centre.\n\nPassport control\n\nThe end of the golden age of corporate cosmopolitanism may make some governments feel more secure. But it could become a zero-sum game, where each country squabbles to get a bigger slice of a fixed pie. For the world's great corporate entrepots, this is bad news. As nationality becomes rebundled, fewer firms will place particular functions away from their headquarters.\n\nThe most intriguing question is whether it is good for companies to be tethered to one place. Now that it is a ward of Uncle Sam, Qualcomm may be unable to cut back on pointless research or relocate jobs from America. Unilever may find the Netherlands cosy but Dutch sensibilities on pay restrictive. And being more protected ultimately breeds complacency. Multinationals may come to miss the days when they could stride the planet, belonging to everyone and no one at the same time.",

                "title": "FDA wants to help unproductive drugmakers",
                "body": "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, the thoughtful head of America's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has had a busy first year. He has launched the process of lowering nicotine levels in cigarettes, approved self-testing kits for breast-cancer genes and waved through the most new medicines in two decades, as well as a record number of copycat drugs (see article). There is one thing he and his regulatory agency are doing less of, however -- regulating. New rules were at a 20-year low in 2017, according to analysts at PwC, a consultancy. Instead, the FDA is providing more guidance to industry. This approach, Mr Gottlieb hopes, will help pharmaceutical firms in America develop drugs more efficiently. Since that is where most drug development happens, the FDA's philosophy matters beyond American borders.\n\nGiven the rapid pace of scientific advances in medicine, you might think Big Pharma is in rude health. You would be wrong. Last year consultants at Deloitte estimated that returns on investment among the biggest American drugmakers fell to 3.2%, from 10.1% in 2010 (see chart). Many observers blame the rising cost of bringing new drugs to market.\n\nIt now costs an average of $2bn to develop a new drug, up from $1.2bn in 2010. One theory is that the easier discoveries have already been made. As medicines become more personalised, the returns per drug may be squeezed because fixed development costs are spread across a smaller pool of potential patients. Either way, firms may have fewer incentives to innovate.\n\nMr Gottlieb has several ideas for how to provide them with more. First, he wants the agency to rethink how much information the FDA demands at an early stage. For example, with better models of a drug's toxicity, it could be tested in animals later in the process rather than at the outset. Lowering upfront costs should encourage investment, especially by smaller biotech firms with bright ideas but fewer resources. Making early failure cheaper should also enable startups to raise capital more easily.\n\nMr Gottlieb's second idea is to extend to other areas the innovative trial design that the FDA has pioneered in recent years for cancer drugs. This may involve doing away with the traditional hard boundaries of the drug-testing process (known as phases 1, 2 and 3). Instead, trials constantly adapt by expanding and shrinking cohorts of patients depending on their response to treatment. This makes the process more efficient. The agency is also open to the inclusion of non-trial data (from wearables or patient records, say).\n\nCrucially, some cancer drugs do not now need to show that they extend overall survival, merely that they prolong the time a patient lives without the cancer getting worse. As a benchmark of clinical success, this \"endpoint\" is quicker, and cheaper, to prove. It may have encouraged investment and innovation in oncology.\n\nThe FDA now wants to do something similar for other diseases, in particular Alzheimer's. This is Mr Gottlieb's third idea -- and potentially the most controversial.\n\nDementia is an area of growing concern as populations age, but one where drugmakers have a history of costly failures. Since 2003 more than 200 compounds for dementia have entered phase-2 clinical trials, when drugmakers begin testing efficacy. None has yet passed the final phase 3 trial by showing that it actually slows cognitive decline and preserves the ability to perform everyday functions. Over the years the field has proved so costly that AstraZeneca and GSK have cut back research; Pfizer has bowed out entirely.\n\nTo counter this trend, the FDA is weighing whether to approve dementia drugs based on their effect on biomarkers: signatures of genes or proteins that imply the presence and severity of a disease. For Alzheimer's, this is a lower hurdle than the current cognitive-function endpoints. But biomarkers are not the same as symptoms, so the risk is that costly new drugs will be approved that do not actually work. Avastin (bevacizumab), which was approved for breast cancer using alternative endpoints, turned out to be ineffective.\n\nA few duds may be worth the risk if overall more good medicines reach patients. Pharma firms certainly think so. They have welcomed Mr Gottlieb and his ideas with \"almost uniform pleasure and happiness\", says John Maraganore, the boss of a biotech company called Alnylam who also chairs BIO, an industry group.\n\nThat is unsurprising -- lower development costs should mean higher returns. What is less clear how much these savings will help the industry's giants, whose research-and-development efforts are spread thinly across many fields, without deeper changes to their business models.\n\nEven today inexpensive drug development is perfectly possible. If you understand the biology and can identify the patients who will benefit from your drug, Mr Gottlieb says, trials can already be shorter and cheaper. Midsized and biggish bio-pharma firms, for instance, have done far better than the very largest ones. According to Deloitte, biotech companies such as Celgene, Gilead, AbbVie and Biogen enjoyed returns of around 12% last year. Many of them have already benefited from past efforts by the FDA to lubricate the approval of potential breakthrough drugs for cancer and some other diseases. But they are also much less diversified than the likes of Pfizer or GSK. It may be that this narrower focus makes them more efficient.\n\nIt therefore remains to be seen if Mr Gottlieb's approach can improve efficiency and innovation across the industry. His tenure may be judged a success if he manages to slow their decline. The rest is up to the industry itself.",

                "title": "Why tariffs on steel and aluminium are easier said than done",
                "body": "HISTORY will rhyme on March 23rd, when Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium imports are due to come into force. Several previous presidents, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, also used tariffs in an attempt to protect America's steel producers from foreign competition. (There are historical echoes, too, in Mr Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a range of Chinese imports; in the 1980s Japan was the target.) A rhyme is not a repeat. But past experience is not encouraging.\n\nThe central problem for America's policymakers is that trade is like water. Block its flow in one place and pressure builds elsewhere. When many countries are covered by tariffs, trade may simply be diverted through those countries that are let off the hook. Importers will howl for exemptions. As a result, whatever the Trump administration's broader ambitions with respect to trade, bellicose unilateralism will make them harder to achieve.\n\nIn 1982 America browbeat the European Community, the forerunner of the European Union, into limiting its steel exports to America. But compensating flows from other countries were so great that America's steel imports increased overall. Exemptions for Canada, Mexico, Israel and Jordan when George W. Bush imposed tariffs on steel imports in 2002 allowed the value of their exports to America to surge by 53%. Canadian and Mexican exporters, who are exempt from the latest tariffs, already account for a big share of American imports (see chart 1). They could clean up.\n\nIn an attempt to stop such substitution Robert Lighthizer, the United States Trade Representative, is said to be offering to spare America's allies from the tariffs if they ensure their exports to America do not exceed the level in 2017. On March 21st he hinted that negotiations could last until late April. But such a deal would break the World Trade Organisation's rules, and put bureaucrats, not markets, in charge of allocating export rights.\n\nWhen different countries receive different treatment, circumventing tariffs looks more tempting. Under Mr Obama, America imposed hefty anti-dumping duties on imports of Chinese steel. Inflows from China duly fell, but those from Vietnam surged. America's Commerce Department recently concluded that some steel imports, supposedly from Vietnam, actually originated in China. Mr Trump expects Canada and Mexico to ensure they do not become conduits for steel originating elsewhere. But that may be hard, especially for the generic, less processed stuff.\n\nMr Trump's tariff barriers are broader than Mr Obama's were. That makes circumvention harder -- but also means importers will squeal more loudly for exemptions. After Mr Bush's steel safeguards were applied to the EU and Japan in 2002, companies cut off from their suppliers expended much time and money pleading their case in Washington. Eventually 1,022 exemptions were granted, over 90% of them to firms importing from Japan and the EU. This time, the Trump administration expects to spend 24,000 worker-hours processing 4,500 requests to exempt steel products and 1,500 pleas for aluminium. Lobbyists are rubbing their hands.\n\nMetal consumers will also seek to be spared pricier inputs, which can threaten jobs. In 2002 the employers of Gordon Jones, a steel-drum loader, were thwacked with a 30% tariff. \"They say that these tariffs are supposed to help workers, to save steel jobs, but what about me?\" Mr Jones asked a congressional hearing. More such complaints will come, since steel-consuming sectors account for far more American jobs than steel production (see chart 2).\n\nTariffs are not Mr Trump's only trade policy. As well as trying to rewrite the North American Free-Trade Agreement, he is trying to curb China's trade power. Whatever the merits of these aims, the new tariffs will make it harder to rally allies to his side. \"Issues like this have a way of overtaking any meeting or any discussion you're having,\" says Wendy Cutler, a trade negotiator under Mr Obama.\n\nBill Brock, who was the United States Trade Representative under Reagan, recalls negotiating trade restrictions with Japan in the 1980s. Even amid tensions, he remembers treating Japanese negotiators with respect, knowing that harm to one part of the trade relationship could affect others. Tariffs are \"single-shot measures to deal with single issues\", he warns, and risk complicating efforts to resolve broader ones. \"Of all the stupid self-defeating things we can imagine, a trade war is the top of the list.\"",

                "title": "Wall Street looks overvalued",
                "body": "FEW measures of stockmarket valuation are as controversial as the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, or CAPE. American equities have looked expensive on this measure for most of the past 20 years, which is why many bulls tend to dismiss its usefulness. It is pretty clear that the CAPE does not help investors to time the market.\n\nBut a new paper* from Research Affiliates, a fund-management group, explains why many criticisms are overblown. The strongest case for the measure is that a higher ratio tends to be associated with lower long-term returns. A study of 12 national markets shows that a 5% increase in the CAPE, from 20 to 21, say, tends on average to reduce the total ten-year expected return by four percentage points.\n\nThe attraction of the CAPE is that it smooths out the vicissitudes of the profit cycle. In a recession, profits can plunge even faster than share prices. So if you look only at the ratio of a share price and the previous year's profits, the market can look very expensive. Since it is a moving average of profits over ten years, the CAPE is less volatile. Past peaks have coincided with the top of bull markets, as in 1929 and 2000 (see chart). It is now well above its long-term average.\n\nCritics say that the high value of the CAPE can be easily explained. One argument is that profits have shifted to a permanently higher level. Accounting standards have changed and modern companies, such as Google and Facebook, have more market power. Another line of argument is that, regardless of the level of profits, valuations should be higher. Demographic changes mean that baby-boomers are piling into equities as they prepare to retire. Low real interest rates mean future profits, when discounted, are worth more today. General economic and financial risks have fallen.\n\nThe paper tries to tackle those arguments. The authors accept that the current level of profits is high. But they do not believe that this means future profits growth will necessarily be strong. There is a tendency to revert to the mean. Historically, rapid growth in profits over a ten-year period is associated with slower growth over the next decade. Furthermore, the high level of profits is linked to slow growth in wages. That has led to a populist backlash, which could result in higher taxes on companies or restrictions on trade.\n\nThe demographic argument also has its flaws. The baby-boomers are already in the process of retiring, which means they will be running down their savings pots rather than building them up. Furthermore, the ageing population means that the workforce will grow more slowly in future. Other things being equal, that will be bad for both economic growth and profits.\n\nAs for the impact of low interest rates, a lot depends on why rates are low. If they are depressed because central banks expect slow economic growth, that is not great for equities. Arguments based on low macroeconomic volatility tend to be hostages to fortune; there was much talk of the \"great moderation\" in the early 2000s, just before the financial crisis hit.\n\nFinally, other countries also have low interest rates, reduced volatility and ageing populations, without their markets trading on anything like the CAPE that Wall Street does. America's ratio is 32.8, whereas Canada is trading on a CAPE of 20. Germany is on 19 and Britain on 14. All are trading near their historical averages; in contrast, Wall Street is at double its usual level. America may have more powerful companies, but that is a very large gap to attribute to a single factor. Alternative measures of stockmarket valuation, which compare share prices with corporate sales or asset values, also show that Wall Street looks expensive, relative to history, but that other countries (particularly emerging markets) look cheap.\n\nPlenty of sceptics will fail to be convinced by this reasoning. They will point out that the American CAPE has been consistently over 20 since 2011, well above its historic average of 16.8. Yet the markets have continued to perform well, admittedly helped by a huge amount of stimulus from the central banks.\n\nBut they should consider what their optimism implies for the future. American pension funds are expecting returns of 7-8% from their portfolios. That would require some combination of decent economic growth, continued low interest rates, a bigger share of profits in GDP and even higher valuations. If you believe in all that, this columnist has some crypto-currencies he would like to sell you.",

                "body": "TO GAUGE an issue's importance, a guest list is a good place to start. The one for a conference in Brussels on March 22nd to discuss the European Union's \"action plan\" on sustainable finance features heavy-hitters including Emmanuel Macron, France's president, and Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York who campaigns on climate change. Given that sustainable finance is well-established, what action does the EU think is needed?\n\nInvesting with an eye to environmental or social issues, not just financial returns, has become mainstream in the past decade. According to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA), $23trn, or 26% of all assets under management in 2016, were in \"socially responsible investments\" that take account of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. New asset classes have sprung up. According to SEB, a Swedish bank, the issuance of green bonds, the proceeds of which are invested in environmental projects, reached $163bn in 2017, up from less than $500m in 2008.\n\nYet standards are a hodgepodge. Many certification and evaluation tools cover just one asset class; competing methodologies abound. It is here that the European Commission, and an advisory group of experts, sees a role for public policy. One aim is to create a framework within which to classify the sorts of activities that qualify as sustainable investments, and against which to benchmark existing standards. The commission proposes setting up an EU labelling scheme for green bonds.\n\nIt also plans to draft a law by mid-2018 to require all asset managers to consider ESG factors when giving advice, and to explain how they are doing so to their investors. The European Fund and Asset Management Association, an industry group, worries that this would turn ESG investing into a box-ticking exercise. But Christian Thimann of AXA, an insurer, and the chair of the expert group, argues that many financial firms still ignore clients' environmental or social preferences. Compelling them to tick boxes would be better than nothing, he thinks.\n\nAnother of the proposals has drawn fiercer criticism: to loosen capital requirements for banks' green investments. That goes against a decade's worth of financial regulation, which has sought to bolster banks' capital buffers. Even the commission's expert group seems dubious, writing that the proposal does not \"seem to be quantitatively grounded\". (The commission insists any changes will take financial stability into account.)\n\nHowever the debate on capital requirements is resolved, the commission's plans look likely to boost sustainable finance in Europe. That will not turn the global financial system green on its own. But it will show how financial rules can be harnessed for environmental ends.",

                "title": "The digitisation of trade's paper trail may be at hand",
                "body": "THE enormous ships steaming into and out of the world's ports do not only carry cargo. They also represent paperwork: bills of lading (BOLs), packing lists, letters of credit, insurance policies, orders, invoices, sanitary certificates, certificates of origin. Maersk, the world's biggest container-shipping line, found that a shipment of avocados from Mombasa to Rotterdam in 2014 entailed more than 200 communications involving 30 parties. A giant container vessel may be associated with hundreds of thousands of documents. \"A Venetian merchant...would recognise some of our documentation,\" says John Laurens, head of global transaction services at DBS, a Singaporean bank.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, the costs of processing trade documents are as much as a fifth of those of shifting goods. Removing administrative blockages in supply chains could do more to boost international trade than eliminating tariffs. Full digitisation of trade paperwork, reckons the UN, could raise Asia-Pacific countries' exports by $257bn a year.\n\nAfter years of talk about digitisation, such a shift may at last be taking place. Banks, insurers, shippers, their corporate customers and governments, abetted by technology companies, are combining forces to digitise the paper trail. Lots of projects are under way, building platforms which the various actors can use. Several are based on the blockchain, or distributed-ledger technology.\n\nUsing blockchain means that everyone with access to a ledger -- for that consignment of avocados, say -- sees the same, up-to-date version of the truth. Flows of goods, information and money are thus aligned. The ledger would contain the purchase order, certification that the fruit came from Kenya, its eligibility for a concessionary European tariff, an updated record of its physical condition, phytosanitary certificates, the BoL and so on. An embedded \"smart contract\" could trigger payment, in full or in part, once certain conditions were met. All sorts of details could be included, says Tyler Mulvihill of Viant, a blockchain startup, such as the provenance of fish or drugs, or a mining firm's environmental credentials.\n\nIn January Maersk and IBM, a computing giant, unveiled a blockchain-based joint venture aimed at digitising the supply chain from end to end. Big companies, ports and the American and Dutch customs authorities have carried out trial projects. The platform will be open to all (and run independently of Maersk): the hope is that logistics firms, financial companies and other shippers will join.\n\nTradeIX, a fintech startup, R3, another blockchain firm, and several banks are testing another open platform, Marco Polo. Last year eight European banks and IBM unveiled we.trade, a trade-finance conduit for small and medium enterprises. They expect to deploy it in the second quarter of 2018. This month Evergreen, a big Taiwanese container line, teamed up with Bolero, a provider of electronic BoLs. Bolero and essDOCS, its rival, have offered electronic BoLs for several years, but have made limited headway. Similarly, electronic letters of credit have been available for some time, but have not been widely used.\n\nGo-ahead governments are also encouraging digitisation. Singapore is building a National Trade Platform (not based on blockchain), involving banks, shippers and technology firms. It will bring \"the whole trade ecosystem onto a single platform\", says Satvinder Singh of International Enterprise Singapore. Hong Kong is creating a trade-finance blockchain platform. In November the two Asian trading hubs said they would create a cross-border platform, the Global Trade Connectivity Network, which is due to go live next year.\n\nPart of the gain from digitisation lies in cutting costs. Banks employ armies of people in back offices, looking for discrepancies that may betoken fraud or honest error. Digitisation should also free the flow of finance to firms starved of it, partly by helping banks' compliance with anti-money-laundering rules. The Asian Development Bank has put the gap between available trade finance and demand at $1.5trn.\n\nThomas Olsen of Bain & Company, a firm of consultants, thinks that digitisation could also slow the trend away from formal letters of credit, which now account for about 15% of trade finance, down from half in 1970. \"Open account\" trade, in which exporters send goods to importers and trust that their invoices will be paid, now accounts for the bulk. That is fine for big corporations and companies familiar with one another; less so for SMEs. \"There would be more risk mitigation if it weren't such a pain,\" Mr Olsen says.\n\nPaper wait\n\nInstitutional obstacles to digitisation loom larger than technical ones. For instance, a UN convention adopted in 2008 extends the recognition of electronic documents. But to come into force it must be ratified by 20 countries. Only four have: Cameroon, Congo, Spain and Togo. Upgraded industry standards are essential. The International Chamber of Commerce, a standard-setter for trade since 1919, established a group last June to co-ordinate work on trade finance. A new initiative based in Singapore, Digital Standards for Trade, may also help push things along.\n\nBain's Mr Olsen thinks the co-ordination problem will not stop progress. \"It's a misconception that a lot of people have to leap at the same time,\" he says. He expects competing blockchain initiatives to develop piecemeal. Some platforms will become utilities; some will specialise; some will fade. Paperwork will not vanish. But at a difficult time for traders, one burden should become a lot lighter.",

                "title": "What if China corners the cobalt market?",
                "body": "COBALT derives its name from Kobold, a mischievous German goblin who, according to legend, lurks underground. For centuries it vexed medieval miners by lookinglike a valuable ore that subsequently turned into worthless -- and sometimes noxious -- rubble. Once again it is threatening to cause trouble, this time in the growing market for batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), each of which uses about 10kg of cobalt. The source of mischief is no longer in Germany, though, but in China.\n\nIt is widely known that more than half of the world's cobalt reserves and production are in one dangerously unstable country, the Democratic Republic of Congo. What is less well known is that four-fifths of the cobalt sulphates and oxides used to make the all-important cathodes for lithium-ion batteries are refined in China. (Much of the other 20% is processed in Finland, but its raw material, too, comes from a mine in Congo, majority-owned by a Chinese firm, China Molybdenum.)\n\nOn March 14th concerns about China's grip on Congo's cobalt production deepened when GEM, a Chinese battery maker, said it would acquire a third of the cobalt shipped by Glencore, the world's biggest producer of the metal, between 2018 and 2020 -- equivalent to almost half of the world's 110,000-tonne production in 2017. This is likely to add momentum to a rally that has pushed the price of cobalt up from an average of $26,500 a tonne in 2016 to above $90,000 a tonne.\n\nIt is not known whether non-Chinese battery, EV or consumer-electronics manufacturers have done similar, unannounced deals with Glencore. But Sam Jaffe of Cairn Energy Research Advisors, a consultancy, says it will be a severe blow to some firms. He likens the outcome of the deal to a game of musical chairs in which Chinese battery manufacturers have taken all but one of the seats. \"Everybody else is frantically looking for that last empty chair.\"\n\nMr Jaffe doubts the cobalt grab is an effort by Chinese firms to corner or manipulate the market for speculative ends. Instead, he says, they are likely to be driven by a \"desperate need\" to fulfil China's ambitious plans to step up production of EVs.\n\nOthers see it more ominously. George Heppel of CRU, a consultancy, says that, in addition to GEM sweeping up such a sizeable chunk of Glencore's output, China Moly may eventually ship its Congo cobalt home rather than to Finland, giving China as much as 95% of the cobalt-chemicals market. \"A lot of our clients are South Korean and Japanese tech firms and it's a big concern of theirs that so much of the world's cobalt sulphate comes from China.\" Memories are still fresh of a maritime squabble in 2010, during which China restricted exports of rare-earth metals vital to Japanese tech firms. China produces about 85% of the world's rare earths.\n\nFew analysts expect the cobalt market to soften soon. Production in Congo is likely to increase in the next few years, but some investment may be deterred by a recent five-fold leap in royalties on cobalt. Investment elsewhere is limited because cobalt is almost always mined alongside copper or nickel. Even at current prices, the quantities needed are not enough to justify production for cobalt alone.\n\nBut demand could explode if EVs surge in popularity. Mr Heppel says that, though most cobalt is currently mined for batteries in smartphones and for superalloys inside jet engines (see chart), its use for EVs could jump from 9,000 tonnes in 2017 to 107,000 tonnes in 2026.\n\nThe resulting higher prices would eventually unlock new sources of supply. But already non-Chinese battery manufacturers are looking for ways to protect themselves from potential shortages. Their best answer to date is the other \"goblin metal\" closely associated with cobalt, nickel, whose name comes from a German spirit closely related to Old Nick.\n\nThe materials most commonly used for cathodes in EV batteries are a combination of nickel, manganese and cobalt known as NMC, and one of nickel, cobalt and aluminium known as NCA. As cobalt has become pricier and scarcer, some battery makers have produced cobalt-lite cathodes by raising the nickel content -- to as much as eight times the amount of cobalt. This allows the battery to run longer on a single charge, but makes it harder to manufacture and more prone to burst into flames. The trick is to get the balance right.\n\nStrangely, nickel has not had anything like cobalt's price rise. Nor do the Chinese appear to covet it. Oliver Ramsbottom of McKinsey, a consultancy, says the reason for this relative indifference dates back to the commodities supercycle in 2000-12, when Indonesia and the Philippines ramped up production of class-2 nickel -- in particular nickel pig iron, a lower-cost ingredient of stainless steel -- until the bubble burst. The subsequent excess capacity and stock build-up caused nickel prices to plummet from $29,000 a tonne in 2011 to below $10,000 a tonne last year.\n\nAs yet, the demand for high-quality nickel suitable for EVs has not boosted production. Output of Class-1 nickel for EVs was only 35,000 tonnes last year, out of total nickel production of 2.1m tonnes. But by 2025 McKinsey expects EV-related nickel demand to rise 16-fold to 550,000 tonnes.\n\nIn theory, the best way to ensure sufficient supplies of both nickel and cobalt would be for prices to rise enough to make mining them together more profitable. But that would mean more expensive batteries, and thus electric vehicles. Only a goblin would relish such a conundrum.",

                "title": "Can't hardly wait",
                "body": "LIKE teenagers, central bankers long to feel normal. For many of them (the central bankers, that is), the past decade has been an unusually angst-ridden one. They stumbled through it, confused by the way their policymaking bodies were changing, unsure what to do with their interest rates, embarrassed by their burgeoning balance-sheets. Teenagers often seek to quell their anxiety and insecurity by imitating behaviour they regard as normal. So too for central bankers.\n\nBut the desire to normalise policy, and leave crisis-era measures behind, could distract central bankers from their main goals, namely to support growth and control inflation. The Bank for International Settlements, a global club for central bankers, recently urged officials not to let market jitters discourage them from raising interest rates. Yet at worst, chasing some elusive notion of normal could put the global recovery at risk.\n\nWhat central bankers mean by normalising policy is clear enough. As Peter Praet, the chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), explained in a recent speech, to normalise is to end their reliance on \"unconventional\" or \"non-standard\" tools such as quantitative easing (QE, the printing of new money to buy assets). It means returning to a familiar world in which adjustments to interest rates are their main policy lever.\n\nCentral bankers make no secret of their longing to return to this normality. When, in his first monetary-policy report to Congress, Jerome Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, praised his predecessor, Janet Yellen, he focused on her achievements in just this area. \"During her term,\" he said, \"Federal Reserve policymakers began to normalise both the level of interest rates and the size of the balance-sheet.\" (On March 21st Mr Powell made his own contribution to the effort, as the Fed raised its benchmark rate by 0.25%.)\n\nBut what makes one era the standard by which all others are judged normal or abnormal? Older central bankers cut their teeth during the 1970s and 1980s when giants like Paul Volcker, a former Fed chairman, used double-digit interest rates to tame inflation. Younger ones began their professional lives during the 1990s, when Alan Greenspan and his peers manipulated their economies with a deft rate hike here, a cunning cut there.\n\nAfter the financial crisis, policy rates plummeted to near zero, forcing central bankers to experiment with QE, negative interest rates and promises to leave rates at rock-bottom far into the future. Since the crisis, asset accumulation in rich economies, which still continues in the euro area and Japan, swelled central banks' balance-sheets by trillions of dollars.\n\nThis combination is more than a relic of the financial crisis, however. Rather, it increasingly looks like a persistent feature of the world economy. Across rich countries, central banks' benchmark interest rates have been only about 2%, on average, over the past 20 years (see chart). The Fed hopes to raise its benchmark policy rate to 3.5% by 2020, according to its most recent projections, clearing that low bar, but with little to spare.\n\nSince rates usually fall by much more than three percentage points during downturns, the Fed's projections imply that \"unconventional\" tools such as asset purchases will be needed again in future. For other central banks, normal is even further out of reach. The Bank of England hopes to reach a policy rate of just over 1% by 2021. The ECB is still in the process of weaning its economies off asset purchases, currently set at €30bn ($37bn) a month. Japan has been living in an abnormal world for roughly a quarter of a century.\n\nAm I bovvered?\n\nAll this makes talk of normalisation perplexing. It might be bravado intended to conceal uncertainty about how to behave -- another teenage habit. Or central bankers may be pinning their hopes on global economic conditions returning to something more like supposedly \"normal\" periods in the past. But central-bank policy rates are low because interest rates around the world are low. Those rates reflect a world in which economic growth in advanced economies is slower than it was in the post-war decades, in which there is more capital sloshing around than governments or firms can easily put to good use, and in which inflation is very low and stable.\n\nNone of this seems likely to change soon. Slow productivity gains and ageing populations weigh on advanced economies. An unanticipated borrowing binge by America's government will soak up some global savings. But it has not yet raised yields on long-term Treasury bonds from their historically low levels. In the absence of a sudden and dramatic change in global conditions, central bankers will be forced to abandon plans to normalise policy -- hopefully before, but potentially after, raising rates above levels their economies can tolerate.\n\nSome factors pushing down global interest rates, such as slow growth and excess capital, depress the real (ie, adjusted for inflation) rate of interest. Yet the policy rates that central banks control are nominal. Inflation is a wedge between the two. Consequently, higher inflation would create an environment in which central bankers could set policy rates well above zero even as real interest rates stayed at their current lows.\n\nFor just that reason, some economists have proposed a change in central-bank targets. Among their number are former Fed officials, including Narayana Kocherlakota, who has recommended an increase in the central bank's inflation target, and Ben Bernanke, who prefers a flexible approach that would give central banks the freedom to allow inflation to rise temporarily higher than the current target permits.\n\nEach idea has its merits. Neither could be described as a return to normal. But as the rare self-confident, trend-setting teenager realises, it is possible, and indeed often preferable, to come to your own understanding of what normal means.",

                "title": "Europeans fret that Chinese investment is a security risk",
                "body": "\"WE ARE not naive free traders. Europe must always defend its strategic interests,\" said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, last year as he introduced plans to screen foreign investment into the European Union. America has had such rules since the 1970s; they are set to tighten further. The EU used to be more relaxed about acquisitions by foreigners. Now it too is toughening up.\n\nThe target is China, whose firms have been on a shopping spree (see chart). Purchases of fripperies such as football clubs and hotels have been curbed by the Chinese authorities, but investment continues to flow into technology and infrastructure, notes James Zhan of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\n\nSeveral European countries, including Germany and Italy, have extended investment-screening rules beyond energy and transport infrastructure to cover technology deemed important for public security, for example in telecoms. Chinese involvement in building Hinkley Point C, a nuclear-power plant, led Britain to tighten its rules. Last month France's government blocked the sale of its share of Toulouse airport to a Chinese consortium, which would have gained a majority stake.\n\nEuropean lawmakers suspect that purchases by private Chinese investors are an extension of their government's \"Made in China 2025\" strategy, which aims at overtaking Western innovation, says Franck Proust, a French member of the European Parliament. Attitudes have soured most in Germany. A turning-point came in 2016, says Cora Jungbluth of Bertelsmann Stiftung, a think-tank, when a Chinese firm acquired KUKA, a German robotics firm, for €4.5bn ($5bn). Critics fumed that, even as Chinese companies gained Western know-how, German ones were facing discrimination in China. Last year Germany, with France and Italy, pushed for an EU-wide regime that could block acquisitions in sectors where European firms did not have reciprocal access in China.\n\nMr Juncker's proposals, which are now before the European Parliament, are more timid. They allow the commission to issue non-binding opinions on foreign acquisitions, and encourage EU members to share information on the possible effect on public security. They represent progress, says Mr Proust, considering that more than half of EU members do not even have a framework in place to assess such deals. But he would prefer something harder-edged.\n\nNot every EU member feels this way. China's Belt and Road Initiative, which involves it underwriting billions of dollars of infrastructure investment along the old Silk Road linking it with Europe, is regarded by some southern and central European countries as a source of much-needed investment. Other EU countries worry that such eagerness could be exploited to divide the continent. Awkwardly, austerity measures imposed as a condition of bail-outs during the euro crisis contributed to Chinese influence. Privatisations intended to help stabilise wobbly public finances mean that the Chinese state now controls Piraeus, a Greek port, and owns the largest stake in Portugal's electricity grid.\n\nThe Nordic countries and the Netherlands meanwhile argue that stricter rules on Chinese investment could inflame trade tensions, even as the global trade environment worsens. Business groups fear that tighter screening could be used as a cover for protectionism. International organisations, including UNCTAD, warn that it could scare off investors and harm economic growth. A less starry-eyed approach to foreign investment brings risks, too.",

                "body": "EVERY year in Singapore 1% of pupils in the third year of primary school bring home an envelope headed \"On government service\". Inside is an invitation to the city-state's Gifted Education Programme. To receive the overture, pupils must ace tests in maths, English and \"general ability\". If their parents accept the offer, the children are taught using a special curriculum.\n\nSingapore's approach is emblematic of the traditional form of \"gifted\" education, one that uses intelligence tests with strict thresholds to identify children with seemingly innate ability. Yet in many countries it is being overhauled in two main ways. The first is that educationists are using a broader range of methods to identify highly intelligent children, especially those from poor households. The second is an increasing focus on fostering the attitudes and personality traits found in successful people in an array of disciplines -- including those who did not ace intelligence tests.\n\nNew research lies behind these shifts. It shows that countries which do not get the most from their best and brightest face big economic costs. The research also suggests that the nature-or-nurture debate is a false dichotomy. Intelligence is highly heritable and perhaps the best predictor of success. But it is far from the only characteristic that matters for future eminence.\n\nThe study of gifted children goes back at least a century. In 1916 Leta Hollingworth -- a psychologist whose doctorate refuted the idea that women struggled at science because of destabilising menstrual cycles -- began some of the earliest research on children with high IQs. Two decades later she started work at the Speyer School in New York City, one of the first schools with a challenging curriculum for these pupils.\n\nLike, really smart\n\nIQ tests have attracted furious criticism. Speaking for the sceptics, Christopher Hitchens, a journalist, argued that: \"There is...an unusually high and consistent correlation between the stupidity of a given person and [his] propensity to be impressed by the measurement of IQ.\" Like any assessment, IQ tests are not perfect. But as Stuart Ritchie of the University of Edinburgh points out in \"Intelligence\", researchers in cognitive science agree that general intelligence -- not book-learning but the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly and so on -- is an identifiable and important attribute which can be measured by IQ tests.\n\nJust how important is suggested by the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), founded in 1971. Julian Stanley, then a psychologist at Johns Hopkins University, over 25 years recruited 5,000 precocious children, each of whom had intelligence-test scores in early adolescence high enough to gain entry to university.\n\nResearch into how these children did in adulthood has emerged over the past two decades. Of the SMPY participants who scored among the top 0.5% for their age-group in maths and verbal tests, 30% went on to earn a doctorate, versus 1% of Americans as a whole. These children were also much more likely to have high incomes and to file patents.\n\nThere is variation even among the top scorers (see chart). This runs contrary to the idea, proposed by some psychologists, that there is a ceiling to IQ, after which its influence wanes. Of the top 0.01% of children, 50% went on to earn a PhD, medical or law degree.\n\nFindings from studies led by Ian Deary of the University of Edinburgh, meanwhile, undermine the idea that gifted children go on to become disproportionately troubled. There are of course exceptions. But on average having a high IQ as a child is associated with better physical and mental health as an adult. Being moved up a school-year, as many are, tends to do them little harm. SMPY pupils who skipped at least one grade were 60% more likely to file patents than those who did not.\n\nOfficials often cite the SMPY as the inspiration for the creation in 2014 of two specialist maths schools in England. Based on the Kolmogorov School in Moscow, these schools accept only those pupils who excel in maths at exams at age 16. In January the government said it wanted to open more as part of its \"industrial strategy\", a plan to boost Britain's woeful productivity growth. Linking gifted education to economic growth may horrify some people. But it has long seemed like common sense in countries without many natural resources, such as Singapore.\n\nSadly, however, the potential of poor bright children is often wasted. In December Raj Chetty of Stanford University and colleagues published a paper lamenting \"lost Einsteins\". They found that children who score in the top 5% of standardised tests in the third year of primary school are many times more likely than the other 95% to file patents in later life. But the likelihood is still much greater among smart kids from rich families.\n\nPhilippe Aghion of the London School of Economics and colleagues found similar results in Finland. Those with high IQs but from poor backgrounds were especially at risk of not fulfilling their potential. That is not only unfair. It also implies that a lot of talent, which could have been harnessed to cure diseases or design better toasters, is being squandered.\n\nThere are many reasons why poor-but-smart children struggle. Yet gifted schemes have often not helped. When applications are voluntary, they come mostly from rich or pushy parents. In New York City, for example, tutoring companies often charge $200 per hour to help four-year-olds prepare for admissions tests for gifted-education programmes starting in kindergarten. Tutoring may temporarily bump up scores by only a few points, but that can make all the difference. In 2015 70% of pupils admitted to such programmes were white or Asian, though they represent just 30% of the school-age population.\n\nIt helps when schools test every child, rather than rely on parents to put children forward. In a paper from 2015, economists David Card and Laura Giuliano found that when a school district in Florida introduced universal screening for its gifted-education scheme, admissions increased by 180% among poor children, 130% among Hispanics and 80% for black pupils. (Admissions among white children fell.)\n\nSome programmes go further. Miami-Dade, America's fourth-largest school district, uses universal screening. It has a lower IQ threshold for poor children or those for whom English is a second language, so long as they show other signs of promise, such as learning English quickly or high scores in other tests. In Miami-Dade 6.9% of black pupils are in the gifted programme, versus 2.4% and 3.6% in Florida as a whole and nationwide respectively.\n\nIn America 48 out of 50 states have programmes for brainy children, but in the decade before 2013, 24 redefined them, typically ditching the \"gifted\" label in favour of \"high-ability\". Today no state relies on a single IQ score to select students. In his book \"Ungifted\" Scott Barry Kaufman of the University of Pennsylvania calls this a \"huge change from just 20 years ago\". European countries have seen similar shifts.\n\nSchool districts are also testing for other attributes, including spatial ability (ie, the capacity to generate, manipulate and store visual images). Jonathan Wai, a psychologist, notes that spatial ability as a child is strongly linked to achievement in science and technology in later life. The Finnish study also found this. But it is less correlated with income during childhood than are verbal and mathematical scores. So testing for it gives talented poor children a better chance to shine, says Mr Wai.\n\nThe power of persistence\n\nOther researchers worry, though, that no matter how good the selection process, relying only on measures of intelligence will fail to find children with the potential to excel in adult life. Psychologists such as Mr Kaufman argue that there are many more possible paths to success in adulthood than often assumed, and that education must do more to foster attributes such as passion, determination and creativity.\n\nWhether termed \"grit\", \"task-motivation\" or \"conscientiousness\", more psychologists are emphasising the role of persistence. \"As much as talent counts, effort counts twice,\" writes Angela Duckworth of the University of Pennsylvania, in \"Grit\", published in 2016. For Anders Ericsson of Florida State University, deliberate practice over a long period (popularly understood as 10,000 hours) is critical.\n\nSuch statements are simplistic. But few researchers disagree with the idea that talent requires development, and that should involve promoting hard work as well as intelligence. Gifted programmes from Singapore's to England's specialist maths schools make it a priority to help children pursue their passion. Robotics prodigies, for example, may be given the opportunity to shadow university students.\n\nThere is evidence that aspects of gifted education should influence education more broadly. Project Bright Idea, developed at Duke University, saw 10,000 typical nursery and primary-school pupils taught using methods often reserved for brainier kids -- fostering high expectations, complex problem-solving and cultivating meta-cognition (or \"thinking about thinking\"). Nearly every one of them went on to do much better on tests than similar peers.\n\nSome researchers go further. Carol Dweck of Stanford University emphasises children's \"mindset\" (the beliefs they have about learning). Children who think they can change their intelligence have a \"growth mindset\", she says. Those who believe they cannot do much to change their \"D\" grades have a \"fixed\" one. According to Ms Dweck, children who adopt the first mindset quickly start to do better in tests.\n\nTeaching methods that draw on Ms Dweck's work are now found in schools across Britain and America. The World Bank is running trials of the approach in countries such as Peru. One technique, for example, might see a pupil told to add the word \"yet\" to their statements, as in \"I can't do long-division -- yet.\"\n\nHowever, a recent meta-analysis suggests that interventions based on growth-mindset are less effective than their hype implies. The study suggests that the effects of interventions drawing on the idea have no effect on the typical student's outcomes and at best a small effect on those of poorer students. Other psychologists have struggled to replicate Ms Dweck's results.\n\nThe idea that intelligence is highly malleable also jars with research on its heritability. Studies led by Robert Plomin of King's College London suggest that roughly 50% of the variance in IQ scores is due to genetic differences. These findings do not dismiss the role of nurture; hard work and social background matter. But they undermine the idea that supreme intelligence can simply be willed into being.\n\nA broader approach to gifted education ensures that more children reach their potential. But the evidence suggests that, so long as they are open to everyone, IQ tests still have a vital role to play. To find lost Einsteins, you have to look for them.",

                "body": "EACH new electric vehicle (EV) uses about 10kg (22 lbs) of cobalt. More than half of the world's reserves and production of the metal are in one dangerously unstable country, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Moreover, four-fifths of the cobalt sulphates and oxides used to make the cathodes for lithium-ion batteries are refined in China. China has already proven willing to restrict exports of rare-earth metals to foreign firms. And although China is not thought to be cornering or manipulating the market for cobalt, growing global demand has still sent the the element's price soaring.\n\nNon-Chinese battery manufacturers have already begun looking for ways to protect themselves from potential shortages. Their best answer to date is another metal closely associated with cobalt: nickel. Some firms are now producing cobalt-lite cathodes, by raising the nickel content to as much as eight times the amount of cobalt. This allows the battery to run longer on a single charge -- but also increases the risk it will burst into flames. So far, the price of nickel has remained flat. But according to McKinsey, a consultancy, by 2025 EV-related demand for nickel is expected to rise 16-fold.",

                "body": "THE American guest in ill-fitting clothes was a curiously bedraggled sight next to his sharp-suited French hosts. But when Steve Bannon took to the stage as the surprise invité at the National Front congress in the city of Lille earlier this month, he stole the show. \"Let them call you racists. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists,\" declared Donald Trump's former chief strategist. \"Wear it as a badge of honour!\" As each of his phrases was translated into French, the star-struck audience applauded. Fresh from meeting populists and nationalists from Germany and Italy, Mr Bannon hailed the rise of a global movement and told them: \"History is on our side.\"\n\nIn one sense, Mr Bannon chose an odd time to drop in on France. Marine Le Pen's movement, which she now wants to rename Rassemblement National (National Rally), has been in disarray ever since she lost the presidential election last year to Emmanuel Macron and secured only eight parliamentary seats. From Rome to Warsaw, populists remain a potent force in Europe. France's muted FN stands out as something of an exception.\n\nYet the American's visit to France was a sobering reminder that any relief felt by Europe's liberal democrats at Mr Macron's victory still needs to be tempered. Fully 10.6m French voters backed Ms Le Pen in the presidential run-off. Identity politics have not disappeared. Mr Bannon's appearance in Lille also underlined the global appeal of nativist populism and its long history. Indeed, America's attempts in the 1890s and early 1900s to deal with an earlier version throw up some curious and instructive parallels with France, and Europe, today.\n\nWhen William Jennings Bryan gave his famous \"Cross of Gold\" speech at the Democratic national convention in Chicago in 1896, it was more than just an attack on the gold standard. Evoking \"the avenging wrath of an indignant people\", the Nebraskan former congressman, who went on to become the joint Democratic and Populist presidential candidate, was also decrying \"the idle holders of idle capital\" and what later became known as trickle-down economics and the plight of the \"toiling masses\", much as Ms Le Pen does today. Bryan built his populist movement around the little person -- the farmers on the prairies -- against the east-coast capitalists and their political cronies. Ms Le Pen frames her politics as a campaign for \"the forgotten\" against the rootless capitalist elite, and to recover sovereignty.\n\nIt was Theodore Roosevelt, though, who became president in 1901 at the age of 42, and devised the most effective American response. In his \"Square Deal\", and later Progressive reforms, the trustbusting TR sought to take on the robber barons, regulate the railroads and smooth the rough edges of capitalism by bringing about social reform. In doing so, he helped to see off the populist threat from Bryan, secured a second term in 1904, and laid the ground for much new thinking about social policy.\n\nThe parallels with Mr Macron, who defeated Ms Le Pen at the age of 39, are striking. Like Roosevelt, Mr Macron defines his politics as \"progressive\", founded his own party to blur political lines and hopes to recalibrate the political balance between what TR called \"the doctrinaires of extreme individualism\" and those of \"extreme socialism\" (though Mr Macron is hardly the Progressives' first emulator: America's Bill Clinton, Britain's Tony Blair and Germany's Gerhard Schröder, for example, used to wax lyrical about the \"third way\" in the 1990s). Where Roosevelt was a conservationist who expanded America's network of national parks, Mr Macron has become a tree-hugger who vows to \"make our planet great again\". Like Roosevelt, Mr Macron considers his attempt to clean up politics, curb rent-seeking and tame tech titans to be part of an effort to fashion a liberal, market-friendly response to populism that can nonetheless assuage voters' fears.\n\nThe resemblances go deeper still. Each president was educated at his country's elite institution (Roosevelt at Harvard; Mr Macron at the Ecole Nationale d'Administration), studied philosophy and particularly Hegel (Mr Macron wrote a thesis on the German philosopher) and is literary-minded (Roosevelt wrote dozens of books; Mr Macron is an unpublished novelist). Like Roosevelt, Mr Macron dislikes cynicism and thinks that talk of grandeur can restore national confidence. \"We have to be amenable once again to creating grand narratives,\" Mr Macron says, words that echo a speech made in Paris at the Sorbonne in 1910 by Roosevelt, who declared it \"unhealthy\" to hold \"an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty\".\n\nPrairies versus Pyrenees\n\nOf course, there is plenty to separate the two presidents. Roosevelt, the \"Rough Rider\", was a one-time cowboy, hunter, and cattle-rancher in the Dakota Badlands who served as a cavalry officer in Cuba during the Spanish-American war; Mr Macron is a tennis-player and skier, of a generation that has never seen active combat. Roosevelt, who took office as a Republican after the assassination of William McKinley, founded his Progressive Party only after leaving the presidency; Mr Macron created En Marche as his vehicle for victory.\n\nYet the lesson of this parallel is that it takes the menace of populism to prompt the market-friendly centre to rethink some of its tenets. Roosevelt ushered in an era of progressive reform that gave the federal government a greater role in social policy and regulation. Mr Macron thinks populism thrives when people feel their leaders are impotent, in particular against the forces of globalisation. His efforts put him at the centre of a balance. Europe is trying to preserve the existing free-market order, while trying to impose new rules on it, for instance by hitting tech giants with taxes and regulations. It is a hard equation to get right. \"France has taught many lessons to other nations,\" declared Roosevelt in his Sorbonne speech. Its current president's response to populism will test whether this can be another.",

                "body": "THE ballot-stuffing, blatant and in full view of the cameras, only underlined Vladimir Putin's impunity. The official result on March 18th gave him 77% of the vote, on a turnout of almost 70%. But the unofficial one would not have been very different. The election was not a genuine exercise of choice so much as a ritual acknowledgment of who holds power. After 18 years, Mr Putin is not just the president but the tsar.\n\nAs important as last weekend's vote, however, is the struggle to come. That will be over the future of Russia. And, as impregnable as Mr Putin looks, it begins today.\n\nThe gun has fired\n\nMr Putin cannot legally run again for president in 2024. Drawing on a mix of persuasion and brutal repression, he could force through changes to the constitution to let himself stand again, as Xi Jinping has just done in China. Or he may retire from his daily duties instead, as Deng Xiaoping did, in the hope of exerting power from behind the scenes. But then again, if Mr Putin starts to show a lack of resolve or cunning he could find himself pushed aside at the end of his term.\n\nAlready the elites in Russia are jockeying for position. The outcome is highly uncertain. At worst, the country could yet embrace an even more extreme form of the nationalism that has defined the politics of Mr Putin. He portrays Russia as assailed by enemies, and argues that it has nothing to learn from foreign ideas like human rights and open democracy. That view has already fuelled a new cold war and led to rows over manipulated elections and political assassinations abroad. In Crimea, Ukraine and Syria it fuelled real wars.\n\nBut there is an alternative. A rising elite in its 30s brought on, in part, by Mr Putin himself yearns for Russia to be a more \"normal\" country. For them much about his rule is archaic. They cringe at his conservative agenda, his traditional values, Orthodoxy and isolation.\n\nThis new generation will play a central part in shaping what comes after Mr Putin's next term. Our briefing this week describes its members, who range from regional governors and businesspeople to independent politicians. They have their differences and their rivalries, naturally, but they also have more in common with each other than they do with the elders who are their bosses. They tend to see the end of the cold war in the 1990s not as Russia's loss, but as a victory for common sense. Well-travelled and informed, they do not suffer from the inferiority complex that led Mr Putin's generation to copy the West and, later, lash out against it. Their parents grew up with shortages and measure success in terms of money. They take material comfort for granted. Having watched as public life has been corrupted by Mr Putin's lies, propaganda and graft, they see the benefits of rules, laws and transparency.\n\nDuring the next six years of Mr Putin's presidency, this elite will assert itself in every walk of life. Think-tanks and journalism increasingly reflect their ideas. Six of Russia's 85 governors are under 40. Mr Putin has started installing young technocrats in the Kremlin and government ministries.\n\nHe may hope that the technocrats' loyalty will preserve his legacy. But Russia lacks the institutions that transfer power peacefully from one leader to the next. A departing leader cannot be confident that he and his family will be safe. A new leader cannot use the debased currency of elections to establish his legitimacy. Thus, even those Mr Putin favours may well end up rejecting him, rather as he consolidated his position by rejecting his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, who first brought him to power.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the coming generation will succeed in making Russia more normal. Russian history is shot through with failed attempts to find a settlement with the West -- in which the country has veered between aspiration and hostility. The fortress mentality that Mr Putin has fostered has instilled feelings of jealousy, resentment and victimisation. The main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, who was barred from last weekend's election, has said that his biggest enemy is not Mr Putin and his cronies, but the debilitating conviction among ordinary Russians of their own powerlessness. If the security services attempt to exploit fear in order to cling to their privileges and their power, the Russian people may behave as their willing accomplices.\n\nIt's everyone's business\n\nThe struggle for Russia will be determined inside Russia. But the West has a part to play. It is worth remembering how the Soviet Union was undermined not just by the military might of the West, but also by its economic, cultural and moral appeal. It took decades for communism to crumble, but today's Russia is economically weak and Mr Putin has a greater need to derive legitimacy from conflict at home and abroad.\n\nEven as the West targets him and his cronies with sanctions and protests at his aggressions, it therefore needs a counter-narrative for the Russian people. The aim should be to remain engaged with ordinary Russians while containing Mr Putin's aggression, just as Western diplomats distinguished between the Soviet regime and its citizens. Even as the Kremlin restricts Russian contact with the West, the West should encourage it.\n\nThat will not be easy. It is hard to punish Mr Putin without alienating all Russians. Cultivating the new elite could justify a purge by their enemies. And the West is less of a model than it was. Disillusion with the European Union and strife in America over the presidency of Donald Trump, which Mr Putin does his best to foment, have tarnished the West's appeal.\n\nThis week Mr Trump played into that weakness when he uncritically congratulated Mr Putin on his re-election, without raising Russia's abuses at home and abroad. That was a mistake. The message that might is right only frustrates the rise of more open young Russians and justifies the repressive instincts of their opponents. This is bad not only for Russians but also for everyone else. Andrei Sakharov, a Russian Nobel prize-winning humanist and nuclear physicist, put it best. A country that violates the human rights of its own people, he argued, cannot be safe for the outside world.",

A sudden change to the city's blood-donation rules had given them a fright.\n\nBlood shortages are common in China -- particularly around Spring Festival, when lots of potential donors leave the cities to holiday in their hometowns. Only about 1% of Chinese give blood each year, slightly below what might be expected given its level of development (see chart). Some people worry that even a modest loss of blood is unhealthy, and no one has forgotten a grim scandal that began in the 1980s, when middlemen paying for blood infected hundreds of thousands with HIV.\n\nPaying people to give blood was outlawed in 1998. Instead, to encourage donations, the government gave volunteers the right to certificates meant to grant them priority access to blood, should they ever need it. More significantly, it allowed donors to transfer this privilege to someone else -- in effect allowing them to donate blood directly to family or friends in need. The idea was that blood donated this way would help to supplement stocks provided freely and altruistically.\n\nThis kind of reciprocal-donation system is common in less-developed countries, and in large part it succeeded in China. Blood donations rose from about 5m units a year in 1998 to more than 20m in 2011, according to data published in Transfusion Medicine Reviews, a journal. But lately its flaws have become apparent. First, growth in donations has slowed, and now lags behind hospital admissions, which are rising by over 15% a year. The reciprocal-donation system makes it harder to persuade people to donate regularly and freely, says Yu Chengpu of Sun Yat-sen University, though that is essential if China is to meet demand in years to come.\n\nA second problem is that presenting blood-donation certificates has become more or less essential for patients seeking transfusions in some big city hospitals (blood stocks are particularly stretched in such places, because lots of people travel from outlying towns or even different provinces to be treated in them). Patients who require frequent transfusions but whose needs are not considered an emergency -- such as those undergoing chemotherapy -- are worst affected. They end up having to ask crowds of friends and relatives to donate on their behalf. That is especially tricky for people without lots of well-wishers, and for out-of-towners.\n\nThe inevitable consequence has been a resurgence of black-market blood-selling of the type officials had initially intended to stamp out. Patients who are on the mend sometimes sell unused blood entitlements to those who are still ill. For a fee professional blood merchants will herd a gaggle of impecunious strangers to a donation centre, where they pose as acquaintances of the patient in need. Some of these criminals hang around hospitals, but increasingly introductions are made through WeChat, a messaging app.\n\nMany provinces have scrapped reciprocal donations. The health ministry wants the rest to phase them out. Last year it told local officials that they had until the end of March to do so. The holdouts are places where supplies are tightest, and the straitened spring months are the worst time to be tinkering with the system. For some reason city officials gave hospitals in Beijing only a few days' notice that the rules would change. Hospitals postponed long-scheduled operations at short notice and patients who were caught in mid-treatment panicked. Blood-sellers made huge profits catering to patients who had counted on getting friends and family to donate for them, but realised they no longer had time to do so before the rules changed.\n\nIn the end blood imported from neighbouring provinces helped carry Beijing's clinics through the holiday (Ms Pu's transplant is under way). Officials say that, although donors may no longer pledge blood to particular patients, they can still donate to specific hospitals. In the long run, though, they will have to try harder to promote altruistic blood-giving.",

                "title": "How Republicans embraced identity politics",
                "body": "SOME Democrats blamed identity politics for Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016. Mark Lilla, a historian from Columbia University, suggested in the New York Times that Democratic identity politics \"encouraged white, rural, religious Americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group.\" But new research suggests that identity politics is not a phenomenon primarily connected to the Democratic Party. Social and cultural identity is more closely tied to partisan support among Republicans.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have become increasingly polarised in terms of their racial, religious and ideological makeup. Blacks, Hispanics and the non-religious have sorted into the Democratic Party, while whites, evangelical Christians, and conservatives have tended to join the Republican Party. Between 1992 and 2016 the percentage of white men registered to vote who identified as Republican rose from 48% to 61% and the share of those who were registered Democrat fell from 44% to 31%, according to the Pew Research Centre.\n\nLilliana Mason of the University of Maryland and Julie Wronski of the University of Mississippi found that a white, Christian Republican is much more attached to his party than one who doesn't have these features. A supporter of the more racially and culturally diverse Democratic Party, meanwhile, is more open to different religious or racial members than are supporters of the Republican Party. The link between particular religious or racial markers and intensity of support for the Democratic Party is also weaker. \"Put plainly, there exist no black, atheist, liberal Republicans, nor many white, Christian, conservative Democrats who feel close to their groups and identify weakly with their party,\" write Ms Mason and Ms Wronski. \"Still, Democrats appear to navigate cross-cutting identities within their party more frequently than Republicans.\"\n\nThe emergence of a belief among Republicans that white Christians are a forgotten, oppressed group has been one result. A survey by the Public Religion Research Institute in February last year found that, among supporters of the Republican party, 43% felt there was a lot of discrimination against whites and 48% thought there was a lot of discrimination against Christians. Only 27% thought there was a lot of discrimination against blacks. (Among Democrats the percentages were 19%, 21% and 82%).\n\nRepublican partisans' views of who is more discriminated against are belied by the evidence. Just as people tend to judge their economic wellbeing based on recent change rather than an absolute level, white males' sense of persecution may be based on (somewhat) diminishing privilege. But an analysis of field experiments covering hiring discrimination published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that in experiments run since 1990 white job applicants received, on average, 36% more callbacks than black applicants and 24% more callbacks than Latino applicants with identical résumés. While there was a trend over that period towards less discrimination against Latinos, there was no significant change in discrimination against blacks over 25 years. There is similar evidence of resilient discrimination against women in America's workforce.\n\nIt may be that Democrats pointing out discrimination against minorities was one factor encouraging a Republican electorate that increasingly identifies as white, Christian and male to conjure the idea of widespread discrimination against white Christian men. But until the Republicans return to ideological politics over identity politics, it is not obvious what to do about that problem. Simply ignoring America's ongoing struggle with racism, sexism and nativism is an inadequate response.",

                "title": "There's something fishy about Britain's Brexit transition deal",
                "body": "AGAINST a backdrop displaying the text of Britain's draft withdrawal agreement, colour-coded to show areas agreed and yet to be tackled, Michel Barnier, the European Union's Brexit negotiator, and David Davis, Britain's Brexit secretary, announced a transition deal on March 19th. It was hard even for the ebullient Mr Davis to hide the fact that Britain had agreed to a \"status quo\" transition period, in which it will maintain most obligations to the EU while losing its voting rights. At least business was pleased that there will be no cliff-edge exit next March -- assuming, that is, the two sides are able to reach some kind of Brexit deal.\n\nWhat was striking was the acquiescence of most pro-Brexit Tory MPs. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who once likened a status-quo transition to being a vassal state, said Britain had rolled over without even getting its tummy tickled. But he and his allies still gave Theresa May's government the benefit of the doubt. In effect, they value the prize of Brexit next March so highly that they will accept almost any terms for it. This should reduce their influence on Mrs May in the remaining negotiations.\n\nOne awkward concession concerned fish. Many Brexiteers say they were promised that Britain would take back full control of fisheries next March. Even Michael Gove, the minister in charge, admitted to being disappointed that this has proved impossible. Britain will now stay in the EU's common fisheries policy until the start of 2021. Scottish Tories are especially upset. Several said they could not sell such a betrayal to their constituents, and 14 MPs wrote to Mrs May urging her to reject the transition and threatening to vote against a Brexit deal later this year if she does not.\n\nFor all their protests, including sending a fishing boat up the Thames to Parliament, Mrs May is bound to accept the transition at the EU summit that was meeting as we went to press. She has no choice. Fishing is too small an industry to jeopardise a future Brexit deal. Just as in 1973, when Britain first joined the club, it is likely to be sacrificed for the greater good, however loudly trawlermen howl.\n\nThe real concern about the transitional deal is not about vassaldom or fish. It is the transition's short duration. Mrs May had asked for a deal lasting \"around two years\"; some ministers openly hoped for longer. Yet Mr Barnier is offering just 21 months, to the end of 2020. Trade experts doubt that a comprehensive trade deal of the sort that Mrs May wants can be negotiated, let alone ratified, that quickly. And the text of the transitional deal leaves it unclear whether an extension will be legally possible, let alone politically so.\n\nA big problem is that Mrs May has wasted so much time since triggering the Article 50 withdrawal process last March, not least by holding a general election last June. A majority of the Commons Brexit committee is calling for an extension of Article 50's two-year deadline. The home affairs committee similarly says more time is needed to ensure continuing co-operation on justice and domestic security. Time, or rather the lack of it, has become one of Brexit's most pressing concerns.",

                "title": "To understand digital advertising, study its algorithms",
                "body": "ALAN MISLOVE studies algorithms. Recently, his research at Northeastern University, in Boston, has shown that Facebook's software was leaking users' phone numbers to advertisers. He has also found new ways to audit that same software for racial bias. But work like his faces challenges. Scraping data from public-facing websites often sails close to breaching their terms and conditions. And the companies those websites belong to are generally unwilling to give researchers more direct access to their systems.\n\nMoreover, examining other people's algorithms requires the creation of your own to do so. Dr Mislove's group often spends months just writing the code needed to gather any data at all about the objects of its inquiry. This means that only those with sufficient computer-science skills can study the computer programs that play an ever-growing role in society -- not just in commerce, but also in politics, economics, justice and many other areas of life. This is bad for research and for the public.\n\nNow, as Facebook finds itself in the throes of a scandal over its handling of data and the power of its hyper-targeted advertising software, Dr Mislove is working with a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who think they have an answer to these problems. This group, led by Iyad Rahwan, has taken a leaf out of the book of B.F. Skinner, an animal behaviourist who, several decades ago, worked down the road from MIT at Harvard. Skinner invented a device, now known as a Skinner box, which standardised the process of behavioural experimentation. He used his boxes to control input stimuli (food, light, sound, pain) and then observed output behaviour in an attempt to link the one to the other. Though by no means perfect, the Skinner box was a big advance in the field. Dr Rahwan hopes to do something similar to software using what he calls a Turing box.\n\nThis \"box\" is itself a piece of software. Place an algorithm in it, control the data inputs, measure the outcomes, and you will be able to work out exactly how it behaves in different circumstances. Anyone who wants to study an algorithm could upload it to a Turing box. The box's software would then start running the algorithm through a standard data set of the kind it was designed to crunch. All face-recognition algorithms, for example, would be given the same scientifically validated set of faces. The algorithm's output -- in this case how it classifies different faces -- would be recorded and analysed. Dr Rahwan's hope is that companies will want political and social scientists to use the box to scrutinise their algorithms for potentially harmful flaws (eg, treating faces differently on racial grounds), and that researchers will line up to do the testing.\n\nIndeed, his ambitions go further still. His intention is that the Turing box should become just one component of a new field, the scientific study of the behaviour exhibited by intelligent machines, and of the impact of that behaviour on people. A demonstration paper he and his colleagues have submitted for publication to the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence describes the system, as well as the broader details of this new field of machine behaviour. He plans to finish the Turing-box software by the summer, and says he will publish the code under an open-source licence shortly thereafter, for anyone to reuse. The running of the platform will then be left to a not-for-profit firm that he plans to spin out of MIT.\n\nBoxing clever\n\nIt is a neat idea, and timely. Algorithms are being developed far faster than their impacts are being studied and understood (see chart). The Turing box, if it works as intended, could help turn the tide. Understanding algorithms' behaviour is particularly urgent in the existing digital-advertising \"ecosystem\", in which individual users of software are, in effect, in their own Skinner boxes -- with their actions constantly monitored, and tailored rewards fed to them. The Facebook furore, for example, revolves around allegations that Cambridge Analytica, a digital lobbying firm, improperly obtained data from Facebook, then used them to aim advertisements which influenced the American presidential election in 2016 (the firm has denied any wrongdoing).\n\nDr Rahwan recognises that the reluctance of many companies which form part of the digital-advertising ecosystem to upload their algorithms for inspection make it a bad place to start. So, to begin with, he will work elsewhere, studying less controversial and commercially sensitive systems such as open-source algorithms for processing natural language.\n\nHe says, though, that the ultimate goal is to enable the study of the algorithms which some of the world's most valuable IT firms hold dearest: Facebook's newsfeed, for example, or Amazon's product-recommendation software. That means looking at the behaviour of these algorithms in an environment which is as close as possible to that in which they normally operate, so that their impact on the real world can be measured. This in turn will require the firms that own them giving independent researchers access to their systems and data.\n\nRecent years have seen things go in the opposite direction. According to Michal Kosinski of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, who in 2012 pioneered the use of Facebook data to study personality, \"academic researchers have virtually no access even to publicly available data without breaking a given platform's terms of service.\" Firms' scruples in these matters are not driven only by desire for commercial secrecy. As this week's events have shown, a leak of personal data from an academic inquiry can be just as damaging as one from a sloppy business partner.\n\nSo, research on particularly sensitive data may require academics to be physically present inside an organisation in order to gain access to those data, a process akin to studying in the rare-books section of a library. It might also be a good idea to have independent umpires of some sort, to ensure that both firms and researchers stay on the straight and narrow.\n\nFacebook seems open to the idea of working with researchers in this way. In a statement given to The Economist a few days before the Cambridge Analytica story broke, the firm stated a desire to work with researchers in order to understand the impact of its systems, but warned that it had to shield its users' data from third parties. Facebook also said that it is \"actively working\" on an approach which achieves both goals, although it declined to provide any details of that work. Contacted later in the week, the firm's data-science team declined to issue any additional statement.\n\nThe Turing box is only in the earliest stages of development, but it, and systems like it, offer to inject something vital into the discussion of digital practices -- independently gathered causal evidence. Without that, people may never get out of the Skinner boxes in which the tech firms have put them.",

                "body": "\"MY GOAL was never really to make Facebook cool. I am not a cool person,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of the social-media giant, in 2014. That has never been more true. His company has spent the past year stumbling through controversies over the peddling of fake news and enabling Russian manipulation of American voters, with various degrees of ineptitude. Then, on March 17th, articles in the New York Times and Britain's Observer newspaper suggested that a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, had obtained detailed data about some 50m Facebook users and shared this trove of information and analysis with third parties, including Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The result is a corporate crisis -- and a political reckoning.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike have called on Mr Zuckerberg and the heads of other tech firms to testify before the Senate. America's consumer watchdog, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), has also reportedly launched an investigation into Facebook's privacy policies and whether it violated a consent decree of 2011 requiring the social network to notify users about how their data are shared. British MPs have called for Mr Zuckerberg to come before a select committee.\n\nEven Facebook's allies have unfriended it. On Twitter, Brian Acton, a co-founder of the popular messaging app WhatsApp (which Facebook bought for $22bn in 2014), encouraged people to \"#DeleteFacebook\". News of his post pinged around the internet, including on Facebook itself. Investors, who have forgiven months of bad headlines in light of Facebook's strong financial performance, are growing jittery. Between March 16th and March 21st the firm's share price fell by 8.5%, erasing $45bn in market value. Facebook is still the world's eighth-most-valuable publicly listed firm, but shareholders worry that politicians in Europe and America may impose onerous restrictions on data, suppressing growth.\n\nHelp yourself to our data\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal reveals Facebook's morphing, porous privacy policies and the company's cavalier approach to oversight. The data on Facebook users were obtained by Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at Cambridge University, who enticed some 270,000 people to take part in a survey in exchange for a small fee. When those users installed the survey app, they shared details about themselves and -- unwittingly -- their friends, around 50m Facebook users in all. Surprisingly, before 2015 Facebook's rules allowed the mining of social connections without each user's consent.\n\nWhat happened next was never permitted by Facebook. Mr Kogan provided these data to Cambridge Analytica, which then allegedly shared them with customers, including Mr Trump's campaign. Cambridge Analytica is backed by Robert Mercer, a Republican donor; Steve Bannon, formerly a top adviser to Mr Trump, used to serve as an executive. (The Economist used Cambridge Analytica for a market-research project in the past.)\n\nAlthough news of Cambridge Analytica's peddling of Facebook data was first reported in December 2015, the social network reportedly did not respond until eight months later, with a letter asking the firm to delete the data. It seems not to have checked that this was done. The lax response is evidence of wider \"systemic operational problems\", says Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research, who follows the firm.\n\nIf reports are to be believed, Cambridge Analytica has a habit of pushing ethical and legal boundaries to gather data. On March 20th Alexander Nix, its chief executive, was suspended after recordings were aired on British television that seem to capture him describing manipulating people for information. Britain's data-protection regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, is expected to search Cambridge Analytica's offices.\n\nThe scandal reverberates through politics as well as the internet. Facebook has built a mammoth advertising business, with sales of around $40bn in 2017, by gathering detailed information about users' identities and behaviour online and then selling access to them. Facebook tracks users not only on its services, including its eponymous social network and Instagram (which it owns), but across the web. Knowing that someone is a dog owner and interested in buying a new lead may not seem controversial. \"Microtargeting\" someone in order to influence their political views and voting behaviour appears more sinister.\n\nThough political advertising is still a minuscule percentage of Facebook's revenues, perhaps around 3%, it is a growing and lucrative line. Politicians have found that using Facebook can pay dividends. Even without using illegitimately obtained data to boost targeting, the social-media firm offers precise tools to political campaigns, including reaching users on Facebook whose names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses they already have. Facebook also enables campaigns to target voters who show an interest in the same issues or have similar profiles, packaging them into what it calls \"lookalike audiences\". No other Western company apart from Google has such rich data.\n\nBarack Obama's campaigns were digitally sophisticated and used Facebook to reach prospective voters. Yet Mr Obama got proper permission to obtain data about people's friends and did not microtarget users on an industrial scale, unlike Mr Trump's campaign. Targeting based on Cambridge Analytica's data may have helped Mr Trump win the presidency, although how much cannot be known.\n\nA tepid response\n\nCompanies can overcome scandals. Rupert Murdoch, a media mogul, survived a maelstrom in 2011 when it was reported that a newspaper he owned had hacked the phone of a murdered girl, Milly Dowler. Mr Zuckerberg, like Mr Murdoch, has structured ownership of his firm so that he controls super-voting shares, and will probably maintain his power. But there is speculation that some of his lieutenants, including Sheryl Sandberg, could leave in the next year. The head of security, Alex Stamos, is expected to resign.\n\nMr Zuckerberg's response to the scandal has been modest. He has apologised and promised thorough audits of third-party app developers and steps to make it easier for users to control their privacy settings. Such basic assurances may not be enough to reverse flagging corporate morale and win back the enthusiasm of users. Trust in social media is already low, and Americans have been spending less time on Facebook, in part because so much of what they see online is negative and dubious. Globally, users spent around 50m hours less per day on Facebook in the fourth quarter of 2017, which translates into a 15% drop in time spent year over year, according to Mr Wieser.\n\nAs some users turn away, politicians in America and Europe are likely to give Facebook more of their attention. They are scrutinising Facebook's conduct and may propose new laws, especially in the domain of data privacy. In May regulations concerning data protection and user consent will come into effect in Europe. America has historically been weak on data protection, except for specific industries like health care. Overworked regulators have typically responded to reports of misconduct on a case-by-case basis, and the online advertising industry has been trusted to police itself.\n\nMr Obama was in favour of a consumer-privacy bill of rights, which would give users more control of their online data by requiring user consent. That made little headway because of opposition from the industry. Some politicians may want to revive talk of such a law, especially as Europe strengthens its safeguards. But political reformers seldom have an easy time in America. And, like many others, politicians have come to rely on Facebook.",

                "title": "Facebook faces a reputational meltdown",
                "body": "LAST year the idea took hold that Mark Zuckerberg might run for president in 2020 and seek to lead the world's most powerful country. Today, Facebook's founder is fighting to show that he is capable of leading the world's eighth-biggest listed company or that any of its 2.1bn users should trust it.\n\nNews that Cambridge Analytica (CA), a firm linked to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, got data on 50m Facebook users in dubious, possibly illegal, ways has lit a firestorm (see article). Mr Zuckerberg took five days to reply and, when he did, he conceded that Facebook had let its users down in the past but seemed not to have grasped that its business faces a wider crisis of confidence. After months of talk about propaganda and fake news, politicians in Europe and, increasingly, America see Facebook as out of control and in denial. Congress wants him to testify. Expect a roasting.\n\nSince the news, spooked investors have wiped 9% off Facebook's shares. Consumers are belatedly waking up to the dangers of handing over data to tech giants that are run like black boxes. Already, according to the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, a majority of Americans say they distrust social-media firms. Mr Zuckerberg and his industry need to change, fast.\n\nThe addiction game\n\nFacebook's business relies on three elements: keeping users glued to their screens, collecting data about their behaviour and convincing advertisers to pay billions of dollars to reach them with targeted ads. The firm has an incentive to promote material that grabs attention and to sell ads to anyone. Its culture melds a ruthless pursuit of profit with a Panglossian and narcissistic belief in its own virtue. Mr Zuckerberg controls the firm's voting rights. Clearly, he gets too little criticism.\n\nIn the latest fiasco, it emerged that in 2013 an academic in Britain built a questionnaire app for Facebook users, which 270,000 people answered. They in turn had 50m Facebook friends. Data on all these people then ended up with CA. (Full disclosure: The Economist once used CA for a market-research project.) Facebook says that it could not happen again and that the academic and CA broke its rules; both deny doing anything wrong. Regulators in Europe and America are investigating. Facebook knew of the problem in 2015, but it did not alert individual users. Although nobody knows how much CA benefited Mr Trump's campaign, the fuss has been amplified by the left's disbelief that he could have won the election fairly.\n\nBut that does not give Facebook a defence. The episode fits an established pattern of sloppiness towards privacy, tolerance of inaccuracy and reluctance to admit mistakes. In early 2017 Mr Zuckerberg dismissed the idea that fake news had influenced the election as \"pretty crazy\". In September Facebook said Kremlin-linked firms had spent a mere $100,000 to buy 3,000 adverts on its platform, failing at first to mention that 150m users had seen free posts by Russian operatives. It has also repeatedly misled advertisers about its user statistics.\n\nFacebook is not about to be banned or put out of business, but the chances of a regulatory backlash are growing. Europe is inflicting punishment by a thousand cuts, from digital taxes to antitrust cases. And distrustful users are switching off. The American customer base of Facebook's core social network has stagnated since June 2017. Its share of America's digital advertising market is forecast to dip this year for the first time. The network effect that made Facebook ever more attractive to new members as it grew could work in reverse if it starts to shrink. Facebook is worth $493bn, but only has $14bn of physical assets. Its value is intangible -- and, potentially, ephemeral.\n\nIf Mr Zuckerberg wants to do right by the public and his firm, he must rebuild trust. So far he has promised to audit some apps, restrict developers' access to data still further, and help people control which apps have access to their data.\n\nThat doesn't go nearly far enough. Facebook needs a full, independent examination of its approach to content, privacy and data, including its role in the 2016 election and the Brexit referendum. This should be made public. Each year Facebook should publish a report on its conduct that sets out everything from the prevalence of fake news to privacy breaches.\n\nNext, Facebook and other tech firms need to open up to outsiders, safely and methodically. They should create an industry ombudsman -- call it the Data Rights Board. Part of its job would be to set and enforce the rules by which accredited independent researchers look inside platforms without threatening users' privacy. Software is being developed with this in mind (see article). The likes of Facebook raise big questions. How does micro-targeting skew political campaigns? What biases infect facial-recognition algorithms? Better they be answered with evidence instead of outrage.\n\nThe board or something like it could also act as a referee for complaints, and police voluntary data-protection protocols. Facebook, for example, is planning to comply worldwide with some of the measures contained in a new European law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. Among other things, this will give users more power to opt out of being tracked online and to stop their information being shared with third parties. Adherence to such rules needs to be closely monitored.\n\nThumbs down\n\nTech has experience of acting collectively to solve problems. Standards on hardware and software, and the naming of internet domains, are agreed on jointly. Facebook's rivals may be wary but, if the industry does not come up with a joint solution, a government clampdown will become inevitable.\n\nFacebook seems to think it only needs to tweak its approach. In fact it, and other firms that hoover up consumer data, should assume that their entire business model is at risk. As users become better informed, the alchemy of taking their data without paying and manipulating them for profit may die. Firms may need to compensate people for their data or let them pay to use platforms ad-free. Profits won't come as easily, but the alternative is stark. If Facebook ends up as a regulated utility with its returns on capital capped, its earnings may drop by 80%. How would you like that, Mr Zuckerberg?",

                "title": "Can Donald Trump sack Robert Mueller?",
                "body": "LAST weekend, for the first time in the ten-month special-counsel investigation into connections between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, Mr Trump named Robert Mueller, the former FBI director leading the investigation, in a series of tweets. The missives were not friendly. \"The Mueller probe should never have been started,\" Mr Trump wrote, as \"there was no collusion and there was no crime.\" Mr Mueller's inquiry is \"a total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\" Days later the president again pressed this criticism, citing the opposition of Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard law professor, to Mr Mueller's investigation. Concerned that Mr Trump's tweets might portend another presidential firing, some Senate Republicans -- including Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham -- warned Mr Trump against sacking Mr Mueller. (In a moment of institutional grovelling Mr Flake tweeted, \"We are begging\" the president not to \"create a constitutional crisis.\") But if the president ignores these pleas, could he actually fire the special counsel?\n\nNot so easily. Unlike recent flick-of-the-wrist firings of Andrew McCabe, the erstwhile deputy FBI director, and Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, the sacking of Mr Mueller would be more fraught. Most critically, Mr Trump could not do the deed by himself. By law, the special counsel is appointed by the attorney general -- or, in this case, by his deputy, since Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation after his meetings with a Russian official during the campaign (which he failed to disclose during his Senate confirmation hearings) came to light. Barring an extraordinary reconceptualisation of presidential authority that could spur a lawsuit by members of Congress, only Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, may fire Mr Mueller. And the reason cannot be as capricious as a firing on \"The Apprentice\". The Department of Justice (DoJ) regulation provides that only \"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest\" or another \"good cause\" can justify removing a special counsel from an investigation.\n\nThere is no real evidence Mr Mueller has crossed such a line (despite some theories Mr Trump's team has floated), and Mr Rosenstein has pledged not to remove the special counsel without cause. But if Mr Trump were to instruct Mr Rosenstein to fire Mr Mueller on the basis of a hunch of impropriety, and the deputy attorney general refused, the constitutional crisis of which Mr Flake warned would probably ensue. The president would probably fire Mr Rosenstein, a move that he seems to have toyed with in recent months. He could then appoint a new deputy or elevate Jesse Panuccio, who has been acting associate attorney general since Rachel Brand left the position in February. Should the new deputy attorney general also rebuff the president and be fired for his troubles, the cycle of sackings and new appointments could continue until somebody removes Mr Mueller as special counsel. Alternatively, Mr Trump could sack Mr Sessions and name a new attorney general without a conflict of interest who could do the job -- assuming the nominee could clear the Senate.\n\nThere is a precedent for serial sackings leading to the removal of a president's nemesis, but the story is not reassuring for Mr Trump. In the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, Richard Nixon fired two justice-department officials before a third (Robert Bork, the solicitor general) finally agreed to write the letter firing Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. But just as Bork then appointed another special prosecutor to take Cox's place, so any justice-department official who agrees to remove Mr Mueller would have to name another to keep the Russia investigation going. What Mr Trump sees as a witch hunt, then, would probably not end with the demise of Mr Mueller. The inquiry would take a new -- and, given the suspicion a Mueller massacre would engender, perhaps more dangerous -- turn for the president. Impeachment proceedings against Nixon began four months after Cox's sacking. By August 1974 Nixon had been forced to resign, lest he be sacked himself.",

                "title": "American corporations come out against Donald Trump's proposed tariffs",
                "body": "PRESIDENT Donald Trump is putting his protectionist instincts into practice this week. On March 23rd he will impose new tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium. Tariffs on Chinese information technology, telecommunications and consumer goods, as well as investment restrictions are due any day now too.\n\nThese moves have won Mr Trump few friends internationally. But some of the most potent resistance has come from within America. Metal users howled in protest against the new trade restrictions, some loud enough to help secure exemptions for Canada and Mexico. And on March 18th, 45 trade groups representing many of the country's largest companies sent a letter urging the White House not to follow through on its plans to slap tariffs on up to $60bn of Chinese goods. The letter argues that such a move, which could come as soon as March 22nd, would raise prices for consumers and businesses and imperil American jobs.\n\nAmongst the signatories of the letter were the 300,000-member United States Chamber of Commerce, which lobbies on behalf of ExxonMobil, Boeing and General Electric among other giants, and the National Small Business Association, which represents some 65,000 small business owners. Support for Mr Trump's tariffs, meanwhile, has been limited. Only three major trade groups, who jointly include fewer than 150 firms, have come out in favour of new duties (see chart). A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the ratio of firms opposed to Mr Trump's protectionism to those in favour may be as high as 3,000 to one.",

                "title": "There's something fishy about Britain's Brexit transition deal",
                "body": "AGAINST a backdrop displaying the text of Britain's draft withdrawal agreement, colour-coded to show areas agreed and yet to be tackled, Michel Barnier, the European Union's Brexit negotiator, and David Davis, Britain's Brexit secretary, announced a transition deal on March 19th. It was hard even for the ebullient Mr Davis to hide the fact that Britain had agreed to a \"status quo\" transition period, in which it will maintain most obligations to the EU while losing its voting rights. At least business was pleased that there will be no cliff-edge exit next March -- assuming, that is, the two sides are able to reach some kind of Brexit deal.\n\nWhat was striking was the acquiescence of most pro-Brexit Tory MPs. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who once likened a status quo transition to being a vassal state, said Britain had rolled over without even getting its tummy tickled. But he and his allies still gave Theresa May's government the benefit of the doubt. In effect, they value the prize of Brexit next March so highly that they will accept almost any terms for it. This should reduce their influence on Mrs May in the remaining negotiations.\n\nOne awkward concession concerned fish. Many Brexiteers say they were promised that Britain would take back full control of fisheries next March. Even Michael Gove, the minister in charge, admitted to being disappointed that this has proved impossible. Britain will now stay in the EU's common fisheries policy until the start of 2021. Scottish Tories are especially upset. Several said they could not sell such a betrayal to their constituents, and 14 MPs wrote to Mrs May urging her to reject the transition and threatening to vote against a Brexit deal later this year if she does not.\n\nFor all their protests, including sending a fishing boat up the Thames to Parliament, Mrs May is bound to accept the transition at the EU summit that was meeting as we went to press. She has no choice. Fisheries is too small an industry to be worth jeopardising a future Brexit deal. Just as in 1973, when Britain first joined the club, fishing is likely to be sacrificed for the greater good, however loudly trawlermen howl.\n\nThe real concern about the transitional deal is not about vassaldom or fish. It is rather the short time given for it. Mrs May had asked for a deal lasting \"around two years\"; some ministers openly hoped for longer. Yet Mr Barnier is offering just 21 months, to the end of 2020. Trade experts doubt that a comprehensive trade deal of the sort that Mrs May wants can be negotiated, let alone ratified, that quickly. And the text of the transitional deal leaves it unclear whether an extension will be legally possible, let alone politically so.\n\nA big problem is that Mrs May has wasted so much time since triggering the Article 50 withdrawal process last March, not least by holding a general election last June. A majority of the Commons Brexit committee is calling for an extension of Article 50's two-year deadline. The home affairs committee similarly says more time is needed to ensure continuing co-operation on justice and domestic security. Time, or rather the lack of it, has become one of the most pressing concerns about Brexit.",
