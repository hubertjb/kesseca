                "body": "VOLOKOLAMSK, Russia (AP) -- The dump on the edge of the Russian town of Volokolamsk has long been an irritant to the community's 20,000-odd residents, worried about emissions of noxious gases.\n\nThe concerns escalated sharply this month when two protests were held in the town some 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Moscow, then burst into national attention on Wednesday when scores of schoolchildren sought medical help because of nausea, fainting and other symptoms of possible gas poisoning. Officials said 57 were hospitalized.\n\nThat day, hundreds of people gathered outside the local hospital and surrounded local administrator Yevgeny Gavrilov, with one man in the crowd trying to punch him. Gavrilov was escorted to safety as the crowd shouted \"Killer!\"\n\nA 10-year-old girl in a pink cap became a hit on the internet when video showed her making a throat-cutting gesture at Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the region that includes Volokolamsk.\n\nVorobyov's office announced Friday that Gavrilov, the district leader, has been removed from office. Vorobyov has promised to get the landfill problem solved by mid-June, but anxiety remains high among residents.",

                "title": "AP Explains: Trump's policy on transgender troops",
                "body": "PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- President Donald Trump has issued an order supporting his push to ban most transgender troops from serving in the U.S. military except under \"limited circumstances.\" But the decision is expected to be the subject of an ongoing legal fight in the months ahead.\n\nThe White House announced the decision late Friday, shortly after the president arrived at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, completing a process that followed Trump's surprise announcement on Twitter last year that he would reverse an Obama administration plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly.\n\nIn a memo to the president, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pointed to \"substantial risks\" with allowing military personnel who seek to undertake a treatment to change their gender or who question their gender identity.\n\nMattis also said exempting those in the military from \"well-established mental health, physical health and sex-based standards\" applying to all service members could hurt \"military effectiveness and lethality.\" But the policy includes narrow exemptions allowing some transgender members to serve.\n\nThe Pentagon has not released data on the number of transgender people serving, but a Rand Corp. study previously estimated between 1,320 and 6,630, out of 1.3 million active-duty troops.\n\nSeveral legal challenges have blocked Trump's efforts to enact a ban, and four federal courts have already ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\n\nCivil rights advocates said they would continue the legal fight, which could eventually reach the Supreme Court.\n\nBefore the policy was announced on Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said it would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\nHOW THE POLICY WORKS\n\nMattis wrote in the 48-page memo that U.S. troops who require or have already had gender reassignment surgery should be disqualified from military service.\n\nService members with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria,\" or those with discomfort with their biological sex, would also be banned - but with some exceptions.\n\nCurrent transgender service members who have not yet undergone reassignment surgery are allowed to remain in the military, as long as they have been medically stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex before joining the military and are able to deploy across the globe.\n\nIt also allows currently serving service members to remain if they were diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the Obama administration's policy took effect and prior to the start of the new Trump policy. Those service members are allowed to serve in their preferred gender and receive medical treatment for gender dysphoria.\n\nTHE PATHWAY TO THE DECISION\n\nDuring President Barack Obama's final year in office, the Pentagon announced it would allow transgender individuals to serve openly in the military and service members could not be discharged solely based on their gender identity.\n\nThe process was still under final review when Trump took office. Mattis announced in June 2017 that he would delay enacting the policy for six months while the military studied the issue.\n\nTrump in July 2017 declared on Twitter that the U.S. would not \"accept or allow ... transgender individuals to serve in any capacity\" in the military. The tweets caught the Pentagon off guard and were followed by the review of the policies.\n\nThe president received recommendations from Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military, leading to Friday's announcement.\n\nLEGAL CHALLENGES\n\nSeveral legal challenges to Trump's proposed ban are ongoing. At least four federal judges have refused to allow the ban to go into effect. Because of the injunctions, the Pentagon has been allowing transgender individuals to enlist since January.\n\nOne of the forefronts of the legal fight is in California, where a federal judge rejected a Trump administration attempt to throw out a lawsuit asking for the ban to be voided. California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said Friday the state would \"continue to vigorously defend the rights of transgender individuals.\"\n\nLambda Legal and OutServe-SLDN, meanwhile, said they would seek a permanent injunction on Tuesday before a federal judge in Seattle.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a statement late Friday that it would defend the Pentagon's authority to \"implement personnel policies they have determined are necessary to best defend our nation\" and would ask the courts to lift all related preliminary injunctions.\n\nREACTION TO TRUMP'S PLAN\n\nThe response to the White House announcement has largely fallen along partisan lines, with Democrats and civil rights groups opposing the plan and Republicans and conservatives approving of it.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California called it a \"hateful ban\" aimed at humiliating transgender members of the military.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the conservative group Family Research Council, said Trump had kept his pledge to \"end the Obama era of social experimentation in our nation's military\" and the policy would move the military away from \"political correctness.\"",

Mostafa al-Nimr survived the explosion and he was seen on a local TV channel in good condition while inspecting the area of the blast shortly after it took place.\n\nThe Interior Ministry had earlier reported only one policeman killed in the blast which occurred in the vicinity of a police station in the city's central Roshdi district.\n\nHealth Ministry spokesman Khaled Megahed told The Associated Press that two policemen were killed and four others wounded in today's explosion, adding that one civilian was also wounded.\n\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe attack comes just days ahead of Egypt's presidential election, in which President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is virtually certain to be re-elected. It also comes during a massive security operation involving land, sea and air forces in areas covering north and central Sinai and parts of Egypt's Nile Delta and the Western Desert, along the porous border with Libya.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said the explosive device had been placed under a car and it detonated as the convoy passed by.\n\nState-run MENA news agency said the public prosecutor has ordered an investigation into the incident.\n\nEgypt has for years been struggling to contain an Islamic insurgency spearheaded by a local affiliate of the extremist Islamic State group in the turbulent Sinai region but attacks on the mainland have also occurred.\n\nThe country has been under a state of emergency since April 2017, when suicide bombings struck two Coptic Christian churches in Alexandria and Tanta on Palm Sunday in an attack claimed later by the Islamic State group.",

Investigators are trying to determine how the gunman got his weapon, since French gun laws are much stricter than those in the U.S.\n\nRelatives of the victims of a deadly 1996 school shooting in Scotland were among the hundreds protesting Saturday outside the U.S. Consulate in Edinburgh for greater gun control in the U.S.\n\nA letter of support to those affected by the Parkland tragedy was read aloud. Catherine Wilson, who lost her sister Mhairi in the 1996 Dunblane Primary School shootings, was among the speakers.\n\n\"I don't understand why the freedom to own a gun is seen as more important than seeing your grandchildren grow up, or feeling safe when you go and watch a film in the cinema,\" Wilson said.\n\nSixteen schoolchildren and their teacher were killed in the Dunblane shooting, and the tragedy led the U.K. to enforce strict firearms laws.\n\nHundreds of people backing tighter U.S. gun controls also rallied outside the U.S. Embassy in London in support of the March for Our Lives movement.",

It shouldn't have happened anywhere, and we feel like it's time to make change and get gun reform.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Banning military-style weapons and more protections for our schools.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"At first nobody really knew what it was because the fire drill had went off. So most people were going out for the fire drill, and then people heard the code red, but some people heard it too late. So it was just a lot of confusion. And then after, it was just mostly shock hearing how many people died and how quickly it happened.\"\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"My family are all gun owners, and I've been around guns my whole life. And I think that it's absolutely necessary for people who own guns who are responsible gun owners to also be advocating for this because I don't think there are two sides. I think that if you want to find solutions, you can do that really easily. And as someone who has been around guns, I feel like I know what is safe, and I know what can be advocated for to be safe.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I don't want to wake up to another headline that says 20 kids died in a school shooting. I don't want people like the Parkland shooter to be able to get access to guns like he did. I just want to feel safe in schools. I don't want to have to keep doing shooter drills. That's what I want to see change, really.\"\n\nBEN STEWART, 17\n\nSCHOOL: Shiloh Hills Christian School in Kennesaw, Georgia\n\nMARCHING IN: Atlanta\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"People have been dying since 1999 in Columbine, and nothing has changed. People are still dying. Columbine isn't even on the top 10 list of mass shootings in America. Something needs to change.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I'd like to see commonsense gun laws introduced. It would be preferable if there was a semi-automatic rifle ban. ... If you look at ... school shootings, the majority of them are with legally purchased weapons. So yeah, criminals will get weapons, but you could still do something. It's better than doing nothing.\"\n\nCECILIA MCCOY, 17\n\nSCHOOL: Assumption High School in Louisville, Kentucky\n\nMARCHING IN: Washington, D.C.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here for the students, for gun control -- honestly just for everyone. This is not just for students. Everywhere you go, there is a threat of guns.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Stricter gun laws and to get rid of assault rifles.\"\n\nHAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING OR OTHER TYPE OF GUN THREAT? \"In Kentucky, there have been multiple school threats. In Marshall County, there was one. I wasn't there, but I knew people that go there, so it did affect home.\"\n\nCHARLIE SHEBS, 16\n\nSCHOOL: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\n\nMARCHING IN: Washington, D.C.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because previous generations couldn't do what we're doing right now. And we want to make this time the last time. So if that means marching all over the world, then I want to be a part of it.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I want to see safer schools. I don't want to hear that kids don't feel safe at schools. ... I want to see change in gun laws, and I want to see control. We're giving it to people who, it's just not safe. There's no other way to put it, really.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"I was in the freshman building on the third floor. And the fire alarm went off for the second time, and I was making my way to the staircase, and then everyone started screaming and running back. And I almost didn't make it into the classroom, and I'm just -- I'm glad I did. The shots just kept coming and coming. And I thought it was still a drill because they said we were going to have a drill, and then everyone started screaming along with the shots. And I was locked in the classroom on top of a printer for a good hour and a half. (When we were able to leave), I saw bodies everywhere, and there were just splatters on the wall. They actually told us to put our heads down and hands on the people's shoulders in front of us, and it was very hard not to look around at the bullet holes in the wall. The only way to get out of the building was to step in blood and over bodies.\"\n\nCESAR ALVARADO, 18\n\nSCHOOL: Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California\n\nMARCHING IN: Los Angeles\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I am marching for those whose voices have been silenced.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"More gun control in areas that don't have it and banning of assault rifles.\"\n\nHAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING OR OTHER TYPE OF GUN THREAT? \"I have not, but I can sympathize for those who have, and it's just sad to see people's hearts have been broken (because of) gun violence.\"\n\nTALIA RUMSKY, 16\n\nSCHOOL: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\n\nMARCHING IN: Washington, D.C.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"Because we keep chanting, 'Never again,' 'Enough is enough,' 'Never again.' But it's already happened again. It happened in Maryland. There was a shooting in (Napa County, California). So I'm really here to make sure we can make our voices heard; so people are empowered to make sure we vote in legislators so this doesn't happen again; so we can avenge those who were stolen from us because someone thought it was OK to own weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I definitely want people to vote in new legislators that will help us pass bills that will include banning high-capacity magazines, banning certain semi and automatic assault rifles -- and not just focusing on school safety but focusing in on gun violence as a whole.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"The fire alarm went off, and we all thought it was kind of weird because we had one that morning. But then we heard gunshots. ... When we were walking out towards Walmart, we saw an armored SWAT car, and that's when it really hit me that this is something real, this is something (where) people are losing their lives at this very moment.\n\nADRIAN MAYAN, 13\n\nSCHOOL: Sacred Heart Academy in Redlands, California\n\nMARCHING IN: Los Angeles\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here to represent the people who died in the several shootings that happened recently, and I'm here to represent those who can't be here and to make changes in the government.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I hope many government officials are able to open their eyes to change gun laws in this country.\"\n\nMAYA MCENTYRE, 15\n\nSCHOOL: Northville High School in Northville, Michigan\n\nMARCHING IN: Detroit\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm really tired of being afraid at school. When I come to school, I don't want to have to look for the nearest exit.\"\n\nHAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING OR OTHER TYPE OF GUN THREAT? \"My school hasn't had any threats that I know of. ... I don't want to have a problem like that. I want to get to the problem before it gets to me.\"\n\nKAYLA RENERT, 15\n\nSCHOOL: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\n\nMARCHING IN: Washington, D.C.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because I look at the younger kids and I look at the future generations, and I just never want them to have to go through what we went through and to experience what we saw and what we heard.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Better gun laws and legislators voted into office that will actually do something about it and not just tell us, 'What you guys are doing is not going to do anything. It doesn't matter to me. I'm not going for (re-election).' We want people that actually care.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"I remember getting a phone call from one of my best friends. She was in a closet. ... And I just remember her crying hysterically to me, and at that moment, I was heartbroken. I got a picture of one of my good friends. She was shot in the leg. Just seeing it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It didn't feel real.\"\n\nFauria reported from Los Angeles.

                "title": "The Colorado Springs Gazette",
                "body": "ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. (AP) -- Back in World War II when the U.S. and Russia were allied against the Nazis, hundreds of Soviet aviators were trained on the North Carolina coast as part of a secret spy project - but now, an effort to honor their mission has triggered a miniature Cold War in a small American city.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense wants to place a 25-ton bronze monument in Elizabeth City, where the recently declassified \"Project Zebra\" was carried out. Russia would pay for the 13-foot tall monument, with the city footing the bill for improvements to the as-yet undeveloped park on the Pasquotank River where it would be located.\n\nBut amid international tensions and fears about Russian hacking of U.S. elections, Elizabeth City elected officials have rejected a memorandum of understanding that was to be the next step.\n\n\"We are living in troubled times, and people are very concerned about a lot of things,\" council member Anita Hummer said at the meeting where the council voted 5-3 to reject the memorandum. \"And I realize that it's about honoring fallen heroes from World War II, and we have Americans who fought in World War II who are buried in Russia. But times were different then.\"\n\nOne council member warned the monument could be a Trojan horse. Johnnie Walton worries the Russians could put something in it that could be triggered remotely to disrupt the internet or electrical grid.\n\n\"Russia is known for hacking now. They're experts at hacking, and then we've got the largest Coast Guard base (that) can't help anybody because our computers have gone down, because Russia controls our mouse,\" Walton said at a committee meeting, according to The Daily Advance of Elizabeth City.\n\nA Russian-American joint commission on POWs and MIAs wanted the monument in Elizabeth City because of a top-secret WWII operation at U.S. Coast Guard station there. Declassified just a few years ago, Project Zebra helped train about 300 Soviet aviators. Their mission was to find German submarines and bomb them.\n\nOne night in 1945, three Russians, a Ukrainian and a Canadian were killed when a seaplane bound for Russia crashed in the Pasquotank River. Their sacrifice was never publicly recognized and the crash was forgotten for decades.\n\nAfter Project Zebra was declassified in 2013, efforts slowly developed to honor it with a monument, which would include three figures - one each of Soviet, U.S. and United Kingdom aviators.\n\nThe previous city council unanimously approved the statue in May 2017. So supporters were caught off-guard by when the new council backtracked and voted nyet in February - especially because three of the negative votes came from incumbents who had supported it earlier.\n\nLocated in northeastern North Carolina near the Virginia border, Elizabeth City was founded in 1793 and has a population of about 18,000. Locals describe the area as progressive in some ways but also fiscally conservative.\n\nIn 2013, the local Republican Party challenged an African-American college student's candidacy for city council. Eventually, the State Board of Election interceded, and the student ran for office and won.\n\nAnd for what may be the first time, the council's majority is African-American and so is the mayor.\n\nPublic discussion has played out along mostly racial lines; four of the five council members who oppose the monument are black, and two of three who support it are white. At one meeting, council member Darius Horton asked the city manager if Elizabeth City has any monuments to minorities or women.\n\nInformation about the monument didn't filter to the African-American community as well as it did to the white community, said Hezekiah Brown, one of two citizens who spoke against it. Not that he's convinced that more information would matter.\n\n\"We're at war with Russia still. We're in a cyberwar here,\" Brown said. \"They interfered in our election. And they've not said they won't do it again. ... The war has to end. Then you do something. You don't do it while you're at war.\"\n\nFor its part, Russia is sensitive to actions it regards as disrespectful to the Soviet Union's military campaign against Nazi Germany. In 2007, weeks of cyberattacks shut down websites of government ministries, banks and news media in the former Soviet republic of Estonia amid a dispute with Moscow over plans to relocate a statue of a Red Army soldier in the capital Tallinn. Estonian officials accused Russia of orchestrating the onslaught.\n\nElected officials in Elizabeth City also are hearing from citizens such as Rick Boyd, who turned in a petition with 569 local signatures supporting the project. He said another 200 people have signed an online petition. The monument offers the two rival nations a chance \"to show that we worked together in the past, and that we can work together in the future,\" he told the council.\n\nMayor Bettie Parker suggested the vote might have turned out differently if it had happened earlier. \"I keep hearing now is not the time to deal with anything that's coming from Russia,\" said Parker, who only votes in a tie.\n\nCouncil member Billy Caudle, who supports the monument, says people who are concerned about the appearance of an alliance with Russia are \"confusing current events with history.\"\n\nRetired U.S. Air Force Gen. Robert Foglesong, chairman of the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, has asked the city council to reconsider its vote. But for now, the council majority seems steadfast.\n\nMembers complained at their most recent meeting that the monument debate has divided Elizabeth City and they need to concentrate on more important issues. Walton said he was sick of discussing the monument and recommended that it be erected in Russia.\n\n\"Those people's relatives live in Russia,\" he said. \"Give them the opportunity to ride by on a Sunday, say a prayer, do all the things that people do when you're memorializing somebody.\"",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on student-led protests against gun violence (all times Eastern Daylight Time):\n\n3 p.m.\n\nU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio said in a prepared statement Saturday that he supports demonstrators' rights to march at anti-gun rallies across the country, but called for activists to find common ground with opponents.\n\n\"While protests are a legitimate way of making a point, in our system of government, making a change requires finding common ground with those who hold opposing views,\" the Republican from Florida said.\n\nRubio's district includes Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last month. He said that a ban on bump stocks (used to make guns fire more rapidly), improvements to the gun background check system and other efforts were achieved by finding common ground with those who don't want certain gun bans.\n\n\"And finding common ground is what it will take to pass our red flag law so we can take guns away from dangerous people,\" Rubio said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people in cities across the United States are attending \"March for Our Lives\" rallies, calling on lawmakers to enact legislation to help stop school shootings and reduce gun violence.\n\nThousands of people are flooding the streets of downtown Los Angeles to demand stricter gun laws in the U.S.\n\nThe rally was one of several being held across California and the United States on Saturday.\n\nProtesters held signs and chanted as they marched to Los Angeles City Hall for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally.\n\nZoe Lopez, a 15-year-old high school freshman from Garden Grove, said she's attending the rally to demand additional regulations on gun purchases.\n\nIn Sacramento, thousands chanted: \"hey, hey, ho, ho, the NRA has got to go\" as they assembled at the state's capitol.\n\nRallies in Oakland and San Diego also drew hundreds of demonstrators.\n\nSimilar rallies were being held in cities across America to march for gun control and ignite political activism among teenagers.\n\nThe granddaughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. told tens of thousands of \"March for Our Lives\" demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C. that she too has a dream -- for a gun-free world.\n\n\"I have a dream that enough is enough,\" Yolanda Renee King said, referencing her grandfather's famous speech. \"That this should be a gun-free world. Period.\"\n\nThe crowd roared in response. The Washington, D.C. event has thousands thronging Pennsylvania Avenue to hear speakers including survivors of the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and singers like Miley Cyrus.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people attended youth-led, anti-gun rallies across the United States and the world on Saturday, calling on lawmakers to tighten gun control in order to stop mass shootings and gun violence.\n\nHundreds of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School arrived for the Washington, D.C. march on three flights donated by Delta Air Lines.\n\nThey'll return to Florida with Delta after the march too.\n\nThe airline, which broke ties with the National Rifle Association after last month's school shooting that left 17 dead, said they offered the round-trip charter flights \"as part of our commitment to supporting the communities we serve.\n\nAfter the shooting in Parkland, Delta said it would no longer offer discounted fares to NRA members to reflect its neutral status on the gun-control debate.\n\nThe move triggered a backlash from gun advocates, and the state of Georgia killed a proposed tax break on jet fuel in retaliation.\n\nA series of protests held across the United States Saturday in support of gun control is shaping up to be one of the biggest youth protests since the era of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe \"March for Our Lives\" rallies are a call to action by student survivors of last month's school shooting in Florida that left 17 people dead.\n\nAt Washington's \"March for Our Lives\" rally, throngs jammed Pennsylvania Avenue for blocks. Tens of thousands of teenagers and their supporters roared their approval as survivors of the Parkland, Florida, assault spoke from the stage. One of them, Delaney Tarr, laid down the students' central demand, a ban on assault-type weapons, and declared \"We will continue to fight for our dead friends.\"\n\nThe Washington crowd was well into the tens of thousands. A vast crowd also rallied in New York City and large marches unfolded in Boston, Chicago, Houston, Minneapolis and scores of other cities. More than 20,000 rallied in Parkland near the school.\n\nHundreds of thousands of demonstrators at student-led anti-gun rallies held across the United States on Saturday were joined by counterparts the world over.\n\nIn Paris, France about 100 demonstrators rallied near the Eiffel Tower in solidarity with the American \"March for Our Lives\" events.\n\nCaitlin Waters, co-organizer of the Paris event, said it's important for Americans overseas to let Washington know that they want more gun control. Similar rallies were planned in New Zealand, Japan and other countries around the world.\n\nIn the United States, rallies stretched from sea to shining sea, with people marching in huge cities like Los Angeles and New York City as well as in smaller ones like Boise, Idaho and Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nProminent civil rights leader U.S. Rep. John Lewis says that the student-led, anti-gun protests occurring across the United States remind him of the early days of the civil rights era.\n\n\"I think it's amazing,\" Lewis said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"They will be the leaders of the 21st century.\"\n\nLewis joined the \"March for Our Lives\" protest in Atlanta, Georgia, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's Florida school shooting and other mass shootings.\n\nThe Democrat also implored his Republican colleagues in Congress to \"come to the right side\" and to pass meaningful gun-control legislation.\n\nLewis wore a button with a large red letter \"F'' on it, proudly displaying the grade he said he has received from the NRA. Lewis said hundreds of Democratic members of the House were wearing them today.\n\nTens of thousands gathered at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally in New York City on Saturday held a moment of silence to honor 17 people killed during a school shooting in Florida just last month.\n\nSam Hendler, a 16-year-old student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was at the rally to read the victims' names.\n\nAnother MSD student, Meghan Bonner, told the demonstrators that she wasn't surprised when she learned the identity of the shooter because it was obvious something was wrong with him.\n\n\"There was so much more that could have been done to prevent this,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"I want to see change.\"\n\nThe rally in midtown Manhattan is one of several being held across the United States on Saturday in response to gun violence.\n\nThe mayor of Houston, Texas told thousands of demonstrators at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally that adults have a responsibility to protect all children.\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner spoke at the Tranquility Park event Saturday morning, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's school shooting in Florida and other mass shootings.\n\n\"We have a responsibility for those of us as adults, we have a responsibility to stand up and protect our children,\" said Turner.\n\nTurner also chanted with the crowd \"Now is the time\" to \"do the right thing.\"\n\nStudents chanted \"enough is enough\" and held up signs with slogans like \"our ballots will stop bullets\" at a rally in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last month.\n\nMore than 20,000 people filled the park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally Saturday morning.\n\nOthers from the area traveled to Washington, D.C., where the main \"March for Our Lives\" event is being held. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft let over 100 people, including families of victims of the Parkland shooting, use the team's charter plane for the trip.\n\nTeam spokesman Stacey James says astronaut Mark Kelly reached out to Kraft for the favor.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say no to, especially involving these victims,\" James said.\n\nMore than 20,000 people are expected at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally nearest the Florida school where last month's deadly shooting occurred.\n\nPolice presence was heavy early Saturday at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in.\n\nEighteen-year-old Sabrine Brismeur and 17-year-old Eden Kinlock came from schools 20 miles away to pass out water.\n\nKinlock said that may seem \"like a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe White House is applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights\" at gun control marches in Washington and in cities around the nation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says \"keeping our children safe is a top priority\" of President Donald Trump and points to his calls on Congress to pass legislation related to expanded background checks and school safety.\n\nTrump is at his Florida home for the weekend. His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

                "title": "'He fell a hero:\" French praise policeman in hostage swap",
                "body": "TREBES, France (AP) -- The French police officer who swapped himself for a female supermarket employee being held hostage had already received a lifetime of accolades by the time he walked unarmed into the store under attack by an extremist gunman.\n\nKnown for his courage and sang-froid in life, Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame was honored as a national hero Saturday after his death from wounds the day before.\n\nAfter agreeing to the hostage swap, Beltrame surrendered his weapon -- but kept his cellphone on, allowing authorities outside the Super U market in the southern French town of Trebes to hear what was happening inside.\n\nThanks to Beltrame's quick thinking, special police units heard gunshots inside the store Friday and stormed the building immediately, killing the attacker.\n\n\"Beyond his job, he gave his life for someone else, for a stranger,\" his brother, Cedric, told RTL radio in France. \"He was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing ... if we don't describe him as a hero, I don't know what you need to do to be a hero.\"\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" President Emmanuel Macron said. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nThe hostage whose life he saved, an employee named Julie, was in a \"catastrophic state,\" her manager said.\n\nBeltrame's entire career seemed to lead inexorably to the moment when he responded to the attack Friday in Trebes, a 15-minute drive from the gendarme unit he had led since last August.\n\nHe joined France's elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005. A former member of the presidential guard, he earned one of France's highest honors, the Order of Merit, in 2012.\n\nIn December, Beltrame organized a counterterrorism training session for just such a hostage situation -- down to the location in a supermarket. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to the Depeche du Midi newspaper.\n\n\"We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,\" he said then.\n\nIn addition to the four people killed by the gunman Friday, 15 others were injured.\n\nInvestigators searched the home of the attacker, Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, 25, and found what a judicial official said were notes \"that alluded to the Islamic State and appeared like a last testament.\" They also found a computer and a phone.\n\nInside the market itself, investigators found three homemade explosive devices, a handgun and a hunting knife, the official said. He wasn't authorized to speak publicly amid the investigation.\n\nThe weapons suggested an intent to do further damage.\n\nMacron called a special Defense Council meeting with key ministers Saturday to decide the country's next steps in combating terror.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted \"We are with you @EmmanuelMacron!\" and condemned \"the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support.\"\n\nFrench police and soldiers have been a prime target of attacks by extremists, with 10 killed in recent years, including Beltrame. Dozens of others have been wounded.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio that, for her son, \"to defend the homeland\" was \"his reason to live.\"\n\n\"He would have said to me, 'I'm doing my job, Mom, nothing more,'\" she said.\n\nFlowers piled up in front of the Gendarmerie headquarters in the French medieval city of Carcassone to pay tribute to Beltrame. Flags at all gendarmeries were flying at half-staff.\n\nMacron says investigators will focus on finding out how the gunman got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nTwo people have been detained in the case, one woman close to Lakdim and a 17-year-old male friend.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But since 2014, he was also on the Fiche S list, a government register of people suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terror. Despite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. Friday when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing the passenger and wounding the driver, the prosecutor said. Lakdim then fired six shots at police officers who had just finished jogging, hitting one in the shoulder.\n\nShouting \"Allahu akbar!\" -- Arabic for \"God is great\" and declaring he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State,\" he entered the Super U supermarket in Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said. He killed two people in the market and took an unknown number of hostages.\n\nThe supermarket's manager, who would identify herself only as Samia, was in her office when she heard the shots.\n\n\"Call the gendarmes,\" she told her employees. \"There's a terrorist in the store.\"\n\nShe said she helped evacuate as many people as possible. Other people sought safety in the store's meat locker.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to its call to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSamia was overcome by emotion when asked about the attack.\n\n\"I'm utterly devastated. This is really a tragedy. I feel deeply for the victims,\" she said, adding that Beltrame \"is a hero. He saved our colleague - our Julie.\"\n\nThe mayor of Trebes, Eric Menassi, was equally emotional.\n\n\"They all looked death in the eye,\" he said. \"There will be a before and an after. I think nothing will ever be the same.\"\n\nElaine Ganley and Sylvie Corbet in Paris and Renata Brito in Trebes contributed to this story.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on student-led protests against gun violence (all times Eastern Daylight Time):\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nThousands of people are flooding the streets of downtown Los Angeles to demand stricter gun laws in the U.S.\n\nThe rally was one of several being held across California and the United States on Saturday.\n\nProtesters held signs and chanted as they marched to Los Angeles City Hall for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally.\n\nZoe Lopez, a 15-year-old high school freshman from Garden Grove, said she's attending the rally to demand additional regulations on gun purchases.\n\nIn Sacramento, thousands chanted: \"hey, hey, ho, ho, the NRA has got to go\" as they assembled at the state's capitol.\n\nRallies in Oakland and San Diego also drew hundreds of demonstrators.\n\nSimilar rallies were being held in cities across America to march for gun control and ignite political activism among teenagers.\n\nThe granddaughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. told tens of thousands of \"March for Our Lives\" demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C. that she too has a dream - for a gun-free world.\n\n\"I have a dream that enough is enough,\" Yolanda Renee King said, referencing her grandfather's famous speech. \"That this should be a gun-free world. Period.\"\n\nThe crowd roared in response. The Washington, D.C. event has thousands thronging Pennsylvania Avenue to hear speakers including survivors of the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and singers like Miley Cyrus.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people attended youth-led, anti-gun rallies across the United States and the world on Saturday, calling on lawmakers to tighten gun control in order to stop mass shootings and gun violence.\n\nHundreds of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School arrived for the Washington, D.C. march on three flights donated by Delta Air Lines.\n\nThey'll return to Florida with Delta after the march too.\n\nThe airline, which broke ties with the National Rifle Association after last month's school shooting that left 17 dead, said they offered the round-trip charter flights \"as part of our commitment to supporting the communities we serve.\n\nAfter the shooting in Parkland, Delta said it would no longer offer discounted fares to NRA members to reflect its neutral status on the gun-control debate.\n\nThe move triggered a backlash from gun advocates, and the state of Georgia killed a proposed tax break on jet fuel in retaliation.\n\nA series of protests held across the United States Saturday in support of gun control is shaping up to be one of the biggest youth protests since the era of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe \"March for Our Lives\" rallies are a call to action by student survivors of last month's school shooting in Florida that left 17 people dead.\n\nAt Washington's \"March for Our Lives\" rally, throngs jammed Pennsylvania Avenue for blocks. Tens of thousands of teenagers and their supporters roared their approval as survivors of the Parkland, Florida, assault spoke from the stage. One of them, Delaney Tarr, laid down the students' central demand, a ban on assault-type weapons, and declared \"We will continue to fight for our dead friends.\"\n\nThe Washington crowd was well into the tens of thousands. A vast crowd also rallied in New York City and large marches unfolded in Boston, Chicago, Houston, Minneapolis and scores of other cities. More than 20,000 rallied in Parkland near the school.\n\nHundreds of thousands of demonstrators at student-led anti-gun rallies held across the United States on Saturday were joined by counterparts the world over.\n\nIn Paris, France about 100 demonstrators rallied near the Eiffel Tower in solidarity with the American \"March for Our Lives\" events.\n\nCaitlin Waters, co-organizer of the Paris event, said it's important for Americans overseas to let Washington know that they want more gun control. Similar rallies were planned in New Zealand, Japan and other countries around the world.\n\nIn the United States, rallies stretched from sea to shining sea, with people marching in huge cities like Los Angeles and New York City as well as in smaller ones like Boise, Idaho and Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nProminent civil rights leader U.S. Rep. John Lewis says that the student-led, anti-gun protests occurring across the United States remind him of the early days of the civil rights era.\n\n\"I think it's amazing,\" Lewis said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"They will be the leaders of the 21st century.\"\n\nLewis joined the \"March for Our Lives\" protest in Atlanta, Georgia, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's Florida school shooting and other mass shootings.\n\nThe Democrat also implored his Republican colleagues in Congress to \"come to the right side\" and to pass meaningful gun-control legislation.\n\nLewis wore a button with a large red letter \"F'' on it, proudly displaying the grade he said he has received from the NRA. Lewis said hundreds of Democratic members of the House were wearing them today.\n\nTens of thousands gathered at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally in New York City on Saturday held a moment of silence to honor 17 people killed during a school shooting in Florida just last month.\n\nSam Hendler, a 16-year-old student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was at the rally to read the victims' names.\n\nAnother MSD student, Meghan Bonner, told the demonstrators that she wasn't surprised when she learned the identity of the shooter because it was obvious something was wrong with him.\n\n\"There was so much more that could have been done to prevent this,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"I want to see change.\"\n\nThe rally in midtown Manhattan is one of several being held across the United States on Saturday in response to gun violence.\n\nThe mayor of Houston, Texas told thousands of demonstrators at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally that adults have a responsibility to protect all children.\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner spoke at the Tranquility Park event Saturday morning, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's school shooting in Florida and other mass shootings.\n\n\"We have a responsibility for those of us as adults, we have a responsibility to stand up and protect our children,\" said Turner.\n\nTurner also chanted with the crowd \"Now is the time\" to \"do the right thing.\"\n\nStudents chanted \"enough is enough\" and held up signs with slogans like \"our ballots will stop bullets\" at a rally in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last month.\n\nMore than 20,000 people filled the park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally Saturday morning.\n\nOthers from the area traveled to Washington, D.C., where the main \"March for Our Lives\" event is being held. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft let over 100 people, including families of victims of the Parkland shooting, use the team's charter plane for the trip.\n\nTeam spokesman Stacey James says astronaut Mark Kelly reached out to Kraft for the favor.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say no to, especially involving these victims,\" James said.\n\nMore than 20,000 people are expected at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally nearest the Florida school where last month's deadly shooting occurred.\n\nPolice presence was heavy early Saturday at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in.\n\nEighteen-year-old Sabrine Brismeur and 17-year-old Eden Kinlock came from schools 20 miles away to pass out water.\n\nKinlock said that may seem \"like a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe White House is applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights\" at gun control marches in Washington and in cities around the nation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says \"keeping our children safe is a top priority\" of President Donald Trump and points to his calls on Congress to pass legislation related to expanded background checks and school safety.\n\nTrump is at his Florida home for the weekend. His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

                "title": "GOP's congressional stronghold is Democrats' source of hope",
                "body": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A longtime congressional stronghold for Republicans, Pennsylvania is emerging in dramatic fashion as a source of hope for Democrats in their quest to take control of the U.S. House in November's mid-term elections.\n\nThis week cemented Democratic victories in two key battles: Republicans dropped talk of legal challenges to Democrat Conor Lamb's improbable victory in a special election in southwestern Pennsylvania and federal courts rejected two GOP lawsuits seeking to block a state court-drawn map of more competitive districts.\n\nFor years, Pennsylvania has hosted one of the nation's biggest Republican congressional delegations. Now, what had been a 13-to-5 Republican advantage in Pennsylvania's 18-member delegation could get wiped out.\n\nIt's been seven head-spinning months.\n\nFirst, five Republican congressmen decided not to run again, including one -- suburban Pittsburgh's Tim Murphy -- who resigned last October amid a sex scandal. Those openings created opportunities for Democrats.\n\nThen the state Supreme Court, ruling in a gerrymandering lawsuit, junked Pennsylvania's six-year-old district boundaries that were drawn by Republicans to get Republicans elected. The court's Democratic majority redrew the boundaries, improving Democrats' chances in five districts in particular.\n\nAmid all that, Pennsylvania was the nation's political hot spot for a few weeks while Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone competed to fill the remainder of Murphy's term. Party strategists viewed the March 13 special election as a test of Republican strength while President Donald Trump is a divisive force.\n\nLamb's narrow victory in a district that Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in 2016's presidential election sent shivers down Republican spines everywhere as the primary season unfolds.\n\nBy Tuesday night's deadline, 94 people filed signatures to get on May 15's primary election ballot in Pennsylvania's congressional districts. That's more than twice the number who appeared on 2016's primary ballot.\n\nThe redrawn districts overhauled a map in which Trump won 12 of Pennsylvania's 18 districts -- one of them by a fraction of a percentage point -- in 2016. Under the new map, Trump would have won 10.\n\nRepublican and Democratic strategists agree that three Republican congressmen face serious challenges: second-term Ryan Costello, freshman Brian Fitzpatrick and third-term Keith Rothfus.\n\nCostello, who has privately told party brass that he may not run, is in dire straits.\n\nUnder the discarded map, Costello's suburban Philadelphia district had a Republican majority that nevertheless helped Clinton beat Trump there by 2 percentage points in 2016. The redrawn district has slightly more Democrats and Clinton would have won it by 9 percentage points. Democratic challenger Chrissy Houlahan is considered one of the top 33 challengers nationwide by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nFitzpatrick's district was already a swing district, and the court's boundaries made it slightly tougher for a Republican. It now has about 10,000 more Democrats and Clinton would have won it by 2 percentage points. Three Democrats filed petitions to challenge him.\n\nRothfus' 100-mile-long district in western Pennsylvania was redrawn into a tight shape in suburban Pittsburgh. A rock-solid conservative district that Trump won by nearly 21 percentage points is now considered a tossup. Compounding the bad news for Rothfus is that Lamb lives in the district and filed to run there, although Lamb still faces a three-way primary race.\n\nRetiring Republican Rep. Charlie Dent's 80-mile-long district in eastern Pennsylvania was redrawn back into its longtime Allentown-area territory and is considered a tossup. Six Democrats and two Republicans filed to run there.\n\nNow that he isn't running again, Republican Rep. Pat Meehan's seat is expected to fall into Democratic hands. The district -- nicknamed \"Goofy Kicking Donald Duck\" for its contorted boundaries snaking through four counties that Republicans drew to save Meehan from Philadelphia's increasingly liberal suburbs -- was compressed back into its historic Delaware County base. Clinton would have won it by 28 percentage points.\n\nWith that in mind, an eye-popping 14 Democrats filed to run there. Delaware County's Democratic Party chairman David Landau said he couldn't predict who would win.\n\nFor years, the party struggled to find good candidates to challenge Meehan, Landau said.\n\n\"Since Donald Trump became president, no more,\" Landau said. \"Since redistricting, we found even more good candidates.\"\n\nFollow Marc Levy on Twitter at www.twitter.com/timelywriter .",

The AP saw a widely destroyed and empty town.\n\nTurkey launched a ground and air offensive on Jan. 20 codenamed Olive Branch to oust the main Syrian Kurdish militia known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG, from Afrin. Turkey considers the YPG a terror group and an extension of Kurdish rebels waging an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials and the country's state media said the Turkish offensive displaced more than 200,000 people from their homes.\n\nIn Afrin's town center, captured Sunday, allied Syrian forces patrolled the streets as Turkish tanks and armored personnel carriers drove past.\n\nIsmail Montaser Billah, a Syrian fighter, said the YPG withdrew from Afrin after resisting the offensive. \"They had left mines but thank God we took (the town) and we will step on their heads God willing,\" he said. Turkish and Syrian opposition flags were flying in the area.\n\nCivilians, including women and children, were out and about in central Afrin. Abdul-Rahman Mohammed, a civilian, said the YPG mistreated locals who did not cooperate with them. \"We are suffering because of a lack of food and water,\" he added.\n\nThe Turkish Red Crescent distributed food and aid in Afrin. Kerem Kinik, the organization's president, said some 100,000 civilians remained in and around Afrin.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on student-led protests against gun violence (all times Eastern Daylight Time):\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nThousands of people are flooding the streets of downtown Los Angeles to demand stricter gun laws in the U.S.\n\nThe rally was one of several being held across California and the United States on Saturday.\n\nProtesters held signs and chanted as they marched to Los Angeles City Hall for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally.\n\nZoe Lopez, a 15-year-old high school freshman from Garden Grove, said she's attending the rally to demand additional regulations on gun purchases.\n\nIn Sacramento, thousands chanted: \"hey, hey, ho, ho, the NRA has got to go\" as they assembled at the state's capitol.\n\nRallies in Oakland and San Diego also drew hundreds of demonstrators.\n\nSimilar rallies were being held in cities across America to march for gun control and ignite political activism among teenagers.\n\nThe granddaughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. told tens of thousands of \"March for Our Lives\" demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C. that she too has a dream - for a gun-free world.\n\n\"I have a dream that enough is enough,\" Yolanda Renee King said, referencing her grandfather's famous speech. \"That this should be a gun-free world. Period.\"\n\nThe crowd roared in response. The Washington, D.C. event has thousands thronging Pennsylvania Avenue to hear speakers including survivors of the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and singers like Miley Cyrus.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people attended youth-led, anti-gun rallies across the United States and the world on Saturday, calling on lawmakers to tighten gun control in order to stop mass shootings and gun violence.\n\nHundreds of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School arrived for the Washington, D.C. march on three flights donated by Delta Air Lines.\n\nThey'll return to Florida with Delta after the march too.\n\nThe airline, which broke ties with the National Rifle Association after last month's school shooting that left 17 dead, said they offered the round-trip charter flights \"as part of our commitment to supporting the communities we serve.\n\nAfter the shooting in Parkland, Delta said it would no longer offer discounted fares to NRA members to reflect its neutral status on the gun-control debate.\n\nThe move triggered a backlash from gun advocates, and the state of Georgia killed a proposed tax break on jet fuel in retaliation.\n\nA series of protests held across the United States Saturday in support of gun control is shaping up to be one of the biggest youth protests since the era of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe \"March for Our Lives\" rallies are a call to action by student survivors of last month's school shooting in Florida that left 17 people dead.\n\nAt Washington's \"March for Our Lives\" rally, throngs jammed Pennsylvania Avenue for blocks. Tens of thousands of teenagers and their supporters roared their approval as survivors of the Parkland, Florida, assault spoke from the stage. One of them, Delaney Tarr, laid down the students' central demand, a ban on assault-type weapons, and declared \"We will continue to fight for our dead friends.\"\n\nThe Washington crowd was well into the tens of thousands. A vast crowd also rallied in New York City and large marches unfolded in Boston, Chicago, Houston, Minneapolis and scores of other cities. More than 20,000 rallied in Parkland near the school.\n\nHundreds of thousands of demonstrators at student-led anti-gun rallies held across the United States on Saturday were joined by counterparts the world over.\n\nIn Paris, France about 100 demonstrators rallied near the Eiffel Tower in solidarity with the American \"March for Our Lives\" events.\n\nCaitlin Waters, co-organizer of the Paris event, said it's important for Americans overseas to let Washington know that they want more gun control. Similar rallies were planned in New Zealand, Japan and other countries around the world.\n\nIn the United States, rallies stretched from sea to shining sea, with people marching in huge cities like Los Angeles and New York City as well as in smaller ones like Boise, Idaho and Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nProminent civil rights leader U.S. Rep. John Lewis says that the student-led, anti-gun protests occurring across the United States remind him of the early days of the civil rights era.\n\n\"I think it's amazing,\" Lewis said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"They will be the leaders of the 21st century.\"\n\nLewis joined the \"March for Our Lives\" protest in Atlanta, Georgia, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's Florida school shooting and other mass shootings.\n\nThe Democrat also implored his Republican colleagues in Congress to \"come to the right side\" and to pass meaningful gun-control legislation.\n\nLewis wore a button with a large red letter \"F'' on it, proudly displaying the grade he said he has received from the NRA. Lewis said hundreds of Democratic members of the House were wearing them today.\n\nTens of thousands gathered at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally in New York City on Saturday held a moment of silence to honor 17 people killed during a school shooting in Florida just last month.\n\nSam Hendler, a 16-year-old student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was at the rally to read the victims' names.\n\nAnother MSD student, Meghan Bonner, told the demonstrators that she wasn't surprised when she learned the identity of the shooter because it was obvious something was wrong with him.\n\n\"There was so much more that could have been done to prevent this,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"I want to see change.\"\n\nThe rally in midtown Manhattan is one of several being held across the United States on Saturday in response to gun violence.\n\nThe mayor of Houston, Texas told thousands of demonstrators at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally that adults have a responsibility to protect all children.\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner spoke at the Tranquility Park event Saturday morning, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's school shooting in Florida and other mass shootings.\n\n\"We have a responsibility for those of us as adults, we have a responsibility to stand up and protect our children,\" said Turner.\n\nTurner also chanted with the crowd \"Now is the time\" to \"do the right thing.\"\n\nStudents chanted \"enough is enough\" and held up signs with slogans like \"our ballots will stop bullets\" at a rally in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last month.\n\nMore than 20,000 people filled the park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally Saturday morning.\n\nOthers from the area traveled to Washington, D.C., where the main \"March for Our Lives\" event is being held. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft let over 100 people, including families of victims of the Parkland shooting, use the team's charter plane for the trip.\n\nTeam spokesman Stacey James says astronaut Mark Kelly reached out to Kraft for the favor.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say no to, especially involving these victims,\" James said.\n\nMore than 20,000 people are expected at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally nearest the Florida school where last month's deadly shooting occurred.\n\nPolice presence was heavy early Saturday at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in.\n\nEighteen-year-old Sabrine Brismeur and 17-year-old Eden Kinlock came from schools 20 miles away to pass out water.\n\nKinlock said that may seem \"like a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe White House is applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights\" at gun control marches in Washington and in cities around the nation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says \"keeping our children safe is a top priority\" of President Donald Trump and points to his calls on Congress to pass legislation related to expanded background checks and school safety.\n\nTrump is at his Florida home for the weekend. His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

                "body": "AFRIN, Syria (AP) -- The Turkish army and Syrian opposition fighters it backs have \"total control\" of the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in northern Syria, according to the country's official news agency on Saturday, nearly a week after they captured the main town that carries the same name.\n\nAnadolu news agency said the Turkish military was continuing its sweep for mines and explosives to allow Afrin's resident's to return, following airstrikes and clashes with Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nAssociated Press journalists on a press tour organized by the Turkish government Saturday passed through the northwestern town of Jinderes en route to central Afrin.\n\nJinderes, captured by Turkey and allied Syrian opposition fighters, was the scene of heavy street clashes earlier in March. The AP saw a widely destroyed and empty town.\n\nTurkey launched a ground and air offensive on Jan. 20 codenamed Olive Branch to oust the main Syrian Kurdish militia known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG, from Afrin. Turkey considers the YPG a terror group and an extension of Kurdish rebels waging an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials and the country's state media said the Turkish offensive displaced more than 200,000 people from their homes.\n\nIn Afrin's town center, captured Sunday, allied Syrian forces patrolled the streets as Turkish tanks and armored personnel carriers drove past.\n\nIsmail Montaser Billah, a Syrian fighter, said the YPG withdrew from Afrin after resisting the offensive. \"They had left mines but thank God we took (the town) and we will step on their heads God willing,\" he said. Turkish and Syrian opposition flags were flying in the area.\n\nCivilians, including women and children, were out and about in central Afrin. Abdul-Rahman Mohammed, a civilian, said the YPG mistreated locals who did not cooperate with them. \"We are suffering because of a lack of food and water,\" he added.\n\nThe Turkish Red Crescent distributed food and aid in Afrin. Kerem Kinik, the organization's president, said some 100,000 civilians remained in and around Afrin.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Summoned to action by student survivors of the Florida school shooting, hundreds of thousands of teenagers and their supporters rallied in the nation's capital and cities across America on Saturday to press for gun control in one of the biggest youth protests since the Vietnam era.\n\n\"If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking,\" David Hogg, a survivor who has emerged as one of the student leaders of the movement, told the roaring crowd of demonstrators at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington.\n\nHe warned: \"We will get rid of these public servants who only care about the gun lobby.\"\n\nChanting \"Vote them out!\" and bearing signs reading \"We Are the Change,\" ''No More Silence\" and \"Keep NRA Money Out of Politics,\" the protesters packed Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House.\n\nLarge rallies with crowds estimated in the tens of thousands in some cases also unfolded in such cities as Boston; New York; Los Angeles; Chicago; Houston; Fort Worth, Texas; Minneapolis; and Parkland, Florida, the site of the Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead.\n\nProtesters denounced the National Rifle Association and its allies and complained that they are scared of getting shot in school and tired of inaction by grown-ups after one mass shooting after another.\n\nThey called for such measures as a ban on high-capacity magazines and assault-type rifles like the one used by the Florida killer, tighter background checks and school security, and a raising of the age to buy guns.\n\n\"I'm really tired of being afraid at school,\" said Maya McEntyre, a 15-year-old high school freshman from Northville, Michigan, who joined a march by thousands in Detroit. \"When I come to school, I don't want to have to look for the nearest exit.\"\n\nShe added: \"I want to get to the problem before it gets to me.\"\n\nIn Atlanta, Ben Stewart, a 17-year-old senior at Shiloh Hills Christian School in Kennesaw, Georgia, took part in a march in Atlanta to press for what he called \"common-sense gun laws.\"\n\n\"People have been dying since 1999 in Columbine and nothing has changed. People are still dying,\" Stewart said. \"It could be prevented.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump was in Florida for the weekend. A motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club in the morning. As of early afternoon, he had yet to weigh in on Twitter about the protests.\n\nThe NRA went silent on Twitter in the morning, in contrast to its reaction to the nationwide school walkouts against gun violence March 14, when it tweeted a photo of an assault rifle and the message \"I'll control my own guns, thank you.\"\n\nAbout 30 gun-rights supporters staged a counter-demonstration in front of FBI headquarters in Washington, standing quietly with signs such as \"Armed Victims Live Longer\" and \"Stop Violating Civil Rights.\"\n\nOrganizers of the gun-control rally in the nation's capital hoped their protest would match in numbers and spirit last year's women's march, which far exceeded predictions of 300,000 demonstrators.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for our dead friends,\" Delaney Tarr, another survivor of the Florida tragedy, declared from the stage. The crowd roared with approval as she laid down the students' central demand: a ban on \"weapons of war\" for all but warriors.\n\nThe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 9-year-old granddaughter Yolanda Renee King gave a rousing speech at the Washington rally, drawing from the civil rights leader's most famous words.\n\n\"I have a dream that enough is enough,\" she said. \"That this should be a gun-free world. Period.\"\n\nIn Parkland, the police presence was heavy as more than 20,000 people filled a park near the school, chanting slogans such as \"Enough is enough\" and carrying signs that read \"Why do your guns matter more than our lives?\" and \"Our ballots will stop bullets.\"\n\nGun violence was also fresh for some in the Washington crowd: Ayanne Johnson of Great Mills High in Maryland held a sign declaring, \"I March for Jaelynn,\" honoring Jaelynn Willey, who died Thursday two days after being shot by a classmate at the school. The classmate also died.\n\nRallying outside the New Hampshire Statehouse in Concord, 17-year-old Leeza Richter said: \"Our government will do more to stop us from walking out than it will to stop a gunman from walking in.\"\n\nSince the bloodshed in Florida, students have tapped into a current of gun control sentiment that has been building for years -- yet still faces a powerful foe in the NRA and its supporters.\n\nOrganizers hope the passions of the crowds and the under-18 roster of speakers will translate into a tipping point starting with the midterm congressional elections this fall. In addition to pushing for tighter gun laws, the students have been working to register young people to vote.\n\nPolls indicate public opinion in the U.S. may be shifting on the issue.\n\nA new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the U.S. should be tightened. That is up from 61 percent in 2016 and 55 percent in 2013.\n\nOverall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun laws.\n\nAt the same time, the poll found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action.\n\nAssociated Press writers Terry Spencer in Parkland, Florida; Jacob Jordan in Atlanta; Ed White in Detroit; Ben Nadler in Atlanta; and Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this report.",

                "body": "ROME (AP) -- Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni formally resigned Saturday following the election of new parliament speakers, but was immediately asked by the president to stay on while the country's political factions jostle to try to form a new government.\n\nItaly's inconclusive March 4 election saw a surge in populist and right-wing sentiment but produced no majority in parliament.\n\nThe transition of power got underway in earnest Saturday after lawmakers voted to give the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement the leadership of one chamber of parliament and Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia leadership of the other.\n\nForza Italia Sen. Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati, a longtime Berlusconi ally, became the first woman to be elected Senate president. In an emotional acceptance speech, she said she wanted to share the victory with \"all the women whose histories, actions, examples, commitment and courage have built Italy today.\"\n\nThe 5-Stars' Roberto Fico was elected president of the lower Chamber of Deputies.\n\nTheir elections followed reports overnight of a perceived split between Berlusconi and the League of Matteo Salvini, the main parties in the center-right bloc. But by Saturday, Berlusconi and Salvini were talking only about the solidity of their bloc and their wish to govern Italy.\n\nNevertheless, there was still no solid indication that either of the two biggest vote-getters from the March 4 election -- the center-right and the 5-Stars -- was any closer to forming a government.\n\nNegotiations on forming a coalition government are expected to last weeks. At some point, President Sergio Mattarella will decide which bloc, if any, is able to command the 51 percent majority in each chamber necessary to pass a confidence vote.\n\nIf no party or group can cobble together a working majority, Mattarella could sponsor a person with a limited mandate and term to govern. That could eventually lead to an early election if all options fail.",

                "title": "Thousands expected to leave second pocket in Syria's Ghouta",
                "body": "BEIRUT (AP) -- Some 7,000 members of a rebel group and their relatives were preparing to leave eastern Ghouta to opposition-held areas north of the country Saturday as part of an agreement to evacuate the second of three pockets held by opposition fighters east of the capital Damascus, Syria's state media reported.\n\nThe expected departure comes a day after an agreement was reached between Faylaq al-Rahman, the second most powerful rebel group in eastern Ghouta, and the Russians to surrender the second of three pockets in eastern Ghouta, where rebels have been holding up over the past years.\n\nEarly on Saturday, bulldozers removed giant sand barriers from a main road in the town of Harasta that will be used by the rebels and their relatives to make their way to the country's north.\n\nThe government-controlled Syrian Central Military Media said a corridor is being prepared for Faylaq al-Rahman members and their relatives to leave the towns of Zamalka, Arbeen, Ein Tarma and Jobar.\n\nThe evacuations come after thousands streamed out of Harasta, the first pocket after a similar negotiated deal for the evacuation of armed fighters and civilians. On Friday night, Harasta was void of rebels for the first time in six years.\n\n\"The city of Harasta in eastern Ghouta is free of terrorism,\" SCMM said referring to opposition fighters that the government refers to as terrorists.\n\nFaylaq al-Rahman said in a statement Friday that the deal will lead to the immediate evacuation of sick and wounded people for treatment and to allow aid to enter the besieged area.\n\nThe group added that opposition fighters and their relatives who decide to leave eastern Ghouta will head to rebel-held parts of northern Syria while civilians who choose to stay will be guaranteed safety.\n\nIt said that Russian military police will deploy in Faylaq al-Rahman-controlled areas including the Arbeen, Zamalka, Ein Tarma and Jobar. A prisoner exchange will take place between the group and the government, the group added.\n\nEight government supporters released by Faylaq al-Rahman told state TV about the mistreatment they were subjected to while being held underground and given little food and water. One of those released, whose left eye appeared closed in the report, said \"they hit me on the eye damaging it.\"\n\nAnother person released said \"they used to beat us, keep us hungry and place us underground in the cold and we did not know when they would kill us.\"\n\nSyrian state TV said Faylaq al-Rahman will hand over maps of underground tunnels as well as others marking mines planted by the group in areas it controlled.\n\nOn Feb. 18, a concerted military offensive, backed by Russian airstrikes, squeezed the rebels and civilians in the area under an intense bombing campaign and tightened the siege. The U.N. estimated that nearly 400,000 people remained in the enclave before the latest offensive began.\n\nThe government assault triggered a mass movement of people trying to escape the violence in the Damascus suburbs. Some have moved deeper into the rebel-held enclave, while 105,000 others have crossed the front lines toward government-controlled areas or left to rebel-held parts in northern Syria, according to state news agency SANA.\n\nThe government's crushing offensive killed nearly 1,500 people and wounded more than 5,000, according to opposition activists.\n\nAfter the departure of Faylaq al-Rahman fighters, the only rebel-held pocket in eastern Ghouta will be the town of Douma which is controlled by the powerful Army of Islam group.\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds more left Douma to government-controlled areas including 700 government supporters that the rebel group had been holding for years, according to SCMM.\n\nIn the rebel-held northwestern city of Idlib, a car bomb exploded near a court building killing at least six people and wounding 25, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the opposition's Syrian Civil Defense.\n\nIn the capital Damascus, a mortar shell hit the Fayhaa soccer stadium, killing footballer Samir Massoud, who used to play for the Army Club, and wounding six other people.\n\nThe French Presidency said in a statement Saturday that President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan the day before and French leader said he \"had very clearly expressed\" his concerns as soon as the Turkish military operation in the Kurdish Syrian enclave of Afrin started.\n\n\"Nothing must lead to weakening the pressure\" on what is left of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, Macron said.\n\nTurkey launched an operation in Afrin to clear it of Syrian Kurdish militia, which Turkey considers to be a security threat, on Jan. 20. It captured the town of Afrin in a major phase of the offensive on Sunday.\n\nTurkey's official Anadolu news agency cited the army Saturday, saying \"complete control\" has been established in the Afrin region. It said the military was continuing its sweep for mines and explosives to allow Afrin's residents to return.\n\nMacron agreed with Erdogan to pursue \"deep and intense\" discussions in coming days about Syria, the French presidency's statement added.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sylvie Corbet in Paris and Zeynep Bilginsoy in Istanbul contributed to this report.",

And I thought it was still a drill because they said we were going to have a drill, and then everyone started screaming along with the shots. And I was locked in the classroom on top of a printer for a good hour and a half. (When we were able to leave), I saw bodies everywhere, and there were just splatters on the wall. They actually told us to put our heads down and hands on the people's shoulders in front of us, and it was very hard not to look around at the bullet holes in the wall.

La ruta pasa adem? junto al Trump International Hotel. El presidente Donald Trump estaba en Florida el fin de semana.\n\nLa violencia con armas de fuego es algo reciente para algunos en la muchedumbre en Washington: Ayanne Johnson, de la Escuela Secundaria Great Mills, en Maryland, llevaba un cartel que dec? \"Marcho por Jaelynn\", en honor a Jaelynn Willey, quien muri?el jueves, dos d?s despu? de ser baleada por un compa?ro de escuela. Un adolescente fue herido en el ataque y el atacante muri?\n\nTras la masacre del 14 de febrero en la Escuela Secundaria Marjory Stoneman Douglas en Parkland, Florida, los estudiantes han accedido a una corriente pro control de armas que ha estado creciendo con los a?s _ pero que a?n enfrenta una poderosa oposici? de los defensores del derecho de posesi? de armas.\n\nUnos 30 partidarios de la tenencia irrestricta de armas realizaron una contramanifestaci? frente a la sede del FBI, de pie en silencio, con carteles que dec?n \"Los que est? armados son los que sobreviven\" y \"Dejen de violar nuestros derechos civiles\".\n\nLos organizadores de la marcha contra la violencia esperan que las pasiones de las muchedumbres y su alineaci? de oradores adolescentes se vuelva un momento decisivo a partir de las elecciones legislativas de noviembre.\n\nEn Atlanta, Georgia, el legislador dem?rata John Lewis dijo que la movilizaci? le recordaba los tiempos de las marchas por los derechos civiles, en las cuales fue un dirigente destacado.\n\n\"Es asombroso. Ellos (los j?enes) ser? los dirigentes del siglo XXI\" dijo a la AP Lewis, quien luc? con orgullo un bot? con una gran letra F, la calificaci? reprobatoria que le otorg?la Asociaci? Nacional del Rifle (NRA).\n\nMuchas personas se congregaron tambi? en una marcha cerca de la escuela en Parkland donde murieron 17 personas. La presencia policial era considerable all? mientras los organizadores preparaban el sitio y los manifestantes comenzaban a llegar. Con las consignas de \"Basta ya\" y \"Nuestras boletas (electorales) detendr? las balas\", unas 20.000 personas se concentraron en el lugar.\n\nOtras personas de la zona fueron a la marcha central en Washington. El due? del equipo de f?tbol americano New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, cedi?el avi? del equipo para el viaje por pedido del astronauta Mark Kelly.\n\n\"Es dif?il decir que no a algo as? sobre todo por tratarse de estas v?timas\", dijo la vocera del equipo, Stacey James.\n\nUn nuevo sondeo The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research encontr?que 69% de los estadounidenses piensan que las leyes de control de armas en el pa? deben ser m? estrictas.",

                "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Alexis Jennings scored 20 points, A'ja Wilson added 20 points and 13 rebounds, and South Carolina beat Buffalo 79-63 on Saturday to keep alive its quest to defend its title.\n\nSecond-seeded South Carolina (29-6), whose only losses this year have come against ranked teams, will face the winner of the other Sweet 16 matchup in the Albany Region between top-seeded and unbeaten UConn and Duke, who played later Saturday.\n\nUpstart Buffalo (29-6), just the third Mid-American Conference school to reach the Sweet 16, was among the final four teams to earn an at-large berth. It was the program's second tournament appearance after a first-round exit two years ago.\n\nThe Gamecocks, who have won six straight, defeated North Carolina A&T and Virginia by double digits in the first two rounds, holding both to under 60 points as they stayed on track to make a third Final Four in four seasons. But those performances had flaws - 19 turnovers in one - that coach Dawn Staley focused on correcting. They didn't on Saturday - South Carolina had 26 turnovers - but in the end it didn't matter.\n\nCierra Dillard led Buffalo with 29 points, the only player in double figures.\n\nThe Gamecocks led 55-48 entering the fourth quarter, and the Bulls stayed with them, closing to 60-54 on Dillard's driving layup off the glass with 6:38 left. But Buffalo missed three straight shots and a fast-break layup by Doniyah Cliney gave South Carolina a 10-point lead with just over 5 minutes to go.\n\nBuffalo is a senior-dominated team and has players from around the globe - four from Australia, a couple of Canadians, one from Nigeria - as well as Buffalo-area locals. That melting pot of sorts had created a close-knit group and they helped contribute to the madness of March that has seen 11th seeds wreak havoc on brackets. The 11th-seeded Bulls had already vanquished sixth-seeded South Florida (102-79) and third-seeded Florida State (86-65) - on the Seminoles home court, no less.\n\nBuffalo coach Felisha Legette-Jack, who nearly quit coaching after being fired by Indiana, had said her Bulls were \"too silly and quirky to be afraid\" and their late-season rush proved it. The Bulls had lost only once in 13 games, the lone setback coming against Central Michigan in the MAC Tournament two weeks ago. That was one of two setbacks to CMU, which won the MAC title and also reached the Sweet 16.\n\nThe Bulls quickly proved they belonged on the big stage, forging a 7-0 run early against the Gamecocks. Dillard's 3 from the left wing gave Buffalo a 10-6 lead midway through the first quarter. South Carolina missed three layups and committed eight turnovers in the period but only trailed 17-16 at the end of the period despite taking six fewer shots than the Bulls.\n\nAs they often did during the season, the Bulls attacked repeatedly from beyond the arc and stayed close until the waning minutes before halftime.\n\nA three-point play by freshman LeLe Grissett began a 12-2 run by the Gamecocks as they continued to attack relentlessly inside. A 3 from left wing by Tyasha Harris and a layup by Jennings gave South Carolina a 40-28 lead.\n\nAfter a layup by Dillard gave Buffalo a one-point lead with 5:50 left in the first half, the Bulls missed five times and committed a turnover before Stephanie Reid hit her only basket of the opening two periods - a 3 with 6.4 seconds left.\n\nAND THEN THERE WAS ONE\n\nStaley and Legette-Jack were the last two African American coaches in the tournament, which started with 10.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nBuffalo: Legette-Jack made her sixth season at the helm of the Bulls one to remember. The program made its first trip to the Sweet 16. Only one 11 seed has ever advanced to a regional final, Gonzaga in 2011 with a seven-point win over Louisville. The Bulls lose three senior starters who were instrumental in setting a school record for victories. They also went 12-0 at home and, and posted 21 victories decided by at least 10 points, a high bar to match.\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks move on to the Elite Eight but their penchant for mistakes will have to be fixed to have a chance to reach the Final Four.\n\nSouth Carolina will play either UConn or Duke in the regional final on Monday night.",

But then, when we were walking out towards Walmart, we saw an armored SWAT car, and that's when it really hit me that this is something real, this is something (where) people are losing their lives at this very moment.\n\nCECILIA MCCOY, 17\n\nSCHOOL: Assumption High School in Louisville, Kentucky\n\nMARCHING IN: Washington, D.C.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here for the students, for gun control - honestly just for everyone. This is not just for students. Everywhere you go, there is a threat of guns.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Stricter gun laws and to get rid of assault rifles.\"\n\nHAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING OR OTHER TYPE OF GUN THREAT? \"No, but in Kentucky there have been multiple school threats. In Marshall County, there was one. I wasn't there, but I knew people that go there, so it did affect home.\"\n\nCHARLIE SHEBS, 16\n\nSCHOOL: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\n\nMARCHING IN: Washington, D.C.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because previous generations couldn't do what we're doing right now. And we want to make this time the last time. So if that means marching all over the world, then I want to be a part of it.\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I want to see safer schools. I don't want to hear that kids don't feel safe at schools. ... I want to see change in gun laws, and I want to see control. We're giving it to people who, it's just not safe. There's no other way to put it, really.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"I was in the freshman building on the third floor. And the fire alarm went off for the second time, and I was making my way to the staircase, and then everyone started screaming and running back. And I almost didn't make it into the classroom, and I'm just - I'm glad I did. The shots just kept coming and coming. And I thought it was still a drill because they said we were going to have a drill, and then everyone started screaming along with the shots. And I was locked in the classroom on top of a printer for a good hour and a half. (When we were able to leave), I saw bodies everywhere, and there were just splatters on the wall. They actually told us to put our heads down and hands on the people's shoulders in front of us, and it was very hard not to look around at the bullet holes in the wall. The only way to get out of the building was to step in blood and over bodies.\"\n\nBEN STEWART, 17\n\nSCHOOL: Shiloh Hills Christian School in Kennesaw, Georgia\n\nMARCHING IN: Atlanta\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"People have been dying since 1999 in Columbine, and nothing has changed. People are still dying. Columbine isn't even on the top 10 list of mass shootings in America. Something needs to change.\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I'd like to see commonsense gun laws introduced. It would be preferable if there was a semi-automatic rifle ban. ... If you look at ... school shootings, the majority of them are with legally purchased weapons. So yeah, criminals will get weapons, but you could still do something. It's better than doing nothing.\"\n\nZOE BONNER, 16\n\nSCHOOL: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\n\nMARCHING IN: Washington, D.C.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here today because it happened to our school, and it shouldn't have happened. It shouldn't have happened anywhere, and we feel like it's time to make change and get gun reform.\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Banning military-style weapons and more protections for our schools.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"At first nobody really knew what it was because the fire drill had went off. So most people were going out for the fire drill, and then people heard the code red, but some people heard it too late. So it was just a lot of confusion. And then after, it was just mostly shock hearing how many people died and how quickly it happened.\"\n\nCESAR ALVARADO, 18\n\nSCHOOL: Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California\n\nMARCHING IN: Los Angeles\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I am marching for those whose voices have been silenced.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"More gun control in areas that don't have it and banning of assault rifles.\"\n\nHAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING OR OTHER TYPE OF GUN THREAT? \"I have not, but I can sympathize for those who have, and it's just sad to see people's hearts have been broken (because of) gun violence.\"\n\nADRIAN MAYAN, 13\n\nSCHOOL: Sacred Heart Academy in Redlands, California\n\nMARCHING IN: Los Angeles\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here to represent the people who died in the several shootings that happened recently, and I'm here to represent those who can't be here and to make changes in the government.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I hope many government officials are able to open their eyes to change gun laws in this country.\"\n\nKAYLA RENERT, 15\n\nSCHOOL: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\n\nMARCHING IN: Washington, D.C.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because I look at the younger kids and I look at the future generations, and I just never want them to have to go through what we went through and to experience what we saw and what we heard. ... I feel there really needs to be a change. And we keep saying, 'Oh, this is going to be the last time,' but there's already been another time.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Better gun laws and legislators voted into office that will actually do something about it and not just tell us, 'What you guys are doing is not going to do anything. It doesn't matter to me. I'm not going for (re-election).' We want people that actually care.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"I remember getting a phone call from one of my best friends. She was in a closet. ... And I just remember her crying hysterically to me, and at that moment, I was heartbroken. I got a picture of one of my good friends. She was shot in the leg. Just seeing it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It didn't feel real.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Andrew Harnik and Alex Brandon in Washington; Krysta Fauria in Los Angeles; and Ben Nadler in Atlanta contributed to this report.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on student-led protests against gun violence (all times Eastern Daylight Time):\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nA series of protests held across the United States Saturday in support of gun control is shaping up to be one of the biggest youth protests since the era of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe \"March for Our Lives\" rallies are a call to action by student survivors of last month's school shooting in Florida that left 17 people dead.\n\nAt Washington's \"March for Our Lives\" rally, throngs jammed Pennsylvania Avenue for blocks. Tens of thousands of teenagers and their supporters roared their approval as survivors of the Parkland, Florida, assault spoke from the stage. One of them, Delaney Tarr, laid down the students' central demand, a ban on assault-type weapons, and declared \"We will continue to fight for our dead friends.\"\n\nThe Washington crowd was well into the tens of thousands. A vast crowd also rallied in New York City and large marches unfolded in Boston, Chicago, Houston, Minneapolis and scores of other cities. More than 20,000 rallied in Parkland near the school.\n\nHundreds of thousands of demonstrators at student-led anti-gun rallies held across the United States on Saturday were joined by counterparts the world over.\n\nIn Paris, France about 100 demonstrators rallied near the Eiffel Tower in solidarity with the American \"March for Our Lives\" events.\n\nCaitlin Waters, co-organizer of the Paris event, said it's important for Americans overseas to let Washington know that they want more gun control. Similar rallies were planned in New Zealand, Japan and other countries around the world.\n\nIn the United States, rallies stretched from sea to shining sea, with people marching in huge cities like Los Angeles and New York City as well as in smaller ones like Boise, Idaho and Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nProminent civil rights leader U.S. Rep. John Lewis says that the student-led, anti-gun protests occurring across the United States remind him of the early days of the civil rights era.\n\n\"I think it's amazing,\" Lewis said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"They will be the leaders of the 21st century.\"\n\nLewis joined the \"March for Our Lives\" protest in Atlanta, Georgia, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's Florida school shooting and other mass shootings.\n\nThe Democrat also implored his Republican colleagues in Congress to \"come to the right side\" and to pass meaningful gun-control legislation.\n\nLewis wore a button with a large red letter \"F'' on it, proudly displaying the grade he said he has received from the NRA. Lewis said hundreds of Democratic members of the House were wearing them today.\n\nTens of thousands gathered at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally in New York City on Saturday held a moment of silence to honor 17 people killed during a school shooting in Florida just last month.\n\nSam Hendler, a 16-year-old student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was at the rally to read the victims' names.\n\nAnother MSD student, Meghan Bonner, told the demonstrators that she wasn't surprised when she learned the identity of the shooter because it was obvious something was wrong with him.\n\n\"There was so much more that could have been done to prevent this,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"I want to see change.\"\n\nThe rally in midtown Manhattan is one of several being held across the United States on Saturday in response to gun violence.\n\nThe mayor of Houston, Texas told thousands of demonstrators at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally that adults have a responsibility to protect all children.\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner spoke at the Tranquility Park event Saturday morning, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's school shooting in Florida and other mass shootings.\n\n\"We have a responsibility for those of us as adults, we have a responsibility to stand up and protect our children,\" said Turner.\n\nTurner also chanted with the crowd \"Now is the time\" to \"do the right thing.\"\n\nStudents chanted \"enough is enough\" and held up signs with slogans like \"our ballots will stop bullets\" at a rally in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last month.\n\nMore than 20,000 people filled the park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally Saturday morning.\n\nOthers from the area traveled to Washington, D.C., where the main \"March for Our Lives\" event is being held. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft let over 100 people, including families of victims of the Parkland shooting, use the team's charter plane for the trip.\n\nTeam spokesman Stacey James says astronaut Mark Kelly reached out to Kraft for the favor.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say no to, especially involving these victims,\" James said.\n\nMore than 20,000 people are expected at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally nearest the Florida school where last month's deadly shooting occurred.\n\nPolice presence was heavy early Saturday at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in.\n\nEighteen-year-old Sabrine Brismeur and 17-year-old Eden Kinlock came from schools 20 miles away to pass out water.\n\nKinlock said that may seem \"like a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe White House is applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights\" at gun control marches in Washington and in cities around the nation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says \"keeping our children safe is a top priority\" of President Donald Trump and points to his calls on Congress to pass legislation related to expanded background checks and school safety.\n\nTrump is at his Florida home for the weekend. His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

                "title": "Catalonia's parliament suspends vote on jailed candidate",
                "body": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- The speaker of Catalonia's parliament suspended a scheduled vote Saturday to elect a jailed separatist leader as the new regional president of the restive northeastern corner of Spain.\n\nSpeaker Roger Torrent communicated his decision to the heads of the different parties moments before he announced to the chamber that there would be no vote on the candidacy of Jordi Turull, a former regional minister.\n\nTurull was one of five high-profile separatists jailed without bail Friday by a Spanish Supreme Court judge for their alleged roles in a failed independence bid by Catalonia from Spain in October.\n\nJudge Pablo Llarena charged 13 Catalans with rebellion, a crime punishable by up to 30 years in prison.\n\nThe separatist parties used Saturday's parliamentary session to denounce what they considered the heavy hand of Spanish law.\n\n\"Yesterday the Spanish state didn't imprison five good people. It imprisoned 2 million people and spat in their faces,\" said Sergi Sabria of the Republican Left in reference to the number of Catalan voters who cast ballots for pro-independence parties in December. \"We received a very hard blow yesterday ... butut we must pick ourselves up quickly to build a future for all.\"\n\nThe leader of Citizens, a pro-Spain party which holds the most seats in the Barcelona-based house, used the moment to claim the secession movement was crushed.\n\n\"Enough is enough. The independence moment has lost. It has failed,\" Citizens leader Ines Arrimadas said. \"I only ask you that you stop thinking only about your voters, because you have generated worry, fear, indignation and shame for what is happening in Catalonia. We have warned you for years that the secession push will only end in a collective sense of frustration.\"\n\nThe judge also activated international arrest warrants for six fugitive Catalan politicians, including former regional Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium in October.\n\nPuigdemont was visiting Finland when the warrant was issued, but both his lawyer, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, and Finnish parliament member Mikko Karna, who had invited him to visit, told The Associated Press that Puigdemont left the country on Friday evening.\n\nKarna said he believed Puigdemont had returned to Brussels.\n\nThe crackdown on the secession movement provoked protests in Catalonia on Friday night. Emergency services said 35 people were injured in clashes with police in Barcelona.\n\nSpain's worst political conflict in three decades reached its climax in October when Puigdemont flouted a ban by the country's top court to stop an ad-hoc referendum on Catalan independence. His subsequent declaration of a Catalan republic received no international recognition and provoked a takeover by Spain's central powers.\n\nThe Spanish Constitution says the European Union nation is indivisible and any changes to its top law must pass through the national parliament in Madrid.\n\nPolls show Catalans are equally divided on the secession issue, with pro-secession parties maintaining a slim hold on the regional legislature in December elections.\n\nThe failure of Turull to be elected on a first vote Thursday started a two-month countdown to elect a new regional leader before a new election is automatically triggered.\n\nAritz Parra contributed to his report from Madrid.",

                "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Alexis Jennings scored 20 points, A'ja Wilson added 20 points and 13 rebounds, and South Carolina beat Buffalo 79-63 on Saturday to keep alive its quest to defend its title.\n\nSecond-seeded South Carolina (29-6), whose only losses this year have come against ranked teams, will face the winner of the other Sweet 16 matchup in the Albany Region between top-seeded and unbeaten UConn and Duke, who played later Saturday.\n\nUpstart Buffalo (29-6), just the third Mid-American Conference school to reach the Sweet 16, was among the final four teams to earn an at-large berth. It was the program's second tournament appearance after a first-round exit two years ago.\n\nThe Gamecocks, who have won six straight, defeated North Carolina A&T and Virginia by double digits in the first two rounds, holding both to under 60 points as they stayed on track to make a third Final Four in four seasons. But those performances had flaws - 19 turnovers in one - that coach Dawn Staley focused on correcting. They didn't on Saturday - South Carolina had 26 turnovers - but in the end it didn't matter.\n\nCierra Dillard led Buffalo with 29 points, the only player in double figures.\n\nThe Gamecocks led 55-48 entering the fourth quarter, and the Bulls stayed with them, closing to 60-54 on Dillard's driving layup off the glass with 6:38 left. But Buffalo missed three straight shots and a fast-break layup by Doniyah Cliney gave South Carolina a 10-point lead with just over 5 minutes to go.\n\nBuffalo is a senior-dominated team and has players from around the globe - four from Australia, a couple of Canadians, one from Nigeria - as well as Buffalo-area locals. That melting pot of sorts had created a close-knit group and they helped contribute to the madness of March that has seen 11th seeds wreak havoc on brackets. The 11th-seeded Bulls had already vanquished sixth-seeded South Florida (102-79) and third-seeded Florida State (86-65) - on the Seminoles home court, no less.\n\nBuffalo coach Felisha Legette-Jack, who nearly quit coaching after being fired by Indiana, had said her Bulls were \"too silly and quirky to be afraid\" and their late-season rush proved it. The Bulls had lost only once in 13 games, the lone setback coming against Central Michigan in the MAC Tournament two weeks ago. That was one of two setbacks to CMU, which won the MAC title and also reached the Sweet 16.\n\nThe Bulls quickly proved they belonged on the big stage, forging a 7-0 run early against the Gamecocks. Dillard's 3 from the left wing gave Buffalo a 10-6 lead midway through the first quarter. South Carolina missed three layups and committed eight turnovers in the period but only trailed 17-16 at the end of the period despite taking six fewer shots than the Bulls.\n\nAs they often did during the season, the Bulls attacked repeatedly from beyond the arc and stayed close until the waning minutes before halftime.\n\nA three-point play by freshman LeLe Grissett began a 12-2 run by the Gamecocks as they continued to attack relentlessly inside. A 3 from left wing by Tyasha Harris and a layup by Jennings gave South Carolina a 40-28 lead.\n\nAfter a layup by Dillard gave Buffalo a one-point lead with 5:50 left in the first half, the Bulls missed five times and committed a turnover before Stephanie Reid hit her only basket of the opening two periods - a 3 with 6.4 seconds left.\n\nAND THEN THERE WAS ONE\n\nStaley and Legette-Jack were the last two African American coaches in the tournament, which started with 10.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nBuffalo: Legette-Jack made her sixth season at the helm of the Bulls one to remember. The program made its first trip to the Sweet 16. Only one 11 seed has ever advanced to a regional final, Gonzaga in 2011 with a seven-point win over Louisville. The Bulls lose three senior starters who were instrumental in setting a school record for victories. They also went 12-0 at home and, and posted 21 victories decided by at least 10 points, a high bar to match.\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks move on to the Elite Eight but their penchant for mistakes will have to be fixed to have a chance to reach the Final Four.\n\nSouth Carolina will play either UConn or Duke in the regional final on Monday night.",

                "body": "VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Young Catholics told the Vatican on Saturday they want a more transparent and authentic church, where women play a greater leadership role and where obeying \"unreachable\" moral standards isn't the price of admission.\n\nIn a fascinating final document from a weeklong Vatican-initiated conference, 300 young people from around the world joined by 15,000 young people online gave the older men who run the 1.2-billion strong church a piece of their collective mind.\n\nThey urged Pope Francis and the bishops who will gather at the Vatican in the fall to back their recommendations that church leaders must address the unequal roles of women in the church and how technology is used and abused. They warned that \"excessive moralism\" is driving faithful away and that out-of-touch church bureaucrats need to accompany their flock with humility and transparency.\n\n\"We, the young church, ask that our leaders speak in practical terms about subjects such as homosexuality and gender issues, about which young people are already freely discussing,\" they said.\n\nAmong the participants, however, there was no consensus on hot-button issues such as church teaching on contraception, homosexuality, abortion or cohabitation. The document said some young people want the church to change its teaching or better explain it; others accept the teachings and want the church to proclaim them more forcefully.\n\nBut overall, the young people concluded, the church often comes off as too severe and its \"excessive moralism\" often sends the faithful looking elsewhere for peace and spiritual fulfillment.\n\n\"We need a church that is welcoming and merciful, which appreciates its roots and patrimony and which loves everyone, even those who are not following the perceived standards,\" they said.\n\nThe 300 young people who attended the conference were mostly selected by their national bishops' conferences, universities or church movements. A handful of non-Catholics and non-Christians, as well as some atheists, also participated, and their views were incorporated into the final document.\n\nTheir reflections will be formally presented to Francis on Sunday -- Palm Sunday -- and will become one of the working documents that will guide discussions during an October synod of bishops at the Vatican on better helping young people find their way in the church.\n\nOn four separate occasions in the 16-page document, the participants demanded greater and equal roles for women in the church, calling for \"real discussion and open-mindedness\" about ways to promote the dignity of women so they feel accepted and appreciated.\n\n\"Some young women feel that there is a lack of leading female role models within the church, and they too wish to give their intellectual and professional gifts to the church,\" they said.\n\nThe young people also made it clear that they love their technology and the church must get hip to that or lose relevance. At the same time, the document said young people are looking for guidance as to how to responsibly use technology and combat online addiction, pornography and cyberbullying.\n\nThey called for the Vatican to issue a teaching document about technology, and use it better to spread the faith.\n\nThe final report is brutally honest in places, responding to Francis' call on the first day for the participants to speak freely and courageously.\n\nIt noted that young people are leaving the church in droves, in part because they have experienced \"indifference, judgment and rejection\" by the institution.\n\nChurch leaders, they say, are too focused on administration than community, and use words like \"vocation\" and \"discernment\" that young people often don't understand.\n\nBut mostly, they say, the church needs to admit that it is human and makes mistakes, and that its mentors aren't perfect people but forgiven sinners. The document cited the clergy sex abuse scandal as both an error that has driven people away and an ongoing issue that requires admission of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Some mentors are put on a pedestal, and when they fall, the devastation may impact young people's abilities to continue to engage with the church,\" they said.",

La ruta pasa adem? junto al Trump International Hotel.

La presencia policial era considerable all? mientras los organizadores preparaban el sitio y los manifestantes comenzaban a llegar. Con las consignas de \"Basta ya\" y \"Nuestras boletas (electorales) detendr? las balas\", unas 20.000 personas se concentraron en el lugar.\n\nOtras personas de la zona fueron a la marcha central en Washington.

The French leader, who has already put in place stronger police measures since being elected in May, is expected to address a joint session of Congress the following day.\n\nA French judicial official says three homemade explosive devices have been found in the supermarket in southern France that was the site of a deadly attack by a man calling himself \"a soldier\" of the Islamic State group.\n\nAlso found were a 7.65-caliber handgun and a hunting knife, the official said on Saturday. He wasn't authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe supermarket in Trebes was the site of an hours-long attack Friday that killed four people. The 25-year-old Moroccan-born attacker was himself killed when special police stormed the market.\n\nIt wasn't clear whether the knife and handgun found were the weapons he wielded when entering the supermarket.\n\nA judicial official says French police searching the home of the man responsible for a deadly rampage in southern France have found notes referring to the Islamic State group that appeared to be a final testament.\n\nAlso found in the search of the home were a computer and telephone, the official said Saturday, a day after the attack. He was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and couldn't be named.\n\nPolice searched the home of Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, 25, after Friday's attack that killed four people -- two in a supermarket near the southern city of Carcassonne where the attacker was killed in an assault. The fourth victim, a gendarme who stood in for a female hostage and was shot, died early Saturday.\n\nThe official says there apparently was no mention in the notes of the attack plans.\n\nFrance is mourning the death of a courageous police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, a 44-year-old gendarme, died from his injuries after the attacker shot him. Flags are at half-staff at all French gendarmeries.\n\nHashtag #ArnaudBeltrame has been the most used on Twitter in France, with many social media users paying tribute to a \"hero\" who gave his life to save others.\n\nResidents of Carcassonne and the nearby town of Trebes, where the supermarket attack took place, are placing flowers in front of the gendarmerie local headquarters.\n\nMarie Kerboull, resident of Carcassone, said she her flowers were meant to be a show of support \"the family. He is our hero.\"\n\nMarie Castelles, of Trebes, said \"the military, the police officers, I would like to give them a big homage.\"\n\nThe manager of a supermarket in southern France that was attacked by an extremist gunman has praised the officer who exchanged himself for a hostage as a hero who saved her co-worker's life.\n\nThe manager, who identified herself only by her first name, Samia, said that her co-worker was in a \"catastrophic state\" after the death of the officer, Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame.\n\nBeltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack in the supermarket in Trebes, and in a carjacking beforehand in a nearby town. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe brother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that he has died a hero.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nCedric Beltrame told RTL radio Saturday his brother \"gave his life for strangers.\"\n\nHe added that his brother \"was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing.\" Cedric Beltrame also stressed that his brother kept his professional reflexes. The officer managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket.\n\nCedric Beltrame said that \"if we don't describe him as a hero, I don't know what you need to do to be a hero. It's a word I think is appropriate for him in such tragic circumstances.\"\n\nThe gunman was killed when police stormed the supermarket after hearing shots.\n\nThe manager of a French supermarket attacked by an Islamic extremist gunman says she felt \"helpless\" as he fired shots in her store.\n\nThe woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, says she was in her office when she heard the shots. She came downstairs saw what was happening and called police. She said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\nShe said from inside city hall, where the local government had set up a crisis center, that \"it was terrifying.\"\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack, including a French police officer who exchanged himself for a female hostage in the Super U market and later died of his injuries. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe Paris prosecutors' office says that police have detained a 17-year-old in connection with the investigation into the Islamic extremist attack that killed four people, including a police officer, in southern France.\n\nThe unidentified young man was arrested overnight over alleged criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise. He is a friend of the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, who was killed when police stormed a supermarket in Trebes where he took hostages.\n\nParis prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday that another person, a woman close to Lakdim, was taken into custody on the same grounds. Molins didn't identify her.\n\nParis counterterrorism investigators took over the probe into the attack in Trebes and nearby Carcassonne.\n\nThe mother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that she wasn't surprised by her son's courage.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injures.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio Friday night before the announcement of his death that \"I'm not surprised. I knew it had to be him. He has always been like that. It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland.\"\n\nAsked if she was proud of him, she said he would have told her \"'I'm doing my job mom, that's all.'\"\n\nShe said to \"defend the homeland\" was his \"reason for living.\" RTL didn't give her name.\n\nFrance's top security official says a heroic officer who swapped himself for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket has died of his injuries.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nBeltrame offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raises the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition. The attack was the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.\n\nA previous version of this story has been corrected throughout to show that the dead officer's rank is Lt. Col., not Col.",

                "title": "Planned Russian statue starts mini-Cold War in American city",
                "body": "ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. (AP) -- Back in World War II when the U.S. and Russia were allied against the Nazis, hundreds of Soviet aviators were trained on the North Carolina coast as part of a secret spy project -- but now, an effort to honor their mission has triggered a miniature Cold War in a small American city.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense wants to place a 25-ton bronze monument in Elizabeth City, where the recently declassified \"Project Zebra\" was carried out. Russia would pay for the 13-foot tall monument, with the city footing the bill for improvements to the as-yet undeveloped park on the Pasquotank River where it would be located.\n\nBut amid international tensions and fears about Russian hacking of U.S. elections, Elizabeth City elected officials have rejected a memorandum of understanding that was to be the next step.\n\n\"We are living in troubled times, and people are very concerned about a lot of things,\" council member Anita Hummer said at the meeting where the council voted 5-3 to reject the memorandum. \"And I realize that it's about honoring fallen heroes from World War II, and we have Americans who fought in World War II who are buried in Russia. But times were different then.\"\n\nOne council member warned the monument could be a Trojan horse. Johnnie Walton worries the Russians could put something in it that could be triggered remotely to disrupt the internet or electrical grid.\n\n\"Russia is known for hacking now. They're experts at hacking, and then we've got the largest Coast Guard base (that) can't help anybody because our computers have gone down, because Russia controls our mouse,\" Walton said at a committee meeting, according to The Daily Advance of Elizabeth City.\n\nA Russian-American joint commission on POWs and MIAs wanted the monument in Elizabeth City because of a top-secret WWII operation at U.S. Coast Guard station there. Declassified just a few years ago, Project Zebra helped train about 300 Soviet aviators. Their mission was to find German submarines and bomb them.\n\nOne night in 1945, three Russians, a Ukrainian and a Canadian were killed when a seaplane bound for Russia crashed in the Pasquotank River. Their sacrifice was never publicly recognized and the crash was forgotten for decades.\n\nAfter Project Zebra was declassified in 2013, efforts slowly developed to honor it with a monument, which would include three figures -- one each of Soviet, U.S. and United Kingdom aviators.\n\nThe previous city council unanimously approved the statue in May 2017. So supporters were caught off-guard by when the new council backtracked and voted nyet in February -- especially because three of the negative votes came from incumbents who had supported it earlier.\n\nLocated in northeastern North Carolina near the Virginia border, Elizabeth City was founded in 1793 and has a population of about 18,000. Locals describe the area as progressive in some ways but also fiscally conservative.\n\nIn 2013, the local Republican Party challenged an African-American college student's candidacy for city council. Eventually, the State Board of Election interceded, and the student ran for office and won.\n\nAnd for what may be the first time, the council's majority is African-American and so is the mayor.\n\nPublic discussion has played out along mostly racial lines; four of the five council members who oppose the monument are black, and two of three who support it are white. At one meeting, council member Darius Horton asked the city manager if Elizabeth City has any monuments to minorities or women.\n\nInformation about the monument didn't filter to the African-American community as well as it did to the white community, said Hezekiah Brown, one of two citizens who spoke against it. Not that he's convinced that more information would matter.\n\n\"We're at war with Russia still. We're in a cyberwar here,\" Brown said. \"They interfered in our election. And they've not said they won't do it again. ... The war has to end. Then you do something. You don't do it while you're at war.\"\n\nFor its part, Russia is sensitive to actions it regards as disrespectful to the Soviet Union's military campaign against Nazi Germany. In 2007, weeks of cyberattacks shut down websites of government ministries, banks and news media in the former Soviet republic of Estonia amid a dispute with Moscow over plans to relocate a statue of a Red Army soldier in the capital Tallinn. Estonian officials accused Russia of orchestrating the onslaught.\n\nElected officials also are hearing from citizens such as Rick Boyd, who turned in a petition with 569 local signatures supporting the project. He said another 200 people have signed an online petition. The monument offers the two rival nations a chance \"to show that we worked together in the past, and that we can work together in the future,\" he told the council.\n\nMayor Bettie Parker suggested the vote might have turned out differently if it had happened earlier. \"I keep hearing now is not the time to deal with anything that's coming from Russia,\" said Parker, who only votes in a tie.\n\nCouncil member Billy Caudle, who supports the monument, says people who are concerned about the appearance of an alliance with Russia are \"confusing current events with history.\"\n\nRetired U.S. Air Force Gen. Robert Foglesong, chairman of the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, has asked the city council to reconsider its vote. But for now, the council majority seems steadfast.\n\nMembers complained at their most recent meeting that the monument debate has divided Elizabeth City and they need to concentrate on more important issues. Walton said he was sick of discussing the monument and recommended that it be erected in Russia.\n\n\"Those people's relatives live in Russia,\" he said. \"Give them the opportunity to ride by on a Sunday, say a prayer, do all the things that people do when you're memorializing somebody.\"",

                "title": "7 months after Harvey, flood-control projects' fate unclear",
                "body": "HOUSTON (AP) -- Large-scale projects long considered essential to easing Houston's flooding woes went to the top of the area's to-do list after Hurricane Harvey inundated large swaths of the nation's fourth-largest city.\n\nSeven months later, local officials are still looking for funding to undertake plans that include a new reservoir, deeper and wider bayous and a costal barrier system - all of which have fallen victim to a lack of money or political will in the past.\n\nYet local leaders insist this time will be different, saying they're committed to making the projects a reality, even as they wait to find out how much money they might get from the state and federal governments and whether local taxpayers will be willing to help out.\n\n\"There's been a whole lot of talk over the years, but now it's time to get it done in the post-Harvey era,\" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said at a recent community meeting.\n\nOne thing that's giving Turner and others hope is that billions of federal dollars have been allocated to pay for flood-mitigation projects. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has promised $1 billion for areas affected by Harvey, though Houston will be competing with other Texas communities for that funding. Congress in February provided $15 billion to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood-control projects nationwide, some of which could go to the Houston area.\n\nHouston, which was founded on the banks of the Buffalo Bayou around the mid-1800s and rises barely above sea level, has long been susceptible to flooding. But recent growth has made the problem worse. The area has more pavement, which generates more stormwater runoff, and has lost wetlands that could soak up that runoff.\n\nBig projects Houston-area officials are eying include building a third reservoir for the area, at a cost of about $500 million. They also want to complete the excavation and widening of six local bayous, a $1.3 billion project, part of which has proceeded in fits and starts for more than 20 years due to inconsistent funding. And they want to undertake a project known as the costal spine, which was first proposed after Hurricane Ike in 2008. That $6 billion to $10 billion project - also called the \"Ike Dike\" - proposes barriers to protect the area from storm surge coming into Galveston Bay.\n\nThis \"will be very different than the last several decades when things were thought of but never actually executed,\" said Marvin Odum, Houston's Hurricane Harvey recovery czar.\n\nWhichever projects are ultimately funded, they will likely take years to build.\n\nTurner and other Houston-area officials have asked Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to use the state's $11 billion rainy day fund to help front the cost of building the reservoir and other projects, with the state being repaid once federal dollars are awarded. But that message has \"fallen on deaf ears,\" said Stephen Costello, Houston's chief resilience officer.\n\n\"I think the governor completely agrees ... that in order to really rebuild after Harvey, a large portion of what we are going to have to do are these major scale projects,\" Reed Clay, the chief operating officer for Abbott's office, told a U.S. House Homeland Security Committee hearing earlier this month.\n\nHarris County Judge Ed Emmett, the top elected official in the county where Houston is located, said he's not reassured by promises from state officials. He also noted that they've pushed to cut property taxes, which Harris County uses to pay for its flood-control efforts.\n\n\"When somebody at the state level tells you that they're going to lower the property tax, what they're telling you is, 'We are not going to build many flood-control projects,'\" Emmett said.\n\nOfficials are also asking Harris County residents to approve a $1 billion to $2 billion bond proposal to help pay for some projects. That will be on the ballot sometime this year.\n\nTexas A&M University at Galveston marine sciences professor Sam Brody cautioned that Houston and the rest of Texas can't engineer their way out of flooding issues by only relying on large-scale projects. Efforts such as buying out homes in flood prone areas and being mindful of future development must play a role in making the area more flood resilient, he said.\n\nHouston remains the only major U.S. city without zoning, but it does have rules about building in the flood plain. The City Council is set to vote in the coming week on stricter rules. Harris County approved new restrictions late last year. Both Houston and Harris County are also pursuing a home buyout strategy.\n\n\"There is no one silver bullet that is going to fix this problem,\" Brody said. \"It's a ... multi-strategy issue that people need to recognize,\" he said.",

Some of the payments took place when Kuczynski was a government minister, raising questions about whether they were made in return for political favors.\n\nThe former Wall Street investor has denied any wrongdoing. He said the consulting firm, Westfield Capital, was then being managed by his business partner and that he paid taxes on all earnings from that era.\n\nOdebrecht has admitted to paying $800 million in bribes to officials across Latin America including $29 million in Peru.\n\nAt the same time the hearing was taking place, prosecutors carried out a search of Kuczynski's home in Lima and another property outside the capital.\n\n\"Peru since the 19th century has watched the sad show as presidents and ex-presidents flee the country and justice,\" said Hamilton Castro, the anti-corruption prosecutor who had requested Kuczynski be barred from leaving Peru. \"This is the historical behavior that we seekers of justice have to take into account.\"\n\nKuczynski's lawyer promised his client's full cooperation and said he would abide by the prosecutor's request not to leave the country.

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Summoned to action by student survivors of the Florida school shooting, hundreds of thousands of teenagers and their supporters rallied in the nation's capital and cities across America on Saturday to press for gun control and ignite political activism among the young.\n\nOrganizers of the March for Our Lives rally in Washington hoped their protest would match in numbers and spirit last year's women's march, one of the biggest protests in the capital since the Vietnam era and one that far exceeded predictions of 300,000 demonstrators.\n\nBearing signs reading \"We Are the Change,\" ''No More Silence\" and \"Keep NRA Money Out of Politics,\" protesters packed Pennsylvania Avenue from the stage near the Capitol, stretching many blocks back toward the White House. The route also took in the Trump International Hotel.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for our dead friends,\" Delaney Tarr, a survivor of the Florida tragedy, declared from the stage. The crowd roared with approval as she laid down the students' central demand: a ban on \"weapons of war\" for all but warriors.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was in Florida for the weekend. A motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club in the morning.\n\n\"It's pretty simple for me,\" said Zoe Tate, 11, from Gaithersburg Middle School in Maryland, explaining why she marched in Washington. \"I think guns are dumb. It's scary enough with the security guards we have in school. We don't need teachers carrying guns now. I find it amazing that I have to explain that idea to adults.\"\n\nSaid her mother, Maria Blaeuer: \"For our kids, feeling safe is fundamental, and they don't feel safe.\"\n\nLarge rallies also unfolded in such cities as Boston; New York; Chicago; Houston; Fort Worth, Texas; Minneapolis; and Parkland, Florida, the site of the Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead.\n\nThe police presence was heavy as more than 20,000 people filled a park near the Florida school, chanting slogans such as \"Enough is enough\" and carrying signs that read \"Why do your guns matter more than our lives?\" and \"Our ballots will stop bullets.\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association went silent on Twitter on Saturday morning, in contrast to its reaction to the nationwide school walkouts against gun violence March 14, when it tweeted a photo of an assault rifle and the message \"I'll control my own guns, thank you.\"\n\nAs of early afternoon, Trump himself had yet to weigh in on Twitter about the protests.\n\nGun violence was fresh for some in the Washington crowd: Ayanne Johnson of Great Mills High School in Maryland held a sign declaring, \"I March for Jaelynn,\" honoring Jaelynn Willey, who died Thursday two days after being shot by a classmate at the school. A boy was injured in the attack, and the shooter died.\n\nMichael Rocco, an 18-year-old freshman at Emerson College in Boston, came to Washington to support the students' calls for banning high-capacity magazines and assault-type rifles like the one used by the Florida killer, tightening background checks and school security, and raising the age to buy guns. He said he grew up in an era of school violence.\n\n\"I've been genuinely terrified of mass shooting,\" he said. \"When I was a kid, I was always scared to go to movie theaters because I was afraid I was going to be killed.\"\n\nRallying outside the New Hampshire Statehouse in Concord, 17-year-old Leeza Richter said: \"Our government will do more to stop us from walking out than it will to stop a gunman from walking in.\"\n\nSince the bloodshed in Florida, students have tapped into a current of gun control sentiment that has been building for years -- yet still faces a powerful foe in the NRA and its supporters.\n\nOrganizers hope the passions of the crowds and the under-18 roster of speakers will translate into a tipping point starting with the midterm congressional elections this fall.\n\nIn Atlanta, Lindsey Alexander, a freshman at Decatur High School in Decatur, Georgia, attended her first protest, inspired by hearing Parkland students debate the NRA on television.\n\n\"If nothing changes, we're going to continue to have school shootings,\" she said. \"I understand the Second Amendment is important. We've always had this right. But when the Founding Fathers put that right in place, they didn't mean it to become what it is today.\"\n\nPolls indicate that public opinion nationwide may be shifting on an issue that has simmered for generations, and through dozens of mass shootings.\n\nA new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the U.S. should be tightened. That's up from 61 percent who said the same in October 2016 and 55 percent when the AP first asked the question in October 2013. Overall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun control laws.\n\nBut even with claims of historic social momentum on the issue of gun control, the AP poll also found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action.\n\nAmong the questions facing march organizers and participants will be how to translate this one-day event into legislative change. One way they hope to do that is by registering young voters and channeling energy into the midterm elections.\n\nAssociated Press writers Terry Spencer in Parkland, Florida; Jacob Jordan in Atlanta; and Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this report.",

He wasn't authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe supermarket in Trebes was the site of an hours-long attack Friday that killed four people. The 25-year-old Moroccan-born attacker was himself killed when special police stormed the market.\n\nIt wasn't clear whether the knife and handgun found were the weapons he wielded when entering the supermarket.\n\nA judicial official says French police searching the home of the man responsible for a deadly rampage in southern France have found notes referring to the Islamic State group that appeared to be a final testament.\n\nAlso found in the search of the home were a computer and telephone, the official said Saturday, a day after the attack. He was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and couldn't be named.\n\nPolice searched the home of Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, 25, after Friday's attack that killed four people -- two in a supermarket near the southern city of Carcassonne where the attacker was killed in an assault. The fourth victim, a gendarme who stood in for a female hostage and was shot, died early Saturday.\n\nThe official says there apparently was no mention in the notes of the attack plans.\n\nFrance is mourning the death of a courageous police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, a 44-year-old gendarme, died from his injuries after the attacker shot him. Flags are at half-staff at all French gendarmeries.\n\nHashtag #ArnaudBeltrame has been the most used on Twitter in France, with many social media users paying tribute to a \"hero\" who gave his life to save others.\n\nResidents of Carcassonne and the nearby town of Trebes, where the supermarket attack took place, are placing flowers in front of the gendarmerie local headquarters.\n\nMarie Kerboull, resident of Carcassone, said she her flowers were meant to be a show of support \"the family. He is our hero.\"\n\nMarie Castelles, of Trebes, said \"the military, the police officers, I would like to give them a big homage.\"\n\nThe manager of a supermarket in southern France that was attacked by an extremist gunman has praised the officer who exchanged himself for a hostage as a hero who saved her co-worker's life.\n\nThe manager, who identified herself only by her first name, Samia, said that her co-worker was in a \"catastrophic state\" after the death of the officer, Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame.\n\nBeltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack in the supermarket in Trebes, and in a carjacking beforehand in a nearby town. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe brother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that he has died a hero.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nCedric Beltrame told RTL radio Saturday his brother \"gave his life for strangers.\"\n\nHe added that his brother \"was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing.\" Cedric Beltrame also stressed that his brother kept his professional reflexes. The officer managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket.\n\nCedric Beltrame said that \"if we don't describe him as a hero, I don't know what you need to do to be a hero. It's a word I think is appropriate for him in such tragic circumstances.\"\n\nThe gunman was killed when police stormed the supermarket after hearing shots.\n\nThe manager of a French supermarket attacked by an Islamic extremist gunman says she felt \"helpless\" as he fired shots in her store.\n\nThe woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, says she was in her office when she heard the shots. She came downstairs saw what was happening and called police. She said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\nShe said from inside city hall, where the local government had set up a crisis center, that \"it was terrifying.\"\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack, including a French police officer who exchanged himself for a female hostage in the Super U market and later died of his injuries. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe Paris prosecutors' office says that police have detained a 17-year-old in connection with the investigation into the Islamic extremist attack that killed four people, including a police officer, in southern France.\n\nThe unidentified young man was arrested overnight over alleged criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise. He is a friend of the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, who was killed when police stormed a supermarket in Trebes where he took hostages.\n\nParis prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday that another person, a woman close to Lakdim, was taken into custody on the same grounds. Molins didn't identify her.\n\nParis counterterrorism investigators took over the probe into the attack in Trebes and nearby Carcassonne.\n\nThe mother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that she wasn't surprised by her son's courage.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injures.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio Friday night before the announcement of his death that \"I'm not surprised. I knew it had to be him. He has always been like that. It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland.\"\n\nAsked if she was proud of him, she said he would have told her \"'I'm doing my job mom, that's all.'\"\n\nShe said to \"defend the homeland\" was his \"reason for living.\" RTL didn't give her name.\n\nFrance's top security official says a heroic officer who swapped himself for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket has died of his injuries.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nBeltrame offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raises the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition. The attack was the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.\n\nA previous version of this story has been corrected throughout to show that the dead officer's rank is Lt. Col., not Col.",

                "title": "Will GOP accomplishments in Congress be enough for voters?",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- With passage of an enormous budget bill, the GOP-controlled Congress all but wrapped up its legislating for the year. But will it be enough to convince voters to give Republicans another term at the helm?\n\nIn two big ways, Republicans have done what they promised. They passed a long sought tax overhaul bill that slashed tax rates. They've rolled back regulations, in ways they claim are boosting the economy. In the Senate, they confirmed a justice to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut there are signs Americans wanted more: immigration reforms, gun control legislation, even an infrastructure plan that President Donald Trump promised voters. Tax cuts, for now, will have to do.\n\n\"It's very clear that tax reform was going to be the biggest legislative crown jewel of this Congress,\" said Matt Gorman, the spokesman for the House GOP's campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"That is a massive centerpiece of our campaign.\"\n\nBut polls swing wildly these days, strategists said. Voters are rarely focused for too long on single issues that can make or break campaigns, as when Republicans seized control of the House in 2010 amid the economic downturn or Democrats pushed to the majority in 2006 over opposition to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and congressional ethics scandals.\n\nTrump's mixed messages on the GOP's accomplishments only make the campaigning more difficult. At the White House on Friday, he toyed with a veto of the $1.3 trillion budget package, complaining it lacked his immigration deal and smacked of overspending, before ultimately signing it. Such shifting views leave Republicans without a reliable partner as they try to push through political headwinds in what's expected to be a tough battle for majority control of the House and Senate.\n\nLawmakers left town for a two-week recess that marks the unofficial end of the legislating season having shelved resolution of other issues.\n\nCongress failed to pass legislation to curb rising health insurance premiums or protect young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation, two issues that have stirred voters this year. And ahead of the nationwide \"March for Our Lives\" protests against gun violence, lawmakers took modest steps to boost school safety funds and improve compliance with the federal gun purchase background check system.\n\nKris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said the measures are \"just not enough.\"\n\n\"The American people have been screaming from the rooftops for real, bold change to fight against\" tragedies such as the Florida and Las Vegas shootings, Brown said. \"We have seen the consequences of Congress's inaction.\"\n\nCongress' spring agenda is thin. It includes modest plans to finish a banking bill that rolls back some of the regulations put in place after the financial crisis and pass a big farm bill that sets agriculture and school nutrition policies. The Senate also has to begin confirmation hearings for Trump's nominees for secretary of state and CIA director.\n\nThe one legislative lift will be another spending bill when the one Trump signed into law expires at the end of September. But it may bring more political risk than reward for Republicans, since conservatives largely sided with the president against this one, and could pose a more serious threat of voter revolt in the fall.\n\nStrategists say it will be up to candidates to make the case that GOP's signature legislative accomplishment is worth their re-election.\n\nDemocrats have been hammering on the tax law as a giveaway to big business, in part because the steep reduction in corporate rates, from 35 percent to 21 percent, is permanent while the reduced rates for individuals and other provisions for families, including expanded child tax credits, expire in coming years.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has derided the lopsided benefits for households as \"crumbs\" -- a quip Republicans eagerly throw back at Democrats.\n\nTo prop up public opinion of the GOP's top accomplishment, millions are being spent by outside groups. American Action Network, which is aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, is unleashing more than $30 million in ads, and the network backed by the influential Koch brothers will spend more than $20 million, heaping praise on lawmakers who voted for the tax cuts and informing voters about those who didn't.\n\nAnd with passage of tax cuts so important to the GOP election effort, Republicans might take the unusual step of trying to pass them again.\n\n\"We think there's more we can do,\" Ryan said.\n\nHouse GOP leaders are seriously considering legislation this summer -- \"Tax Cuts 2\" -- that would try to build on the original bill that became law in December by making the individual tax cuts permanent.\n\nA do-over tax cuts bill is not expected to pass this Congress. But setting up another showdown accomplishes political goals for Republicans by turning attention back on the tax law, and pushing Democrats into the uncomfortable position of voting against it, again.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, one of the groups in the Koch network, launched an ad campaign urging Congress to fortify the law by making tax cuts permanent. \"More needs to be done,\" the group says on a website for its advocacy.\n\n\"Even if there are things that get passed between now and the fall, the bottom line is the single most important piece of legislation is going to be the tax bill,\" said veteran strategist David Winston, who advises House and Senate GOP leadership. \"That defines what this Congress is about.\"\n\nFollow Mascaro on Twitter at https://twitter.com/LisaMascaro and Daly at https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on student-led protests against gun violence (all times Eastern Daylight Time):\n\n12:35 p.m.\n\nTens of thousands gathered at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally in New York City on Saturday held a moment of silence to honor 17 people killed during a school shooting in Florida just last month.\n\nSam Hendler, a 16-year-old student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was at the rally to read the victims' names.\n\nAnother MSD student, Meghan Bonner, told the demonstrators that she wasn't surprised when she learned the identity of the shooter because it was obvious something was wrong with him.\n\n\"There was so much more that could have been done to prevent this,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"I want to see change.\"\n\nThe rally in midtown Manhattan is one of several being held across the United States on Saturday in response to gun violence.\n\nThe mayor of Houston, Texas told thousands of demonstrators at a \"March for Our Lives\" rally that adults have a responsibility to protect all children.\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner spoke at the Tranquility Park event Saturday morning, one of several anti-gun rallies being held across the U.S. on Saturday in response to last month's school shooting in Florida and other mass shootings.\n\n\"We have a responsibility for those of us as adults, we have a responsibility to stand up and protect our children,\" said Turner.\n\nTurner also chanted with the crowd \"Now is the time\" to \"do the right thing.\"\n\nStudents chanted \"enough is enough\" and held up signs with slogans like \"our ballots will stop bullets\" at a rally in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last month.\n\nMore than 20,000 people filled the park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for the \"March for Our Lives\" rally Saturday morning.\n\nOthers from the area traveled to Washington, D.C., where the main \"March for Our Lives\" event is being held. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft let over 100 people, including families of victims of the Parkland shooting, use the team's charter plane for the trip.\n\nTeam spokesman Stacey James says astronaut Mark Kelly reached out to Kraft for the favor.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say no to, especially involving these victims,\" James said.\n\nMore than 20,000 people are expected at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally nearest the Florida school where last month's deadly shooting occurred.\n\nPolice presence was heavy early Saturday at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in.\n\nEighteen-year-old Sabrine Brismeur and 17-year-old Eden Kinlock came from schools 20 miles away to pass out water.\n\nKinlock said that may seem \"like a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe White House is applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights\" at gun control marches in Washington and in cities around the nation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says \"keeping our children safe is a top priority\" of President Donald Trump and points to his calls on Congress to pass legislation related to expanded background checks and school safety.\n\nTrump is at his Florida home for the weekend. His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

The investigators were seen leaving the premises early Saturday after spending about seven hours searching the office.\n\nThe regulator said it will \"consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions.\"\n\n\"This is one part of a larger investigation by the ICO into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns, parties, social media companies and other commercial actors,\" it said.\n\nAuthorities in Britain as well as the U.S. are investigating Cambridge Analytica over allegations the firm improperly obtained data from 50 million Facebook users and used it to manipulate elections, including the 2016 White House race and the 2016 Brexit vote in Britain.\n\nBoth Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny wrongdoing.\n\nThe data firm suspended its CEO Alexander Nix this week after Britain's Channel 4 News broadcast footage that appeared to show Nix suggesting tactics like entrapment or bribery that his company could use to discredit politicians. The footage also showed Nix saying Cambridge Analytica played a major role in securing Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nCambridge Analytica's acting chief executive, Alexander Tayler, said Friday that he was sorry that SCL Elections, an affiliate of his company, \"licensed Facebook data and derivatives from a research company (Global Science Research) that had not received consent from most respondents\" in 2014.\n\n\"The company believed that the data had been obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service and data protection laws,\" Tayler said.\n\nHis statement said the data was deleted in 2015 at Facebook's request, and denied that any of the Facebook data that Cambridge Analytica obtained was used in the work it did on the 2016 U.S. election.",

                "title": "Florida students call for gun reform at March for Our Lives",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Student survivors of the Florida school massacre anchored a massive rally against gun violence Saturday in Washington, D.C., while throngs of other young people took to the streets in sister marches across the U.S. The protests followed widespread student walkouts last week.\n\nHere's a look at what some of the demonstrators from Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had to say:\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"Because we keep chanting, 'Never again,' 'Enough is enough,' 'Never again.' But it's already happened again. It happened in Maryland. There was a shooting in Napa (California's Napa County). So I'm really here to make sure we can make our voices heard; so people are empowered to make sure we vote in legislators so this doesn't happen again; so we can avenge those who were stolen from us because someone thought it was OK to own weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I definitely want people to vote in new legislators that will help us pass bills that will include banning high-capacity magazines, banning certain semi and automatic assault rifles - and not just focusing on school safety but focusing in on gun violence as a whole.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"The fire alarm went off, and we all thought it was kind of weird because we had one that morning. But then we heard gunshots. ... And then a cop car pulled up, and they told (students): 'Run past Westglades, run past the highway, run past the creek.' And we had to go, like, single file and everything, and it still really hadn't hit me at that point. But then, when we were walking out towards Walmart, we saw an armored SWAT car, and that's when it really hit me that this is something real, this is something (where) people are losing their lives at this very moment.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because previous generations couldn't do what we're doing right now. And we want to make this time the last time. So if that means marching all over the world, then I want to be a part of it.\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I want to see safer schools. I don't want to hear that kids don't feel safe at schools. ... I want to see change in gun laws, and I want to see control. We're giving it to people who, it's just not safe. There's no other way to put it, really.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"I was in the freshman building on the third floor. And the fire alarm went off for the second time, and I was making my way to the staircase, and then everyone started screaming and running back. And I almost didn't make it into the classroom, and I'm just - I'm glad I did. The shots just kept coming and coming. And I thought it was still a drill because they said we were going to have a drill, and then everyone started screaming along with the shots. And I was locked in the classroom on top of a printer for a good hour and a half. (When we were finally able to leave), I saw bodies everywhere, and there were just splatters on the wall. They actually told us to put our heads down and hands on the people's shoulders in front of us, and it was very hard not to look around at the bullet holes in the wall. The only way to get out of the building was to step in blood and over bodies.\"\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here today because it happened to our school, and it shouldn't have happened. It shouldn't have happened anywhere, and we feel like it's time to make change and get gun reform.\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"The change I'm looking for is gun reform on banning military-style weapons and more protections for our schools.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"It was a lot of confusion because at first nobody really knew what it was because the fire drill had went off. So most people were going out for the fire drill, and then people heard the code rode, but some people heard it too late. So it was just a lot of confusion. And then after, it was just mostly shock hearing how many people died and how quickly it happened.\"\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because I look at the younger kids and I look at the future generations, and I just never want them to have to go through what we went through and to experience what we saw and what we heard ... and just have to deal with being told, 'Oh, it's not a problem with guns and this and that.' And I feel there really needs to be a change. And we keep saying, 'Oh, this is going to be the last time,' but there's already been another time.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Better gun laws and legislators voted into office that will actually do something about it and not just tell us, 'Oh, what you guys are doing is not going to do anything. It doesn't matter to me. I'm not going for (re-election).' We want people that actually care.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"When I heard the shots, I just remember looking at my teacher and seeing his face and just the kids around me. We all just had, like, blank faces. And I remember getting a phone call from one of my best friends. She was in a closet. ... She didn't think that she would get out of the closet. And I just remember her crying hysterically to me, and at that moment, I was heartbroken. I got a picture of one of my good friends. She was shot in the leg. Just seeing it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It didn't feel real.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Andrew Harnik contributed to this report.",

                "title": "'He fell a hero:\" French praise policeman in hostage swap",
                "body": "TREBES, France (AP) -- A French police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage has died, raising the death toll in the attack in southern France to four. He was honored Saturday as a national hero of \"exceptional courage and selflessness.\"\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was among the first officers to respond to the attack Friday on the supermarket in the French town of Trebes.\n\nBeltrame, who joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had organized a training session in the Aude region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to the Depeche du Midi newspaper.\n\n\"We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,\" he said then.\n\nBut when he went inside the supermarket Friday, he gave up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morocco-born hostage-taker, he left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.\n\nInvestigators quickly searched the home of the attacker, Redouane Lakdim, 25, and found what a judicial official said were notes \"that alluded to the Islamic State and appeared like a last testament.\" They also found a computer and telephone that will be examined for information. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly amid an investigation.\n\nInvestigators also found three homemade explosive devices, a handgun and a hunting knife inside the supermarket, the official said. The weapons suggested his intent to do further damage.\n\nTwo people were detained for alleged links to a terrorist enterprise, one woman close to Lakdim and a 17-year-old male friend of his, Paris prosecutor's office said.\n\nIn addition to the four people killed by the gunman in his rampage Friday, the attacker was killed by police. Fifteen others were injured.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nFrench police and soldiers have been a prime target of attacks by extremists, with 10 killed in recent years, including Beltrame. Dozens of others have been wounded.\n\nAccording to Macron's statement, Beltrame also served as a member of the presidential guard and in 2012 earned one of France's highest honors, the Order of Merit. He was married with no children.\n\nCedric Beltrame told RTL radio Saturday that his brother died \"a hero.\"\n\n\"He was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing,\" Cedric Beltrame said.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio that for her son, \"to defend the homeland\" was \"his reason to live.\"\n\n\"He would have said to me, 'I'm doing my job, Mom, nothing more,'\" she said.\n\nPeople were placing flowers in front of the Gendarmerie headquarters in the French medieval city of Carcassone to pay tribute to Beltrame. Flags at all gendarmeries were ordered to fly at half-staff.\n\nMayor Eric Menassi of Trebes, a town of 6,000, said people there were forever marked.\n\n\"There will be a before and an after ... yesterday we were able to measure how much radicalism can affect anyone,\" he said.\n\nMacron says investigators will focus on establishing how Lakdim got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, hitting one in the shoulder, said Yves Lefebvre of the SGP Police-FO police union.\n\nThe attacker then went to a Super U supermarket in Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking hostages. He shouted \"Allahu akbar!\" -- the Arabic phrase for \"God is great\" -- and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\nSpecial police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nGuibbert said he put his wife, sister-in-law and other shoppers in the meat locker for safety.\n\nThe manager of the supermarket, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, called the ordeal \"terrifying.\" She was in her office when she heard the shots.\n\n\"Call the gendarmes,\" she told her employees. \"There's a terrorist in the store.\"\n\nShe said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\nThe hostage whose life Beltrame saved, a store employee named Julie, was in a \"catastrophic state,\" she said.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people.\n\nGanley reported from Paris. Associated Press journalists Thomas Adamson, Samuel Petrequin, Sylvie Corbet, Angela Charlton and Jerome Pugmire contributed from Paris.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show dead policeman's rank was Lt. Col., not Col. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants.",

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft let over 100 people, including families of victims of the Parkland shooting, use the team's charter plane for the trip.\n\nTeam spokesman Stacey James says astronaut Mark Kelly reached out to Kraft for the favor.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say no to, especially involving these victims,\" James said.\n\nMore than 20,000 people are expected at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally nearest the Florida school where last month's deadly shooting occurred.\n\nPolice presence was heavy early Saturday at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in.\n\nEighteen-year-old Sabrine Brismeur and 17-year-old Eden Kinlock came from schools 20 miles away to pass out water.\n\nKinlock said that may seem \"like a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe White House is applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights\" at gun control marches in Washington and in cities around the nation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says \"keeping our children safe is a top priority\" of President Donald Trump and points to his calls on Congress to pass legislation related to expanded background checks and school safety.\n\nTrump is at his Florida home for the weekend. His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

(AP) -- The man made famous by being \"the most interesting man in the world\" while pitching Dos Equis beer is lending his expertise with his perfectly groomed facial hair by helping to judge a contest looking for the best beard in Vermont.\n\nJonathan Goldsmith, whose close-cropped beard was a key part of the image of the cigar-smoking sophisticate, will judge the Best Beardies competition Saturday. It's sponsored by the Vermont chapter of the Make-a-Wish Foundation.\n\nLast year's competition raised nearly $30,000 for Make-a-Wish Vermont and this year, organizers hope to raise more.\n\nGoldsmith said before the competition that a beard reveals the personality of the man who sports it.\n\n\"If it's wild looking, unkempt - that has some statement. If it's immaculately trimmed, it might mean that he keeps a clean desk,\" said Goldsmith, a Vermont resident who now promotes tequila. \"If it's really long, I would say that it's somebody who is his own man and doesn't really care about convention.\"\n\nAmong this year's 20 competitors who have made it to Saturday's finals is Steve Jalbert, 33, of Barre, whose long beard counters his bald pate. He's one of the top fundraisers for the competition. The winners for each category - people's choice, urban, freestyle, backwoods and the ultimate beard - win a plaque, a gift card for beard care products and bragging rights.\n\nHe said friends, family and admirers of his beard, which he's been working on for about a year, urged him to enter.\n\n\"The biggest thing is you have to have patience. It doesn't grow fast,\" Jalbert said.\n\nThere's a science to ensuring that his beard remains kempt, he said. He washes it several times a week and he uses oils to keep it tame and looking good.\n\n\"Most people have a good thing to say about a guy with good beard,\" said Jalbert.\n\nAlso judging those goods beards is Bryan Sturge, last year's winner. He still has the beard he grew to honor his daughter who died of cancer in 2013.\n\nOrganizers have also drawn the Montana Make-a-Wish organization into the best-beard fray.\n\nMontana, which is holding its finals March 29, is betting bison steaks it can find a better beard in Big Sky Country than the Green Mountain State. Vermont is countering that bet with of maple syrup.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Student survivors of the Florida school massacre anchored a massive rally against gun violence Saturday in Washington, D.C., while throngs of other young people took to the streets in sister marches across the U.S. The protests followed widespread student walkouts last week.\n\nHere's a look at what some of the demonstrators from Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had to say:\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"Because we keep chanting, 'Never again,' 'Enough is enough,' 'Never again.' But it's already happened again. It happened in Maryland. There was a shooting in Napa (California's Napa County). So I'm really here to make sure we can make our voices heard; so people are empowered to make sure we vote in legislators so this doesn't happen again; so we can avenge those who were stolen from us because someone thought it was OK to own weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I definitely want people to vote in new legislators that will help us pass bills that will include banning high-capacity magazines, banning certain semi and automatic assault rifles - and not just focusing on school safety but focusing in on gun violence as a whole.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"The fire alarm went off, and we all thought it was kind of weird because we had one that morning. But then we heard gunshots. ... And then a cop car pulled up, and they told (students): 'Run past Westglades, run past the highway, run past the creek.' And we had to go, like, single file and everything, and it still really hadn't hit me at that point. But then, when we were walking out towards Walmart, we saw an armored SWAT car, and that's when it really hit me that this is something real, this is something (where) people are losing their lives at this very moment.\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because previous generations couldn't do what we're doing right now. And we want to make this time the last time. So if that means marching all over the world, then I want to be a part of it.\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I want to see safer schools. I don't want to hear that kids don't feel safe at schools. ... I want to see change in gun laws, and I want to see control. We're giving it to people who, it's just not safe. There's no other way to put it, really.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"I was in the freshman building on the third floor. And the fire alarm went off for the second time, and I was making my way to the staircase, and then everyone started screaming and running back. And I almost didn't make it into the classroom, and I'm just - I'm glad I did. The shots just kept coming and coming. And I thought it was still a drill because they said we were going to have a drill, and then everyone started screaming along with the shots. And I was locked in the classroom on top of a printer for a good hour and a half. (When we were finally able to leave), I saw bodies everywhere, and there were just splatters on the wall. They actually told us to put our heads down and hands on the people's shoulders in front of us, and it was very hard not to look around at the bullet holes in the wall. The only way to get out of the building was to step in blood and over bodies.\"\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here today because it happened to our school, and it shouldn't have happened. It shouldn't have happened anywhere, and we feel like it's time to make change and get gun reform.\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"The change I'm looking for is gun reform on banning military-style weapons and more protections for our schools.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"It was a lot of confusion because at first nobody really knew what it was because the fire drill had went off. So most people were going out for the fire drill, and then people heard the code rode, but some people heard it too late. So it was just a lot of confusion. And then after, it was just mostly shock hearing how many people died and how quickly it happened.\"\n\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because I look at the younger kids and I look at the future generations, and I just never want them to have to go through what we went through and to experience what we saw and what we heard ... and just have to deal with being told, 'Oh, it's not a problem with guns and this and that.' And I feel there really needs to be a change. And we keep saying, 'Oh, this is going to be the last time,' but there's already been another time.\"\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Better gun laws and legislators voted into office that will actually do something about it and not just tell us, 'Oh, what you guys are doing is not going to do anything. It doesn't matter to me. I'm not going for (re-election).' We want people that actually care.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"When I heard the shots, I just remember looking at my teacher and seeing his face and just the kids around me. We all just had, like, blank faces. And I remember getting a phone call from one of my best friends. She was in a closet. ... She didn't think that she would get out of the closet. And I just remember her crying hysterically to me, and at that moment, I was heartbroken. I got a picture of one of my good friends. She was shot in the leg. Just seeing it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It didn't feel real.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Andrew Harnik contributed to this report.",

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft let over 100 people, including families of victims of the Parkland shooting, use the team's charter plane for the trip.\n\nTeam spokesman Stacey James says astronaut Mark Kelly reached out to Kraft for the favor.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say no to, especially involving these victims,\" James said.\n\nMore than 20,000 people are expected at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally nearest the Florida school where last month's deadly shooting occurred.\n\nPolice presence was heavy early Saturday at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in.\n\nEighteen-year-old Sabrine Brismeur and 17-year-old Eden Kinlock came from schools 20 miles away to pass out water.\n\nKinlock said that may seem \"like a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe White House is applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights\" at gun control marches in Washington and in cities around the nation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says \"keeping our children safe is a top priority\" of President Donald Trump and points to his calls on Congress to pass legislation related to expanded background checks and school safety.\n\nTrump is at his Florida home for the weekend. His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

                "title": "Planned Russian statue starts mini-Cold War in American city",
                "body": "ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. (AP) -- Back in World War II when the U.S. and Russia were allied against the Nazis, hundreds of Soviet aviators were trained on the North Carolina coast as part of a secret spy project - but now, an effort to honor their mission has triggered a miniature Cold War in a small American city.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense wants to place a 25-ton bronze monument in Elizabeth City, where the recently declassified \"Project Zebra\" was carried out. Russia would pay for the 13-foot tall monument, with the city footing the bill for improvements to the as-yet undeveloped park on the Pasquotank River where it would be located.\n\nBut amid international tensions and fears about Russian hacking of U.S. elections, Elizabeth City elected officials have rejected a memorandum of understanding that was to be the next step.\n\n\"We are living in troubled times, and people are very concerned about a lot of things,\" council member Anita Hummer said at the meeting where the council voted 5-3 to reject the memorandum. \"And I realize that it's about honoring fallen heroes from World War II, and we have Americans who fought in World War II who are buried in Russia. But times were different then.\"\n\nOne council member warned the monument could be a Trojan horse. Johnnie Walton worries the Russians could put something in it that could be triggered remotely to disrupt the internet or electrical grid.\n\n\"Russia is known for hacking now. They're experts at hacking, and then we've got the largest Coast Guard base (that) can't help anybody because our computers have gone down, because Russia controls our mouse,\" Walton said at a committee meeting, according to The Daily Advance of Elizabeth City.\n\nA Russian-American joint commission on POWs and MIAs wanted the monument in Elizabeth City because of a top-secret WWII operation at U.S. Coast Guard station there. Declassified just a few years ago, Project Zebra helped train about 300 Soviet aviators. Their mission was to find German submarines and bomb them.\n\nOne night in 1945, three Russians, a Ukrainian and a Canadian were killed when a seaplane bound for Russia crashed in the Pasquotank River. Their sacrifice was never publicly recognized and the crash was forgotten for decades.\n\nAfter Project Zebra was declassified in 2013, efforts slowly developed to honor it with a monument, which would include three figures - one each of Soviet, U.S. and United Kingdom aviators.\n\nThe previous city council unanimously approved the statue in May 2017. So supporters were caught off-guard by when the new council backtracked and voted nyet in February - especially because three of the negative votes came from incumbents who had supported it earlier.\n\nLocated in northeastern North Carolina near the Virginia border, Elizabeth City was founded in 1793 and has a population of about 18,000. Locals describe the area as progressive in some ways but also fiscally conservative.\n\nIn 2013, the local Republican Party challenged an African-American college student's candidacy for city council. Eventually, the State Board of Election interceded, and the student ran for office and won.\n\nAnd for what may be the first time, the council's majority is African-American and so is the mayor.\n\nPublic discussion has played out along mostly racial lines; four of the five council members who oppose the monument are black, and two of three who support it are white. At one meeting, council member Darius Horton asked the city manager if Elizabeth City has any monuments to minorities or women.\n\nInformation about the monument didn't filter to the African-American community as well as it did to the white community, said Hezekiah Brown, one of two citizens who spoke against it. Not that he's convinced that more information would matter.\n\n\"We're at war with Russia still. We're in a cyberwar here,\" Brown said. \"They interfered in our election. And they've not said they won't do it again. ... The war has to end. Then you do something. You don't do it while you're at war.\"\n\nBut elected officials also are hearing from citizens such as Rick Boyd, who turned in a petition with 569 local signatures supporting the project. He said another 200 people have signed an online petition. The monument offers the two rival nations a chance \"to show that we worked together in the past, and that we can work together in the future,\" he told the council.\n\nMayor Bettie Parker suggested the vote might have turned out differently if it had happened earlier. \"I keep hearing now is not the time to deal with anything that's coming from Russia,\" said Parker, who only votes in a tie.\n\nCouncil member Billy Caudle, who supports the monument, says people who are concerned about the appearance of an alliance with Russia are \"confusing current events with history.\"\n\nRetired U.S. Air Force Gen. Robert Foglesong, chairman of the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, has asked the city council to reconsider its vote. But for now, the council majority seems steadfast.\n\nMembers complained at their most recent meeting that the monument debate has divided Elizabeth City and they need to concentrate on more important issues. Walton said he was sick of discussing the monument and recommended that it be erected in Russia.\n\n\"Those people's relatives live in Russia,\" he said. \"Give them the opportunity to ride by on a Sunday, say a prayer, do all the things that people do when you're memorializing somebody.\"",

                "title": "Fate of utility consumers under federal tax overhaul uneven",
                "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Utility companies around the nation are reacting in varied ways to states' demands that they return federal tax cut proceeds to their customers. Some companies are readily complying, while others are balking.\n\nPressure to send the savings back to electricity, gas and water customers regulated at the state level escalated recently after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission demanded federally regulated utilities report back to them about the potential tax windfall and returning the money to customers.\n\nDavid Hayes, director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center, said that should boost efforts by consumer groups, elected officials and public utilities commissions from California to Maine who have been pushing for state-regulated utilities to pass along the tax cuts to customers.\n\n\"Hopefully, the fact that FERC came out so quickly and emphatically about this issue will help the advocates in the states - attorneys general, and others - to push the PUCs and the utilities to return those funds to ratepayers,\" he said.\n\nAt issue is an estimated $1 billion in tax savings this year and $5 billion over the next two years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax cut package into law in December. It provides generous tax cuts for corporations, including utilities, but more modest reductions for middle- and low-income individuals and families. The law's corporate tax rate reduction affects regulated utilities because taxes are an expense the companies pass along to consumers.\n\nAmong the big questions posed by the law's passage is how much should go back to customers and over what period, said Ken Costello, of the National Regulatory Research Institute, which represents state utility regulatory commissions.\n\n\"It's not as easy as it appears on the surface,\" Costello said.\n\nDemocratic Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey was the first attorney general to call for the return. Others soon followed. A bipartisan coalition of attorneys general, state agencies and consumer advocates from 18 states called on the federal government to assure public utility customers - not utility shareholders - receive the benefits of the federal tax cut.\n\nAmong the group was Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear, a Democrat, who sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking for a rate reduction that would pass the tax savings directly to customers.\n\n\"Kentuckians were called upon to pay utility bills at the previous, higher tax rate, and now that the companies' taxes are lower all the savings should be returned immediately to each ratepayer,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, a Republican, filed five motions with the state's utility regulatory body seeking immediate customer rate reductions. The Corporation Commission approved his proposals in a 2-to-1 vote. At least one utility serving the state, Oklahoma Gas & Electric, has said it will embed the tax savings in its upcoming rate package.\n\nAlternatively, some utilities want to put the tax savings toward infrastructure. Florida Power & Light Co., for example, says it will put the money toward repairs from Hurricane Irma, eliminating the need for a surcharge for customers and saving them an average of $250.\n\nCostello said other power companies contend there are factors complicating the issue and that they first need to know more about the new tax law.\n\nAfter the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio instructed American Electric Power, Dayton Power & Light, Duke Energy and FirstEnergy to treat any tax savings received after Jan. 1, 2018, as potential consumer savings in January, utilities filed an unusual joint response to regulators' orders to track tax savings requesting reconsideration. They argued the order lacked specifics, potentially violated a rule against retroactive utility refunds and fell outside the normal rate-making process.\n\nThe commission's order for companies to begin tracking how much they are over-collecting when using delivery rates developed under the previous 35-percent federal tax rate, rather than using the new 21-percent rate is still under negotiation.\n\n\"This is a significant and complex undertaking, and the (companies) urge the commission to methodically pursue the task in a thorough manner using a process that is fair and deliberate for each utility,\" the companies said in the filing.",

He was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and couldn't be named.\n\nPolice searched the home of Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, 25, after Friday's attack that killed four people -- two in a supermarket near the southern city of Carcassonne where the attacker was killed in an assault. The fourth victim, a gendarme who stood in for a female hostage and was shot, died early Saturday.\n\nThe official says there apparently was no mention in the notes of the attack plans.\n\nFrance is mourning the death of a courageous police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, a 44-year-old gendarme, died from his injuries after the attacker shot him. Flags are at half-staff at all French gendarmeries.\n\nHashtag #ArnaudBeltrame has been the most used on Twitter in France, with many social media users paying tribute to a \"hero\" who gave his life to save others.\n\nResidents of Carcassonne and the nearby town of Trebes, where the supermarket attack took place, are placing flowers in front of the gendarmerie local headquarters.\n\nMarie Kerboull, resident of Carcassone, said she her flowers were meant to be a show of support \"the family. He is our hero.\"\n\nMarie Castelles, of Trebes, said \"the military, the police officers, I would like to give them a big homage.\"\n\nThe manager of a supermarket in southern France that was attacked by an extremist gunman has praised the officer who exchanged himself for a hostage as a hero who saved her co-worker's life.\n\nThe manager, who identified herself only by her first name, Samia, said that her co-worker was in a \"catastrophic state\" after the death of the officer, Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame.\n\nBeltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack in the supermarket in Trebes, and in a carjacking beforehand in a nearby town. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe brother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that he has died a hero.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nCedric Beltrame told RTL radio Saturday his brother \"gave his life for strangers.\"\n\nHe added that his brother \"was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing.\" Cedric Beltrame also stressed that his brother kept his professional reflexes. The officer managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket.\n\nCedric Beltrame said that \"if we don't describe him as a hero, I don't know what you need to do to be a hero. It's a word I think is appropriate for him in such tragic circumstances.\"\n\nThe gunman was killed when police stormed the supermarket after hearing shots.\n\nThe manager of a French supermarket attacked by an Islamic extremist gunman says she felt \"helpless\" as he fired shots in her store.\n\nThe woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, says she was in her office when she heard the shots. She came downstairs saw what was happening and called police. She said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\nShe said from inside city hall, where the local government had set up a crisis center, that \"it was terrifying.\"\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack, including a French police officer who exchanged himself for a female hostage in the Super U market and later died of his injuries. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe Paris prosecutors' office says that police have detained a 17-year-old in connection with the investigation into the Islamic extremist attack that killed four people, including a police officer, in southern France.\n\nThe unidentified young man was arrested overnight over alleged criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise. He is a friend of the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, who was killed when police stormed a supermarket in Trebes where he took hostages.\n\nParis prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday that another person, a woman close to Lakdim, was taken into custody on the same grounds. Molins didn't identify her.\n\nParis counterterrorism investigators took over the probe into the attack in Trebes and nearby Carcassonne.\n\nThe mother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that she wasn't surprised by her son's courage.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injures.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio Friday night before the announcement of his death that \"I'm not surprised. I knew it had to be him. He has always been like that. It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland.\"\n\nAsked if she was proud of him, she said he would have told her \"'I'm doing my job mom, that's all.'\"\n\nShe said to \"defend the homeland\" was his \"reason for living.\" RTL didn't give her name.\n\nFrance's top security official says a heroic officer who swapped himself for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket has died of his injuries.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nBeltrame offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raises the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition. The attack was the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.\n\nA previous version of this story has been corrected throughout to show that the dead officer's rank is Lt.

Several placards with photos of German Chancellor Angela Merkel were crossed out.\n\n\"They say we are backward because we believe in God,\" said Gordana Turic, a former ruling party lawmaker. \"The Istanbul convention is against the Christianity.\"\n\nSeveral smaller counter-protests were set up along the route of the march, including one with a siren that tried to dampen the speeches by the conservatives on the main square.

                "title": "Fate of utility consumers under federal tax overhaul uneven",
                "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Utility companies around the nation are reacting in varied ways to states' demands that they return federal tax cut proceeds to their customers. Some companies are readily complying, while others are balking.\n\nPressure to send the savings back to electricity, gas and water customers regulated at the state level escalated recently after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission demanded federally regulated utilities report back to them about the potential tax windfall and returning the money to customers.\n\nDavid Hayes, director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center, said that should boost efforts by consumer groups, elected officials and public utilities commissions from California to Maine who have been pushing for state-regulated utilities to pass along the tax cuts to customers.\n\n\"Hopefully, the fact that FERC came out so quickly and emphatically about this issue will help the advocates in the states - attorneys general, and others - to push the PUCs and the utilities to return those funds to ratepayers,\" he said.\n\nAt issue is an estimated $1 billion in tax savings this year and $5 billion over the next two years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax cut package into law in December. It provides generous tax cuts for corporations, including utilities, but more modest reductions for middle- and low-income individuals and families. The law's corporate tax rate reduction affects regulated utilities because taxes are an expense the companies pass along to consumers.\n\nAmong the big questions posed by the law's passage is how much should go back to customers and over what period, said Ken Costello, of the National Regulatory Research Institute, which represents state utility regulatory commissions.\n\n\"It's not as easy as it appears on the surface,\" Costello said.\n\nDemocratic Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey was the first attorney general to call for the return. Others soon followed. A bipartisan coalition of attorneys general, state agencies and consumer advocates from 18 states called on the federal government to assure public utility customers - not utility shareholders - receive the benefits of the federal tax cut.\n\nAmong the group was Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear, a Democrat, who sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking for a rate reduction that would pass the tax savings directly to customers.\n\n\"Kentuckians were called upon to pay utility bills at the previous, higher tax rate, and now that the companies' taxes are lower all the savings should be returned immediately to each ratepayer,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, a Republican, filed five motions with the state's utility regulatory body seeking immediate customer rate reductions. The Corporation Commission approved his proposals in a 2-to-1 vote. At least one utility serving the state, Oklahoma Gas & Electric, has said it will embed the tax savings in its upcoming rate package.\n\nAlternatively, some utilities want to put the tax savings toward infrastructure. Florida Power & Light Co., for example, says it will put the money toward repairs from Hurricane Irma, eliminating the need for a surcharge for customers and saving them an average of $250.\n\nCostello said other power companies contend there are factors complicating the issue and that they first need to know more about the new tax law.\n\nAfter the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio instructed American Electric Power, Dayton Power & Light, Duke Energy and FirstEnergy to treat any tax savings received after Jan. 1, 2018, as potential consumer savings in January, utilities filed an unusual joint response to regulators' orders to track tax savings requesting reconsideration. They argued the order lacked specifics, potentially violated a rule against retroactive utility refunds and fell outside the normal rate-making process.\n\nThe commission's order for companies to begin tracking how much they are over-collecting when using delivery rates developed under the previous 35-percent federal tax rate, rather than using the new 21-percent rate is still under negotiation.\n\n\"This is a significant and complex undertaking, and the (companies) urge the commission to methodically pursue the task in a thorough manner using a process that is fair and deliberate for each utility,\" the companies said in the filing.",

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft let over 100 people, including families of victims of the Parkland shooting, use the team's charter plane for the trip.\n\nTeam spokesman Stacey James says astronaut Mark Kelly reached out to Kraft for the favor.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say no to, especially involving these victims,\" James said.\n\nMore than 20,000 people are expected at the \"March for Our Lives\" rally nearest the Florida school where last month's deadly shooting occurred.\n\nPolice presence was heavy early Saturday at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as organizers set up and demonstrators streamed in.\n\nEighteen-year-old Sabrine Brismeur and 17-year-old Eden Kinlock came from schools 20 miles away to pass out water.\n\nKinlock said that may seem \"like a small thing but it helps in the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe White House is applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights\" at gun control marches in Washington and in cities around the nation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters says \"keeping our children safe is a top priority\" of President Donald Trump and points to his calls on Congress to pass legislation related to expanded background checks and school safety.\n\nTrump is at his Florida home for the weekend. His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

A motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club in the morning.\n\nLarge rallies also took shape in such cities as Boston, Houston and Parkland, Florida, the site of the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead.\n\nThe police presence was heavy as more than 20,000 people filled a park near the school, chanting slogans such as \"Enough is enough\" and carrying signs that read \"Why do your guns matter more than our lives?\" and \"Our ballots will stop bullets.\"\n\nGun violence was fresh for some in the Washington crowd: Ayanne Johnson of Great Mills High School in Maryland held a sign declaring, \"I March for Jaelynn,\" honoring Jaelynn Willey, who died Thursday two days after being shot by a classmate at the school. A boy was injured in the attack, and the shooter died.\n\nSince the bloodshed in Florida, students have tapped into a current of gun control sentiment that has been building for years -- yet still faces a powerful counterpoint from the National Rifle Association and its supporters.\n\nOrganizers hope the passions of the crowds and the under-18 roster of speakers will translate into a tipping point starting in the midterm elections this year.\n\nThe protesters, many of them high school students, claim that the youth leadership of this initiative is what will set it apart from previous attempts to enact stronger gun-control legislation.\n\nPolls indicate that public opinion nationwide may be shifting on an issue that has simmered for generations, and through dozens of mass shootings.\n\nA new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the U.S. should be tightened. That's up from 61 percent who said the same in October 2016 and 55 percent when the AP first asked the question in October 2013. Overall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun control laws.\n\nBut even with claims of historic social momentum on the issue of gun control, the AP poll also found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action.\n\nAmong the questions facing march organizers and participants will be how to translate this one-day event into legislative change.\n\nOne way they hope to do that is by registering young voters and channeling energy into the midterm congressional elections this fall.",

                "body": "A federal heating aid program for low-income residents has survived another attempt by President Donald Trump to kill it.\n\nThe $1.3 trillion spending bill signed by Trump on Friday includes $3.64 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n\nThe energy assistance funding includes an extra $250 million, the first increase in five years.\n\n\"It's amazing, isn't it?\" said Mark Wolfe, director of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association in Washington, D.C. \"Not only did Congress reject the president's proposal but they increased our funding. This will significantly help poor people.\"\n\nThe program is especially important in the Northeast, where states are more reliant on heating oil to keep their homes warm in the winter.\n\nIt was the second time Trump tried to kill the program. He contends it's unnecessary and rife with fraud, but program supporters say he's wrong on both counts. They say the program known as LIHEAP is a lifeline for the elderly, disabled and others on fixed incomes.\n\nTrump said states have programs to prevent utility shutoffs in cold weather, but there's no such requirement for heating oil dealers, which are not regulated like electric and natural gas utilities, to deliver to customers who cannot pay.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, had called Trump's efforts to gut the program \"dangerous and unacceptable.\"\n\n\"The past few weeks of storms have demonstrated that heating assistance is an absolute necessity,\" she said.\n\nAll told, the program has served about 6 million households in recent years, and the extra funding is enough to serve another 500,000 households, Wolfe said. In addition to helping people stay warm, the program helps people stay cool in the blazing summer heat of states like Florida and Arizona.\n\nDwayne Labrecque, a disabled worker in Hartford, Maine, expressed relief that the program isn't going to be eliminated and instead will be expanded.\n\nThe program has helped him, his fiancee and their five children stay in their home. Without it, they may have had to sell their house.\n\n\"We've been living week to week with oil heat. If the heat hadn't been there for us, I don't know what we would've done,\" said Labrecque, a diabetic who's recovering from surgeries after losing several toes and part of his foot to infection.",

                "title": "C ya! Mets' David Wright is baseball's lone captain in 2018",
                "body": "MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Anthony Rizzo is a three-time All-Star and the 2017 winner of the Roberto Clemente Award, baseball's biggest honor for sportsmanship and community involvement. Jon Lester is a three-time World Series champion, and Jason Heyward organized the most important meeting in franchise history.\n\nPlenty of leaders with the Chicago Cubs. No captain.\n\nOne of the most revered titles in sports is hanging by a thread in baseball, which treats its history with hallowed tones in almost every case, but doesn't seem the slightest bit concerned about the absence of the iconic C on the front of its uniforms. New York Mets third baseman David Wright is the majors' only captain on the eve of the season, and it's unclear if he will ever play again.\n\n\"Leadership is a taken role and people want to follow you just based on how you are, how you treat them, how well you listen, how well you interact daily, how much you really are into them as opposed to yourself,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, \"and that becomes obvious. Leadership is taken, man. It's hard to just place that out there.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old Wright was named the fourth captain in Mets history in 2013, joining Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter and John Franco. He made the last of his seven NL All-Star teams that same year before he was hampered by a series of injuries. He hasn't appeared in a major league game since 2016.\n\nWright declared right away that he wouldn't wear the C on the front of his jersey, so that special touch has been missing from baseball for a couple years.\n\n\"I'm not sure if there's a benefit to having a title and I've never been one to like come in here and say you have to listen to me because I'm the captain,\" Wright said. \"I would hope that if I have something to say that somebody would listen to me because of, you know, because of what I've hopefully displayed in the clubhouse and be considered kind of a leader in here.\"\n\nBut Wright made no attempt to hide the significance of the title to him.\n\n\"I'll say it again, that to this day it's probably the biggest honor away from the field of my career,\" he said.\n\nA variety of factors have contributed to the decline of captains. Many of the captains across sports spend most of their careers with a single team, but that has become a rarity in baseball. There also are no real responsibilities for the title.\n\nHockey captains serve as the team's liaison to the officials. NFL captains participate in the pregame coin toss. NBA captains also have specific responsibilities, but baseball barely mentions the word in its rulebook.\n\n\"There's no, like, formal meeting,\" Washington ace Max Scherzer said. \"It's not like football where you go out there and shake the other team's hands and you need captains to go do that. Baseball doesn't have that. So maybe that's why you don't see it. There's no coin toss.\"\n\nBut the list of baseball captains still includes some of the biggest names in the history of the sport. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Thurman Munson and Derek Jeter are on the list of 11 Yankees captains. Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider with the Dodgers. Jimmie Foxx and Carl Yastrzemski for the Boston Red Sox. Willie Stargell, Barry Larkin and other Hall of Famers.\n\nJeter thought he did something wrong when then-Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called to make him captain in 2003.\n\n\"The boss, Mr. Steinbrenner usually only called if you were in trouble during the season,\" Jeter said. \"He called me, we were in Cincinnati, and said he wanted to name me the captain. It was a welcome phone call.\"\n\nThe list of baseball captains underscores not only the special players to hold the title, but also the unique situations that led to their leadership position.\n\nRizzo, Lester and Heyward, who got the Cubs together during a key moment in Game 7 of their World Series win in 2016, could each serve as captain. But identifying one leader in Chicago's clubhouse at the possible expense of its other respected veterans likely would hurt the team more than help it. There are similar situations in several other clubhouses across the sport.\n\n\"Having a team captain could conceivably in some ways change the relationship between the manager and the coaches and the rest of the team,\" Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said.\n\n\"So, again, it's all about the people. It's not that it's a good idea or a bad idea, it's all about the people. It's not just the guy you're considering for that position but also everybody around him, your own players, the manager, the coaching staff. You really have to think of it in those terms.\"\n\nAP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick and AP Sports Writer Steven Wine contributed to this report.",

                "title": "7 months after Harvey, flood-control projects' fate unclear",
                "body": "HOUSTON (AP) -- Large-scale projects long considered essential to easing Houston's flooding woes went to the top of the area's to-do list after Hurricane Harvey inundated large swaths of the nation's fourth-largest city.\n\nSeven months later, local officials are still looking for funding to undertake plans that include a new reservoir, deeper and wider bayous and a costal barrier system - all of which have fallen victim to a lack of money or political will in the past.\n\nYet local leaders insist this time will be different, saying they're committed to making the projects a reality, even as they wait to find out how much money they might get from the state and federal governments and whether local taxpayers will be willing to help out.\n\n\"There's been a whole lot of talk over the years, but now it's time to get it done in the post-Harvey era,\" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said at a recent community meeting.\n\nOne thing that's giving Turner and others hope is that billions of federal dollars have been allocated to pay for flood-mitigation projects. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has promised $1 billion for areas affected by Harvey, though Houston will be competing with other Texas communities for that funding. Congress in February provided $15 billion to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood-control projects nationwide, some of which could go to the Houston area.\n\nHouston, which was founded on the banks of the Buffalo Bayou around the mid-1800s and rises barely above sea level, has long been susceptible to flooding.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has promised $1 billion for areas affected by Harvey, though Houston will be competing with other Texas communities for that funding. Congress in February provided $15 billion to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood-control projects nationwide, some of which could go to the Houston area.\n\nHouston, which was founded on the banks of the Buffalo Bayou around the mid-1800s and rises barely above sea level, has long been susceptible to flooding.

His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

                "body": "CAIRO (AP) -- Egyptian authorities arrested a British journalist and expelled her from the country after threatening her with a military trial, The Times said on Saturday. The move comes as part of a heavy crackdown on media ahead of this month's presidential elections.\n\nBel Trew, who has been in Egypt for seven years, had been detained and faced \"sufficiently outlandish\" threats to suggest a misunderstanding over reporting she carried out in a central Cairo district, The Times (of London) said. She was expelled in late February. The British daily has been since attempting to bring about Trew's safe return to Cairo to cover the elections but to no avail.\n\n\"It is now clear that the authorities have no intention of allowing her to return,\" The Times said in a statement. Egyptian authorities were not immediately available for comment.\n\nTrew said in an account on the Times' website that she has been listed as a persona non-grata and that Cairo authorities threatened to re-arrest her if she attempts to return.\n\nShe said her reporting in the district of Shoubra was part of a story on a migrant boat that disappeared two years ago. An informer seems to have reported her to the police, she added. She was stopped shortly after she left a cafe where she was conducting an interview.\n\n\"The taxi had just pulled away from the caf?... when a minibus of plain-clothes police officers cut us off. Five men jumped out and took me to a nearby police station,\" she said, adding that she provided the authorities with the audio recording of the interview. \"It was either ignored and not listened to -- or listened to and ignored,\" she said.\n\nEgypt has often detained, jailed and prosecuted journalists under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the military's 2013 overthrow of elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, after mass protests against his one-year divisive rule.\n\nAdvocacy group Reporters Without Borders ranked Egypt as 161 out of 180 countries on their 2017 World Press Freedom Index.\n\nThe New York-based Committee to Protect Journalist ranked Egypt among the top worst jailers of journalists in a December report. It says some 20 reporters remain detained; several face charges of spreading \"false news.\"\n\nSome 500 websites have been blocked since last year including many run by rights groups, sites critical of the government and the VPN services that help users bypass the blocks.\n\nPro-el-Sissi businessmen have also expanded their reach into an already cowed private media, according to Reporters Without Borders. The group says security forces maintain a list of \"wanted\" journalists they have sometimes even forcibly disappeared, and are especially keen to crack down on individuals who sell video content to opposition media abroad.\n\nThe government's stepped up warnings to the media ahead of the 26-28 March presidential election, in which el-Sissi faces no serious challenge after a string of hopefuls were forced out of the race or arrested. His only challenger is a little-known candidate who supports him.\n\nEarly March saw some of the harshest official rhetoric to date taking aim at the press. The country's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, described the media as \"forces of evil\" -- one of el-Sissi's hallmark phrases -- saying they have been trying to \"undermine the security and safety of the nation through the broadcast and publication of lies and false news.\" El-Sissi himself described any defamation of the country's security forces as \"high treason.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, a bill was proposed in parliament criminalizing any statements authorities define as insults toward the armed forces or police, with penalties of at least three-year jail terms and fines upward of 10,000 Egyptian pounds (or $567).\n\nEgyptian authorities have also published a list of telephone numbers for citizens to alert reports they view as undermining security or spreading false news.",

                "title": "Can Facebook restore public trust after privacy scandal?",
                "body": "CHICAGO (AP) -- It's a scandal of privacy, politics and an essential ingredient of business success - public trust.\n\nFacebook is confronting a costly, embarrassing public relations debacle after revelations that Cambridge Analytica may have misused data from some 50 million users to try to influence elections. Among its marquee clients: President Donald Trump's general election campaign.\n\nNow a company known as much for reminders of a long-lost friend's birthday and documentation of acquaintances' every whim is grappling with outrage- and the possible loss of confidence - from users around the globe that have made the social media site a part of their daily routine.\n\n\"I trust somebody until they give me a reason not to trust them,\" said Joseph Holt, who teaches business ethics at the University of Notre Dame. \"And Facebook has increasingly given me reasons not to trust them.\"\n\nLosing that would be a disaster, not just for Facebook, but for any Silicon Valley company that relies on users to open up their private lives.\n\nThe amount of trust placed in technology has soared. Cars sync with cell phones. Refrigerators know when there's no more milk and reorder it. Virtual assistants field answers to nearly any inane question.\n\nAnd with each turn of the steering wheel, sip of milk or request for dinner reservations, a trail of digital crumbs is left for companies to collect, analyze and profit off.\n\nThe public has largely been willing to accept the trade-off, knowing in exchange for giving up some data, Netflix will offer spot-on show suggestions, Amazon will prompt a diaper order and Google will figure out what to search before a user finishes typing it.\n\nNot everyone understands the darker side of data brokers in an always-connected society.\n\nEvery time a person shops online or at a store, loyalty cards linked to phone numbers or email addresses can be linked to other databases that may have location data, home addresses and more. Voting records, job history, credit scores (remember the Equifax hack?) are constantly mixed, matched and traded by companies in ways regulators haven't caught up with.\n\nWhile Facebook let slip data profiles on millions of people, \"it's much more than that,\" says James Grimmelmann, a professor at Cornell Law School. \"Trying to pin down any one breach as being the source of all the privacy harms out there is futile.\"\n\nFor Facebook, whose power and value are built on being so ever-present in people's lives, the impact has been immediate - its share price is down nearly 14 percent since the scandal broke March 16.\n\nInvestors fear that Facebook users will start to think twice before posting the latest snapshots of their puppy, or clicking \"like\" on a news story or movie trailer.\n\n\"It's something that's going to remain in people's memory,\" says Mike Chapple, a University of Notre Dame professor with expertise in cybersecurity. \"I think it's changed people's perceptions.\"\n\nAfter the scandal broke, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized, admitted his company's mistakes and said security needs to be enhanced to protect users' data. He noted that this is a major trust issue for the public.\n\nIt follows closely on the heels of the company acknowledging it helped spread fake news and propaganda from Russian-linked trolls disrupting the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhile some disenchanted Facebook users have deactivated their accounts, others point out that breaking up can be hard to do. If a credit card company or an airline's data is breached, it's easy enough to switch allegiances. But for most of Facebook's 2 billion users there's no real substitute, says Aaron Gordon, a partner at Schwartz Media Strategies, a Miami-based public relations and crisis management firm.\n\n\"It's a lot harder to just up and leave,\" he says. \"So you go to Twitter or Instagram? It's not the same.\"\n\n(Besides, Instagram is owned by Facebook.)\n\nHolt, the business ethics professor, loved Facebook, but with all that's come out, he feels like he's in an abusive relationship. He estimates he cut his usage from about 30 minutes daily to about 10 minutes every other day and would happily flee altogether if a viable alternative emerged that more zealously protected data.\n\n\"I haven't left it yet, but I go less often and I feel less good about it,\" he says.\n\nFacebook is not the only company to deal with misuse of private information that has weakened public confidence. Equifax, the credit reporting agency, and Target, the retail giant, both suffered massive data breaches affecting tens of millions of people. Wells Fargo faced stiff government fines for a fake accounts scandal.\n\nThe public tends to get numb to this steady drumbeat of bad news, says brand strategist Rachel Brand.\n\n\"People pick their battles and daily outrage,\" she says. \"Facebook messed up royally, but most people are on a daily outrage roller-coaster and aren't sure if this is the hill worth dying on.\"\n\nMatt Sedensky reported from New York.

It costs jobs.\"\n\nSuddenly, the world's financial markets are gripped by fear that an escalating trade rift between the United States and China - the two mightiest economies - could smear the world with a lot of splattered cream and broken crust. If it doesn't prove tragic, as Reagan warned, it may still inflict far-reaching pain.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average lost a combined nearly 1,150 points Thursday and Friday after President Donald Trump set his administration on a path to restrict Chinese investment in the United States and impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese products.\n\n\"We should be very worried,\" said Bryan Riley, director of the conservative National Taxpayer Union's Free Trade Initiative. \"It's very possible this could escalate into something that neither country intends.\"\n\nThe trade sanctions that Trump unveiled Thursday are meant to punish Beijing for pilfering technology from American companies or for forcing them to hand over technology in exchange for access to China's market. The announcement followed a seven-month investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative into the tactics China has deployed to try to overtake American technological supremacy.\n\n\"China has not been playing by the rules,\" said Stephen Ezell, director of global innovation policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation think tank.\n\nUnbowed, China immediately threatened to retaliate if the United States followed through on its actions.\n\nOn Friday, Beijing unveiled a broad list of U.S. products - from apples and wine to pork to steel pipe - that could face retaliatory Chinese tariffs in a separate trade spat with Washington. That dispute is over taxes that Trump imposed this month on imported steel and aluminum.\n\n\"We don't want a trade war, but we are not afraid of it,\" said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe stakes are even higher in the standoff over Beijing's technology policies than in the old-school dispute over metals. An industrial nation's ability to harness technology is increasingly vital to healthy economic expansion.\n\n\"If China dominates the industries of the future, it will be very difficult for the United States to have an economic future,\" Peter Navarro, a key White House trade adviser, told reporters.\n\nTrade tensions are rising at a delicate time. The world economy has finally emerged from the shadow of the Great Recession. Major regions are growing in tandem for the first time in a decade. International economic growth is expected to reach a seven-year high of 3.9 percent this year. Last year, global trade expanded 4.2 percent, the most since 2011.\n\nSome trade experts fear that a conflict over technology will erupt into an escalating war of sanctions between the world's two biggest economies - Reagan's destructive pie fight.\n\nThe U.S.-China tensions remind economists and trade analysts of the Reagan-era skirmishes between the United States and Japan, which at the time appeared to pose a grave threat to U.S. economic dominance.\n\n\"This is 'Back to the Future' - that old '80s film,\" said Rod Hunter, a former White House trade adviser. Indeed, Trump's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, is a veteran of the trade battles with Tokyo, having served in the Reagan administration.\n\nTo target China, Trump and Lighthizer dusted off a Cold War weapon from the Reagan years: Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which lets the president unilaterally impose tariffs. The provision was meant for a world in which much of global commerce wasn't covered by trade agreements. But with the arrival in 1995 of the World Trade Organization, Section 301 fell largely into disuse.\n\nIn some ways, a hard-nosed approach succeeded against Japan three decades ago. Under U.S. pressure, Tokyo agreed to \"voluntary export restraints\" to limit auto shipments to the United States. But to bypass the limits, Japanese automakers simply built plants in the American South.\n\nLikewise, the Reagan administration in 1985 strong-armed Japan, Germany, France and Britain to raise their currencies' values to help U.S. manufacturers squeezed by a strong dollar, which makes U.S. goods costlier overseas.\n\nBut the United States wielded unusual leverage with Japan. The two countries are close political allies; Japan depends on U.S. military protection. China, by contrast, is a geopolitical rival, far less likely to bend to U.S. pressure.\n\nIt's true that China has benefited enormously from access to the American market and has much to lose: Last year, it exported $375 billion more in goods to the United States than it bought in return - a record trade gap that irritates Trump.\n\nBut a full-blown trade war would test Trump's fortitude for commercial combat and would certainly hurt many Americans, including some of Trump's supporters. Most directly, U.S. tariffs would raise costs for consumers and businesses.\n\nTrade groups are already lobbying the Trump administration to seek diplomatic solutions to the disputes. China's all-powerful leaders face no such public pressure.\n\n\"We live in a society where stakeholders in Congress are going to put a lot of pressure on the administration,\" said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"In China, they don't.\"\n\nStill, the 301 sanctions might be enough to prod the Chinese to return to the negotiating table to consider softening their aggressive technology policies.\n\n\"If this gets the two countries back to the table to talk about this, then that is a good outcome,\" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. \"If the idea is to inflict sufficient pain so that China feels it has no choice but to change its policies, then I'm skeptical.\"",

                "title": "Ex-NFL lineman Evan Mathis selling prized Mickey Mantle card",
                "body": "After retiring from the NFL a little more than a year ago, Evan Mathis decided to move closer to where he grew up in Alabama.\n\nAnd to get the kind of house he and his wife wanted, Mathis needed to free up some money. And that meant the avid sports card collector would have to part with his prized possession: a 1952 Mickey Mantle baseball card.\n\n\"Just that image of the young Mickey Mantle, over the years it's been a centerpiece of the hobby,\" Mathis told The Associated Press by phone. \"I guess it's kind of like the Mona Lisa of the sports card world.\"\n\nIssued as part of its first set of baseball cards by Topps, the Mantle card is the marquee piece of a card-only spring collection by Heritage Auctions. It is one of six versions of the card to have been rated a Mint 9 by PSA, one of the leading sports memorabilia authenticators, with three others having earned a Mint 10 rating.\n\nThe card has been estimated by Heritage to be valued at $3.5 million. For comparison, the highest price paid for a card at auction was $3.12 million two years ago for a 1909 Honus Wagner card.\n\n\"It's what I consider the new face of card collecting,\" said Chris Ivy, Heritage's director of sports auctions. \"For decades it's been the (Wagner card). For post-war (World War II) cards and the baby-boomer generation and beyond, it really does come down to this '52 Topps rookie Mickey Mantle card, which has kind of moved from just sports collecting to more of Americana.\"\n\nIvy attributes the high value of the card Mathis is selling due to its centering, strong corners and print quality - a rare combination, considering \"quality control wasn't the top issue\" for Topps in the 1950s.\n\n\"The fact that this one came out of the factory in strong condition, survived for many decades in that same condition, didn't get put in spokes or thrown away by mom is pretty miraculous,\" Ivy added.\n\nBidding for items in the collection, which also includes cards from the 19th century, ends April 20.\n\nMathis was a third-round pick by Carolina in the 2005 NFL draft. He retired in January 2017 after 12 seasons as an offensive guard with the Panthers, Miami, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Denver and Arizona. He was on the Broncos team that won Super Bowl 50.\n\nHe got into card collecting as a kid growing up a fan of Bo Jackson in Birmingham, Alabama, in the late 1980s. Jackson, who had attended high school in nearby McCalla before starring in football and baseball at Auburn, was a two-sport professional for the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders and baseball's Kansas City Royals. Mathis, about 6 years old then, started going to the store to buy packs of cards to get as many of Jackson as he could.\n\nBy his recollection, Mathis got away from the hobby around the time he was in middle school before picking it up again years later when his own NFL career was progressing and he could afford some of the cards he couldn't earlier. He was drawn to the 1952 Mantle card and bought several versions of the card inferior to the one he currently owns, and his best was a Mint 8 until about two years ago. That's when a collector friend sent him a photo of his Mint 9 to show it off, and Mathis knew he had to have it.\n\nMathis said he traded the \"vast majority\" of his collection and agreed to a payment plan for rest of the value to get the card. Now, he's moving with his wife, Katelynn, and their two daughters from Arizona to Tennessee to be close to family, and needed to free up some money.\n\n\"I don't think I'll have any regrets because I'll have a nice house to show for it instead of the card,\" he said.\n\nLooking to expand the pool of potential buyers, Mathis is willing to accept cryptocurrency such as bitcoin as payment.\n\n\"A lot of new money was created in crypto,\" Mathis said. \"There's a lot of people that might have some newfound riches that they might want to diversify with, and I just kind of wanted to spread the target market out a little bit and give those guys a chance to jump in.\"\n\nWhile Mathis is selling the card he owns now, he hasn't given up on the thought of acquiring one of the Mint 10 versions one day.\n\n\"It's not within my grasp at the moment,\" he said. \"It's something to work for.\"",

His motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club on Saturday morning as hundreds of thousands of people were preparing for marches after the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe president has ordered the Justice Department to ban bump stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons.\n\nDozens of protesters are rallying outside the U.S. Embassy in London in solidarity with the \"March for Our Lives\" protest against gun violence.\n\nStudents, families with children and other protesters raised placards reading \"Protect kids not guns,\" ''Never again,\" and \"Enough is enough\" Saturday outside the new embassy building in south London.\n\nAmnesty International U.K.'s director Kate Allen referred to the 1996 school killings at Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, in which 16 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nShe said: \"After our own school shooting at Dunblane, new gun ownership laws were introduced in Britain and that's exactly what's needed in the United States, where gun deaths are a national tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of marches are planned in U.S. cities and dozens of locations abroad.\n\nWith thousands of demonstrators gathering in Washington, organizers of the March for Our Lives rally say the country has reached a historic emotional tipping point on gun violence.\n\nThey predict a half-million demonstrators Saturday near the U.S. Capitol building for a several-hour rally. That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

                "body": "CAIRO (AP) -- Egyptian authorities arrested a British journalist and expelled her from the country after threatening her with a military trial, The Times said on Saturday. The move comes amid a heavy crackdown on media ahead of this month's presidential elections.\n\nBel Trew, who has been in Egypt for seven years, had been detained and faced \"sufficiently outlandish\" threats to suggest a misunderstanding over reporting she carried out in the central Cairo district of Shoubra, The Times (of London) said. She was expelled in late February. The British daily has been since attempting to bring about Trew's safe return to Cairo to cover the elections but to no avail.\n\n\"It is now clear that the authorities have no intention of allowing her to return,\" The Times said in a statement. Egyptian authorities were not immediately available for comment.\n\nTrew said in an account on the Times' website that she has been listed as a persona non-grata and that Cairo authorities threatened to re-arrest her if she attempts to return.\n\nShe said her reporting in Shoubra was part of a story on a migrant boat that disappeared two years ago. An informer seems to have reported her to the police, she added. She was stopped shortly after she left a cafe where she was conducting an interview.\n\n\"The taxi had just pulled away from the caf?... when a minibus of plain-clothes police officers cut us off. Five men jumped out and took me to a nearby police station,\" she said, adding that she provided the authorities with the audio recording of the interview. \"It was either ignored and not listened to -- or listened to and ignored,\" she said.\n\nEgypt has often detained, jailed and prosecuted journalists under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the military's 2013 overthrow of elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, after mass protests against his one-year divisive rule.\n\nAdvocacy group Reporters Without Borders ranked Egypt as 161 out of 180 countries on their 2017 World Press Freedom Index.\n\nThe New York-based Committee to Protect Journalist ranked Egypt among the top worst jailers of journalists in a December report. It says some 20 reporters remain detained, more than half of whom are in poor health.\n\nSome 500 websites have been blocked since last year including many run by rights groups, sites critical of the government and the VPN services that help users bypass the blocks.\n\nPro-el-Sissi businessmen have also expanded their reach into an already cowed private media, according to Reporters Without Borders. The group says security forces maintain a list of \"wanted\" journalists they have sometimes even forcibly disappeared, and are especially keen to crack down on individuals who sell video content to opposition media abroad.\n\nEarly March saw some of the harshest official rhetoric to date taking aim at the press. The country's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, described the media as \"forces of evil\" -- one of el-Sissi's hallmark phrases -- saying they have been trying to \"undermine the security and safety of the nation through the broadcast and publication of lies and false news.\" El-Sissi himself described any defamation of the country's security forces as \"high treason.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, a bill was proposed in parliament criminalizing any statements authorities define as insults toward the armed forces or police, with penalties of at least three-year jail terms and fines upward of 10,000 Egyptian pounds (or $567).\n\nEgyptian authorities have also published a list of telephone numbers for citizens to alert reports they view as undermining security or spreading false news.",

                "title": "C ya! Mets' David Wright is baseball's lone captain in 2018",
                "body": "MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Anthony Rizzo is a three-time All-Star and the 2017 winner of the Roberto Clemente Award, baseball's biggest honor for sportsmanship and community involvement. Jon Lester is a three-time World Series champion, and Jason Heyward organized the most important meeting in franchise history.\n\nPlenty of leaders with the Chicago Cubs. No captain.\n\nOne of the most revered titles in sports is hanging by a thread in baseball, which treats its history with hallowed tones in almost every case, but doesn't seem the slightest bit concerned about the absence of the iconic C on the front of its uniforms. New York Mets third baseman David Wright is the majors' only captain on the eve of the season, and it's unclear if he will ever play again.\n\n\"Leadership is a taken role and people want to follow you just based on how you are, how you treat them, how well you listen, how well you interact daily, how much you really are into them as opposed to yourself,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, \"and that becomes obvious. Leadership is taken, man. It's hard to just place that out there.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old Wright was named the fourth captain in Mets history in 2013, joining Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter and John Franco. He made the last of his seven NL All-Star teams that same year before he was hampered by a series of injuries. He hasn't appeared in a major league game since 2016.\n\nWright declared right away that he wouldn't wear the C on the front of his jersey, so that special touch has been missing from baseball for a couple years.\n\n\"I'm not sure if there's a benefit to having a title and I've never been one to like come in here and say you have to listen to me because I'm the captain,\" Wright said. \"I would hope that if I have something to say that somebody would listen to me because of, you know, because of what I've hopefully displayed in the clubhouse and be considered kind of a leader in here.\"\n\nBut Wright made no attempt to hide the significance of the title to him.\n\n\"I'll say it again, that to this day it's probably the biggest honor away from the field of my career,\" he said.\n\nA variety of factors have contributed to the decline of captains. Many of the captains across sports spend most of their careers with a single team, but that has become a rarity in baseball. There also are no real responsibilities for the title.\n\nHockey captains serve as the team's liaison to the officials. NFL captains participate in the pregame coin toss. NBA captains also have specific responsibilities, but baseball barely mentions the word in its rulebook.\n\n\"There's no, like, formal meeting,\" Washington ace Max Scherzer said. \"It's not like football where you go out there and shake the other team's hands and you need captains to go do that. Baseball doesn't have that. So maybe that's why you don't see it. There's no coin toss.\"\n\nBut the list of baseball captains still includes some of the biggest names in the history of the sport. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Thurman Munson and Derek Jeter are on the list of 11 Yankees captains. Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider with the Dodgers. Jimmie Foxx and Carl Yastrzemski for the Boston Red Sox. Willie Stargell, Barry Larkin and other Hall of Famers.\n\nJeter thought he did something wrong when then-Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called to make him captain in 2003.\n\n\"The boss, Mr. Steinbrenner usually only called if you were in trouble during the season,\" Jeter said. \"He called me, we were in Cincinnati, and said he wanted to name me the captain. It was a welcome phone call.\"\n\nThe list of baseball captains underscores not only the special players to hold the title, but also the unique situations that led to their leadership position.\n\nRizzo, Lester and Heyward, who got the Cubs together during a key moment in Game 7 of their World Series win in 2016, could each serve as captain. But identifying one leader in Chicago's clubhouse at the possible expense of its other respected veterans likely would hurt the team more than help it. There are similar situations in several other clubhouses across the sport.\n\n\"Having a team captain could conceivably in some ways change the relationship between the manager and the coaches and the rest of the team,\" Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said.\n\n\"So, again, it's all about the people. It's not that it's a good idea or a bad idea, it's all about the people. It's not just the guy you're considering for that position but also everybody around him, your own players, the manager, the coaching staff. You really have to think of it in those terms.\"\n\nAP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick and AP Sports Writer Steven Wine contributed to this report.",

                "title": "No laughing matter: When exactly did clowns become scary?",
                "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- His nose was round and bright red, his face as white as a sheet. His mouth was surrounded by an exaggerated smear of red makeup and his arched eyebrows hung ridiculously high on his forehead.\n\nSuch was the daily uniform of Bozo the Clown, who entertained kids for decades when TV was in its infancy. It's also a uniform that for many now seems grotesque and sinister.\n\nThe death of longtime Bozo performer Frank Avruch this week triggered both feelings - warm memories from some and a shiver of fear from others who associate clowns more with the film \"It.\"\n\nWhich begs the question: When exactly did clowns go from birthday-party goofy to downright sinister? Well, hold onto your really big shoes - experts are divided.\n\nDavid Carlyon, author, playwright and a former clown with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in the 1970s, argues that the fear of clowns - known officially as coulrophobia - is a relatively new phenomenon, born from the counter-culture 1960s and emerging as a popular force in the 1980s.\n\n\"There is no ancient fear of clowns,\" he said. \"It wasn't like there was this panic rippling through Madison Square Garden as I walked up through the seats. Not at all.\"\n\nCarlyon said clowns were considered sweet and funny for two centuries until an inevitable backlash that included Stephen King's hit novel \"It,\" the film \"Poltergeist,\" Heath Ledger's white-faced maniac Joker, the misanthrope Krusty the Clown from \"The Simpsons,\" the shock band Insane Clown Posse and Homey D. Clown from \"In Living Color.\"\n\n\"Anything that gets that much glorification and is sentimentalized within an inch of its life invites someone to snark at it,\" said Carlyon, who recently discovered the cover of a National Lampoon from 1979 with a girl cowering in fear of a malevolent clown.\n\n\"There's nothing in any available evidence that kids were afraid of clowns in the '40s, the '50s, the '60s, the '70s,\" he said. \"Who said that about Red Skelton?\"\n\nNot so fast, argues Benjamin Radford, an author and editor at Skeptical Inquirer magazine who literally wrote the book on the subject, 2016's \"Bad Clowns.\" Not to throw a pie in anyone's face, but he argues that evil clowns have always been among us.\n\n\"It's a mistake to ask when clowns turned bad because historically they were never really good. They've always had this deeply ambiguous character,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes they're good; sometimes they're bad. Sometimes they're making you laugh. Other times, they're laughing at your expense.\"\n\nRadford traces bad clowns all the way to ancient Greece and connects them to court jesters and the Harlequin figure. He notes that Punch, an evil puppet who frequently smacks his partner Judy with a stick, made his first appearance in London in the 1500s. \"You have this mass-murdering, baby-killing clown that's beloved by Britons everywhere of all ages,\" he said.\n\nClowns in America had their roots in circuses and they were at first meant to amuse adults, but clowning history took a detour in the 1950s and '60s when the squeaky-clean Bozo and Ronald McDonald became the \"quintessentially American default clowns\" for kids, Radford said.\n\nThe more sinister clown waited patiently for his day to shine. \"Stephen King didn't invent the evil clown. That was long before his time. But what he did was turn the coin over, if you will,\" Radford said.\n\nEven if there's debate on the issue, Radford paid homage to Avruch, the first nationally syndicated incarnation of the iconic Bozo. Without virtuous clowns like him to lay the foundation, the bad ones make no sense.\n\n\"The fact is that we need both bad and good clowns because without the good clowns like Bozo, there's no contrast, there's no tension to make the evil or scary clowns entertaining or interesting,\" Radford said.",

(AP) -- A Rockford man is the oldest ice luge racer in the world at age 80, and he's setting records for the most consecutive years competing in the event too.\n\nThis year marks Dick Genovese's 48th year in a row competing in the U.S. Masters luge competition, a race for competitors 30 years and older, the Rockford Register Star reported. He competed in Park City, Utah, against men 40 and 50 years his junior.\n\n\"They are going to put it in the Guinness Book of World Records,\" Genovese said. \"I am the oldest competitor and the longest continuous. I didn't start out to do it. I just like to do it.\"\n\nGenovese's wife said, \"it keeps him young.\"\n\nGenovese first picked up the luge after watching the 1968 Winter Olympics. At the time, there were only 50 luge pilots in the world and not a single luge track in the United States.\n\nHe wrote letters and was invited to the U.S. luge tryouts in Sweden, where he spent two and a half months practicing by the \"crash and error method.\"\n\nGenovese never qualified for an Olympic team. He just nearly missed making the team in 1972 and 1980. He retired from Olympic-type luge competition in 1985 after racing on the U.S. national team for 16 years. But he has continued with his Masters competitions once a year, and he's showing no signs of stopping.\n\n\"I haven't thought about when I was going to quit,\" Genovese said. \"You never know, all of a sudden your hip or shoulder or something hurts so much you can't do something, but right now I'm perfectly fine.

                "title": "Why Trump's latest steps heighten risk of a global trade war",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Ronald Reagan once likened trade wars to the pie fights in old Hollywood comedies. One pie in the face leads to another. And then another.\n\nPretty soon, Reagan said in a 1986 radio address, \"everything and everybody just gets messier and messier. The difference here is that it's not funny. It's tragic. Protectionism becomes destructionism. It costs jobs.\"\n\nSuddenly, the world's financial markets are gripped by fear that an escalating trade rift between the United States and China - the two mightiest economies - could smear the world with a lot of splattered cream and broken crust. If it doesn't prove tragic, as Reagan warned, it may still inflict far-reaching pain.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average lost a combined nearly 1,150 points Thursday and Friday after President Donald Trump set his administration on a path to restrict Chinese investment in the United States and impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese products.\n\n\"We should be very worried,\" said Bryan Riley, director of the conservative National Taxpayer Union's Free Trade Initiative. \"It's very possible this could escalate into something that neither country intends.\"\n\nThe trade sanctions that Trump unveiled Thursday are meant to punish Beijing for pilfering technology from American companies or for forcing them to hand over technology in exchange for access to China's market. The announcement followed a seven-month investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative into the tactics China has deployed to try to overtake American technological supremacy.\n\n\"China has not been playing by the rules,\" said Stephen Ezell, director of global innovation policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation think tank.\n\nUnbowed, China immediately threatened to retaliate if the United States followed through on its actions.\n\nOn Friday, Beijing unveiled a broad list of U.S. products - from apples and wine to pork to steel pipe - that could face retaliatory Chinese tariffs in a separate trade spat with Washington. That dispute is over taxes that Trump imposed this month on imported steel and aluminum.\n\n\"We don't want a trade war, but we are not afraid of it,\" said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe stakes are even higher in the standoff over Beijing's technology policies than in the old-school dispute over metals. An industrial nation's ability to harness technology is increasingly vital to healthy economic expansion.\n\n\"If China dominates the industries of the future, it will be very difficult for the United States to have an economic future,\" Peter Navarro, a key White House trade adviser, told reporters.\n\nTrade tensions are rising at a delicate time. The world economy has finally emerged from the shadow of the Great Recession. Major regions are growing in tandem for the first time in a decade. International economic growth is expected to reach a seven-year high of 3.9 percent this year. Last year, global trade expanded 4.2 percent, the most since 2011.\n\nSome trade experts fear that a conflict over technology will erupt into an escalating war of sanctions between the world's two biggest economies - Reagan's destructive pie fight.\n\nThe U.S.-China tensions remind economists and trade analysts of the Reagan-era skirmishes between the United States and Japan, which at the time appeared to pose a grave threat to U.S. economic dominance.\n\n\"This is 'Back to the Future' - that old '80s film,\" said Rod Hunter, a former White House trade adviser. Indeed, Trump's top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, is a veteran of the trade battles with Tokyo, having served in the Reagan administration.\n\nTo target China, Trump and Lighthizer dusted off a Cold War weapon from the Reagan years: Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which lets the president unilaterally impose tariffs. The provision was meant for a world in which much of global commerce wasn't covered by trade agreements. But with the arrival in 1995 of the World Trade Organization, Section 301 fell largely into disuse.\n\nIn some ways, a hard-nosed approach succeeded against Japan three decades ago. Under U.S. pressure, Tokyo agreed to \"voluntary export restraints\" to limit auto shipments to the United States. But to bypass the limits, Japanese automakers simply built plants in the American South.\n\nLikewise, the Reagan administration in 1985 strong-armed Japan, Germany, France and Britain to raise their currencies' values to help U.S. manufacturers squeezed by a strong dollar, which makes U.S. goods costlier overseas.\n\nBut the United States wielded unusual leverage with Japan. The two countries are close political allies; Japan depends on U.S. military protection. China, by contrast, is a geopolitical rival, far less likely to bend to U.S. pressure.\n\nIt's true that China has benefited enormously from access to the American market and has much to lose: Last year, it exported $375 billion more in goods to the United States than it bought in return - a record trade gap that irritates Trump.\n\nBut a full-blown trade war would test Trump's fortitude for commercial combat and would certainly hurt many Americans, including some of Trump's supporters. Most directly, U.S. tariffs would raise costs for consumers and businesses.\n\nTrade groups are already lobbying the Trump administration to seek diplomatic solutions to the disputes. China's all-powerful leaders face no such public pressure.\n\n\"We live in a society where stakeholders in Congress are going to put a lot of pressure on the administration,\" said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"In China, they don't.\"\n\nStill, the 301 sanctions might be enough to prod the Chinese to return to the negotiating table to consider softening their aggressive technology policies.\n\n\"If this gets the two countries back to the table to talk about this, then that is a good outcome,\" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. \"If the idea is to inflict sufficient pain so that China feels it has no choice but to change its policies, then I'm skeptical.\"",

                "title": "Planned Russian statue starts mini-Cold War in American city",
                "body": "ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. (AP) -- Back in World War II when the U.S. and Russia were allied against the Nazis, hundreds of Soviet aviators were trained on the North Carolina coast as part of a secret spy project - but now, an effort to honor their mission has triggered a miniature Cold War in a small American city.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense wants to place a 25-ton bronze monument in Elizabeth City, where the recently declassified \"Project Zebra\" was carried out. Russia would pay for the 13-foot tall monument, with the city footing the bill for improvements to the as-yet undeveloped park on the Pasquotank River where it would be located.\n\nBut amid today's international tensions and fears about Russian hacking of U.S. elections, Elizabeth City elected officials have rejected a memorandum of understanding that was to be the next step.\n\n\"We are living in troubled times, and people are very concerned about a lot of things,\" council member Anita Hummer said at the meeting where the council voted 5-3 to reject the memorandum. \"And I realize that it's about honoring fallen heroes from World War II, and we have Americans who fought in World War II who are buried in Russia. But times were different then.\"\n\nOne council member warned the monument could be a Trojan horse. Johnnie Walton worries the Russians could put something in it that could be triggered remotely to disrupt the internet or electrical grid.\n\n\"Russia is known for hacking now. They're experts at hacking, and then we've got the largest Coast Guard base (that) can't help anybody because our computers have gone down, because Russia controls our mouse,\" Walton said at a committee meeting, according to The Daily Advance of Elizabeth City.\n\nA Russian-American joint commission on POWs and MIAs wanted the monument in Elizabeth City because of a top-secret WWII operation at U.S. Coast Guard station there. Declassified just a few years ago, Project Zebra helped train about 300 Soviet aviators. Their mission was to find German submarines and bomb them.\n\nOne night in 1945, three Russians, a Ukrainian and a Canadian were killed when a seaplane bound for Russia crashed in the Pasquotank River. Their sacrifice was never publicly recognized and the crash was forgotten for decades.\n\nAfter Project Zebra was declassified in 2013, efforts slowly developed to honor it with a monument, which would include three figures - one each of Soviet, U.S. and United Kingdom aviators.\n\nThe previous city council unanimously approved the statue in May 2017. So supporters were caught off-guard by when the new council backtracked and voted nyet in February - especially because three of the negative votes came from incumbents who had supported it earlier.\n\nLocated in northeastern North Carolina near the Virginia border, Elizabeth City was founded in 1793 and has a population of about 18,000. Locals describe the area as progressive in some ways but also fiscally conservative.\n\nIn 2013, the local Republican Party challenged an African-American college student's candidacy for city council. Eventually, the State Board of Election interceded, and the student ran for office and won.\n\nAnd for what may be the first time, the council's majority is African-American and so is the mayor.\n\nPublic discussion has played out along mostly racial lines; four of the five council members who oppose the monument are black, and two of three who support it are white. At one meeting, council member Darius Horton asked the city manager if Elizabeth City has any monuments to minorities or women.\n\nInformation about the monument didn't filter to the African-American community as well as it did to the white community, said Hezekiah Brown, one of two citizens who spoke against it. Not that he's convinced that more information would matter.\n\n\"We're at war with Russia still. We're in a cyberwar here,\" Brown said. \"They interfered in our election. And they've not said they won't do it again. ... The war has to end. Then you do something. You don't do it while you're at war.\"\n\nBut elected officials also are hearing from citizens such as Rick Boyd, who turned in a petition with 569 local signatures supporting the project. He said another 200 people have signed an online petition. The monument offers the two rival nations a chance \"to show that we worked together in the past, and that we can work together in the future,\" he told the council.\n\nMayor Bettie Parker suggested the vote might have turned out differently if it had happened earlier. \"I keep hearing now is not the time to deal with anything that's coming from Russia,\" said Parker, who only votes in a tie.\n\nCouncil member Billy Caudle, who supports the monument, says people who are concerned about the appearance of an alliance with Russia are \"confusing current events with history.\"\n\nRetired U.S. Air Force Gen. Robert Foglesong, chairman of the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, has asked the city council to reconsider its vote. But for now, the council majority seems steadfast.\n\nMembers complained at their most recent meeting that the monument debate has divided Elizabeth City and they need to concentrate on more important issues. Walton said he was sick of discussing the monument and recommended that it be erected in Russia.\n\n\"Those people's relatives live in Russia,\" he said. \"Give them the opportunity to ride by on a Sunday, say a prayer, do all the things that people do when you're memorializing somebody.\"",

                "title": "French hero officer who swapped himself for hostage dies",
                "body": "TREBES, France (AP) -- A French police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage has died, raising the death toll in the attack in southern France to four. He was honored Saturday as a national hero of \"exceptional courage and selflessness.\"\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was among the first officers to respond to the attack Friday on the supermarket in the southern French town of Trebes.\n\nBeltrame, who joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had organized a training session in the Aude region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to the Depeche du Midi newspaper.\n\n\"We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,\" he said then.\n\nBut when he went inside the supermarket, he gave up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morocco-born hostage-taker, he left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.\n\nIn addition to the four people killed by the gunman in his rampage Friday, the attacker was killed by police. Fifteen others were injured.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" President Emmanuel Macron said. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nFrench police and soldiers have been a prime target of attacks by extremists, with 10 killed in recent years, including Beltrame. Other victims include three soldiers killed near Toulouse in 2012, three police officers shot to death in 2015, a police couple killed in their home in 2016 and a police officer killed on Paris' Champs-Elysees in 2017. Dozens of others have been wounded.\n\nAccording to Macron's statement, Beltrame also served as a member of the presidential guard and in 2012 earned one of France's highest honors, the Order of Merit. He was married with no children.\n\nCedric Beltrame told RTL radio Saturday that his brother died \"a hero.\"\n\n\"He was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing,\" Cedric Beltrame said.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio that, for her son, \"to defend the homeland\" was \"his reason to live.\"\n\n\"He would have said to me, 'I'm doing my job, Mom, nothing more,'\" she said.\n\nPeople were placing flowers in front of the Gendarmerie headquarters in the French medieval city of Carcassone to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Beltrame. Flags at all gendarmeries were ordered to fly at half-staff.\n\nMacron says investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, 25, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a car and the apartment complex in central Carcassonne where Lakdim was believed to live. Two people were detained over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, one woman close to Lakdim and a friend of his, a 17-year-old male, Paris prosecutor's office said.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, hitting one in the shoulder, said Yves Lefebvre of the SGP Police-FO police union.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking hostages. He shouted \"Allahu akbar!\" -- the Arabic phrase for God is great -- and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\nSpecial police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nGuibbert said he put his wife, sister-in-law and other shoppers in the meat locker for safety.\n\nThe manager of the supermarket, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, was in her office when she heard the shots.\n\n\"Call the gendarmes,\" she told her employees. \"There's a terrorist in the store.\"\n\nShe said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" Samia said.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Elaine Ganley. Thomas Adamson, Samuel Petrequin, Sylvie Corbet, Angela Charlton and Jerome Pugmire contributed to this report from Paris.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show dead policeman's rank was Lt. Col., not Col. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants.",

                "body": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- The speaker of Catalonia's parliament on Saturday suspended a scheduled vote to elect a jailed separatist leader as the new regional president of the restive northeastern corner of Spain.\n\nSpeaker Roger Torrent communicated his decision to the heads of the different parties moments before he announced to the chamber that there would be no vote on the candidacy of Jordi Turull, a former regional minister.\n\nTurull was one of five high-profile separatists jailed without bail Friday by a Supreme Court judge for their alleged role in a failed independence bid by Catalonia from the rest of Spain in October.\n\nJudge Pablo Llarena charged a total of 13 people with rebellion, a crime that is punishable by up to 30 years in prison.\n\nThe separatist parties used Saturday's parliamentary session to denounce what they considered the heavy hand of Spanish law.\n\n\"Yesterday the Spanish state didn't imprison five good people. It imprisoned 2 million people and spat in their faces,\" said Sergi Sabria of the Republican Left in reference to the number of voters who cast ballots for pro-independence parties in December.\n\n\"We received a very hard blow yesterday. .. But we must pick ourselves up quickly to build a future for all.\"\n\nThe leader of Citizens, a pro-Spain party which holds the most seats in the Barcelona-based house, used the moment to claim the secession movement was crushed.\n\n\"Enough is enough. The independence movement has lost. It has failed,\" Citizens leader Ines Arrimadas said. \"I only ask you that you stop thinking only about your voters, because you have generated worry, fear, indignation and shame for what is happening in Catalonia. We have warned you for years that the secession push will only end in a collective sense of frustration.\"\n\nLlarena also activated international arrest warrants for six fugitive Catalan politicians. That group included former regional president Carles Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium in October but was visiting Finland on since Thursday.\n\nPuigdemont's lawyer, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, told The Associated Press that Puigdemont has made his whereabouts known to Finnish authorities and that he will cooperate if they seek his arrest. Finnish police, for their part, confirmed that they had received Spain's extradition order.\n\nThe crackdown on the secession movement sparked protests in Catalonia on Friday night. Emergency services for the wealthy region said that 35 people were injured in clashes with police sent to control the angry crowd in central Barcelona.\n\nSpain's worst political conflict in three decades reached its climax in October when Puigdemont flouted a ban by the country's top court to stop an ad-hoc referendum on independence. His subsequent declaration of a Catalan republic received no international recognition and provoked a takeover by Spain's central powers.\n\nThe Spanish Constitution says the European Union nation is indivisible and any changes to its top law must pass through the national parliament in Madrid.\n\nPolls show Catalans are equally divided on the secession issue, with pro-secession parties maintaining a slim hold on the regional legislature in December elections.\n\nSeparatist lawmakers had the chance to elect Turull on Thursday, but the far-left wing of its bloc sunk his chances by abstaining.\n\nThe failure of Turull to be elected on a first vote started a two-month countdown to elect a new regional leader before a new election is automatically triggered.\n\nA senior member of the leading separatist party \"Together for Catalonia\" who requested anonymity because of the sensitive moment with other pro-secession parties told the AP that Turull is still their candidate and that they hope the session to elect him can be reopened at a later date.\n\nWhile that would require a judge freeing Turull to attend, Turull also faces being banned from holding public office once a period of appeals for his indictment expires in a few weeks.\n\nAritz Parra contributed to this report from Madrid.",

                "title": "Illinois fails to recoup $76 million in Medicaid overpayment",
                "body": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Gov. Bruce Rauner's administration hasn't recouped $76 million in overpayments to private Medicaid-program insurers dating back five years, two state audits found.\n\nThe reviews by Auditor General Frank Mautino, released last week, of the Department of Human Services and Department of Healthcare and Family Services also determined that they paid $71 million for Medicaid services without checking whether the clients were still eligible. And 74,649 requests for services have gone unanswered for more than the maximum 45 days, with the oldest dating to 2014.\n\nA Healthcare and Family Services spokesman said the payments are being recouped.\n\nThe findings are critical because they involve Medicaid managed care organizations, or MCOs, the private insurance-run system for low-income and disabled residents. Under the General Assembly's direction, the administration last fall moved 800,000 more Medicaid clients to purportedly cost-saving managed care. Managed care now handles 80 percent of the state's 3.4 million Medicaid cases.\n\nRauner, a former private-equity investor who has repeatedly railed against waste and mismanagement and championed a private-business approach to government, downplayed the findings.\n\n\"Clerical errors, or mistakes, get made, and they get made in business, too, I hate to break it to you,\" Rauner said at a Springfield stop last week. \"It's a few million dollars. When you find a problem, you correct it, and you constantly improve it.\"\n\nMautino determined that the state has paid 12 MCOs $22.5 billion since 2013. In one finding, Healthcare and Family Services left $65 million on the table from 2013 to 2015 by not collecting so-called medical-loss ratio refunds, or money owed the state because the MCO didn't meet the percentage of direct-care costs it promised.\n\nAnother finding determined that HFS had paid the MCOs $11 million for incentives the companies didn't earn.\n\nAnd both departments were to blame, the audits said, for a backlog of 74,649 requests for social services that hadn't been evaluated in the required 45 days. The oldest dates to 2014.\n\nA spokesman for Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJohn Hoffman, spokesman for HFS, said the state began seeking reimbursement of the medical-loss ratio payments before the audit began. He said new system programming and the time it took to ensure accurate calculations delayed seeking reimbursement.\n\n\"A full understanding of Medicaid, including its managed care operations, will show that the department has been efficiently monitoring its programs in the best interest of our members and the taxpayers,\" Hoffman said.\n\nEligibility determinations for 8,187 cases that had Medicaid services paid are about half complete, Hoffman said. And a new system begun this year automatically cuts off benefits if a client fails to respond to a notice seeking eligibility.\n\nThe backlog of people seeking services should drop precipitously now that a new eligibility system is in place and substantial training for caseworkers is completed, Hoffman said.\n\n\"Replacing an outdated system more than 40 years old to better serve our members and taxpayers can cause challenges, and we are working to reduce any inconveniences,\" Hoffman said.\n\nSign up for the AP's weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv",

                "title": "Can Facebook restore public trust after privacy scandal?",
                "body": "CHICAGO (AP) -- It's a scandal of privacy, politics and an essential ingredient of business success - public trust.\n\nFacebook is confronting a costly, embarrassing public relations debacle after revelations that Cambridge Analytica may have misused data from some 50 million users to try to influence elections. Among its marquee clients: President Donald Trump's general election campaign.\n\nNow a company known as much for reminders of a long-lost friend's birthday and documentation of acquaintances' every whim is grappling with outrage- and the possible loss of confidence - from users around the globe that have made the social media site a part of their daily routine.\n\n\"I trust somebody until they give me a reason not to trust them,\" said Joseph Holt, who teaches business ethics at the University of Notre Dame. \"And Facebook has increasingly given me reasons not to trust them.\"\n\nLosing that would be a disaster, not just for Facebook, but for any Silicon Valley company that relies on users to open up their private lives.\n\nThe amount of trust placed in technology has soared. Cars sync with cell phones. Refrigerators know when there's no more milk and reorder it. Virtual assistants field answers to nearly any inane question.\n\nAnd with each turn of the steering wheel, sip of milk or request for dinner reservations, a trail of digital crumbs is left for companies to collect, analyze and profit off.\n\nThe public has largely been willing to accept the trade-off, knowing in exchange for giving up some data, Netflix will offer spot-on show suggestions, Amazon will prompt a diaper order and Google will figure out what to search before a user finishes typing it.\n\nNot everyone understands the darker side of data brokers in an always-connected society.\n\nEvery time a person shops online or at a store, loyalty cards linked to phone numbers or email addresses can be linked to other databases that may have location data, home addresses and more. Voting records, job history, credit scores (remember the Equifax hack?) are constantly mixed, matched and traded by companies in ways regulators haven't caught up with.\n\nWhile Facebook let slip data profiles on millions of people, \"it's much more than that,\" says James Grimmelmann, a professor at Cornell Law School. \"Trying to pin down any one breach as being the source of all the privacy harms out there is futile.\"\n\nFor Facebook, whose power and value are built on being so ever-present in people's lives, the impact has been immediate - its share price is down nearly 14 percent since the scandal broke March 16.\n\nInvestors fear that Facebook users will start to think twice before posting the latest snapshots of their puppy, or clicking \"like\" on a news story or movie trailer.\n\n\"It's something that's going to remain in people's memory,\" says Mike Chapple, a University of Notre Dame professor with expertise in cybersecurity. \"I think it's changed people's perceptions.\"\n\nAfter the scandal broke, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized, admitted his company's mistakes and said security needs to be enhanced to protect users' data. He noted that this is a major trust issue for the public.\n\nIt follows closely on the heels of the company acknowledging it helped spread fake news and propaganda from Russian-linked trolls disrupting the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhile some disenchanted Facebook users have deactivated their accounts, others point out that breaking up can be hard to do. If a credit card company or an airline's data is breached, it's easy enough to switch allegiances. But for most of Facebook's 2 billion users there's no real substitute, says Aaron Gordon, a partner at Schwartz Media Strategies, a Miami-based public relations and crisis management firm.\n\n\"It's a lot harder to just up and leave,\" he says. \"So you go to Twitter or Instagram? It's not the same.\"\n\n(Besides, Instagram is owned by Facebook.)\n\nHolt, the business ethics professor, loved Facebook, but with all that's come out, he feels like he's in an abusive relationship. He estimates he cut his usage from about 30 minutes daily to about 10 minutes every other day and would happily flee altogether if a viable alternative emerged that more zealously protected data.\n\n\"I haven't left it yet, but I go less often and I feel less good about it,\" he says.\n\nFacebook is not the only company to deal with misuse of private information that has weakened public confidence. Equifax, the credit reporting agency, and Target, the retail giant, both suffered massive data breaches affecting tens of millions of people. Wells Fargo faced stiff government fines for a fake accounts scandal.\n\nThe public tends to get numb to this steady drumbeat of bad news, says brand strategist Rachel Brand.\n\n\"People pick their battles and daily outrage,\" she says. \"Facebook messed up royally, but most people are on a daily outrage roller-coaster and aren't sure if this is the hill worth dying on.\"\n\nMatt Sedensky reported from New York.

Several placards with photos of German Chancellor Angela Merkel were crossed out.\n\n\"They say we are backward because we believe in God,\" said Gordana Turic, a former ruling party lawmaker. \"The Istanbul convention is against the Christianity.\"\n\nSeveral smaller counter-protests were set up along the route of the march, including one with a siren that tried to dampen the speeches by the conservatives on the main square.

(AP) -- President Donald Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under \"limited circumstances,\" following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.\n\nThe White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\" -- those who may require substantial medical treatment -- \"presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nTrump surprised the Pentagon's leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\n\n\"This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards -- including those regarding the use of medical drugs -- equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.\n\nThe new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, \"No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.\"\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing \"anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.\"\n\n\"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" said HRC President Chad Griffin.\n\nJoshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy \"effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.\"\n\nTrump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.\n\nEarlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a statement late Friday that it would defend the Pentagon's authority to \"implement personnel policies they have determined are necessary to best defend our nation\" and would ask the courts to lift all related preliminary injunctions.\n\nThe issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.\n\nUnder guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.\n\nTransgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.\n\nThe requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror conditions laid out by President Barack Obama's administration in 2016, when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military.\n\n__\n\nFollow Thomas on Twitter at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC",

                "title": "No laughing matter: When exactly did clowns become scary?",
                "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- His nose was round and bright red, his face as white as a sheet. His mouth was surrounded by an exaggerated smear of red makeup and his arched eyebrows hung ridiculously high on his forehead.\n\nSuch was the daily uniform of Bozo the Clown, who entertained kids for decades when TV was in its infancy. It's also a uniform that for many now seems grotesque and sinister.\n\nThe death of longtime Bozo performer Frank Avruch this week triggered both feelings - warm memories from some and a shiver of fear from others who associate clowns more with the film \"It.\"\n\nWhich begs the question: When exactly did clowns go from birthday-party goofy to downright sinister? Well, hold onto your really big shoes - experts are divided.\n\nDavid Carlyon, author, playwright and a former clown with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in the 1970s, argues that the fear of clowns - known officially as coulrophobia - is a relatively new phenomenon, born from the counter-culture 1960s and emerging as a popular force in the 1980s.\n\n\"There is no ancient fear of clowns,\" he said. \"It wasn't like there was this panic rippling through Madison Square Garden as I walked up through the seats. Not at all.\"\n\nCarlyon said clowns were considered sweet and funny for two centuries until an inevitable backlash that included Stephen King's hit novel \"It,\" the film \"Poltergeist,\" Heath Ledger's white-faced maniac Joker, the misanthrope Krusty the Clown from \"The Simpsons,\" the shock band Insane Clown Posse and Homey D. Clown from \"In Living Color.\"\n\n\"Anything that gets that much glorification and is sentimentalized within an inch of its life invites someone to snark at it,\" said Carlyon, who recently discovered the cover of a National Lampoon from 1979 with a girl cowering in fear of a malevolent clown.\n\n\"There's nothing in any available evidence that kids were afraid of clowns in the '40s, the '50s, the '60s, the '70s,\" he said. \"Who said that about Red Skelton?\"\n\nNot so fast, argues Benjamin Radford, an author and editor at Skeptical Inquirer magazine who literally wrote the book on the subject, 2016's \"Bad Clowns.\" Not to throw a pie in anyone's face, but he argues that evil clowns have always been among us.\n\n\"It's a mistake to ask when clowns turned bad because historically they were never really good. They've always had this deeply ambiguous character,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes they're good; sometimes they're bad. Sometimes they're making you laugh. Other times, they're laughing at your expense.\"\n\nRadford traces bad clowns all the way to ancient Greece and connects them to court jesters and the Harlequin figure. He notes that Punch, an evil puppet who frequently smacks his partner Judy with a stick, made his first appearance in London in the 1500s. \"You have this mass-murdering, baby-killing clown that's beloved by Britons everywhere of all ages,\" he said.\n\nClowns in America had their roots in circuses and they were at first meant to amuse adults, but clowning history took a detour in the 1950s and '60s when the squeaky-clean Bozo and Ronald McDonald became the \"quintessentially American default clowns\" for kids, Radford said.\n\nThe more sinister clown waited patiently for his day to shine. \"Stephen King didn't invent the evil clown. That was long before his time. But what he did was turn the coin over, if you will,\" Radford said.\n\nEven if there's debate on the issue, Radford paid homage to Avruch, the first nationally syndicated incarnation of the iconic Bozo. Without virtuous clowns like him to lay the foundation, the bad ones make no sense.\n\n\"The fact is that we need both bad and good clowns because without the good clowns like Bozo, there's no contrast, there's no tension to make the evil or scary clowns entertaining or interesting,\" Radford said.",

That would match last year's women's march and make it one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam War era.\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 69 percent of respondents and half of Republicans now favor stronger gun control laws.\n\nActivists are looking to channel the energy of this youth-led initiative into the midterm congressional elections this fall with elements like on-site voter registration booths.",

A prisoner exchange will take place between the group and the government, the group added.\n\nOn Feb. 18, a concerted military offensive, backed by Russian airstrikes, squeezed the rebels and civilians in the area under an intense bombing campaign and tightened the siege. The U.N. estimated that nearly 400,000 people remained in the enclave before the latest offensive began.\n\nThe government assault triggered a mass movement of people trying to escape the violence in the Damascus suburbs. Some have moved deeper into the rebel-held enclave, while 105,000 others have crossed the front lines toward government-controlled areas or left to rebel-held parts in northern Syria, according to state news agency SANA.\n\nThe government's crushing offensive killed nearly 1,500 people and wounded more than 5,000, according to opposition activists.\n\nAfter the departure of Faylaq al-Rahman fighters, the only rebel-held pocket in eastern Ghouta will be the town of Douma that is controlled by the powerful Army of Islam group.\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds more left Douma to government controlled area including 700 pro-government supporters that the rebel group had been holding for years, according to SCMM.\n\nIn the rebel-held northwestern city of Idlib, a car bomb exploded near a court building killing at least six people and wounding 25, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the opposition's Syrian Civil Defense.\n\nThe French Presidency said in a statement Saturday that President Emmanuel Macron had a phone call with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan the day before in which the French leader said he \"had very clearly expressed\" his concerns as soon as the Turkish military operation in the Kurdish Syrian enclave of Afrin started.\n\n\"Nothing must lead to weakening the pressure\" on what is left of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, Macron said.\n\nTurkey launched an operation in Afrin to clear it of Syrian Kurdish militia, which Turkey considers to be a security threat, on Jan. 20. It captured the town of Afrin in a major phase of the offensive on Sunday.\n\nMacron agreed with Erdogan to pursue \"deep and intense\" discussions in coming days about Syria.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report from Paris.",

                "title": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump on trade, Islamic State, vets, Clinton",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump isn't always bringing genuine statistics to the fight as he goes after China on trade.\n\nTrump stretched credulity on a variety of subjects over the past week, trade among them. He mangled comments from 2016 presidential rival Hillary Clinton, inflated expectations of an overhaul in health services for veterans and gave his administration too much credit for defeating the Islamic State. Here's a look at some of his recent statements.\n\nTRUMP: \"Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China. We can't let that happen.\" -- comments at the White House on Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That didn't happen. Last year, Americans bought about $506 billion in goods from China. That's not \"lost\" money but purchases of products that Americans wanted. And it's only part of the equation. China bought more than $130 billion in goods from the U.S. So the actual trade deficit in goods was $375 billion.\n\nFactor in trade in services and the actual U.S trade deficit with China was $337 billion.\n\nTRUMP: \"On terrorism, in Iraq and Syria, we've taken back almost 100 percent, in a very short period of time, of the land that they took. And it all took place since our election. We've taken back close to 100 percent.\" -- National Republican Congressional Committee dinner Tuesday. Comments Friday: \"We've gotten just about 100 percent of our land back from ISIS.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: It's not true that progress against the Islamic State group \"all took place\" since the election. The Obama administration said IS had lost more than 40 percent of its territory by the time the last president left office.\n\nIS was pushed to the point of collapse in Mosul, its main Iraqi stronghold, before Trump took office. In 2016, Iraqi military forces, supported by the U.S.-led coalition, waged successful battles to oust IS from Fallujah, Ramadi, eastern Mosul and a number of smaller towns along the Tigris River. They also established logistical hubs for the push that began in February 2017 to retake western Mosul.\n\nIt's true that advances since then have decimated IS as a territorial force. Those advances came on many fronts from multiple foes of the Islamic State, including U.S.-backed Iraqi forces and fighters of Syrian President Bashar Assad, supported by Russia. The assertion that \"we've taken back close to 100 percent\" is only supportable if \"we\" means the various groups, often hostile to one another, that have been battling IS.\n\nTRUMP, on Clinton: \"I would say her last statement about women -- they have to get approval from their husbands, their sons, and their male bosses to vote for Trump. That was not a good statement. Not good.\" -- Republican dinner Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's not what she said. In remarks this month in India, Clinton advanced the theory that a slim majority of white women voted for Trump because of \"ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should.\" She did not say women felt they needed approval from men to vote for Trump -- but rather that they faced pressure from them to side with Trump instead of her.\n\nTRUMP: \"Republicans also repealed one of the nation's cruelest and most unfair taxes ever: the Obamacare individual mandate. And the mandate is gone forever. And that's a beauty. You pay a lot of money not to have to pay and not to get health care. So you're paying not to have health care. I mean, that wasn't so good. But we got rid of it.\" -- Republican dinner Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The mandate is not gone. Fines for going without health insurance coverage are still in effect this year. They disappear next year under the repeal law he signed.\n\nTRUMP on a marketing campaign against opioid abuse: \"That's the least expensive thing we can do, where you scare them from ending up like the people in the commercials. And we'll make them very, very bad commercials. We'll make them pretty unsavory situations.\" -- speech in New Hampshire on Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: This \"scared straight\" advertising was neither inexpensive nor particularly effective the last time it was tried and researched. There is some evidence, though, that anti-drug messages focused on teenagers' need for independence can help discourage drug use.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2004, the U.S. government spent nearly $1 billion on a national campaign to persuade young people to avoid illegal drugs, particularly marijuana. A 2008 follow-up study funded by the National Institutes of Health found the campaign \"had no favorable effects on youths' behavior\" and may actually have prompted some to experiment with drugs -- an unintended \"boomerang\" effect.\n\nTRUMP: \"Choice is coming. Choice -- where the veterans can actually, instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks, they can actually go and see a doctor and have it taken care of, and we pay. And that's going to be the big one.\" -- Republican dinner Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: A long-term plan along these lines doesn't appear to be coming any time soon. It's stalled in Congress and delays experienced in the program so far mean it won't be fully implemented until 2019 or later.\n\nA choice program was put in place after a 2014 wait-time scandal that was discovered at the Phoenix VA hospital and elsewhere throughout the country. It allows veterans to go to private doctors if they endure long waits for VA appointments. According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress' investigative arm, people using the program suffer wait times potentially as long as 81 days. Last summer, an unexpected budget shortfall in the program forced VA to limit outside referrals, leading to additional delays in medical care.\n\nVA Secretary David Shulkin said last month VA care is \"often 40 percent better in terms of wait times\" compared with the private sector.\n\nHe hoped a long-term overhaul would be approved by Congress in December, but proposals have stalled due to disagreements over cost and how much access veterans should have to private doctors.\n\nDEMOCRATIC SEN. PATTY MURRAY, questioning VA Secretary David Shulkin: \"I was really concerned to see your budget asks for a large decrease in the Office of Inspector General ... . I want to know why this budget doesn't provide the OIG with the full funding that they need.\" -- Senate hearing Wednesday on VA budget.\n\nSHULKIN: \"We are supportive of the role of the OIG as well. And in fact this budget actually does provide them the resources. ...They do have the staffing they need.\" -- Senate hearing Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Neither is entirely correct.\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed budget would provide $172 million to VA's internal watchdog office for the budget year beginning Oct. 1. That's technically an increase from the administration's $159 million budget level in 2018, but a decline from the office's actual spending of roughly $174 million due to increased demands to investigate problems at VA. The inspector general's office used leftover money from previous years to fill the gap, cash that is now largely gone.\n\nTo maintain current staffing levels, the IG's office is seeking $181 million for the next budget year, or $9 million above what the Trump administration is proposing. Without that money, it says it will have to cut the equivalent of 30 full-time staff positions, most of them directly involved with the IG's core criminal investigations, auditing and health inspections work.\n\nThe IG office, with about 850 full-time staff, is charged with keeping watch over the government's second largest department, whose 360,000 employees provide medical care and other benefits to 9 million military veterans. In recent months, the watchdog has put out blistering reports concluding that Shulkin violated ethics rules during an 11-day trip to Europe and that systemic leadership problems at VA put patients at risk. Shulkin is now being investigated over allegations that he used his security detail to run personal errands for him; he has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Perrone, Bradley Klapper and Christopher Rugaber in Washington and Carla K.

Col. Arnaud Beltrame.\n\nBeltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack in the supermarket in Trebes, and in a carjacking beforehand in a nearby town. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe brother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that he has died a hero.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nCedric Beltrame told RTL radio Saturday his brother \"gave his life for strangers.\"\n\nHe added that his brother \"was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing.\" Cedric Beltrame also stressed that his brother kept his professional reflexes. The officer managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket.\n\nCedric Beltrame said that \"if we don't describe him as a hero, I don't know what you need to do to be a hero. It's a word I think is appropriate for him in such tragic circumstances.\"\n\nThe gunman was killed when police stormed the supermarket after hearing shots.\n\nThe manager of a French supermarket attacked by an Islamic extremist gunman says she felt \"helpless\" as he fired shots in her store.\n\nThe woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, says she was in her office when she heard the shots. She came downstairs saw what was happening and called police. She said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\nShe said from inside city hall, where the local government had set up a crisis center, that \"it was terrifying.\"\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack, including a French police officer who exchanged himself for a female hostage in the Super U market and later died of his injuries. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe Paris prosecutors' office says that police have detained a 17-year-old in connection with the investigation into the Islamic extremist attack that killed four people, including a police officer, in southern France.\n\nThe unidentified young man was arrested overnight over alleged criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise. He is a friend of the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, who was killed when police stormed a supermarket in Trebes where he took hostages.\n\nParis prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday that another person, a woman close to Lakdim, was taken into custody on the same grounds. Molins didn't identify her.\n\nParis counterterrorism investigators took over the probe into the attack in Trebes and nearby Carcassonne.\n\nThe mother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that she wasn't surprised by her son's courage.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injures.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio Friday night before the announcement of his death that \"I'm not surprised. I knew it had to be him. He has always been like that. It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland.\"\n\nAsked if she was proud of him, she said he would have told her \"'I'm doing my job mom, that's all.'\"\n\nShe said to \"defend the homeland\" was his \"reason for living.\" RTL didn't give her name.\n\nFrance's top security official says a heroic officer who swapped himself for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket has died of his injuries.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nBeltrame offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raises the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition. The attack was the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.\n\nA previous version of this story has been corrected throughout to show that the dead officer's rank is Lt. Col., not Col.",

                "body": "BANGKOK (AP) -- The elephant is Thailand's national animal, so it's only natural that King Mongkut in 1861 offered to send a pair to the United States as a gift of the friendship between the two countries.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln, likely bemused and relieved at the distraction from America's then-raging Civil War, politely declined, saying his country uses the steam engine and would have no use for the working animals.\n\nAs part of the 200th anniversary celebrating the long-lasting relationship, the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok is showcasing historic gifts the two countries have exchanged on the grounds of Thailand's Grand Palace.\n\nIt includes the first-ever official letter sent in 1818 from a Thai diplomat to President James Monroe -- there are documents spanning two centuries -- as well as some spectacular Thai objects d'art and portraits.\n\nThen there's the elephants story, also documented among the exhibits.\n\nIn his 1861 letters, Mongkut offered the elephants after learning they were not native to America. He also sent along three gifts: a sword and scabbard, a photograph of the king with one of his daughters, and an impressive pair of elephant tusks.\n\nHe addressed the letters to then-President James Buchanan \"or whomever would become president\" with elaborate paragraph-long salutations.\n\nLincoln was already president by the time the letters arrived a year later. He penned a reply, addressing the king simply as \"Great and Good Friend.\"\n\nThe offer of elephants did not neglect practical details. Mongkut stated, \"On this account, we desire to procure and send elephants to be let loose to increase and multiply in the continent of America.\" But Thailand -- then called Siam -- did not have a large enough vessel to transport them, the letter said.\n\nIt continued: \"In reference to this opinion of ours if the President of the United States and Congress who conjointly with him rule the country see fit to approve, let them provide a large vessel loaded with hay and other food suitable for elephants on the voyage, with tanks holding a sufficiency of fresh water, and arranged with stalls so that the elephants can both stand and lie down in the ship -- and send it to receive them. We on our part will procure young male and female elephants and forward them one or two pairs at a time.\"\n\nMongkut then in his letter directs that the elephants should be kept away from the cold and under the sun, and to also \"let them with all haste be turned out to run wild in some jungle suitable for them not confining them any length of time.\"\n\n\"If these means can be done we trust that the elephants will propagate their species hereafter in the continent of America,\" the letter said.\n\nThai monarchy expert Tongthong Chandransu said the offer of elephants reveals that Mongkut wanted to be part of building the young United States.\n\n\"You have to consider that 200 years ago, elephants were an important means of transportation and helped a lot with our work, not to mention warfare, but also the building of homes and cities,\" Tongthong said.\n\nThe ever-practical Lincoln rejected the offer to send wild elephants running through American forests, saying the country \"does not reach a latitude so low as to favor the multiplication of the elephant.\" He said in his 1862 letter that \"steam on land, as well as on water, has been our best and most efficient agent of transportation in internal commerce.\"",

Officials said 57 were hospitalized.\n\nThat day, hundreds of people gathered outside the local hospital and surrounded local administrator Yevgeny Gavrilov, with one man in the crowd trying to punch him. Gavrilov was escorted to safety as the crowd shouted \"Killer!\"\n\nA 10-year-old girl in a pink cap became a hit on the internet when video showed her making a throat-cutting gesture at Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the region that includes Volokolamsk.\n\nVorobyov's office announced Friday that Gavrilov, the district leader, has been removed from office. Vorobyov has promised to get the landfill problem solved by mid-June, but anxiety remains high among residents.",

Pero tambi? estaba bajo vigilancia y desde 2014 fue incluido en la llamada \"Fiche S\", un registro gubernamental de individuos que presuntamente est? en v?s de radicalizaci? pero no han cometido actos de terrorismo.\n\nA pesar de esto, el fiscal de Par?, Fran?is Molins, dijo que \"no hab? se?l de advertencia\" de que Lakdim llevar? a cabo un ataque extremista.\n\nUna mujer cercana a Lakdim fue detenida por sus supuestos v?culos con una acci? terrorista, dijo el viernes Molins, quien no la identific?\n\nEl drama de cuatro horas comenz?a las 10:13 de la ma?na, cuando Lakdim rob?un carro cerca de Carcassonne, mat?a uno de los ocupantes e hiri?a otro, dijo el fiscal.\n\nLakdim despu? dispar?contra agentes que regresaban de trotar cerca de Carcassone, dijo Yves Lefebvre, secretario general del sindicato de polic?s SGP Police-FO. Los polic?s llevaban ropa deportiva con insignias de la polic?. Un agente fue baleado en un hombro, pero la herida no fue grave, se?l?Lefebvre.\n\nLakdim despu? se dirigi?al mercado Super U, en la localidad vecina de Trebes, 100 kil?etros (60 millas) al sureste de Tolosa, mat?a tiros a dos personas en el lugar y tom?un n?mero indeterminado de rehenes. Unidades especiales de la polic? acudieron al lugar mientras las autoridades cerraban las calles y ped?n a la gente alejarse del lugar.\n\nGrit?\"?Alahu Akbar! (Dios es grande)\" y afirm?que era un \"soldado del Estado Isl?ico\" cuando ingres?en el Super U, donde hab? unas 50 personas, seg?n Molins.\n\n\"Escuchamos una explosi?, bueno varias explosiones\", dijo el comprador Christian Guibbert a la prensa. \"Fui a ver qu?ocurr? y vi a un hombre tendido en el piso y a otra persona, muy agitada, que ten? una pistola en una mano y un cuchillo en la otra\".\n\nGuibbert dijo que llev?a su esposa, su cu?da y a otros clientes a la c?ara de refrigeraci?. Luego regres?para ver d?de estaba el atacante y llam?a la polic? para describir la situaci?.\n\n\"En ese momento me persigui? Me ech?a correr, por supuesto, lo perd? Tom?la salida para emergencias y vi cuando lleg?la polic?\", agreg?\n\nDurante la toma del supermercado, Lakdim exigi?la liberaci? de Salah Abdeslam, el ?nico agresor sobreviviente de los ataques del 13 de noviembre de 2015 en Par? que dejaron 130 muertos. El ministro del Interior sugiri?en cambio que la puesta en libertad del extremista no fue el motivo clave para el ataque.\n\nLakdim respond? al llamado del grupo EI a atacar a los pa?es presentes en la coalici? liderada por Estados Unidos que lucha contra la milicia radical en Siria e Irak desde 2014, explic?la agencia Aamaq, vinculada a Estado Isl?ico. Francia es un blanco habitual por su participaci? en la alianza.\n\nFrancia est?en alerta m?ima desde una ola de ataques extremistas en 2015 y 2016 que se cobraron m? de 200 vidas.\n\nLos periodistas de The Associated Press Thomas Adamson, Samuel Petrequin, Sylvie Corbet, Angela Charlton y Jerome Pugmire en Par? contribuyeron a este despacho.\n\nSe corrigi?una versi? previa de este despacho para se?lar que el rango del polic? fallecido era teniente coronel, no coronel. Un despacho previo afirm?de forma err?ea que el grupo extremista Estado Isl?ico se atribuy?la autor? del ataque. Tambi? se aclar?que el cateo en Carcassonne ocurri?el viernes en la noche.",

Col. Arnaud Beltrame.\n\nBeltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack in the supermarket in Trebes, and in a carjacking beforehand in a nearby town. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe brother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that he has died a hero.\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nCedric Beltrame told RTL radio Saturday his brother \"gave his life for strangers.\"\n\nHe added that his brother \"was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing.\" Cedric Beltrame also stressed that his brother kept his professional reflexes. The officer managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket.\n\nCedric Beltrame said that \"if we don't describe him as a hero, I don't know what you need to do to be a hero. It's a word I think is appropriate for him in such tragic circumstances.\"\n\nThe gunman was killed when police stormed the supermarket after hearing shots.\n\nThe manager of a French supermarket attacked by an Islamic extremist gunman says she felt \"helpless\" as he fired shots in her store.\n\nThe woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, says she was in her office when she heard the shots. She came downstairs saw what was happening and called police. She said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\nShe said from inside city hall, where the local government had set up a crisis center, that \"it was terrifying.\"\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack, including a French police officer who exchanged himself for a female hostage in the Super U market and later died of his injuries. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe Paris prosecutors' office says that police have detained a 17-year-old in connection with the investigation into the Islamic extremist attack that killed four people, including a police officer, in southern France.\n\nThe unidentified young man was arrested overnight over alleged criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise. He is a friend of the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, who was killed when police stormed a supermarket in Trebes where he took hostages.\n\nParis prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday that another person, a woman close to Lakdim, was taken into custody on the same grounds. Molins didn't identify her.\n\nParis counterterrorism investigators took over the probe into the attack in Trebes and nearby Carcassonne.\n\nThe mother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that she wasn't surprised by her son's courage.\n\nLt.

He has always been like that. It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland.\"\n\nAsked if she was proud of him, she said he would have told her \"'I'm doing my job mom, that's all.'\"\n\nShe said to \"defend the homeland\" was his \"reason for living.\" RTL didn't give her name.\n\nFrance's top security official says a heroic officer who swapped himself for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket has died of his injuries.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nBeltrame offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raises the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition. The attack was the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the dead officer's rank is Lt. Col., not Col.",

                "title": "French hero officer who swapped himself for hostage dies",
                "body": "TREBES, France (AP) -- A French police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage died of his injuries, raising the death toll in the attack to four, and the officer was honored Saturday as a national hero of \"exceptional courage and selflessness.\"\n\nLt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday.\n\nBeltrame, who first took his place among the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had organized a training session in the Aude region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to Depeche du Midi, the local newspaper.\n\n\"We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,\" he said then.\n\nBut when he went inside the supermarket on Friday, he had given up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morocco-born captor, he left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.\n\nHis death raises the toll to four. The gunman was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, Beltrame joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and deployed to Iraq in 2005. He served as a member of the presidential guard and in 2012 earned one of France's highest honors, the Order of Merit. He was married with no children.\n\nBeltrame's brother, Cedric Beltrame, told RTL radio Saturday his sibling died \"a hero.\"\n\nHe added that his brother \"was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing.\"\n\nPeople were placing flowers in front of the Gendarmerie headquarters in Carcassone to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Beltrame.\n\nMacron has said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a car and the apartment complex in central Carcassonne where Lakdim was believed to live.\n\nTwo people were detained over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, one woman close to Lakdim and one friend of his, a 17-year-old male, Paris prosecutor office said.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury wasn't serious, Lefebvre said.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.\n\nHe shouted \"Allahu akbar!\" -- the Arabic phrase for God is great -- and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nThe manager of the supermarket said she felt \"helpless.\" The woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, said that she was in her office when she heard the shots.\n\n\"How am I? I am devastated,\" she said \"What we went through yesterday was a tragedy. What else would you have me say? You feel utterly helpless .\"\n\nShe said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" she said.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. One of those attacks, against a kosher supermarket in Paris, seemed to foreshadow this week's deadly assault in the south.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Thomas Adamson, Samuel Petrequin, Sylvie Corbet, Angela Charlton and Jerome Pugmire contributed to this report from Paris.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show dead policeman's rank was Lt. Col., not Col. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014.",

                "body": "TREBES, France (AP) -- The Latest on the extremist attack in southern France (all times local):\n\n11:40 a.m.\n\nThe manager of a supermarket in southern France that was attacked by an extremist gunman has praised the officer who exchanged himself for a hostage as a hero who saved her co-worker's life.\n\nThe manager, who identified herself only by her first name, Samia, said that her co-worker was in a \"catastrophic state\" after the death of the officer, Col. Arnaud Beltrame.\n\nBeltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack in the supermarket in Trebes, and in a carjacking beforehand in a nearby town. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe brother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that he has died a hero.\n\nCol. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injuries.\n\nCedric Beltrame told RTL radio Saturday his brother \"gave his life for strangers.\"\n\nHe added that his brother \"was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing.\" Cedric Beltrame also stressed that his brother kept his professional reflexes. The officer managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket.\n\nCedric Beltrame said that \"if we don't describe him as a hero, I don't know what you need to do to be a hero. It's a word I think is appropriate for him in such tragic circumstances.\"\n\nThe gunman was killed when police stormed the supermarket after hearing shots.\n\nThe manager of a French supermarket attacked by an Islamic extremist gunman says she felt \"helpless\" as he fired shots in her store.\n\nThe woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, says she was in her office when she heard the shots. She came downstairs saw what was happening and called police. She said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\nShe said from inside city hall, where the local government had set up a crisis center, that \"it was terrifying.\"\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack, including a French police officer who exchanged himself for a female hostage in the Super U market and later died of his injuries. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe Paris prosecutors' office says that police have detained a 17-year-old in connection with the investigation into the Islamic extremist attack that killed four people, including a police officer, in southern France.\n\nThe unidentified young man was arrested overnight over alleged criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise. He is a friend of the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, who was killed when police stormed a supermarket in Trebes where he took hostages.\n\nParis prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday that another person, a woman close to Lakdim, was taken into custody on the same grounds. Molins didn't identify her.\n\nParis counterterrorism investigators took over the probe into the attack in Trebes and nearby Carcassonne.\n\nThe mother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that she wasn't surprised by her son's courage.\n\nCol. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injures.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio Friday night before the announcement of his death that \"I'm not surprised. I knew it had to be him. He has always been like that. It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland.\"\n\nAsked if she was proud of him, she said he would have told her \"'I'm doing my job mom, that's all.'\"\n\nShe said to \"defend the homeland\" was his \"reason for living.\" RTL didn't give her name.\n\nFrance's top security official says a heroic officer who swapped himself for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket has died of his injuries.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Col. Arnaud Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nBeltrame offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raises the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition. The attack was the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.",

                "title": "French hero officer who swapped himself for hostage dies",
                "body": "TREBES, France (AP) -- A French police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage died of his injuries, raising the death toll in the attack to four, and the officer was honored Saturday as a national hero of \"exceptional courage and selflessness.\"\n\nCol. Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday.\n\nBeltrame, who first took his place among the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had organized a training session in the Aude region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to Depeche du Midi, the local newspaper.\n\n\"We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,\" he said then.\n\nBut when he went inside the supermarket on Friday, he had given up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morocco-born captor, he left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.\n\nHis death raises the toll to four. The gunman was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,\" President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. \"In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, Beltrame joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and deployed to Iraq in 2005. He served as a member of the presidential guard and in 2012 earned one of France's highest honors, the Order of Merit. He was married with no children.\n\nBeltrame's brother, Cedric Beltrame, told RTL radio Saturday his sibling died \"a hero.\"\n\nHe added that his brother \"was well aware he had almost no chance. He was very aware of what he was doing.\"\n\nPeople were placing flowers in front of the Gendarmerie headquarters in Carcassone to pay tribute to Col. Beltrame.\n\nMacron has said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a car and the apartment complex in central Carcassonne where Lakdim was believed to live.\n\nTwo people were detained over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, one woman close to Lakdim and one friend of his, a 17-year-old male, Paris prosecutor office said.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury wasn't serious, Lefebvre said.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.\n\nHe shouted \"Allahu akbar!\" -- the Arabic phrase for God is great -- and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\n\"We heard an explosion -- well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nThe manager of the supermarket said she felt \"helpless.\" The woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, said that she was in her office when she heard the shots.\n\n\"How am I? I am devastated,\" she said \"What we went through yesterday was a tragedy. What else would you have me say? You feel utterly helpless .\"\n\nShe said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" she said.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. One of those attacks, against a kosher supermarket in Paris, seemed to foreshadow this week's deadly assault in the south.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Thomas Adamson, Samuel Petrequin, Sylvie Corbet, Angela Charlton and Jerome Pugmire contributed to this report from Paris.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014.",

                "title": "Trump order would ban most transgender troops from serving",
                "body": "PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- President Donald Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under \"limited circumstances,\" following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.\n\nThe White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\" - those who may require substantial medical treatment - \"presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nTrump surprised the Pentagon's leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\n\n\"This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards - including those regarding the use of medical drugs - equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.\n\nThe new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, \"No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.\"\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing \"anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.\"\n\n\"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" said HRC President Chad Griffin.\n\nJoshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy \"effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.\"\n\nTrump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.\n\nEarlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\nThe issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.\n\nUnder guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.\n\nTransgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.\n\nThe requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror conditions laid out by President Barack Obama's administration in 2016, when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands are gathering in Washington Saturday for a protest that organizers claim will be a defining moment in the long-simmering national debate over gun-control legislation.\n\nOrganizers of the March for Our Lives rally are hoping to draw 500,000 protesters; that would match last year's women's march and make this one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam era. It would also bolster claims that the nation is ready to enact sweeping changes to its gun control laws. More than 800 marches are planned in cities across America and dozens of locations overseas to be held at roughly the same time.\n\nWashington is generally nonchalant about protests, but Saturday's gathering has prompted more attention and speculation than usual. Washington officials say they are prepared to handle the crowds -- more prepared than they were for the women's march, which far exceeded the organizers' official predictions of 300,000.\n\nThe protesters, many of them high school students, claim that the youth leadership of this initiative is what will set it apart from previous attempts to enact stronger gun-control legislation.\n\nIn the wake of the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the students have tapped into a powerful current of pro-gun control sentiment that has been building for years. They have also partnered with well-funded liberal groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control advocacy group founded by former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg.\n\nPolls indicate that public opinion nationwide may indeed be shifting on an issue that has simmered for generations, and through dozens of mass shootings. A new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the United States should be tightened. That's up from 61 percent who said the same in October of 2016 and 55 percent when the AP first asked the question in October of 2013. Overall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun control laws.\n\nBut even with claims of historic social momentum on the issue of gun control, the AP poll also found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action. Among the questions facing march organizers and participants will be how to translate this one-day event, regardless of turnout, into meaningful legislative change.\n\nOne way is by channeling the current energy into mid-term congressional elections this fall. Students in Florida have focused on youth voter registration and there will be a registration booth at the Saturday rally.",

El agente fue honrado el s?ado como un h?oe nacional por su \"excepcional coraje y altruismo\".\n\nEl coronel Arnaud Beltrame fue uno de los primeros agentes que respondieron al asalto del viernes.\n\nBeltrame, que entr?en las fuerzas especiales de ?ite de la polic? en 2003 y estuvo desplegado en Irak en 2005, hab? organizado una sesi? de formaci? para este tipo de situaciones con rehenes en la regi? de Aude el pasado diciembre. Entonces arm?a sus agentes con pistolas de pintura, seg?n el diario local Depeche du Midi.\n\n\"Queremos estar lo m? cerca posible de las condiciones reales\", explic?entonces el polic?.\n\nPero cuando entr?al mercado el viernes tras prestarse voluntario para ocupar el sitio de una reh?, hab? entregado su arma.\n\nLo que no sab? el captor, de origen marroqu? es que hab? dejado su celular encendido para que la polic? en el exterior pudiera escuchar lo que ocurr? dentro del mercado. Las autoridades dijeron que cuando escucharon disparos en el interior decidieron ingresar. Beltrame sufri?una herida fatal.\n\nSu muerte eleva a cuatro personas el n?mero de v?timas mortales del ataque. El pistolero fue abatido por las fuerzas de seguridad y otras 15 personas resultaron heridas.\n\n\"Arnaud Beltrame muri?al servicio de una naci? a la que ya le hab? dado mucho\", dijo el presidente del pa?, Emmanuel Macron, en un comunicado. \"Al dar su vida para terminar con el plan mortal de un terrorista yihadista, cay?como un h?oe\".\n\nSeg?n el comunicado, Beltrame se uni?a las fuerzas de ?ite de la polic? en 2003 y sirvi?en Irak en 2005. Form?parte de la guardia presidencial en 2012 y obtuvo uno de los m? altos honores de Francia, la Orden del M?ito. Estaba casado y no ten? hijos.\n\nLa investigaci? se centrar?en establecer c?o el agresor, que identificado por la fiscal? como Redouane Lakdim, consigui?el arma y se radicaliz? explic?Macron.\n\nEl viernes en la noche, las autoridades catearon un edificio y un edificio en el centro de la localidad de Carcassonne, donde se cree que viv? Lakdim.\n\nLa polic? tuvo durante la noche a un joven de 17 a?s no identificado por un supuesto delito de asociaci? delictiva relaci? con el terrorismo, dijo la fiscal? de Par?. El menor es amigo del pistolero, seg?n las autoridades.\n\nLakdim ten? antecedentes penales por delitos menores y narcomenudeo. Pero tambi? estaba bajo vigilancia y desde 2014 fue incluido en la llamada \"Fiche S\", un registro gubernamental de individuos que presuntamente est? en v?s de radicalizaci? pero no han cometido actos de terrorismo.\n\nA pesar de esto, el fiscal de Par?, Fran?is Molins, dijo que \"no hab? se?l de advertencia\" de que Lakdim llevar? a cabo un ataque extremista.\n\nUna mujer cercana a Lakdim fue detenida por sus supuestos v?culos con una acci? terrorista, dijo el viernes Molins, quien no la identific?\n\nEl drama de cuatro horas comenz?a las 10:13 de la ma?na, cuando Lakdim rob?un carro cerca de Carcassonne, mat?a uno de los ocupantes e hiri?a otro, dijo el fiscal.\n\nLakdim despu? dispar?contra agentes que regresaban de trotar cerca de Carcassone, dijo Yves Lefebvre, secretario general del sindicato de polic?s SGP Police-FO. Los polic?s llevaban ropa deportiva con insignias de la polic?. Un agente fue baleado en un hombro, pero la herida no fue grave, se?l?Lefebvre.\n\nLakdim despu? se dirigi?al mercado Super U, en la localidad vecina de Trebes, 100 kil?etros (60 millas) al sureste de Tolosa, mat?a tiros a dos personas en el lugar y tom?un n?mero indeterminado de rehenes. Unidades especiales de la polic? acudieron al lugar mientras las autoridades cerraban las calles y ped?n a la gente alejarse del lugar.\n\nGrit?\"?Alahu Akbar!

Luego regres?para ver d?de estaba el atacante y llam?a la polic? para describir la situaci?.\n\n\"En ese momento me persigui? Me ech?a correr, por supuesto, lo perd? Tom?la salida para emergencias y vi cuando lleg?la polic?\", agreg?\n\nDurante la toma del supermercado, Lakdim exigi?la liberaci? de Salah Abdeslam, el ?nico agresor sobreviviente de los ataques del 13 de noviembre de 2015 en Par? que dejaron 130 muertos. El ministro del Interior sugiri?en cambio que la puesta en libertad del extremista no fue el motivo clave para el ataque.\n\nLakdim respond? al llamado del grupo EI a atacar a los pa?es presentes en la coalici? liderada por Estados Unidos que lucha contra la milicia radical en Siria e Irak desde 2014, explic?la agencia Aamaq, vinculada a Estado Isl?ico.

                "title": "Trump order would ban most transgender troops from serving",
                "body": "PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- President Donald Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under \"limited circumstances,\" following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.\n\nThe White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\" -- those who may require substantial medical treatment -- \"presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nTrump surprised the Pentagon's leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\n\n\"This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards -- including those regarding the use of medical drugs -- equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.\n\nThe new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, \"No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.\"\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing \"anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.\"\n\n\"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" said HRC President Chad Griffin.\n\nJoshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy \"effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.\"\n\nTrump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.\n\nEarlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.\n\nThe issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.\n\nUnder guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.\n\nTransgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.\n\nThe requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror conditions laid out by President Barack Obama's administration in 2016, when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military.\n\n__\n\nFollow Thomas on Twitter at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC",

                "body": "TREBES, France (AP) -- The Latest on the extremist attack in southern France (all times local):\n\n10:25 a.m.\n\nThe manager of a French supermarket attacked by an Islamic extremist gunman says she felt \"helpless\" as he fired shots in her store.\n\nThe woman, who would identify herself only by her first name, Samia, says she was in her office when she heard the shots. She came downstairs saw what was happening and called police. She said she helped evacuate as many people as possible.\n\nShe said from inside city hall, where the local government had set up a crisis center, that \"it was terrifying.\"\n\nA total of four people were killed in the attack, including a French police officer who exchanged himself for a female hostage in the Super U market and later died of his injuries. The gunman was also killed when police stormed the supermarket.\n\nThe Paris prosecutors' office says that police have detained a 17-year-old in connection with the investigation into the Islamic extremist attack that killed four people, including a police officer, in southern France.\n\nThe unidentified young man was arrested overnight over alleged criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise. He is a friend of the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, who was killed when police stormed a supermarket in Trebes where he took hostages.\n\nParis prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday that another person, a woman close to Lakdim, was taken into custody on the same grounds. Molins didn't identify her.\n\nParis counterterrorism investigators took over the probe into the attack in Trebes and nearby Carcassonne.\n\nThe mother of a French police officer who was killed after he swapped himself for a hostage during an Islamic extremist attack on a supermarket says that she wasn't surprised by her son's courage.\n\nCol. Arnaud Beltrame had offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage in the southern town of Trebes. The attacker shot him and Beltrame later died of his injures.\n\nBeltrame's mother told RTL radio Friday night before the announcement of his death that \"I'm not surprised. I knew it had to be him. He has always been like that. It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland.\"\n\nAsked if she was proud of him, she said he would have told her \"'I'm doing my job mom, that's all.'\"\n\nShe said to \"defend the homeland\" was his \"reason for living.\" RTL didn't give her name.\n\nFrance's top security official says a heroic officer who swapped himself for a hostage during an attack on a supermarket has died of his injuries.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb wrote in a tweet early Saturday that Col. Arnaud Beltrame had \"died for his country.\"\n\nBeltrame offered himself up unarmed to the 25-year-old attacker in exchange for a female hostage. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it, killing the gunman.\n\nBeltrame was grievously injured, and his death raises the toll from the attack to four.\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition. The attack was the deadliest since Emmanuel Macron became president last May.",

Earlier this month, he was shifted to a hospital from a prison after he complained of chest pains in Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand state.\n\nCorruption is endemic in Indian politics. Judges are now expediting trials of lawmakers accused of crimes including murder, fraud and extortion following a Supreme Court order to reach verdicts within one year in such cases. Indian lawmakers are now barred from running in elections if they are found guilty of offenses carrying a jail term of at least two years.\n\nYadav has turned his political party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, or the National People's Party, into a family enterprise, with his wife, two sons and a daughter running it. The daughter is a member of India's Parliament and the two sons have become lawmakers in Bihar state.\n\nAround 15 percent of Indian lawmakers are facing court trials on criminal charges such as rioting, murder and extortion, according to the Association for Democratic Reforms, an activist group.",

Earlier this month, he was shifted to a hospital from a prison after he complained of chest pains in Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand state.\n\nCorruption is endemic in Indian politics. Judges are now expediting trials of lawmakers accused of crimes including murder, fraud and extortion following a Supreme Court order to reach verdicts within one year in such cases. Indian lawmakers are now barred from running in elections if they are found guilty of offenses carrying a jail term of at least two years.\n\nYadav has turned his political party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, or the National People's Party, into a family enterprise, with his wife, two sons and a daughter running it. The daughter is a member of India's Parliament and the two sons have become lawmakers in Bihar state.\n\nAround 15 percent of Indian lawmakers are facing court trials on criminal charges such as rioting, murder and extortion, according to the Association for Democratic Reforms, an activist group.",

                "body": "Los d?s de declaraciones conflictivas y enga?sas Donald Trump y sus principales asesores han alimentado las dudas sobre la credibilidad de la Casa Blanca, sembrando desconfianza e inestabilidad en el Ala Oeste y haciendo que algunos congresistas republicanos se pregunten si tienen en el presidente a un socio que negocie de buena fe.\n\nSeg?n un exayudante de un l?er republicano en el Congreso, negociar con los funcionarios de la Casa Blanca se ha convertido en algo imposible para los republicanos dada la disposici? del mandatario para socavar las garant?s p?blicas y privadas de su propio equipo. Funcionarios de la Casa Blanca se han encontrado en la extra? posici? de instar a los legisladores a que ignoren algunas de las declaraciones de Trump.\n\nEste fue el caso el viernes, cuando en uno de sus habituales tuits matinales, Trump amenaz?con vetar una masiva ley presupuestaria que la Casa Blanca hab? asegurado previamente a los legisladores que firmar?. Funcionarios de la Casa Blanca insistieron en privado en el que el presidente se estaba desahogando tras ver informaciones que presentaban el acuerdo como una derrota de varias de sus prioridades. Luego de horas de incertidumbre, firm?la legislaci?.\n\nSin embargo, esta situaci? inquiet?a algunos republicanos.\n\n\"La espontaneidad y la falta de control de impulsos son cosas que preocupan a muchos miembros de ambos lados de la c?ara\", dijo Charlie Dent, un diputado republicano por Pensilvania que ha sido cr?ico con el dirigente. \"El desorden, el caos, la inestabilidad, la incertidumbre y las declaraciones desmedidas no son, en mi opini?, virtudes conservadores\".\n\nTrent Lott, exl?er de la mayor? republicana del Senado, de Mississippi, dijo que los legisladores republicanos \"sienten una gran consternaci?\" por la situaci? inducida por la casa Blanca. \"Supongo que hab? un m?odo en lo que hizo el presidente\".\n\nMiembros de los dos partidos dijeron estar preocupados porque Trump parece ajeno a la forma en la que ha socavado su propia influencia y su agenda al tomar determinadas posiciones y luego abandonarlas sin pudor. En su d?, los legisladores habr?n atribuido estos pasos en falso a la poca experiencia del mandatario con Washington y sus formas, pero ya no.\n\nLas vacilaciones de Trump con la ley presupuestaria fueron solo uno m? dentro de una serie de incidentes recientes que pusieron la credibilidad de las palabras de la Casa Blanca en el punto de mira. A principios de mes, durante un acto privado de recaudaci? de fondos, Trump presumi?de haberse inventado datos comerciales en una conversaci? con el primer ministro de Canad? Justin Trudeau. Y en los ?ltimos d?s, ? y su equipo negaron rotundamente la posible marcha del asesor de seguridad nacional H.R. McMaster as?como posibles cambios en el equipo legal que se encarga del papel de Trump en la investigaci? del fiscal especial sobre la interferencia de Rusia en las presidenciales y una obstrucci? a la justicia. M? all?de las declaraciones p?blicas, John Kelly, jefe de despacho de la Casa Blanca, hab? asegurado en privado a su personal que no hab? reestructuraciones en el horizonte.\n\nA finales de semana, McMaster estaba fuera. Y el equipo legal perdi?a un abogado y parec? estar buscando un reemplazo.\n\nLos problemas de Trump con la verdad no son nada nuevo. A menudo altera los hechos, desde el n?mero de personas que acudieron a su toma de posesi? al alcance de la reforma fiscal que firm?el a? pasado. Y como hizo al alardear de su conversaci? con Trudeau, el mandatario raramente parece avergonzarse al repetir afirmaciones que han demostrado ser falsas.\n\n\"Hay una diferencia fundamental entre esta Casa Blanca y todas sus predecesoras en la historia moderna\", dijo Timothy Naftali, historiador y exdirector de la biblioteca presidencial de Richard Nixon. \"(A esta) no le preocupa su credibilidad m? all?de hacia una peque? parte del pueblo estadounidense\".\n\nNumerosas encuestas muestran que la mayor? de los estadounidenses no creen que Trump sea veraz, y en una elaborada recientemente por Quinnipiac, el 57% de los encuestados dijeron que el presidente no era honesto. Los defensores del dirigente se?lan que fue elegido pese a que en la campa? las encuestas arrojaron datos similares.\n\nLa disposici? de Trump a eludir la verdad pone frecuentemente a sus asesores en la inc?oda posici? de emitir contundentes comunicados p?blicos que el presidente desmiente r?idamente. La portavoz Sarah Huckabee Sanders desminti?en repetidas ocasiones los reportes sobre la salida de McMaster en los d?s previos al anuncio de Trump de que ten? un nuevo asesor en seguridad nacional.\n\nEn v?peras de la amenaza de Trump de vetar la ley de financiaci?, el director de la Oficina de Presupuesto, Mick Mulvaney, no dio pie a la ambig?edad al hablar de la intenci? del dirigente de validar la medida.\n\n\"Seamos directos. ?El presidente va a firmar la ley? S? ?Por qu? Porque financia sus prioridades\", se?l?Mulvaney.\n\nFuncionarios de la Casa Blanca se?laron en privado que a veces quedan en una posici? imposible dada la disposici? de Trump a cambiar de opini?. Incluso si sus declaraciones son ciertas en un determinado momento, dijeron, no hay garant?s de que la posici? del presidente se mantenga en el tiempo.\n\nPeter Wehner, que trabaj?en los gobiernos de los expresidentes Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush y George W. Bush, dijo que Trump no tiene a nadie a quien culpar m? que a s?mismo.\n\n\"Ni siquiera sabe cu? es su propia postura\", explic?Wehner, un cr?ico habitual del dirigente. \"Esto solo deval?a su palabra y sus promesas y su presidencia\".\n\nJulie Pace est?en Twitter en http://twitter.com/jpaceDC y Alan Fram en http://twitter.com/asfram",

                "body": "BEIJING (AP) -- China's newly-appointed economic czar told U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Saturday that Beijing is ready to defend its interests after President Donald Trump announced plans to slap tariffs on nearly $50 billion Chinese imports.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He told Mnuchin in a phone call the order Trump signed Thursday violates international trade rules, the official Xinhua News Agency said.\n\nThe White House says the planned tariffs are aimed at punishing Beijing for allegedly stealing American technology and pressuring U.S. companies to hand it over.\n\nXinhua cited Liu as saying that China is \"ready and capable of defending its national interest and hopes both sides will remain rational.\"\n\nOn Friday, China said it plans to raise tariffs on a $3 billion list of U.S. goods including pork, apples and steel pipes in response to the steel and aluminum duties earlier announced by Trump.\n\nThe Chinese move appeared to be warning shot aimed at increasing domestic U.S. pressure on Trump by making clear which exporters, including farm areas that voted for the president in 2016, might be hurt.\n\nOn Friday, American farmers from hog producers in Iowa to apple growers in Washington state and winemakers in California expressed deep disappointment over being put in the middle of a potential trade war with China by the president many of them helped elect.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said Friday Beijing was considering a tariff increase of 25 percent on pork and aluminum scrap, mirroring Trump's 25 percent charge on steel. A second list of goods including wine, apples, ethanol and stainless steel pipe would be charged 15 percent, mirroring Trump's tariff hike on aluminum.\n\nOverall, the nation's farmers shipped nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. The American pork industry sent $1.1 billion in products, making China the No. 3 market for U.S. pork.\n\n\"No one wins in these tit-for-tat trade disputes, least of all the farmers and the consumers,\" said National Pork Producers Council President Jim Heimerl, a pig farmer from Johnstown, Ohio.\n\nThe U.S. has complained for years about China's sharp-elbowed trading practices, accusing it of pirating trade secrets, manipulating its currency, forcing foreign companies to hand over technology, and flooding world markets with cheap steel and aluminum that drive down prices and put U.S. manufacturers out of business.\n\nThe spiraling trade dispute between the world's two-largest economies has spurred concerns among companies and investors that global commerce could be depressed.",

                "body": "ROSEVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Investigators are working around the clock as they struggle to determine why a man with no apparent ties to terrorism drove a flaming minivan full of propane tanks and gasoline cans through the main gate of a major Northern California Air Force Base this week.\n\nHafiz Kazi, 51, died in the Kia minivan Wednesday night after veering through the gate at Travis Air Force Base and crashing, FBI agent Sean Ragan said Friday. Kazi had no known links to terrorism, did not leave behind a manifesto or any threats or explanation, and a video found on a cellphone provided no clue.\n\n\"Why did this individual end up at the front gate of Travis Air Base on fire and now deceased? We don't have the answers to that,\" Ragan said. \"We've got a significant amount of investigators assigned to it night and day since this occurred.... They will continue at it until we get those answers.\"\n\nInvestigators know of no one else associated with the incident nor any threats to air base or the community.\n\nAir Force gate personnel initially thought they were dealing with a vehicle accident when Kazi crashed and they realized he was on fire. No shots were fired as he entered the base, and it was only after the fire was out and they broke through the locked minivan doors to aid Kazi that they realized it was loaded with five propane tanks, three gallon-size gasoline cans and several cigarette lighters, Ragan said. Also found was a gym bag with personal effects and three cellphones.\n\nKazi's body was so badly burned that he had to be identified by fingerprints. Ragan said he is a native of India who has lived in the United States since 1993 and was a permanent legal resident. He never served in the military and has no known ties to the air base, he said.\n\n\"We know what happened,\" Ragan said. \"Now the question is why. Why was he there? What led him there? And we don't know the answers to that, quite frankly. So the investigation that we're doing right now is trying to piece together his life, trying to piece together what led up to this event, and attempt to determine why he was there and why he had those items in his vehicle ... They will continue at it until we get the answers.\"\n\nRagan said they have been unable to find any of Kazi's family living in the United States. A family member in India has been notified of Kazi's death, Ragan said. He said Kazi appeared to work as a cab driver in the past, but that investigators haven't determined if he was currently employed. It's not clear if he owned the minivan.\n\n\"We don't have any evidence of any religious affiliation or anything at this point,\" Ragan said. \"As of right now, we know of no other associates.\"\n\nInvestigators have interviewed some of Kazi's acquaintances and are working on some search warrants, he said. They also are scouring social media, so far without result.\n\nCalls to several numbers associated with Kazi were not returned Friday.\n\nAbout 10,000 people live and work on the base 55 miles (88 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco.\n\nElias contributed to this report from San Francisco.",

                "body": "SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon's attorney general says she is reviewing whether to launch an investigation of Facebook, including whether it violated a state law that protects online customers' private information.\n\nAttorney General Ellen Rosenblum told The Associated Press that she and several other state attorneys general are drafting a letter to Facebook, asking about a leak of Facebook customers' data without their knowledge or consent.\n\n\"We're just full of unanswered questions at this point, and whether or not it's going to blossom into a full-scale investigation is still somewhat up for grabs,\" Rosenblum said in a telephone interview late Thursday.\n\nOthers are also looking into Facebook:\n\n- Overseas, a British parliamentary committee has summoned CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify, Israel says it is launching an investigation into Facebook, and Germany's justice minister says she is calling in Facebook's European leadership to explain the scandal.\n\n- U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California wants Zuckerberg's assurances that Facebook is prepared to take the lead on protecting people's privacy. Other members of Congress have requested information from Facebook.\n\n- New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said his office is investigating how personal information came into the possession of Cambridge Analytica. Connecticut's attorney general sent Zuckerberg a letter demanding answers.\n\nCambridge Analytica, a data mining firm that worked for Donald Trump's campaign, is accused of lifting data from some 50 million Facebook users to influence voters. Former Cambridge Analytica employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie says the firm sought Facebook information to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate. It amassed the database with the help of academic Aleksander Kogan, who developed a Facebook app called \"This is Your Digital Life\" that appeared to be a personality test, Wylie said.\n\nThat app vacuumed up information from users who gave the app permission to access their accounts - as well as additional data from tens of millions of their Facebook friends.\n\nCambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing. Kogan said the data firm approached him for the project and assured him that everything he did was legal.\n\nRosenblum credited Will Castleberry, a Facebook vice president for state and local public policy, for reaching out to her on Thursday, but added that tough questions need to be answered.\n\nShe said questions being prepared for the letter include how did Facebook monitor what the developers did with the data and did Facebook have protective safeguards, including audits, to ensure developers were not misusing Facebook user data.\n\n\"They've known about this for years and they didn't notify any of their users, which really concerns me,\" Rosenblum said. \"What we're trying to do is figure out ... how to keep this from happening in the future.\"\n\nIn an email to AP on Friday, Castleberry said: \"We appreciate Attorney General Rosenblum's interest and will be in touch with her office as we continue our review of the situation.\"\n\nZuckerberg apologized Wednesday during a CNN interview but stopped short of endorsing broad privacy legislation.\n\nRosenblum said her office is looking at whether misuse of Facebook users' data violated a new Oregon law that makes it an unlawful trade practice for a business to collect, use or dispose of a consumer's information in a manner inconsistent with the business's own privacy policy as published on its website.\n\nRosenblum, who had championed the bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the Legislature last year, said Oregon is among the first states, if not the first, to pass such a law. She noted that much of the activity under scrutiny took place before the law took effect, on Jan. 1, but was confident that it would cover continued misuse of data.\n\n\"Facebook is just an unbelievably big platform,\" Rosenblum told AP. \"They have many opportunities to influence people ... and that's why it's so important for them at the front end to be properly monitoring the developers who take advantage of - and have access to - the data of the users.\"\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect Rosenblum spoke to The Associated Press on Thursday.",
