                "title": "Chelsea racism claims could be just the tip of the iceberg",
                "body": "After all the alleged failures, all the specific allegations that boys in their care were stripped of self-confidence in a hard-faced world inhabited by some deeply unpleasant characters, what do Chelsea do next?\n\nNot just Chelsea either, if the latest former player to begin legal action against the club - a man, now 51, who says he cannot bear to pass Stamford Bridge or even watch them on television because of the psychological scars more than 30 years on - is correct in his assertion that there will be hundreds of others throughout the sport who have experienced the same kind of deplorable racism that he is alleging.\n\nThis man was talented enough to earn a professional contract and share a dressing room with Kerry Dixon, Pat Nevin and David Speedie but quit the sport in 1985, he says, because the alleged racial abuse from his own coach, Gwyn Williams, had left him feeling physically sick about going into the club.\n\nHe contacted solicitors after finding out, via the Guardian's story in January, that three other former youth-team players, this time from the 1990s, had lodged legal claims against Chelsea, citing Williams again in what one claimant has described as a \"feral environment\" where black boys were treated like a \"race of fucking dogs\".\n\nLawyers working on the relevant cases tell me they have been contacted by other players from the same era. And don't imagine it is just Chelsea who might be feeling twitchy about where all this leads. These stories can quickly gather legs. Who can be sure, across the sport as a whole, that a trickle of complaints will not soon turn into a tidal wave? Or that other clubs will not be affected in the same way?\n\nTo make it very clear, Williams is flatly denying that he has ever racially abused anyone. He has issued a statement through his solicitor, Eddie Johns, to that effect and I did ring him when the first allegations surfaced. His response on that occasion was to say he did not know me and ask me to list the other football journalists on this newspaper before ringing off when it turned out they also were not familiar to him. Since then he has turned down a number of invitations to give his version of events and explain, presumably, why he thinks these players would make this up. He is not saying anything more. And that is fine, entirely his prerogative - though I would want to defend myself if I was being accused of what he is.\n\nGraham Rix, who is named extensively in the 1990s claims, is also represented by the same solicitor. Rix, formerly Chelsea's youth-team coach, has been accused of, among other things, throwing a cup of coffee in the face of a black player. Johns says his clients \"deny all and any allegations of racial or other abuse\", that they cooperated with a police investigation that did not lead to charges being pressed and have helped the Football Association.\n\nAs for Chelsea, the encouraging part is that their response goes much further than the statement they released to me earlier this week, saying: \"We take allegations of this nature extremely seriously. We are absolutely determined to do the right thing, to fully support those affected, assist the authorities and support their investigations.\"\n\nWhen I started thinking about writing this column the idea was to suggest Chelsea gave serious thought to commissioning an independent investigation. As it turns out, they had already done so, bringing in external legal counsel so there can be no accusations of a whitewash.\n\nChelsea have passed on what they have to the FA, the Premier League and, in some cases, the police, as well as offering in-house counselling to at least one former player. It cannot be easy for the current regime to deal with the fallout of something that allegedly happened under a different set of owners, yet the modern Chelsea have at least shown they want to establish the full facts - and that, for now, is all that can be asked of them.\n\nEqually I get the feeling they will be as horrified as any right-minded person by what is being alleged. The description, for example, from one of the youth-team players in the 1990s about the dressing-room environment at Harlington, at the age of 13, when Rix was coach. \"He'd walk in and go: 'Hey, look at the fucking blackies here then. Fucking rubber lips. Look at their fucking big noses. You black bastard. Been fucking robbing cars, have you?' Let me tell you something - that is the most demoralising feeling you could ever have. I'm telling you that now. It's so demoralising. You're sat there with these other little kids from all parts of Europe and different parts of the world. I remember a little boy called Javier said to me: 'Why? Why?' I remember this boy, Javier. I've never seen him since. He couldn't understand it. He was like: 'Why? Porque? I remember.\"\n\nApologies, by the way, if the language jars. This newspaper's policy is not to pebbledash its pages with asterisks and we would rather tell the story in grown-up form, rather than a censored version. Or, at least, a shortened version of the story. The above quote was a single paragraph from the transcript of the player's interview with two FA safeguarding officials last October.\n\nOther allegations include that Rix or Williams called him a \"darkie\", a \"nignog\", a \"black bastard\", a \"wog\", \"midnight\", \"jigaboo\" and various other insults. The player alleges he was told by Williams to \"fuck off back to Africa\" and \"sell drugs or rob old grannies\". Williams, he says, used to tell him to \"go and clean my office, Richard Pryor - shine my shoes like a good wog\" or \"pick up your lip, it's dragging on the floor\". In total there are 49 pages of it - all along the same lines. It's a grim and disturbing read. And, if possible, the independent lawyers need to track down Javier, and everyone else who was there at the same time.\n\nAs for the former pro who alleges he was subjected to sometimes daily abuse from Williams, from 1979 to 1985, I can also disclose some examples from his evidence for the first time. His claim alleges that he turned up in a new jumper once and Williams asked him: \"Have you been out on the rob with the other darkies on your estate?\" When the player put wet-look gel on his curly hair, Williams allegedly shouted on the bus: \"What are you wearing that stupid nig-nog hairstyle for?\"\n\nOn another occasion the team went on a pre-season trip to Switzerland. \"I got into an altercation with one of my team-mates who hit me around the head with a glass bottle,\" the former player says. \"It didn't smash but it was a serious assault so I went to him [Williams]. The only response was: 'Stop being a little coon snitch.'\"\n\nPretty shocking, isn't it? As is the claim of Renu Daly, of Hudgell Solicitors, which is representing the player, that across the sport as a whole there might be \"potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of young people\" who experienced racial abuse in the relevant decades. Her client says the same - \"I am 100% certain it happened to many young black kids\" - and if those numbers are anywhere near correct it is not just Chelsea who need to take this very seriously.\n\nSnubbing Anfield for Costa Rica game is a Kop out\n\nAfter the game against Italy on Tuesday England have two more friendlies to prepare for the World Cup, with Nigeria also due to visit Wembley but, first, a match against Costa Rica in Leeds.\n\nBut why Elland Road? And why did the Football Association decide not to go through with its original plans to stage the match at Anfield?\n\nVarious reasons - one being that Gareth Southgate and his coaching staff had misgivings about the lack of privacy at Melwood, Liverpool's training ground. Yet I'm also reliably informed that one of the reasons why Liverpool's name was crossed off was because the people making these decisions suspected the FA would not be welcomed by everyone on Merseyside because of everything surrounding Hillsborough and the possibility, at the time, that the game might clash with the forthcoming criminal trial.\n\nAnother issue was potentially letting the Sun into Anfield when the club have banned the newspaper and, again, the bad feeling that might cause. England's last game at Anfield was 12 years ago, and who can say how long it will be before they return to Merseyside?\n\nFriday night in Amsterdam - what did FA expect?\n\nYes, England's finest have done the nation proud again judging by those videos of bikes being hurled in canals and beer thrown over sightseers (I mean, why drink it if it can be chucked over three middle-aged women?). It is cringeworthy and wearisome in equal measures. More than anything, though, it is entirely predictable. Did the FA, after complaining about the stag-do mentality of England's fans, really think it wise to arrange a Friday night game in Amsterdam?",

                "title": "Brexit whistleblower: 'They cheated. It's a lie, the whole thing'",
                "body": "When I first met Shahmir Sanni last August, he was nervy, anxious, uncertain. \"I've just started piecing it together,\" he said, in what was our first off-the-record conversation. \"All this stuff I didn't realise at the time.\" Stuff that a series of investigations and news articles had forced him to start thinking about. \"Was I just really naive?\" he asked. Then later: \"Do you think they just used me?\"\n\nIt's been a painful question for Sanni, one that he's struggled with over a period of months. Now, though, he thinks that, yes, he was used; that he and his friend, Darren Grimes, were taken advantage of by people they respected and trusted, and that the consequences of it are profound, far reaching, and go well beyond his own personal feelings of hurt and betrayal.\n\nIn early 2016, Sanni was a 22-year-old recent graduate, volunteering with Vote Leave, the official campaign to leave the European Union led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. It was one of his first pieces of work experience after graduating from the University of East Anglia with a degree in economics, and for someone who describes himself as a \"natural Eurosceptic\" it was a plum role. \"It was like a startup. Everyone was throwing ideas around and saying different things. You're given a lot of creative freedom.\" He was still living at home in Solihull, but was travelling in by train, a few days each week, to work in Vote Leave's headquarters at Millbank Tower in London, overlooking the Thames.\n\nVote Leave's senior directors were quick to realise how useful he would be for the campaign. \"A huge part of campaigns is to make sure you diversify,\" says Sanni. \"And we discussed how crucial it was that Vote Leave didn't appear racist.\"\n\nSo, it was: \"Here's the brown guy\"?\n\n\"Exactly,\" he says.\n\nIt was a role he was happy to play, though, helping with their black and ethnic minority outreach efforts. \"At university all my friends were 'Remain, Remain, Remain', but when I started doing research into it, I realised I'm a nerdy Eurosceptic. And even after all this, I would still vote Leave.\"\n\n\"All this\" is why Sanni is talking today. Because it's what happened next that's the issue - a sequence of events that began in March 2016, when one of Vote Leave's senior directors, Stephen Parkinson, who is now Theresa May's political secretary, asked Sanni if he would be interested in helping with one of Vote Leave's official youth groups, BeLeave.\n\n\"BeLeave was very progressive; it was aimed at young, liberal Leavers. They were talking about African farmers being discriminated against... it totally aligned with my values.\"\n\nBeLeave had been set up and was being run from within Vote Leave's HQ by another volunteer, 23-year-old fashion student Darren Grimes, whose main role was creating ads and messaging to share on social media. \"His content was just really, really good. They were just cool, simple graphics that people would share. His creative side shone through. Everyone recognised that.\"\n\nSanni continued to campaign for Vote Leave, but he was also now helping BeLeave. Then about a month before the referendum, \"Cleo tells us someone, a sponsor, wants to give money to BeLeave\".\n\nThis was Cleo Watson, another senior director at Vote Leave - its head of outreach. Now, like Parkinson, Watson works at No 10 Downing Street, as political adviser to Theresa May.\n\nWhen Watson said a donor had expressed interest in giving money to BeLeave so it could expand its work, Sanni and Grimes wrote a proposal. They could treble the impact of their Facebook content, they reckoned, if they could get a few thousand pounds to spend on ads. \"We were like: 'If we had £10,000, this is what we could do: we could have X number of paid adverts and reach so many people.'\"\n\nWatson told them they needed to speak to Vote Leave's internal lawyer and head of compliance. \"And he said the only way to get money was to set [BeLeave] up as a separate organisation. So, we were like: 'OK, cool. How do we do that?' And so he wrote up the constitution for us. And Darren put his own name on it. Because that's what he was told to do.\"\n\nThe lawyer helped Sanni and Grimes to draw up the documents, which they signed on 18 May, and he told them to open a bank account.\n\nBut no donor ever materialised. Later, in the crucial final fortnight before the referendum, the talk in the Vote Leave office was about how the campaign was both running out of money and about to hit its spending limit of £7m. And then, 10 days before the referendum, Vote Leave learned that they had received a donation of £1m. Because of their spending limits, they suggested this could be given as a donation to BeLeave. Not the few thousand pounds they had asked for, though. The proposed sum was initially £400,000 but ended up close to £700,000.\n\nWhat was your reaction?\n\n\"We were ecstatic. It was amazing. Can you imagine... you're 22 and you're given nearly a million pounds? I think I added that to my LinkedIn profile that same day.\"\n\nToday, though, for Sanni, that campaign, the money, the creative work, and everything associated with it is tainted. What he has spent months coming to terms with is that this donation may not have had anything to do with BeLeave's creativity and flair. \"Vote Leave didn't really give us that money,\" he says. \"They just pretended to. We had no control over it. We were 22-year-old students. You're not going to just give nearly a million pounds to a pair of students and let them do whatever.\"\n\nTo Sanni's mind, what this means is: \"They cheated.\"\n\nThe question is whether this was a strategy to get around the strict electoral spending limits enforced by law. If election campaigns coordinate, they have to declare their spending together. Spending limits are the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy: our electoral laws control the amount of money that can be spent in elections - which for the official designated campaign group is £7m. But a perfectly legal loophole exists: separate campaigns can spend up to £700,000 in excess of that. Just as long as they don't co-ordinate - or, in the Electoral Commission's words, \"work together\".\n\nSo was BeLeave a separate campaign? Vote Leave insist it was and the Electoral Commission agreed back in April 2017. But Sanni - and he has a wealth of documents - now thinks it wasn't. He believes BeLeave \"worked together\" with Vote Leave.\n\n\"It's a lie. The whole thing. It was never separate.\" And he has a whole dossier of emails, text messages and other files. What's more: \"They told us to set up the bank account, but no money ever went into it. I was the treasurer and secretary of BeLeave and I never saw the money. I had no control over it. It was Vote Leave who decided everything.\" The money went straight to Vote Leave's Canadian data analytics firm - AggregateIQ (AIQ).\n\nIt's an extraordinary revelation. The Observer has been one of a number of publications and campaign groups that have picked away at the story behind this donation. Because one thing is clear: something smelled bad. It's been the subject of two Electoral Commission investigations, an inquiry by the Information Commissioner's Office, numerous Freedom of Information requests, multiple articles and a judicial review. The latest investigation is still live. And nobody has yet been able to answer the question posed in the very first article by BuzzFeed on 2 August 2016: \"Why did Vote Leave donate £625,000 to a 23-year-old fashion student during the referendum?\"\n\nUntil now. Because Sanni knows exactly why. \"We were two broke college students. Darren's working-class as well. And it's his name all over this. He's the one being investigated. It's his name on the form. And he just did what Vote Leave told him.\"\n\nSanni is quite profoundly anti-Europe. He doesn't believe in what he calls EU \"passport discrimination\". And having moved here from Pakistan, he loves this country with the passion that, he says, maybe only an immigrant can feel. \"Britain saved my family,\" he says. \"I voted Leave. And if there was a second referendum, I would vote Leave again. But I now know my vote was based on cheating. And that's what I cannot stand.\"\n\nTo say it's a brave decision to come forward is a huge understatement. Sanni is still only 24. The CEO of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliott, is the co-founder of the TaxPayers' Alliance, where Sanni works on pro-Brexit social media messaging. And a lot of his friends are still in that same pro-Brexit world, including Darren Grimes, who now works for another Matthew Elliott outfit, the website BrexitCentral.\n\nSanni lives in BrexitLand. His career has been built on Brexit. And his decision to come forward has been far from straightforward. Back in August, we discussed him going on the record anonymously, but even that felt too risky. He was worried about his mother - a teacher who came to Britain as a single mother from Pakistan less than a decade ago - and his two sisters. But it's also part of what has prompted his decision.\n\n\"I'm from Pakistan. And for someone that came here seeking a new life, a better life, one where my mum and my sisters could live freely, in a country where my decision as a voter actually matters and is truthful... this is a huge deal.\"\n\nThe first inkling that something wasn't right came when journalists from BuzzFeed and Private Eye got sight of BeLeave's audit to the Electoral Commission and found what BuzzFeed noted was \"a highly unusual transfer of funds\". Namely that Darren Grimes was recorded as having received a total of £675,315 in four donations spread over eight days shortly before polling day - on 13, 16, 20 and 21 June.\n\nSanni shrugged it off. \"I just thought: 'Oh, this is how politics is. It's remoaners trying to smear us and our hard work.'\"\n\nBut Grimes was less sanguine. Sanni still has his Facebook messages, which show his confusion and panic. \"I've had three journalists this morning,\" one says. \"I don't know if I should go back to GP and be like I'm dying or just fight through it.\" (A reference, Sanni says, to the state of his health.) Grimes then forwarded an email he'd received from a Vote Leave director: \"So as discussed we think you should refuse to speak to hacks about it and just email them something like this: 'We received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.'\"\n\nIn the BuzzFeed article, Grimes says: \"We received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.\"\n\nWhat's Sanni believes, and says is reflected in the multiple pages of evidence that he has gathered, is that Vote Leave directed BeLeave's actions before it became a separate campaign, after it became a separate campaign, and throughout the referendum.\n\nWhat's also clear, in the pages of messages from Grimes, is how the donation - which has put him front and centre of the media coverage - has affected him. His messages to Sanni make distressing reading. As a teenager, Grimes was bullied. He grew up in a working-class community in County Durham, and Sanni describes him as sensitive and vulnerable to criticism.\n\nWhen the letter arrived from the Electoral Commission, announcing it needed to make an \"assessment\", he really started to panic. \"He rang me up and told me to delete my emails. I didn't understand it. I said: 'We've done nothing wrong. Don't worry about it.' But he was panicking. So I just did it.\"\n\nSanni still had no inkling that there was anything seriously amiss. \"We were advised every step of the way by Vote Leave's lawyers. They literally told us what to do and where to sign. I couldn't understand how we had done anything wrong.\"\n\nAnd then he found the drive: a shared Google drive that Vote Leave had set up and that has every appearance of being a smoking gun. It's here that Grimes and Sanni shared content with key Vote Leave directors, including campaign director Dominic Cummings, and Vote Leave's data analytics firm, AIQ.\n\n\"I looked at it and I thought 'Oh, my God.' That's when I realised things were serious. I was, 'OK, this is really fucked up.'\"\n\nWhat Sanni realised was that on 17 March 2017, Victoria Woodcock, the chief operating officer of Vote Leave, went through the drive and deleted herself, Cummings and Vote Leave's digital director, Henry de Zoete, from more than 100 files. However the system logged a record of her activity. It is not known whether or not she was acting under instruction.\n\nThis was 17 days after the Electoral Commission had written to Vote Leave and Darren Grimes, telling them that it was opening an investigation into the donation. And 13 days after the Observer had announced the Information Commissioner's Office was launching an inquiry into the use of data in the referendum.\n\nTo Sanni it was obvious that something was seriously amiss - that this was evidence that had been deleted. Woodcock had painstakingly gone through the files one by one, and removed their names from them. Not one or two, but 140 of them. On a blog post published on Friday, Cummings says this is \"factually wrong and libellous\". Vote Leave say staff acted \"ethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data\".\n\n\"What did you do when you saw that on the drive?\" I ask Sanni.\n\n\"I told Chris,\" he says.\n\nI've spent countless hours this year talking to Christopher Wylie, and it was through him that I first heard about Shahmir Sanni's role in the EU referendum. Wylie is the whistleblower whose revelations in the Observer last weekend about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook precipitated such an astonishing global fallout. Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Alexander Nix, has been suspended, while at one stage Facebook saw around $60bn wiped off its share price. On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg apologised.\n\nChristopher Wylie is not just at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal. He's at the heart of Brexit too.\n\nIt was Wylie who introduced both Sanni and Grimes to Vote Leave. Politics is a small world, and Wylie's work with the Lib Dems in the coalition government had brought him into contact with both Lib Dems and Tories. Grimes and Sanni were both friends of Wylie, and it was he who introduced them to Stephen Parkinson of Vote Leave. In a statement released this week, Stephen Parkinson said: \"I was not introduced to Shahmir Sanni or Darren Grimes by Chris Wylie as he is claiming, but by a mutual friend from university.\"\n\nIt is Wylie's role elsewhere that is pivotal. Because he didn't just play a founding role in setting up Cambridge Analytica: he also helped in the setting up of AIQ, the Canadian data services and \"digital advertising\" firm to which Vote Leave allocated 40% of its £6.8m spend.\n\nIn February last year, I wrote my first report about Cambridge Analytica, interrogating what work it had done for Nigel Farage's Leave.EU campaign. It kicked off two investigations into Cambridge Analytica's role in Brexit: one by the Electoral Commission into its work for Leave.EU; the other by the ICO into how it used data. Since then, both organisations have denied that Cambridge Analytica did any paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU. However, on Friday, a former director of the data firm, Brittany Kaiser, said she was told to deny any work had been done. \"In my opinion, I was lying,\" she said. \"I felt like we should say 'this is exactly what we did'.\" This is consistent with what I have been reporting for more than a year.\n\nIn March, after the first article was published, I got a tip-off. Vote Leave - the official leave campaign group in the referendum - was entirely separate from Leave.EU, but the data analytics firm Vote Leave used, AIQ, was linked to SCL Elections, the parent company that set up Cambridge Analytica with Robert Mercer's funds. AIQ was until last year listed on its website as \"SCL Canada\".\n\nIt was my attempt to prove this, to figure out the link, that first led me to Wylie. \"If you want to understand where Canada fits into this,\" an ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica told me, \"you need to find Christopher Wylie.\" So I did.\n\nWylie was the key to understanding how Cambridge Analytica had harvested upwards of 50m Facebook profiles. And he was the key to understanding the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ.\n\n\"I helped set up AIQ in 2013,\" he told me in our first conversation. \"They're my friends. We needed someone to build Cambridge Analytica's technology platform and manage their databases, and I asked my friend Jeff.\"\n\nJeff Silvester was Wylie's first employer, a man he had known since he was 16 and who went on to co-found AIQ. Last May, Wylie showed me a document that proved the link: an intellectual property agreement that showed SCL Elections owned AIQ's IP \"in perpetuity\". This document shows the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ. Between Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon and Brexit. What's more, says Wylie, AIQ deployed the algorithms that Cambridge Analytica built. \"AIQ managed Ripon, Cambridge Analytica's platform, and built a lot of the tech to connect the algorithms to social and online advertising networks.\" In response to our questions, AggregateIQ said: \"AggregateIQ has always been 100 per cent Canadian owned and operated. AggregateIQ never worked or even communicated in anyway with Cambridge Analytica, or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica, with respect to the Brexit campaign.\"\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, almost all of AIQ's work came via Cambridge Analytica. They worked closely with Cambridge Analytica's vice-president, Steve Bannon, on multiple political campaigns in the US. \"Bannon was always interested in Brexit,\" says Wylie. \"He saw Britain as a cultural leader. And where Britain led, America would follow.\"\n\nIn total, £3.9m of leave campaign funds were spent with AIQ. Four different groups used the firm, even though all these campaigns were supposedly separate and could only \"work together\" if they shared their spending limits. Vote Leave spent £2,697,000. There was the £675,000 via BeLeave. A sum of £100,000 that Vote Leave donated to Veterans for Britain, which Veterans for Britain then paid to AIQ. AIQ also received £32,750 from the Democratic Unionist party. Whichever way one looks at it, AIQ would seem to be fundamental to the data-driven targeting of \"persuadables\" in the final days of the campaign.\n\nThese four campaign groups mysteriously and independently found the same tiny data analytics firm, located in a sleepy town on an island off the west coast of Canada, 5,000 miles away.\n\nIn April 2017, Dominic Cummings told me by email that Vote Leave had found the firm \"on the internet\". Darren Grimes told the Electoral Commission the same thing. The only problem? Online archives show that AIQ's website didn't show up in Google searches until after the referendum. \"I looked at the time,\" says Sanni. \"I was, like, 'Who is AIQ?' And there was nothing. No website. Nothing.\"\n\nIt's Cummings who is widely acknowledged to be the mastermind of Vote Leave. A close friend of Michael Gove, he had worked as his special adviser when Gove was minister of education, alongside another senior Vote Leave director, its head of digital, Henry de Zoete.\n\nNobody is in any doubt about Cummings's brilliance: he's advertised it widely, and written thousands of words about his strategy on his blog - about how he spent 98% of his budget online; how Vote Leave's ads received nearly a billion impressions; and how, in the end, it came down to just 600,000 people, or just over 1% of registered votes. \"A small enough margin,\" he notes, that \"a few specific events and decisions\" made all the difference.\n\nHe's also been very specific about the pivotal role played by AIQ. The firm's website featured a quote from Cummings about Brexit: \"We couldn't have done it without them.\" This was removed from the site this week. AIQ told the Observer that \"the services it provided to Vote Leave were in accordance with instructions given by Vote Leave\", and \"the services provided to BeLeave were in accordance given by BeLeave\".\n\nThe final weeks of the Brexit campaign were the most crucial. On his blog, Cummings says they code-named the period \"Waterloo\" and ramped up its spending, bombarding the small sliver of people it had identified as \"persuadable\" with every kind of ad. And it worked. Cummings's campaign was a triumph. It had overcome all the odds. There's no doubt that he won the war of the internet.\n\nBut the question about this donation, the £675,000 that went to Darren Grimes (to him personally because BeLeave was not a limited company), the four campaigns that all used AIQ, and AIQ's links to Cambridge Analytica... all this has dogged the result for 18 months now.\n\nLast autumn, Cummings took himself off Twitter. A freedom of information effort by Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay of Open Democracy became the basis for a judicial review by the Good Law Project's Jolyon Maugham QC, and in November, in what was front-page news, the Electoral Commission reopened its investigation into Darren Grimes and the donation. It had \"reasonable grounds\", it said, \"to suspect an offence may have been committed.\"\n\nCummings masterminded Vote Leave's strategy. And CEO Matthew Elliott signed it all off. But neither has been named by the Electoral Commission or the Information Commissioner's Office in any of the multiple subsequent investigations. As Sanni points out, \"It's Darren's name all over everything. He's the one in the frame.\" And he's the one, according to Sanni, who has borne the brunt of the stress and anxiety that's followed.\n\nThis is the heart of the story, and it's what has ultimately prompted Shahmir Sanni to go on the record.\n\n\"Darren is totally loyal,\" he says. \"And they knew that.\"\n\nAnd it was witnessing the toll the investigation was taking on Grimes that finally made Sanni realise the seriousness of the charges.\n\n\"It's the impact on Darren's health that made me go: 'Something's fucked up. Something's wrong.'\"\n\nIn evidence that Sanni has submitted to the Electoral Commission, he includes Facebook messages that Grimes sent him at the time senior Vote Leave staff were trying to arrange the donation; text messages that make poignant reading in the light of what happened next.\"\n\nGrimes: \"I was a bit worried about things going wrong tbh [...] Especially with the prying eyes because of the expenses scandal.\"\n\nSanni: \"What are you worried about?\"\n\nGrimes: \"Managing accounts/handling that sum of money and making sure everything is properly accounted for I guess. I have a lot to manage pretty much alone because people are flakey [sic]. And the last thing I need is to end up fucking up. Haha.\"\n\nSanni: \"I don't think you've got anything to worry about honestlyyt [sic]. And you're worried because you care - which is good thing... And the fact that people are wiling to donate to BeLeave instead of Vote Leave is something you should be very, very proud of.\"\n\nWhat's more, in an email sent on 16 May to Vote Leave's lawyer, Cleo Watson wrote: \"... Darren and the rest of the group (all between 18 & 22) don't feel comfortable handling the money side of things, having no experience beyond their student loans.\"\n\nIt's a stunning acknowledgment, one which raises more questions. This was Vote Leave's senior director and Vote Leave's head of compliance acknowledging that this was a group of young people without the experience or wherewithal to handle such a large sum of money. Watson told the Observer: \"I absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.\" She said she was supportive as a friend but did not have \"any kind of control\" over them.\n\nThere's a heartbreaking contrast in the documents that Sanni has - between the cynicism that informed the funding scheme and the idealism that underpinned BeLeave's messages and beliefs (\"BeLeave is a movement of young people working to build a bright future for Britain outside the European Union,\" read the funding proposal document they submitted).\n\nAnd Grimes's fear that somehow he would mess up and jeopardise the cause is unmistakable: that it was too much responsibility; that he didn't feel up to it. Sanni repeatedly tells him, \"you should be proud\", and Grimes replies: \"I guess it is just worrying soemthing [sic] is gonna fuck up and it'll be me having to pay thousands back and end up homeless.\" We sent Darren Grimes a summary of the evidence we had found. He said any allegations he had done anything wrong were \"damaging\" and \"untrue\".\n\nWhat has amazed me through all this is Sanni. When I met him in August, I didn't think he'd come forward. I thought there was an outside chance he might leak me emails or documents, but I couldn't see him going on record. He's a Leaver: these are his friends and colleagues, they are people he looked up to.\n\n\"Everyone associated with the campaign knew who Darren was,\" he says. \"Everybody congratulated us and knew what role we'd played. Michael Gove knew exactly how important we'd been. He's a close friend of Dom Cummings. Of course he knew. Boris Johnson knew. Everybody knew.\"\n\nAnd part of me worried about what would happen if he did go on the record. I worried that Christopher Wylie's decision to come forward last week might over-influence Sanni. That he'd expose himself to risks he hadn't properly thought through. That at just 24, he couldn't really understand the possible consequences. But what I've learned about Sanni in the past few months is how tough-minded he is. Coming to terms with the idea that he had been gulled and compromised by the people he respected, for the cause that he loved, has been painful and difficult. It was a process of months. But since he decided to come forward, he's been determined to do what he has no doubt is the right thing. His messages reveal how protective and supportive he's been of Darren Grimes. They're at the heart of his decision. But he has a sense of higher purpose too.\n\n\"I think I respect British laws more than most British people do,\" he says. \"I feel I respect this country and love this country more than some people who have been born and bred here. Because I know and I've seen... the safety that it's brought me and my family, my sisters and my mother as a woman, as women that have potential and are now living their best lives.\"\n\nSanni doesn't go into detail about what they went through in Pakistan, but at one point he tells me that he has \"had a lot of trauma in my life\". Nobody is making him come forward. And when he talks about his mother and sisters and the freedom they now enjoy, the hairs rise on the back of my neck. And then he tells me about queueing. It starts as a riff, but then it becomes a speech. A mission statement.\n\n\"This is the one country where no matter what is happening, people will stand in a line. People here, there is a core ethos of what it means to be British: to do it right. To wait your turn. To never cheat or lie your way to get to the front. It's what it means to be British.\"\n\nSanni would still vote Leave. He just wants to do it properly. \"We don't cheat,\" he says. \"We're British.\"\n\nWhat will you do on Monday, I ask him. He still works for the TaxPayers' Alliance, co-founded by Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave's CEO. He has no other form of income. He shrugs. \"Go to work, I suppose. Wait and see what happens.\"\n\nLike us all.",

                "title": "'My crew saved 218 migrants from drowning - so why are we the enemy?'",
                "body": "Captain Marc Reig's ship is stuck in a Sicilian port, and a hostage to Italy's resurgent right, as charities become a target for their role in rescuing refugees\n\nCaptain Marc Reig does not look like a man at the centre of a storm. But that is what he is, despite the fact that his ship, the migrant-rescue boat the Open Arms, is safely moored in the pretty port of Pozzallo in southern Sicily, its peace disturbed only by the waves gently lapping against its hull.\n\nWhen the ship, operated by the Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms, lifted 218 desperate migrants from the leaky raft on which they had been trying to cross the rough seas of the Mediterranean last week, it seemed like a routine operation. In the last three years, more than 5,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean onboard the ship run by the NGO, which patrols an area outside Libyan waters. But what happened next was anything but routine. As the ship docked in Pozzallo, dozens of police closed in.\n\nAs soon as the human cargo disembarked, the ship was seized and three members of its crew put under investigation. The chief prosecutor of Catania, Carmelo Zuccaro, has accused them of refusing to hand the migrants over to Libyan coastguards, and so enabling illegal immigration. The 37-metre boat has remained moored in Pozzallo, awaiting a judge's verdict on its fate, while Italians who no longer want their country to provide a refuge to migrants are celebrating its seizure.\n\nThe Proactiva ship seems to have become a political hostage in a country where immigrants are perceived by many as invaders and parasites, and where the issue of migration has become toxic in the wake of this month's election, which saw a surge in support for anti-immigrant parties.\n\nOn 3 February, a neo-fascist shot and injured six Africans in the city of Macerata, and a few days later, rightwing parties vowed to kick 600,000 migrants out of the country if elected. In this context, anyone who helps migrants is considered an enemy, responsible for helping human traffickers.\n\nThis is the crime of which the Spanish captain of the Open Arms is accused. Of his 19 crew members, more than half have returned home. Reig, 42, who now spends most of the time locked in his cabin, is haunted by the events of that dramatic night a week ago, when his ship picked up the migrants from their raft - and immediately faced a challenge from Libyan coastguards, who he says threatened to kill the crew if they didn't hand the migrants over.\n\n\"It all happened in the space of a few minutes. We had just rescued 218 people, when we saw the Libyan coastguard ship arrive,\" he tells the Observer. \"They said we had to give them back the migrants, or they would shoot us.\"\n\nThe Italian authorities called the Open Arms' crew and advised them to leave the migrants to the Libyans, because they said Tripoli was in charge of the save-and-rescue zone in that area of the sea. But Reig says this is not true - the Libyan SAR zone was unilaterally declared by Italy and Libya around Christmas, but a notification by the IMO (International Maritime Organisation) has not been issued. Moreover, the rescue took place in international waters and so the orders of the Libyan coastguard were not binding. The law of the sea is clear: the responsibility lies with whoever rescues the boat first. \"At that precise moment I thought about the dozens of empty boats we found at sea in recent months,\" says Reig. \"The migrants who were on board had been captured by the Libyans and deported back to Tripoli. The refugees we saved spoke of unimaginable torture. They say they would rather die than go back to Libya.''\n\nWith Libyan rifles still pointed at his crew, Reig turned north towards Sicily. \"If we had abandoned them to the Libyans, we would never have forgiven ourselves,'' says Anabel Montes, coordinator of the rescue mission.\n\n\"We were victims of an armed attack, but we are the ones on trial,\" says Riccardo Gatti, head of the Open Arms mission. \"And all this happens a week after the elections and the triumph of the rightwing parties in Italy. It does not seem a mere coincidence.''\n\nThe morning after the standoff, Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right Northern League, tweeted: \"Finally an Italian prosecutor is blocking the human trafficking.\"\n\nSalvini, who ran an election campaign promising tougher laws against migrants, won almost 18% of the vote, becoming the undisputed leader of the centre-right. But Italy's intolerant attitude began way before his rise.\n\nAfter the shipwreck of 3 October 2013, when 368 people died after a fire broke out on their boat a few miles off the Italian island of Lampedusa, Italy declared war on human traffickers. The goal was to capture the smugglers who organise the crossings and protect the migrants.\n\nThis is how the year-long naval and air operation Mare Nostrum was born. During the mission, 150,000 migrants arrived safely in Italy, before moving on to destinations across Europe. Unfortunately, the operation angered some countries, above all France, Austria and Switzerland, who began to repel migrants and return them to the Italian authorities. The refugees rescued at sea found themselves stuck in Italy, and reception centres from north to south began collapsing. Italians started to complain about the thousands of migrants trapped in their cities.\n\n\"In 2015, Italy's approach starts to change,\" explains Fulvio Vassallo, asylum law expert at the University of Palermo. \"The Mare Nostrum operation was replaced by the more authoritarian Frontex, whose main objective is not saving lives but border control. The hunt for human traffickers began to lose its humanitarian purpose, replaced by feelings of intolerance.\"\n\nIn short, human traffickers had to be captured, not to put an end to the abuses perpetrated on refugees, but to stop the flow of people. Charity boats continued to run sea rescues, and picked up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore in 2017, compared with less than 1% in 2014. But then Italy's minister of the interior, Marco Minniti, fearing that the NGOs were helping people smugglers from North Africa, proposed a code of conduct for the charities, including the commitment to take armed police officers onboard, which many considered unethical.\n\n\"The message was clear,\" says Vassallo. \"NGOs had become a problem for European countries. [They] not only continued to deliver migrants, but also witnessed the injustices perpetrated by Libyan authorities. Linking them to the traffickers was a pretext to get rid of them.\"\n\nLast August, Italian police impounded the Iuventa, a boat operated by German NGO Jugend Rettet, and dispatched a navy patrol boat to Libya as part of an attempt to end the refugee crisis. According to a police statement \"the Iuventa was used for activities facilitating illegal immigration\". The ongoing investigation has found no real evidence against the NGO. But since then, charity efforts to save lives at sea have become increasingly difficult. Five aid groups that operate migrant-rescue boats in the Mediterranean have refused to sign up to the Italian government's code of conduct, but three others have backed the new rules. Among those three is Proactiva Open Arms, which has seen donations fall by 40% in the last year.\n\nBut if one part of Italy rejoices at the boat's seizure, another celebrates the deeds of Captain Reig, sending him messages of support. But he rejects any description of himself as a hero. ''The real heroes are those who cross the desert for years, enduring torture and persecution,\" he says. \"Those who, in order to get to Europe and not go back to Libya, throw themselves into a sea in which they cannot even swim.\"",

                "body": "England's long hot summer of 2017 is stretching through into the even longer cold winter of 2018 as Aidy Boothroyd's under-21s, semi-finalists in last summer's European Championship, won impressively against a dangerous Romania side at Molineux.\n\nGoals from Demarai Gray and Jake Clarke-Salter saw the Under-21s stretch their good run to one defeat in 11 games after a friendly that should prove useful preparation for Tuesday's Euro 2019 qualifier against Ukraine at Bramall Lane.\n\nThe depth of quality is more significant than the bare statistics, with the likes of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose goal clinched the Under-20 World Cup, and Jonjoe Kenny came off the bench. Ryan Sessegnon, Fulham's wonderkid, did not even get onto the field.\n\nEngland can feel confident about building on the three major trophies they won at junior level last year. The under-17s host their own Euros in May, and who knows, Gareth Southgate's group may even prosper in Russia.\n\nThe applause in memory of Cyrille Regis had started long before the public announcer had the opportunity to start the minute's ovation. Floral tributes were laid on the pitch from representatives of the FA and the West Midlands clubs the late England striker represented to mark his passing earlier this year.\n\nThere may have been only two survivors in the starting line-up from the under-21s squad Aidy Boothroyd led to the European Championship semi-finals in Poland but the majority of the players picked know how it feels to win a tournament - the squad contained 15 winners from last summer's triumph - and the team set about Romania with zeal.\n\nKeiran Dowell, the Everton winger on loan at Nottingham Forest, whipped a free-kick just over the crossbar as England chased an early goal to excite a sizeable Molineux crowd.\n\nDemarai Gray, captain on the night and one of the more senior players in this squad, has not enjoyed much playing time with Leicester City this season but he was clearly intent on capitalising on this opportunity. With freedom to roam from his left-sided role, the former Birmingham winger received a layoff from Ademola Lookman in the eighth minute and cut inside before releasing a shot that deflected off Alex Pascanu - his club-mate at Leicester - and into the near corner of the net.\n\nRomania would have equalised midway through the first half if Jake Clarke-Salter had not deflected Andrei Ivan's shot on to the post. The Chelsea loanee, sent off in his last two games for Sunderland, had got himself in a mix-up with Fikayo Tomori but atoned.\n\nBoothroyd made an unusual substitution when he introduced a second right-back, Jonjoe Kenny, and moved Alexander-Arnold up into midfield, presumably to counter Roman Coman's threat down the left. The head coach's decision to withdraw Gray, his captain, was also an interesting move.\n\nAbraham headed up and, as the goalkeeper Ionut Radu lost his footing, on to the crossbar from Alexander-Arnold's right-wing cross after an excellent move in which Dowell's clever backheel made the space out wide. Lookman, evidently benefiting from the action he is getting in the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig, was England's standout player and he shot against the post before Radu touched the ball behind.\n\nFrom Alexander-Arnold's corner, Clarke-Salter headed in and England's win looked secure. But Dean Henderson flapped at a free-kick from Ianis Hagi - son of the legendary Gheorge - for substitute Valentin Ciobanu to make it 2-1 13 minutes from time, and England had to throw bodies in the way of a flurry of late shots to secure the win.",

Additionally, on Friday, the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following through on the president's commitment to ban devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"\n\nTrump spent much of the morning at the Trump International golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The White House did not respond to questions about his activities there.\n\nThe Fix Nics 2017 Act would tighten the country's background checks system. Nics stands for the National Instant Background Checks System. The legislation provides federal agencies with a few more incentives to submit records to the background check system - something they are already required by law to do.\n\nThe Stop School Violence Act would authorize $50m in grant funding for campus safety improvements, including training for local law enforcement and faculty and the development of an anonymous reporting system to identify early warning signs of potential threats.\n\nBoth pieces of legislation were part of the omnibus government bill that Trump signed on Friday.\n\nOther politicians from both sides of the partisan divide weighed in as well. Florida senator Marco Rubio said in a statement: \"I commend those who today are peacefully exercising their first amendment rights to march in favor of a gun ban.\"\n\nRubio, who came under criticism from survivors of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in a televised town hall on CNN, added: \"While I do not agree with all of the solutions they propose, I respect their views and recognize that many Americans support certain gun bans. However, many other Americans do not support a gun ban. They too want to prevent mass shootings, but view banning guns as an infringement on the second amendment rights of law abiding citizens that ultimately will not prevent these tragedies.\"\n\nIn contrast, a number of Democrats actively participated in marches held across the country.Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were among those who marched in Washington. Senator Sherrod Brown attended an event in Cleveland and Senator Elizabeth Warren attended an event in Boston. Barack Obama also expressed his support on Twitter, saying: \"Michelle and I are so inspired by all the young people who made today's marches happen. Keep at it. You're leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change.\"\n\nTrump, who ran as a strong supporter of gun rights, has taken several different positions on new legislation in the aftermath of the Florida shooting. Most recently, he proposed arming teachers while backing away from earlier statements about raising the legal age to purchase a semi-automatic weapon to 21.\n\nOn Friday, the US justice department proposed rule changes that would effectively ban bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like a machinegun. Bump stocks were used by Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock to kill 58 people in the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history. Trump heralded the DoJ's move on Twitter by saying: \"We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"\n\nTrump has also proposed extreme risk protection orders, which would provide law enforcement and family members with a legal way to petition a court to temporarily remove an unstable person's guns, and block them from buying new ones.",

                "body": "Wearing the away kit colours that reflected the blue skies above them, Paul Smyth sent the Northern Ireland faithful into seventh heaven on a sunny spring‑like afternoon in Belfast. Only four minutes after coming on, the 20-year-old Queens Park Rangers winger shook off his South Korean marker just inside the penalty area and fired home the winner on his international debut. He marked it with an acrobatic backwards flip as Windsor Park celebrated.\n\nSmyth's dream start as a Northern Ireland player also marked an upbeat second coming for Michael O'Neill, who only a few months ago appeared to be taking over at Scotland instead.\n\nThe manager said it should be remembered that Smyth played an under-21s game against Spain only 48 hours earlier. \"I Just asked him had he got 10 minutes' running in him because he played 90 minutes the other night. I told him to go and enjoy it. He's played on that pitch many times so he's probably better used to the surface than any of the other players.\n\n\"He loved it, you could just see. His enthusiasm for the game is infectious, the boys love him,\" O'Neill added.\n\nSmyth's strike transformed what was heading to be a fair, evenly matched 1-1 draw between the hosts and World Cup-bound South Korea into a friendly victory that should give O'Neill and his squad a major boost.\n\nInitially, though, the South Koreans were a neat, tidy passing unit that appeared about to take Northern Ireland apart. Tottenham's Son Heung-min created their seventh-minute opener by cleverly lifting the ball into the penalty area for Kwon Chang-hoon to shoot past Trevor Carson.\n\nThe home goalkeeper then managed to stop Son himself making it 2-0 soon afterwards when the Motherwell goalkeeper blocked his shot.\n\nA minute later a Jamie Ward effort was ruled out for offside but Northern Ireland did not have to wait too long for an equaliser. In the 20th minute they crafted a clever free-kick about 25 yards out. Ward skipped over the ball but kept running down the right and Oliver Norwood played him in with a low pass for the winger to strike a hard and low cross into the box, which clipped off Kim Min-jae for an own goal.\n\nThe quick recovery by O'Neill's men created a more evenly fought contest up until half-time. But after the interval South Korea enjoyed two spells of sustained pressure. A Lee Jae-sung shot was deflected away for a corner, then Carson got down to his left to save Park Joo-ho's deflected strike, which could easily have ended up in the net.\n\nSon, who was subject to booing throughout his time on the pitch, then cut in from the left but his shot was blocked by defender Conor McLaughlin.\n\nShin Tae-yong's players will have to be far more ruthless and clinical in front of goal when they face Germany, Sweden and Mexico in Group F in Russia this summer, and as with the first half, there was a Northern Ireland revival.\n\nThe key substitution came in the 82nd minute when Smyth returned to the pitch where last season his performances on the wing helped Linfield win the Irish Premiership. Now the West Belfast-born player was on an international stage and he latched onto QPR team-mate Conor Washington's header and showed strength and guile to score the winner with a low drive.\n\nFittingly it was Smyth who enjoyed the very last kick of the game after he cut in from the wing and forced a save from Kim. The Northern Ireland fans sang \"Paul Smyth's on fire\" - the tune they normally belt out in praise of Wigan's Will Grigg. They have found a new striking hero.",

                "body": "The suggestion is unlikely to prick Martin Allen's self-belief but this, surely, is a \"mission impossible\" too far. His fifth spell managing Barnet began with hints of his influence but they finished well beaten and patently lacking quality. Goals from Danny Hylton and James Collins put the home team back on top of League Two; Barnet will be relegated from it if they cannot bridge a deficit of at least seven points and another Allen-inspired miracle seems some way off.\n\nAllen had spent the week reducing a 43-strong squad by more than half. The 11 who made it out on to the pitch looked purpose-moulded to his image: in comparison to their opponents Barnet resembled giants, Allen's four changes seemingly motivated by the need to bludgeon any kind of path towards survival.\n\nAn early concession would have put their appetite to the test but after Craig Ross, the goalkeeper, bundled a Dan Potts header away from goal they settled well. Luton, skittish after seeing a five-game winless run ask questions of their promotion credentials, were drawn into a scrap that cared little for the purring football that has won them so many admirers.\n\nBarnet could call upon a bustling outlet in John Akinde, who almost found a route to goal before a timely challenge by Alan Sheehan, but broadly their defence's priority on receiving possession was that anywhere would do. It meant the game careered from one end to another with nobody evincing the ability - or, in Barnet's case, willingness - to apply a handbrake.\n\nRoss clutched another Potts header and parried an effort from Luke Berry but Barnet had glimpses too. When Akinde, who had earlier angered Alan McCormack by leaving a high boot in as the midfielder stooped to clear, seized upon a sloppy Potts pass and shot marginally wide it was an accurate comment on how Luton's half had passed.\n\nThey had not found any kind of rhythm, efforts to do so hardly aided by Barnet's lengthy deliberations over throw-ins and goal-kicks, and Allen paced down the tunnel to reflect on a gameplan well executed.\n\nHis thoughts will have darkened, then, when they committed the cardinal sin of switching off straight after half-time. Hylton's goal, heading into a half-empty net after Potts directed a Sheehan free-kick across the six-yard box, was his first since 6 January and maddeningly simple from a Barnet perspective.\n\nAs much as it undid their good work it had the effect of liberating the home team. One flowing move, which ended with Collins dummying and Andrew Shinnie's shot deflecting wide, was reminiscent of their prolific pre-Christmas form; Ross then spectacularly punched a Berry curler over and the sense grew that Allen would need a stroke of magic from beyond the usual playbook.\n\nInstead Collins ensured the spell was shattered, setting his sights near the right edge of the penalty area and finding the corner with a drive that, while well struck, should have been repelled by Ross.\n\n\"You're getting sacked in the morning'\" was the home support's chant. It is true that Allen tends to join the Bees for a good time rather than a long time; the odds against the former, though, look insurmountable on this occasion.",

                "title": "PSG hold talks with Antonio Conte's representatives over summer move",
                "body": "* Ligue 1 champions-elect willing to offer Conte £10m a season\n\n* Unai Emery certain to leave after failing to impress in Europe\n\nParis Saint-Germain have opened talks with Antonio Conte's representatives in an attempt to convince the Italian to leave Chelsea this summer.\n\nThe French club are certain to part company with Unai Emery at the end of the season when his contract expires, and Conte is one of four managers the PSG president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, is considering as a replacement. José Mourinho, Diego Simeone and Massimiliano Allegri are the other three.\n\nMourinho is unlikely to leave Manchester United despite their exit from the Champions League at the hands of Sevilla and a somewhat strained relationship with the club's fans. Simeone and Allegri will also be difficult to prise away from their respective clubs. Mauricio Pochettino has also been linked with the post but there has been no contact with the Argentinian yet.\n\nSo PSG have approached Conte first, knowing he is frustrated at Chelsea and possibly looking for a new challenge. The Italy job would be another option for the 48-year-old, should he part company with the London club in the summer, but it is thought that he would prefer to remain in club football. The Chelsea board is set to discuss Conte's future next month.\n\nPSG would be able to offer Conte a small increase in salary and the initial talks were positive. PSG have not made a formal approach and are still considering their options. Conte earns £9.5m a season at Chelsea with PSG willing to offer their new manager £10m a year.\n\nThe French club hired Emery in 2016 after he had won an unprecedented third Europa League in a row with Sevilla. PSG had hoped that the Spaniard's European nous would help them finally lift the Champions League. However, in Emery's first year in charge they went out to Barcelona in the last 16 despite having won the home leg 4-0. This season they were again eliminated in the first knockout round, this time Real Madrid progressing 5-2 on aggregate.\n\nOn course to win this season's Ligue 1 title, PSG are 17 points ahead of Monaco with seven matches remaining (Monaco have eight), but there has not been enough progress under the Spaniard on the European stage for the club to retain their faith in him.\n\nPSG signed Neymar and Kylian Mbappé last summer (the latter on a loan deal that will become permanent this summer) but both European campaigns under Emery have been undermined by the manager's decision-making and team selection, especially surrounding the team captain Thiago Silva.\n\nConte, meanwhile, has showed at Chelsea that he is capable of creating a team that can overcome the odds and win titles. Chelsea won the league in his first season at Stamford Bridge and although his second campaign has not been as successful there is recognition in Paris that he was not backed in the summer transfer window and that the squad has lacked the required depth and quality to compete in Europe and domestically.\n\nThe Italian's relationship with the board has deteriorated this season with Conte complaining that he has not been able to sign the players he wanted. Chelsea are currently fifth, five points behind Tottenham, who they play next in the league.\n\nThe lack of investment in the Chelsea squad has never been far from Conte's thoughts and before the recent game against Manchester City he said: \"When you have a good manager and a lot of money to spend, probably you can have a successful season.\n\n\"I have great ambition but I don't have money for Chelsea. The club knows very well what is my idea, what is my ambition. That is very clear. When you decide to work with this type of coach, you must understand that you take a coach with great ambition. Not a loser but a winner. And that ambition must always be shared.\"\n\nChelsea have actually spent more money than PSG on players over the past two seasons - £351m to £316m - but when it comes to net spend the Parisians are leading the way, £178m to Chelsea's £111m. Conte has sold players such as Diego Costa, Oscar and Nemanja Matic to fund player purchases but was still unable to sign the striker he wanted, Romelu Lukaku, last summer, having to settle for Álvaro Morata instead.\n\nPSG would face competition from Italy to sign Conte this summer with the Italian FA's vice-commissioner, Alessandro Costacurta, saying last month that the Chelsea manager is Italy's top choice as national coach. \"I haven't chosen yet but I think Conte is the one who could do the best,\" he said. \"I'll definitely talk with him in a couple of months.\"",

                "body": "The actor has put Breaking Bad behind him, earning rave reviews in Network at the National Theatre. But next it's a dog's life with Wes Anderson\n\nCalifornian actor Bryan Cranston, 62, is best known for his Emmy-winning portrayal of Breaking Bad's antihero Walter White. His film roles include Trumbo, for which he was Oscar-nominated. He's currently starring in Network at the National Theatre and the new Wes Anderson animation, Isle of Dogs.\n\nYou're playing news anchor Howard Beale in the stage production of Network. How's it going?\n\nReally well. It's about to finish but I've enjoyed my time in London. The play is very prescient about fake news and how we're in trouble if television falls into the wrong hands. It's amazing how 42 years ago, [screenwriter] Paddy Chayefsky was able to see into the future.\n\nAre you thinking about the likes of Fox News?\n\nYeah. When I was growing up, we believed that what we saw on TV was the truth. The news was simply a man, in most cases, telling you what happened today. Now it's so opinionated, it's difficult to decipher what's news and what's part of an agenda. You talk to younger people and they say \"Oh, I get all my news on Twitter or Facebook\". Really? Wow. This is the world we're living in and how the Russians were able to influence large swaths of America. That's what the play's all about. In my final speech, I say: \"The thing we must be most afraid of is the destructive power of absolute beliefs.\" It's crazy.\n\nThe staging includes a bustling studio and onstage restaurant. Has it been distracting?\n\nSurprisingly not. It's been interesting to integrate the audience. There's the occasional noise but whenever you're on stage, you hear people coughing or whispering. You just have to divert your attention away.\n\nHow did you land the part in Isle of Dogs?\n\nHonestly, when my agent called and said the first three words, I knew my answer. Those three words were \"Wes Anderson wants...\" I said yes before he'd finished the sentence.\n\nBut he could have wanted anything...\n\n\"Wes Anderson wants you to wash his dishes. Mow his lawn. Shovel his... sidewalk.\" Still yes!\n\nYour character, Chief, leads the outcast dogs. How did you bring him to life?\n\nWes showed me an early drawing and Chief really was a mutt. I relate to that. It's what I am. I'm not a pedigree of any kind either.\n\nIt's said dogs and their owners grow to look alike. Do you look like Chief?\n\nIn a way. We're both rugged, haggard and weathered. We've seen better days and aren't going to win any beauty contests. Chief gets a bath eventually, though. I can scrub up quite well too.\n\nHe has a romance with showdog Nutmeg, played by Scarlett Johansson. Were you aiming for a Bogart and Bacall vibe?\n\nYes. It works in animation. No live-action film would ever couple me with Scarlett Johansson. But here the plight of the characters and our vocal qualities seemed to be in line. Our exchanges were done remotely. In fact, I still haven't met Scarlett. I guess this will break the ice when we do. We're like Lady and the Tramp.\n\nWhat was it like leading the wolf pack?\n\nI spent a few days in a room with Wes and most of the other pack dogs: Bill Murray, Bob Balaban and Edward Norton. Usually you do voice work alone, so it was interesting to see the pack dynamics in action. I'd glance over and Wes would have his eyes closed, listening to our voices and imagining the visuals.\n\nDid you act like the alpha dog in the studio?\n\nThe first thing I did was walk up to my microphone, lift my leg and mark my territory. Trouble was, then I had to live with the smell of the mic.\n\nAre you a dog lover yourself?\n\nVery much. I don't have one right now. Our beloved Sugar passed two years ago. She was a rescue dog from an LA pound and we had her for 16 years. Dogs are just the surface of this film, though. Its deeper levels look into greed, fear-mongering, the segregation of immigrants and how we treat others.\n\nThe anti-dog hysteria and deportation seem politically timely...\n\nThey do. Audiences anywhere will be able to extract meaning, depending on what's happening in their own country.\n\nChildren save the day in the film. Could that be the case in the real world too - say, with the US gun-control debate?\n\nIt will take resistance, fight and struggle. But without that, we wouldn't have a country at all. Revolutions have to take place to topple regimes. Resistance is a force for change. I certainly hope change is coming in America.\n\nWhen you presented an award at last month's Baftas, you pretended to be a dog. Was that fun?\n\nYeah, I like to take chances. Awards shows can get rather dry, so it's nice to rib people a little. I heard them mention dogs in my introduction, so thought I'd play the obedient pet. Besides, it's not often you get patted on the head by Joanna Lumley.\n\nWas it powerful to see the black dress code for Time's Up?\n\nVery. What's happening is really beneficial. The pillars of misogyny are falling. The oppressive behaviour of rich white men has got to stop. People are nervous that it will stop workplace romances and so on, but men just need to read signals, see boundaries and show respect.\n\nWhat are the differences between working in the US and UK?\n\nWhat I love about British audiences is their deep respect for the theatre. It's embedded in your DNA. And you don't feel obliged to stand and give an ovation, like in the States. You have to earn it here and that's what a performer wants. It's the best compliment. It's great to be in a country that not only appreciates the arts but where the government supports them too. In the US, it's the first thing to get cut.\n\nDo you miss Walter White? Would you ever play him again?\n\nI really don't. I loved that time and miss the people. I stay in touch with the cast and see the crew now and then. But [creator] Vince Gilligan crafted a beautiful thing with a beginning, middle and an end. Revisiting it would diminish the experience. Having said that, would I entertain being on [spin-off series] Better Call Saul? Yes. It's a fresh story, tonally different and I love it.\n\nBreaking Bad had a huge cultural impact. How does that feel?\n\nIt's strange because that feels separate to what we did in the New Mexico desert for six years. If things become a classic, that's for society to determine. Breaking Bad certainly seems to have created a groundswell but I assure you that it has nothing to do with us. We just told the story the best we could.\n\nWas it transformative for your career?\n\nWithout question and I'm eternally grateful. I just responded to the writing. It's what I tell young actors: take every job when you're coming up, so you learn your craft and meet more people, but at a certain point, learn to say no and wait for good work. Good work always starts with the writing.\n\nWhat's next in the pipeline?\n\nI've created a show for Amazon called The Dangerous Book for Boys, which comes out next week and I'm very excited about it. It's a true family experience, filled with love, pathos and adventure. I'm focusing on that and the final week of Network, then we'll see.\n\nIsle of Dogs is out in the UK on Friday",

This was a victory for the jockey's link with the Newmarket trainer William Haggas, which is still in its early stages but proving fruitful.\n\n\"We're trying to build a relationship with James,\" Haggas said. \"He's contracted to Godolphin but he didn't seem to be used much by them last year. We're trying to get a jockey who will ride regularly and will be able to ride in the better races.\n\n\"We'd like Ryan [Moore] but so would everyone else. We'll see how it goes and if James is available I think he'll ride the majority of the ones that we have.\"\n\nDoyle is a 40-1 shot to be champion this year but that could underestimate him, considering he also has the support of another influential Newmarket trainer in Hugo Palmer. Asked if he would be making a run at the title this year, Doyle replied: \"I've never not gone for it.\" He then accepted he is now receiving a quantity of support that could make him a contender. \"Hopefully we can ride plenty of winners. We'll be trying anyway.\"\n\nLast seen winning the Silver Cambridgeshire with Moore aboard in September, Addeybb travelled strongly here, could be called the winner a long way out and won in the style of a Group horse. Haggas may try him in a good-quality mile race at Sandown's mixed meeting at the end of April. The trainer has now won four Lincolns, matching the record set by Jack Robinson, whose most recent victory was more than a century ago.\n\nA step up in class is also on the cards for Zabeel Prince, who won a Listed prize here. Beaten once in his past five outings, Roger Varian's charge may now go to Newbury's Lockinge Stakes in May.\n\nAt Newbury, Seeyouatmidnight finally qualified for next month's Grand National by taking part in a race over fences for the first time this season. His connections' plans had been repeatedly frustrated by bad weather at tracks such as Kelso and Carlisle but he showed up well for a long way in this race over a distance too short for him.\n\nSeveral firms trimmed the Scottish horse's odds for thee Aintree race, though he remains at 33-1 in places.",

                "body": "Ukip is dead but Nigel Farage remains the most significant politician since Margaret Thatcher, his influence everywhere\n\nIt's easy to laugh at Britain's unpopular populists. Ukip is dead. Farage has been reduced to being a minor radio personality in Britain and a down-the-bill warm-up act in Trump country. As for the supposedly serious Brexiters, the Observer's revelations will surely discredit the Vote Leave crew, assuming they have any credit left to diss, that is.\n\nLook at them. They can't even organise a mindless publicity stunt. They were to throw fish in the Thames - haddock, if you must know - to protest about EU fishing quotas remaining until 2021. Alas, the trawler could not moor. Jacob Rees-Mogg was left stranded on the bank, not by Brussels bureaucrats but good old British red, white and blue tape, which mandates that you must have a Transport for London permit to pull in at Westminster pier.\n\nAs futile was the Tory right's follow-up threat to crash the economy by scuppering the transition deal if Britain does not get control of its territorial waters in 2019. Because of the Brexit referendum, and for the first time in British history, we have a prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary, half of the government benches and nearly all the opposition benches following a policy they believe is against the national interest. They will not make further concessions to the Tory right that has forced them to betray their conscience and country.\n\nAs I said, it's easy to laugh. A little too easy. Nigel Farage remains the most significant politician since Margaret Thatcher. If it wasn't for him, we would still be in the EU. As for Ukip and the Tory right, they only seem insignificant because they have forced the PM to give them virtually everything they want. Their sidelining may turn out to be a clever strategic move. They will be able to cry \"stab in the back\" and \"Brexit betrayed\" because Theresa May will be responsible for the decline they brought to Britain. If only, the right will say, the perfidious establishment had not compromised we would have had a Brexit filled with hope and glory.\n\nMatthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, who pioneered the research into the new right, tell me they are not writing its obituary yet. Trump and Orbán control the US and Hungary. So weak are liberal forces, it is counted a victory when the National Front wins only 33.9% of the vote in the French presidential election. There's no reason to believe in British exceptionalism. Given a charismatic leader either inside or outside the Tory party, the right will clamber out of its shallow grave to blame everyone else for the consequences of its dogmatism.\n\nFor even the most blinkered must be realising that Brexit is looking absurd. Until 2021 there will still be free movement with the EU, Britain will have to accept the judgments of the European court and implement EU laws, the only difference being we will have no say in the laws' content. Even after the transition period is over, exporters will still meet EU standards because they will want to trade with the continent, and farmers and the protesting fishermen will have to cut a deal if they want to sell their produce. As for immigration, business and the public sector will tell the government that every enterprise from care homes to restaurant chains will collapse if it closes the borders.\n\nI don't want to lay the flattery on with a trowel but Jacob Rees-Mogg isn't always the drivel-spouting dullard he appears. When he says Britain risks becoming a \"vassal state\" of the EU after 2019 he's right, but he cannot draw the obvious conclusion that we shouldn't leave. Nor can millions of others because of a failure by progressive opinion to argue respectfully with them.\n\nFor some, the failure is an act of policy. A faction among Labour MPs and commentators announces they are respecting the voters' wishes, even though they realise leaving the single market will harm the poorest parts of Britain. (They then stand back as if expecting a round of applause for their bravery.) The rightwing press makes too much of them, but there are undoubtedly also liberals who think supporters of Brexit are just stupid racists, and there is no point arguing with them.\n\nIn any political battle, you should always ask how far you can compromise without selling your soul. The right cannot be stopped now or in future unless a portion of its supporters are offered reasons to change their minds. Few are forthcoming from the liberal-left. The dominant leftish explanation for working-class support for leave is it was a protest by the people left behind by Thatcherism. As leftists hated Thatcher, this is the worst type of self-indulgent reasoning: the argument that proves you have been right all along.\n\nThe liberal-left does not try to understand harder reasons behind Brexit and grapple with working-class patriotism, fears about immigration and political correctness, and the yearning for strong government and national security. Perhaps progressives can never assuage these passions without becoming reactionaries themselves, but they could try. If not, there should at least be a campaign to explain to leave voters how they have been deceived.\n\nHere we run into an under-discussed problem. Without the support of the official opposition, efforts to hold the right to account will be puny. That Jeremy Corbyn and the British far left are anti-EU has been of the utmost importance. They have not pounded away at the lies the left-behind were fed, and tried to provoke a class that is hugely suspicious of politicians to turn on Farage and Johnson for taking them for fools. Silence can be the most effective form of complicity. Because the Labour leadership stays silent, the Brexit right can revive, regain the trust of the men and women it shamefully misled and win the next battle.\n\n*Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

                "body": "The battle of the Brexiters has resurfaced in revelations over the use of campaign funds\n\nAcrimony, distrust and recrimination have ravaged the battle over Brexit since the summer of 2016. Yet in the run-up to the EU referendum, the same toxic atmosphere characterised the relationship between some of the groups campaigning to secure Britain's EU exit.\n\nVote Leave. Leave.EU. Grassroots Out. Labour Leave. BeLeave. There was seemingly a pro-Brexit group for every occasion. The constant warring meant that they often appeared to be engaged in comic levels of factual infighting worthy of a Monty Python sketch. Leaving the EU was about the only thing they could agree on, but some now credit the fact that the groups were aiming at different groups of voters with helping to secure the shock result.\n\nThe two main groups were Vote Leave, which eventually went on to win the support of the Brexiters in David Cameron's cabinet, and Leave.EU, backed by prominent Ukip figures. The former was headed by lobbyist Matthew Elliott and Michael Gove's former special adviser Dominic Cummings. The latter was bankrolled by Ukip donor Arron Banks.\n\nThere was no love lost between the groups. At one point, Banks said that Elliott and Cummings were \"two of the nastiest individuals I have ever had the misfortune to meet\" and that he \"wouldn't put them in charge of the local sweet shop\".\n\nThe increasingly bitter dispute was not just down to the big personalities involved. There was also a major prize at stake - the race to become the official \"Leave\" campaign group. The winner would gain greater spending powers and media time. Official organisations were granted up to £600,000, campaign broadcasts and free mailing. They were also allowed to spend up to £7m, instead of the £700,000 limit that applied to other registered campaign groups in the run-up to the referendum.\n\nThe acrimony caused splits within political parties. While Nigel Farage was an early backer of Leave.EU, Ukip's only MP at the time, Douglas Carswell, backed Vote Leave. There were even reports of staff in Vote Leave headquarters shredding documents for fear that they were being spied upon by their pro-Brexit rivals. Banks has gone on record that he ordered a private detective to follow Elliott.\n\nThe strategic differences were clear. Vote Leave initially wanted to run an economy-focused campaign capable of winning over those considering voting for Brexit, but concerned about the consequences. The group soon identified that its most successful message was the pledge to use money currently sent to Brussels to fund the NHS. Meanwhile, Leave.EU would release starker, more rightwing messages designed to appeal to Ukip voters and ensure that staunch Leavers cast their vote. Immigration was their key battleground.\n\nThere was also internal strife at Vote Leave. Some Labour and Green supporters left the group, denting its cross-party credentials. The Labour Leave group was at one time a supporter of Vote Leave, but leading members eventually broke away to campaign independently.\n\nWith the infighting at its peak, some figures - including Farage and some Tory MPs - eventually threw their weight behind another organisation, Grassroots Out. The group's garish green ties became a feature in the Commons. One of its rallies saw the unlikely speaking lineup of Farage, Labour MP Kate Hoey and former Respect MP George Galloway. As the referendum progressed, Leave.EU threw its weight behind the grassroots movement in a failed attempt to become the official pro-Brexit campaign. And if all that wasn't confusing enough, there was also BeLeave.,\n\nNow the confusion that characterised the campaign groups has resurfaced, and questions are being asked about the precise nature of the relationship between them - and how they used the funds they received.",

                "body": "Role of remote data affiliate raises questions over relationship between Brexit groups\n\nCambridge Analytica has undisclosed links to the Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ that played a pivotal role in the official Vote Leave campaign in 2016, which was headed by the environment secretary Michael Gove and the foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the Observer has learned.\n\nChristopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, has revealed that as well as playing a part in setting up the firm - which is now facing increasing scrutiny from investigators on both sides of the Atlantic over its role in harvesting Facebook data - he was also a central figure in setting up AIQ, which accounted for 40% of Vote Leave's campaign budget.\n\nThe Observer first disclosed connections between the firms a year ago when it published details of an intellectual property licence that linked AIQ and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIn public, the official Leave campaign and Nigel Farage's Leave.EU campaign were quite separate and appeared hostile to each other. But the connections between the two data firms raise fresh questions about possible overlaps between the two campaigns.\n\nWylie said that, in 2016, the relationship went far beyond that. Although AIQ and Cambridge Analytica appeared separate, the two were bound by a skein of threads so intimate that some Cambridge Analytica staff referred to the Canadian data firm as a \"department\" within the company. Wylie said that the two businesses shared the same underlying technology.\n\n\"AIQ wouldn't exist without me,\" he said. \"When I became research director for SCL [the parent company of Cambridge Analytica] we needed to rapidly expand our technical capacity and I reached out to a lot of people I had worked with in the past.\"\n\nThat included Jeff Silvester, his former boss, who lived in Wylie's home town - Victoria in British Columbia. Wylie suggested Silvester should work for the firm in London. \"But he had just had a family and wasn't keen to go on London,\" he said.\n\nThe Observer has seen an email from 11 August 2013 that Wylie sent to Silvester about SCL. \"We mostly do psychological warfare work for Nato,\" he said. \"But a lot of projects involve a socio-political element.\"\n\nSilvester replied: \"You need a Canadian office.\"\n\nHe then set up AIQ with his business partner, Zack Massingham, to work on SCL and later Cambridge Analytica projects. \"Essentially it was set up as a Canadian entity for people who wanted to work on SCL projects who didn't want to move to London. That's how AIQ got started: originally to service SCL and Cambridge Analytica projects,\" said Wylie.\n\nLast March, when the Observer started asking questions about the connection between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ, the former removed \"SCL Canada\" and Massingham's phone number from its website and said that AIQ was a \"former IT contractor\".\n\nCambridge Analytica is already under scrutiny for its work for Farage's Leave.EU campaign, and AIQ is also involved in an investigation by the Electoral Commission into Vote Leave.\n\nOn Saturday the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham said that \"AggregateIQ has not been especially co-operative with our investigation. We are taking further steps in that matter.\"\n\nThe mystery of how Vote Leave even found AIQ, a firm with just 20 staff that operated 2,300 miles away out of a cramped office above an opticians in the provincial Canadian city of Victoria, was raised by the Observer last May.\n\nDom Cummings, the chief strategist for Vote Leave, told this newspaper that he found the firm \"on the internet\". But cached searches show that AIQ had no internet presence at that time and a new source within Vote Leave has now come forward to say that Cummings had full knowledge of the connections between the two firms.\n\n\"The idea that Dom had no idea of AIQ's connection to Cambridge Analytica is complete bullshit,\" said the source. \"It was a former Cambridge Analytica employee who made the introduction. He knew exactly how the two companies operated together. He knew they'd worked together on the [former candidate for the Republican nomination for president] Ted Cruz campaign and that they shared the same underlying technology,\" said the source.\n\nBut Cummings told this newspaper yesterday: \"Vote Leave data never went anywhere near Cambridge Analytica and your repeated attempts to show that Vote Leave and Cambridge Analytica were somehow secretly coordinating is not just without foundation but the opposite of the truth.\"\n\nUntil 2016, AIQ had no clients other than Cambridge Analytica. The lack of a website, Wylie claims, was because at the time of the referendum it was operating almost as \"an internal department of Cambridge Analytica. It didn't have a website and no contact number. The only public contact number was SCL's website.\" However, AIQ says it has had a website since it was founded in 2013.\n\nWylie said that AIQ managed Cambridge Analytica's technology platform - Ripon - and its databases. \"Because AIQ was operating internally, almost as a department of Cambridge Analytica, it didn't have a website and no contact number. The only public contact number was SCL's website,\" said Wylie.\n\nHe said AIQ also had its intellectual property owned by Cambridge Analytica. \"AIQ often traded as SCL Canada for ages and although a technically separate company, the IP [intellectual property] was retained by Cambridge Analytica and SCL.\n\n\"They were the ones that took a lot of data that Cambridge Analytica would acquire and the algorithms they build and translated that into the actual physical targeting online, they [AIQ] were the bit that actually disseminated stuff. AIQ managed the Ripon platform, which is Cambridge Analytica's platform, and built a lot of the tech that would connect the algorithms to social and online advertising networks.\"\n\nWylie claims that the two entities, certainly during the time of the referendum campaign, were operating closely. \"Among internal CA staff AIQ was referred to as 'our Canadian office'. They were treated as a department within the company,\" he said.\n\nCummings would later say: \"Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn't have done it without them.\" His quote, emblazoned on the AIQ website for more than a year, disappeared on Thursday.\n\nSilvester said that Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with AIQ during the referendum campaign. \"AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign. Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.\"\n\nHe added: \"AggregateIQ has always been 100% Canadian owned and operated.\"",

                "body": "Keir Starmer plans to force government to enshrine into law a promise not to have infrastructure on Republic-Northern Ireland border\n\nLabour is seeking to build cross-party consensus in parliament behind plans that will enshrine into law a promise not to have any infrastructure, customs posts or cameras on the border of Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit.\n\nThe plan, which will be announced on Sunday by shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer would force the government to honour what is to date only a political commitment to avoid a hard border solution, once the UK leaves the EU in a year's time.\n\nIn an interview with the Observer, Starmer said: \"At the end of last year, the EU and UK government made a political agreement that there would be no hard border in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"However, the content of the withdrawal agreement is not legally binding. It is a political document subject to negotiation and will not have legal force unless and until it is ratified - which is by no means a done deal.\"\n\nThe move represents another headache for Theresa May as the Withdrawal Bill and other Brexit legislation struggle to make their way through parliament.\n\nLabour's attempt to work with other parties reflects a genuine fear that negotiations on Brexit could flounder on the border issues, leaving the future of cross border trade in doubt. Any prospect of a hard border is also likely to have politically destabilising effect.\n\nThe government is also facing defeats in the Lords, and then knife-edge battles in the Commons, on issues such as membership of the customs union and single market, on which amendments are also likely to be passed in the upper house after Easter.\n\nStarmer said that there had been signs that the government had been backsliding on its commitment to having no infrastructure on the border because it could not find another solution, other than remaining in a customs union, which Tory MPs will not accept.\n\nAs a result, it was vital to hold it to its word to prevent what would be disastrous economic and political outcome and a threat to peace. \"The point has now come where it is so serious that we have to enshrine this in law.\"\n\nWhile senior Tory MPs support the Labour move as a policy, they says the best chance of success would be if such a motion were jointly tabled by members of all parties, and not just Labour.\n\n\"You need to do this on a cross-party basis,\" said one prominent Labour MP. \"Tory MPs will be reluctant to defeat the government by backing a Labour amendment. They would not do it because they would be accused of working to put Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street.\"\n\nWhile the EU signed off last week on plans for a 21-month transition period after Brexit day on 29 March next year - during which we will remain effectively in the EU - the main sticking point on a final deal remains the unsolved problem of the Irish border. If there is not final deal, there will also be no transition deal.\n\nTheresa May has said there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But she has come up with no clear or convincing plan about how to prevent the flow of goods from northern Ireland into the Republic and vice versa, once the UK is outside the customs union and single market.\n\nStarmer added: \"I have not yet met anybody credible in Northern Ireland or the rest of the EU who thinks that there is a solution without us being in a customs union with the rest of the EU.\"",

                "body": "Vote Leave didn't know how to reach liberal Eurosceptics. But Darren Grimes and his friends, with their witty internet adverts, could do just that\n\nThe handful of teens and twenty-somethings who made up BeLeave seemed an unlikely group to attract the attention of Britain's most powerful Brexiters, but long before they got a large, controversial donation from Vote Leave they had made their way to the heart of the official campaign.\n\nAll politically inexperienced volunteers, they were welcomed into the team backed by Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, mostly because of the demographic they promised to reach.\n\nIt was Darren Grimes, then a 23-year-old fashion student from County Durham, who set up the youth group. A Liberal Democrat member with a talent for graphic design and social media marketing, he had an approach that was rare among the groups campaigning for Brexit.\n\nBeLeave messages targeted a group generally inclined towards Remain - young, diverse and progressive voters - who the senior campaigners at the official Vote Leave campaign thought would be both hard to win over and critical to any victory. \"Vote Leave understood that they couldn't win the referendum if they specifically targeted angry Ukippers. They knew that they needed to target young liberals,\" said the group's treasurer turned whistleblower Shahmir Sanni.\n\n\"They needed to target Green party members that didn't like the EU's environmental laws, or liberal Eurosceptics like me that did hold fiscally conservative values but were socially liberal and understood the EU didn't support everyone, that it only benefited Europeans.\"\n\nWhen Sanni joined the BeLeave team, it had already become extraordinarily successful in appealing to liberal and leftwing supporters on Facebook and other social media, using videos and other messaging that often appeared to be the exact opposite of the largest Vote Leave and LeaveEU campaigns.\n\nInstead of bleak scaremongering about immigration, most notoriously Nigel Farage's \"Breaking Point\" poster, their adverts were pro-migration, feminist and witty. One campaign questioned why holders of EU passports could come freely to the UK while Commonwealth citizens could not. Others attacked the EU for policies it claimed \"have driven African farmers into poverty\", and made it impossible for Britain to abolish the \"tampon tax\". A fourth warned that EU penalties could make Netflix streaming more expensive.\n\nTheir positions stood out, even amid the patchwork of pro-Brexit groups, and Vote Leave realised BeLeave could prove useful as it battled for designation as the official campaign against the Arron Banks- and Farage-backed Leave.EU. Needing to show a broad spectrum of support, it listed the youth group in its application, among a range of independent \"outreach groups\" claimed to be backing Vote Leave.\n\nYet at the time BeLeave worked out of Vote Leave headquarters, under its guidance and support. Although it had its own website, it appears to have been co-ordinated and paid for by the Vote Leave head of outreach Cleo Watson. \"You deserve a brilliant site and this is so annoying,\" Watson, now a political adviser to the prime minister, wrote to Grimes when development of the group's site hit a glitch. \"Will troubleshoot this asap.\"\n\nWatson said: \"I absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me, including the allegation that I co-ordinated and paid for the BeLeave website\". She added: \"To imply being supportive of their work was to have any kind of control over their activities is absolutely untrue and deliberately misleading.\"\n\nBut in the final weeks before the referendum, as Vote Leave neared its spending limit of £7m, senior directors suggested to BeLeave that, if they set up as a separate campaign, they would receive a donation to spend on their own advertisements.\n\nPreparing for meetings with prospective donors - and unaware that they were working beside the people who were planning to support them - the team drew up a pitch for funds. Even their highest hopes were well below the eventual donation. \"On our proposal we wrote £10,000 would get you this much engagement on Facebook, and if you gave us £100,000 this is how much engagement we'd get,\" Sanni said. \"We were putting it there just in case.\"\n\nThey pointed out that their Facebook posts were engaging more people - to share, comment or like - than most paid advertisements by political campaigns. One video reached 41,000 people in one day without any paid promotion. \"With funding, we could triple this amount,\" their pitch said.\n\nShortly afterwards Vote Leave drew up legal documents allowing BeLeave to create a bank account so that it could accept donations of its own. \"Following our discussion I attach a typed-up first draft of the constitution,\" Vote Leave's legal director said in an email to Grimes in May, with Watson copied in.\n\nHe told Sanni, BeLeave's secretary and treasurer, to set up a bank account. Then Vote Leave revealed to the astonished young team that they would be getting a donation of more than £600,000. \"To be at that age and to find out that my organisation, that the work that I've done, has received funding of almost £1m, I was elated,\" Sanni said. \"It was amazing.\"\n\nThe donation never made it into the bank account. The money would be passed directly to AggregateIQ - Vote Leave's data analytics firm - in its name, without ever coming under even nominal control of BeLeave.\n\n\"The first thing I said to Darren was, 'Well, OK, can I get my train tickets paid for?',\" remembers Sanni. But Grimes made clear that he had no control over even small amounts.\n\nThe BeLeave team were allegedly not warned of potential implications. \"If I am being advised by ... a compliance lawyer for Vote Leave, I have no reason to think anything is wrong,\" Sanni said. Vote Leave has denied any suggestion it co-ordinated with BeLeave.\n\nWhen the size of the donation drew scrutiny from the Electoral Commission, Grimes said he found AIQ on the internet and was so impressed he decided to blow his budget on its marketing. But cached data shows that, at the time, AIQ did not have a website. AIQ says it had a website since it was founded in 2013.\n\nGrimes knew about the firm because of its work with Vote Leave, whose director and other employees sat at desks near his own in the campaign HQ, where BeLeave's work, whether in messaging or as a conduit for funds, was highly appreciated. \"Everyone knew who Darren was,\" Sanni says. \"Everybody congratulated us and knew what role we'd played. He knew exactly how important we'd been. He's a close friend of Dom Cummings [the Vote Leave strategist]. Of course he knew. Boris Johnson knew. Everybody knew.\"\n\nGrimes denied to the Observer that there was any collaboration with Vote Leave on campaign material or spending.",

On the evidence of this slow-paced encounter, it is nowhere near enough.\n\nEvery round of the Premiership supplies evidence that the club game, lacking the fluidity, pace and intensity Jones believes will be required to have a chance of winning the World Cup, is not serving England. It was not set up to, as the Saracens chairman, Nigel Wray, who has been involved since the beginning of professionalism, reminded those who read his programme notes.\n\n\"I can see a time when people, as in football, are more interested in the club they see every week than they are in the national side when they can't anyway get tickets to watch them at Twickenham,\" said Wray who pointed out that the extra load on players had come through the increase in the number of Test fixtures. \"What is absolutely clear is that Premiership Rugby will as a body have to be the leading party to the future development of the game.\"\n\nWray scoffed at the notion of central contracts, pointing out that at the rate England called up players, the cash-rich union would soon find itself stretched. His point about potential spectator alienation has not been lost on the Rugby Football Union which intends to play one international a year away from Twickenham, but despite the agreement between the clubs and the union, their games continue to run on parallel lines.\n\nThere was little for Jones to take from a match that even before it started showed how the club game had advanced in the last 23 years: commercially. Neither side played in its traditional jersey, the ground was a football stadium, hired because Wembley was unavailable, and the majority of the crowd were not Premiership regulars and were hushed for long periods with the slow pace of the game only occasionally quickening.\n\nMaro Itoje stirred himself. The second row reacted to suggestions that he had looked tired during the Six Nations by lying down and pretending to be asleep after scoring Saracens' second try. Little had appeared to be on when Sarries moved the ball from a scrum that had been cleverly won by Liam Williams who took out Tim Visser in the air while getting a hand to the ball, but Itoje clattered through James Chisholm's challenge before leaving James Horwill wondering what had run over him.\n\nTackling was not the strongest part of Harlequins' game, if they had one. Kyle Sinckler's attempt to halt Sean Maitland after nine minutes was especially feeble and the prop was equally ineffective trying to halt another back, Alex Goode, later. That did not cost his side, but Maitland, who had come into midfield from his wing near halfway, got to within 20 metres of the opposition line.\n\nHe rejoined the heavy traffic to ensure there was space on the open-side which Saracens exploited to send in Williams who extended his side's lead to 10 points after Alex Lozowski's early penalty. Quins eventually stirred, taking polar through endless phases without varying their approach. Were Itoje and his England colleagues tired or bored with the repetitive nature of training and playing?\n\nTwo Demetri Catrakilis penalties on another day when contesting for possession at the breakdown was given little latitude by the referee cut the lead before Itoje's try and Lozowski's second kick gave Saracens an 18-6 half-time lead. Quins showed a hint of dynamism after the break, sparked by Marcus Smith, a replacement for the injured Catrakilis.\n\nA jinking Smith break, finding space where none appeared to exist, established the platform from which James Horwill scored, but his clearance kick from the restart was charged down by Nick Isiekwe and when Visser went off his feet at a ruck, Lozowski restored the lead to 10 points again. It stayed that way until two minutes from the end when, with Max Malins in the sin-bin, Saracens had the final word through the boot of their outside-half but their voice will need to be louder when they face Leinster in the Champions Cup on Sunday.",

                "title": "Brexit insider claims Vote Leave team may have breached spending limits",
                "body": "A whistleblower who worked for the official Vote Leave campaign has broken cover to raise concerns that the masterminds behind the 2016 vote - including key figures now working for Theresa May in Downing Street - may have flouted referendum spending rules and then attempted to destroy evidence.\n\nThe allegations, from former volunteer Shahmir Sanni, are detailed in an interview in the Observer and supported by a mass of documents and files that he has passed to the Electoral Commission and the police.\n\nSanni's central claim concerns a donation of £625,000 that Vote Leave ostensibly made to an independent referendum campaign organisation called BeLeave. He claims the money, channelled to a digital services firm linked to the controversial Cambridge Analytica firm, violated election rules because it was not a genuine donation.\n\nThe money was registered by BeLeave with election authorities as a donation from Vote Leave to an independent youth operation. Sanni says BeLeave shared offices with Vote Leave - fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove - which in practice offered advice and assistance to the group and helped them to decide where their cash would be spent.\n\nElectoral law prohibits co-ordination between different campaign organisations, which must all comply with spending limits. If they plan tactics or co-ordinate together, they must have a shared cap on spending. Vote Leave strongly denies any such co-ordination.\n\nSanni says that after the commission opened an investigation last March, Victoria Woodcock, the operations director for Vote Leave, deleted herself, campaign director Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave's digital director, Henry de Zoete, from dozens of files on the drive Vote Leave shared with BeLeave to hide the fact of co-ordination. On a blog post on Friday, Cummings said this was \"factually wrong and libellous\". Vote Leave say staff acted \"ethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data\".\n\nMost of the £625,000 donation went to a Canadian data company called AggregateIQ, which has links to Cambridge Analytica, the firm that used harvested Facebook data to build a political targeting system in the US. Christopher Wylie, the former CA employee turned whistleblower, said that at the time of the referendum, the Canadian firm was operating \"almost as an internal department of Cambridge Analytica\".\n\nAIQ would eventually soak up about a third of all Vote Leave's official spending, receiving £2.7m from the group in addition to the money that came via BeLeave. The firm also received £100,000 from Veterans for Britain and £32,750 from the DUP. After the referendum, Cummings stated on AIQ's website: \"Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of Aggregate IQ. We couldn't have done it without them.\"\n\nOther senior figures in Vote Leave included Stephen Parkinson, now Theresa May's chief adviser. Parkinson said in a statement: \"I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups. I had no responsibility for digital campaigning or donations during the referendum and am confident that Vote Leave acted entirely within the law and strict spending rules at all times\".\n\nSanni, who was treasurer and secretary of BeLeave at 22, is still a committed Eurosceptic and works for Matthew Elliott today at his TaxPayers 'Alliance campaign group. He says he decided to go public because he did not want Brexit to be tainted by possibly illegal activities.\n\nHe was also alarmed by the fact that his friend, Darren Grimes, the former head of the BeLeave youth group, is a focus of an Electoral Commission investigation into breaches of spending limits.\n\nSanni said Vote Leave \"didn't really give us that money. They just pretended to. We had no control over it.\"\n\nHe believes Vote Leave's senior officials may have taken advantage of the group's youth and the political inexperience of Grimes to ramp up their own spending. He emphasises BeLeave was a small Brexit-supporting outreach group run by twenty-somethings with no real experience or background in campaigning or finance.\n\nHe says that it was helped by Vote Leave staff to set up its own constitution and bank account so that it could accept donations of its own. Vote Leave's lawyers did the legal documentation, he said.\n\n\"We were advised every step of the way by Vote Leave's lawyers. They told us what to do and where to sign.\"\n\nThe payment to AIQ was ostensibly made by BeLeave as the referendum campaign drew to a close. But Sanni claims BeLeave didn't have any choice about where the cash would be spent, didn't sign a contract with AIQ, and did not direct what the data firm did with the funds. The money never even passed through the group's own bank account.\n\n\"There was no contract in front of me, as treasurer and secretary,\" Sanni said. \"I didn't see any contract.\" This process was repeated with a further £50,000, from an outside donor.\n\nVote Leave said: \"It was Darren's decision to hire AIQ, agreed with and confirmed by Shamir Sanni.\"\n\nVenner Shipley, Vote Leave's lawyers, said: \"We have never been instructed by, nor have we ever provided advice to BeLeave.\"\n\nSanni has shared emails with the Observer and the authorities which appear to show the young campaigners seeking advice from top Vote Leave figures, an invoice to VoteLeave covering work on the BeLeave campaign and messages from Vote Leave lawyers and accountants about the practicalities of establishing it as an independent group.\n\nSanni explained that Vote Leave also set up and managed a shared BeLeave computer drive with the youth campaign's messaging, information and other documents.\n\nThe emails reveal other senior figures were in regular contact with BeLeave. Cleo Watson, who was head of outreach for Vote Leave and is now a political adviser alongside Parkinson in Downing street, was in touch with the organisation and was a member of a closed Facebook group for BeLeave contributors. In a statement to the Observer, Watson said: \"I absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.\"\n\nThis weekend Parkinson was at the centre of a political storm after revealing in a statement delivered without Sanni's consent that they dated each other for a year and a half, including the period when Parkinson was at Vote Leave and Sanni worked as a volunteer.\n\nParkinson said he only gave Sanni advice and guidance in the context of that relationship. In a statement released on Friday night, lawyers for Sanni said: \"We believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone. My client is now having to come out to his mother and family ... and members of his family are being forced to take urgent protective measures to ensure their safety.\"\n\nIn one email to Vote Leave's lawyer, Watson acknowledged that BeLeave did not have the experience needed to handle the funds that would be spent in their name, stating: \"Darren and the rest of the group (all between 18 & 22) don't feel comfortable handling the money side of things, having no experience beyond their student loans.\"\n\nIn a statement to the Observer, Watson said: \"To imply that being supportive of their work was to have any kind of control over their activities is absolutely untrue.\"\n\nWoodcock, the operations director for Vote Leave, has been described by Cummings as \"the most indispensible person in the campaign\". The documents provided by Sanni suggest that after the Information Commissioner's Office last year announced an inquiry into how the different campaigns used personal data, she deleted key Vote Leave names, including her own, from dozens of files on the shared BeLeave drive.\n\nWoodcock told the Observer yesterday: 'The gist of those allegations is that I knowingly and deliberately deleted evidence which would be relevant to an investigation in an attempt to frustrate it. I believe that is untrue and completely unsupported by the evidence.\"\n\nCummings said: \"The allegations about illegal donations to BeLeave are false and are part of a campaign to cancel the referendum result.\"\n\nFurther evidence of contact between senior figures at Vote Leave and BeLeave during the referendum came in a witness statement from Elliott, the campaign chief, which was submitted to the High Court on March 13, 2018 as part of a judicial review.\n\n\"I can confirm distinct campaigns were run,\" Elliot says, who added that he was including some examples of BeLeave publicity work to help clarify details. \"I thought it may assist the Court in having examples of the campaign material used by the different campaigns and I attach those.\"\n\nA photograph attached shows a group of young people - including Grimes - beneath the BeLeave logo. But emails detail how on March 18, 2016, it was Cleo Watson who organised that photoshoot. In another email from March 22, it was Stephen Parkinson who signed off on the logo.\n\nn February 2016, a leaked email from prominent Brexit supporter, Steve Baker, now a junior minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, floated the idea of creating \"separate legal entities each of which could spend £700,000\".\n\nSanni believes this is exactly what happened with BeLeave. \"Throughout this whole process Darren and I were victims to very intelligent people trying to find ways to overspend.\" Sanni said. He described Grimes as a 'fall guy'.\n\nGrimes denied to the Observer that there was any collaboration with Vote Leave on campaign material or spending, and threatened legal action.",

                "title": "Democracy dies without transparency and fairness  | Observer editorial",
                "body": "Our new exposé raises issues that should concern those who believe in open and transparent democracy\n\nThe concept of democracy is based on high principle, refined by centuries of political theory. But democracy is at its most observable in the processes required to sustain it; the everyday - and sometimes mundane - safeguards needed to protect free and fair elections, freedom of speech and association, and minority rights. The Observer's report last week on how Cambridge Analytica used data harvested from millions of Facebook profiles to influence voter behaviour posed new questions about how those democratic processes can be protected in a new information age, in which data, not just money, is the powerful currency that determines whether elections are won or lost. Closer to home, our new exposé by Carole Cadwalladr this week features allegations that Vote Leave may have manipulated electoral law to get around the spending limits set by the Electoral Commission for the EU referendum.\n\nAccording to whistleblower Shahmir Sanni, Vote Leave channelled £625,000 via a youth campaign he worked on, BeLeave, to the data analytics firm AggregateIQ. Sanni alleges BeLeave was not the separate, independent organisation Vote Leave claims. Sanni explained that it shared an office and, as he recalls, was effectively under its control. Such activity, if true, may amount to co-ordination under electoral law, and require Vote Leave to declare its spending as an expense.\n\nSanni has also given evidence to the Electoral Commission showing that the names of Vote Leave's directors - including those currently working as advisers in No 10 - were deleted from BeLeave Google documents shortly after the information commissioner launched an inquiry last year into how the referendum campaigns used personal data, though AggregateIQ has downplayed this.\n\nA common thread runs through these stories. It is already established that AggregateIQ is linked to Cambridge Analytica through IP agreements; this weekend, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleges that the links between the two go much deeper, such that their activities became confused. But both stories also shine a light on the extent to which our electoral law, with its 19th-century roots, is unfit for purpose in this modern age.\n\nBritish electoral law is based on two principles. First, that elections should achieve a level playing field in terms of resource; parties and candidates face national and local spending limits. Second, that elections should be conducted under conditions of openness and transparency: candidates have to be transparent about the material they are using to communicate with voters, and it is illegal to make false claims in that material.\n\nOur reporting shows the extent to which the modern realities of electioneering are putting these principles under strain. The system relies heavily on parties self-reporting their spending, and the fact that campaigning material has, on the whole, been openly available; try keeping a controversial or misleading leaflet sent to thousands of voters out of the public eye.\n\nThe ability to spend large sums on micro-targeted advertising based on revealing data harvested from voters' social media profile removes much of that transparency. If the material in question goes unseen by the vast majority of voters, it becomes harder to track exactly what a party is putting out, so easier to put out false claims, and for spending to go undeclared, particularly when the money is channelled through little-known intermediaries. Social media platforms are overtaking the national and local press as the channels through which politicians communicate with voters, but they perform that function without the same level of scrutiny, regardless of their own ideological or business interests. Anomalies abound. Broadcast advertising is banned; yet advertising on YouTube - where videos can garner more viewers than primetime television - is unlimited so long as it is within spending limits.\n\nBut this goes beyond the regulation of democratic processes, to the very nature of democracy itself. Public deliberation and debate are the lifeblood of a healthy, functioning democracy: this manifests itself in parties that run campaigns with broad appeal; in wide-ranging, public platforms that provide a basis on which voters can hold governments to account.\n\nThe trend towards micro-targeting risks moving us further away from the democracy of the public forum, towards a fractured, individualised democracy in which \"swing voters\" are targeted based on narrow issues, using false claims or under-the-radar dog-whistling that are not subjected to public scrutiny. Meanwhile, voters seen as already decided, or insignificant to the result, go ignored.\n\nWe don't know how effective Cambridge Analytica's efforts were at changing voters' minds. We don't know whether the extra spending Vote Leave channelled via BeLeave helped swing the referendum result. Clearly, the poll revealed deep schisms within Britain, fuelled by discontent with the status quo among the electorate. Those sentiments were not manufactured by malevolent actors deploying subterfuge.\n\nThe Observer has made no secret of its belief that Brexit is not in the national interest. But asking questions about transparency and fairness is driven not by a partisan wish to overturn a referendum result, but the desire for a critical debate about whether our electoral laws, and ultimately our democracy, remain fit for purpose. Left or right; remain or leave: this debate concerns democrats from all political traditions.",

Lewis Page smashed a 22-yard half volley to give Charlton the lead in just the third minute. Michael Zyro doubled Charlton's advantage when he steered a near post header in. A Stefan Payne strike for Shrewsbury against AFC Wimbledon was enough to send the Shropshire side top of the league. Payne missed the original chance in the 54th minute, but after the ball bounced around in the area, he was able to poke home at the second attempt to secure a 1-0 win. Bottom-placed Bury are one step closer to relegation after falling to a 2-0 home defeat against Wigan, helping Paul Cook's team leapfrog Blackburn Rovers into the automatic promotion places. The visitors scored with their first shot on target, when Michael Jacobs crossed into the box and Nick Powell netted from six yards. For the second Max Power directed a free-kick towards Cheyenne Dunkley at the back post, allowing the defender to power a header into the net. Scunthorpe and Rochdale shared the points after a 1-1 draw at Glanford Park. Callum Camps hit a long-range shot into the corner after Scunthorpe failed to clear a corner. Striker Ivan Toney equalised in the 51st minute after a cross was headed back into his path. In a key relegation tussle Fleetwood saw off Northampton 2-0 as Kyle Dempsey finished after an intelligent pass from Toumani Diagouraga, before Cian Bolger completed the scoring late on. Simon Grayson picked up his first win since becoming Bradford City manager as Dominic Poleon's goal was enough to down Gillingham 1-0.\n\nLeague One results: Bradford 1-0 Gillingham, Bury 0-2 Wigan, Charlton 2-0 Plymouth, Fleetwood 2-0 Northampton, MK Dons 0-0 Blackpool, Peterborough 1-1 Bristol Rovers, Scunthorpe 1-1 Rochdale, Shrewsbury 1-0 AFC Wimbledon, Southend 2-0 Rotherham.\n\nLeague Two Forest Green boosted their survival hopes by defeating promotion-chasing Mansfield 2-0 at The New Lawn. Reuben Reid took advantage of Mansfield's inability to clear by powerfully finishing from inside the area in the 54th minute. Dayle Grubb finished off a fine personal performance by cutting in and scoring the second with a composed finish to leave his team nine points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nExeter moved up to fifth by beating Swindon Town 3-1. Kaiyne Woolery opened the scoring for Swindon after the ball dropped at his feet in the box, allowing him to score from eight yards. Jake Taylor levelled things up when he smashed home a cross from Hiram Boateng, before Dean Moxey was fouled in the box, resulting in Pierce Sweeney converting from the spot. Despite pressure from Swindon, Jayden Stockley confirmed the win by sweeping home from eight yards with three minutes to go. A Marc McNulty hat-trick helped Coventry City to a 4-0 win over Grimsby, who remain in 22nd place. Crewe have almost secured their place in the Football League for another season thanks to a 2-1 win on a bobbly Newport County pitch. Harry McKirdy and Jordan Bowery gave David Artell's team a two-goal lead and they held on despite Micky Demetriou pulling one back.\n\nEight goals were shared between Crawley and Cheltenham, as the latter earned a 5-3 victory.\n\nLeague Two results: Carlisle 1-1 Cambridge, Coventry 4-0 Grimsby, Crawley 3-5 Cheltenham, Exeter 3-1 Swindon, Forest Green 2-0 Mansfield, Morecambe 0-0 Lincoln, Newport 1-2 Crewe, Stevenage 0-1 Colchester, Wycombe 0-0 Port Vale",

Can you suggest something funny or inspiring or both, which is also a page-turner and well written, that is about the best of humanity, not the worst? Never without a book, I am in my early 60s, live in London, work on a website and want to feel more cheerful about the world. Anonymous\n\nA: Observer writer and critic Kate Kellaway\n\nHappiness, it is sometimes said, \"writes white\" - or even off-white. I agree there are too many books - especially novels - that are wilfully nihilistic and I am weary of books where the feel-bad factor prevails. For its healing beauty, Richard Mabey's Nature Cure would be my first stop - to recover equilibrium. It is his account of writing himself out of depression in a contemplation of Norfolk (may the county never be described as merely \"flat\" again). It is a quietly inspiring book and I cherish it.\n\nFor comedy, you cannot beat Michael Frayn's classic novel about Fleet Street, Towards the End of the Morning. His Fleet Street might be a thing of the past but the comedy of this book has not dimmed. I first read it at bedtime as a student frightened of sitting finals - it made me laugh and helped me sleep. And I have just finished reading The Mare by Mary Gaitskill about a girl from an abusive family (yes, I know - but hold on) who forms a relationship with a wayward mare and brings together, in a non-fairytale way, her turbulent mother and her good but struggling foster parents. It is a stirring, redemptive page-turner.",

                "title": "Kit de Waal: 'I read my first novel aged 22'",
                "body": "The novelist on her Irish heritage, the passing of time and why she's glad she didn't start young\n\nKit de Waal's bestselling debut novel, My Name Is Leon, was shortlisted for numerous awards, including the Desmond Elliott prize and the Costa first novel award. Born in Birmingham to an Irish mother and a Caribbean father, she worked in criminal and family law for 15 years before becoming a writer. Her new novel, The Trick to Time, is published by Viking on 29 March (£12.99).\n\nYour new novel is about a young couple of Irish immigrants in Birmingham, Mona and Will, and a tragedy that tears them apart. What came to you first: the characters or their heartbreaking situation?\n\nMona came first. Characters always do for me. It was getting to know her that gave me the story; it was driven by her identity and her history. I wanted to write something about my Irish heritage. I wanted to talk about my mother's generation moving here from Ireland and explore the dislocation they felt when they first came, how quickly they were assimilated into the culture while never actually becoming British. The Irish very much remain Irish wherever they are. My grandmother, honestly, you would never have thought she left the fields of Wexford.\n\nThe story is set at the time of the Birmingham pub bombings in 1974 amid much anti-Irish sentiment. Do you remember those negative feelings when you were growing up?\n\nCompletely. After the bombs there was a definite turning against the Irish, a massive suspicion, and this assumption that if you were Irish, you were pro-IRA. I kept very quiet about my background at that time. There had always been jokes about the Irish being stupid, but now people talked openly about the dirty Irish, the terrible Irish, how we were all terrorists, very much as some people speak about Muslims today.\n\nOne of the main themes in the book is ageing and the passing of time. How pressing are those issues for you?\n\nI am completely out of touch with how old I am. When I started writing Mona, who is a few days before her 60th birthday, I started writing her as an old woman. And then I thought, what am I doing? I'm 57, she is only two years older than me, she is not an old lady. In my mind I'm 35. I don't feel at all grown up or mature. I don't feel like winding down. I feel like there's lots of life left to live.\n\nDo you think starting to write later in life has made you a better writer?\n\nYes. I know that if I had started writing at 20 I would have written shite. I was so full of it, I thought I knew it all. Everything would have been black and white, good or bad. The older I get, the more I realise that so few issues are black and white. I don't think I was very compassionate in my 20s either.\n\nSince publishing My Name Is Leon, you've become a vocal campaigner for more inclusivity in publishing. What drove you to speak out about this?\n\nIt was actually a throw-away comment that started it all off. I was interviewed by somebody just before Leon came out and I said I would really like to see more working-class writers. It seemed to strike a chord and afterwards I kept getting asked to talk about it and write about it and I was invited to make a Radio 4 documentary on the subject. But I didn't feel like I drove it at all. I'm very happy to be looked upon as an activist and a freedom fighter, but it's absolutely accidental. I'm not that nice and selfless.\n\nWhat books are on your bedside table at the moment?\n\nI'm currently judging the Orwell prize so there is a pile of 64 books and pieces of journalism - not all of them actually on the bedside table. I am getting an absolutely brilliant education in contemporary politics and I'm loving it. I feel like I've got a little more authority now when I start gobbing on about something.\n\nWhat is the last really great book that you read?\n\nI can think of three. The first is My Absolute Darling. It's brilliant and the guy that's written it [Gabriel Tallent] looks about 12. The second came out in the 60s, Whatever Happened to Interracial Love by Kathleen Collins. It's a series of short stories about interracial relationships, not necessarily sexual, and it is so good, she has such a light touch. It is very nuanced, subtle and powerful and all the better because it's not preachy. The third is Donal Ryan's new book, From a Low and Quiet Sea. It is vomit-inducing, it's so good.\n\nWhich other novelists and nonfiction writers working today do you admire?\n\nLaurie Penny - I had to read Bitch Doctrine for the Orwell prize and I really like that book. I like its fuck-off attitude, I like her controlled anger, I like that she's a young woman, bravely saying very intelligent, hard-hitting stuff about what she believes in. In fiction, I would say Sebastian Barry. I just love his writing. I think it is real and very rooted but it's so lyrical and poetic and just lovely. I'm really jealous of his work.\n\nDo you prefer to read on paper or on screen?\n\nI have got a Kindle and an iPad but I read books on them absolutely under duress. Otherwise, it is paperback every time and hardback if I can afford it, which is rare.\n\nWhat kind of reader were you as a child?\n\nI was not a reader as a child. We didn't have books in our house. We had the Bible, because my mother was a Jehovah's Witness, and we had my father's News of the World: two classics. I read at school but I never, ever read at home. I voluntarily read my first novel when I was 22 - Riotous Assembly by Tom Sharpe. After that, I spent my 20s and 30s working through the classics.\n\nWhat's the best book you have ever received as a present?\n\nIt wasn't exactly a book, it was a session with Ella Berthoud, who co-wrote The Novel Cure and is a bibliotherapist. You tell her what's going on in your life and she gives you a literary prescription to cure it. I did think it was bit bollocks at first, but it was actually really good. The books she prescribed - Jane Gardam, Anita Brookner, Elizabeth Taylor - were spot-on and I ended up confessing loads of stuff to her. It was a therapy session disguised as a chat about books.\n\nWhat book did you last put down without finishing?\n\nI don't know about not finishing, but there's only one book I've thrown across the room and that was North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell. Oh my God! It seemed to be all foreplay and nothing ever happened. I hated it.\n\nIs there a book or an author that you always return to?\n\nGraham Greene - I think his novels are so beautiful and clever. They are so slender compared with some contemporary novels, yet they pack in worlds.\n\nWhat do you plan to read next?\n\nWhile I was reading all those mostly male classics in the 80s and 90s I missed out on all the women's literary fiction that was being produced at that time by writers like Margaret Atwood, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker. So there are these big gaps in my reading history. I've seen the films, I watched The Handmaid's Tale recently and loved it, but I haven't read the literature and I feel there's some work to be done.\n\n* The Trick to Time by Kit de Waal is published by Viking (£12.99).

Eight hundred men of the Strategic Reserve are being recalled by telegram from Easter leave.\n\nLast night south-west Cornwall was trapped in a pincer of oil from the wrecked tanker Torrey Canyon. It was being swept ashore on beaches along 100 miles of coast. A spokesman at the Joint Services control centre at Plymouth said: \"Patches of sludge are coming ashore from St Ives to Mount's Bay. It is thick, black and horrible. Depending on the weather it could get worse and we must be prepared for anything.\"\n\nFive hundred troops, commandos and sailors joined the fight against the oil. Some, with firemen and council workers, sprayed the beaches with stirrup pumps. Others helped with spraying from boats.\n\nRAF launches sped across Mount's Bay spraying a crescent of oil 13 miles long and up to five miles wide. Patches of oil one and a half feet thick lay on top of the water off Penzance last night. An Army spokesman at Truro said the oil was so thick that spraying with detergent was unsuccessful and it would have to be removed by bulldozers when it was washed up on the beaches. People living a mile inland said they could smell the oil.\n\nNear the Lizard 27 ships sprayed the water. Small boats sailed from Newlyn as they were fitted with spraying gear. There were fears that if the tanker were raised from the reef more oil could pour from her, threatening the Scilly Isles, where Mr Wilson is on holiday. Fifteen soldiers were flown by helicopter to the Scillies to form a beach defence force.\n\nNews Report",

                "body": "The English game is languishing in its own inertia, apparently. Some people should watch it occasionally. This was an extraordinary encounter in a season that has had its fair share, however dispirited the national team may seem.\n\nHow London Irish are not playing as if similarly bereft is anyone's guess. Declan Kidney, supremo of Ireland's previous grand-slammers, assumed control at the Madejski for the first time and elicited from his new charges a performance of verve and, alas, futility. The Exiles were 17-0 up in the first quarter and scored two exhilarating tries in the fourth, only to come away with two bonus points. Their fate was more or less sealed already, but it seems terminally so now.\n\nGloucester were as mercurial as only they can be. A five-try win put them back in fourth place a while at least but should not conceal the wild fluctuations in their form during this 80 minutes, let alone the whole season. How they had to wake themselves, because Irish pummelled them the moment the game started.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise, so often does it happen, but the fillip a simple (or in this case quite radical) change of management seems to impart never ceases to surprise. It comes too late for Irish now, but Kidney's charges burst into this game as if they had everything to play for - not the least of which was a new coaching panel.\n\nTheir dominance of the opening quarter was so complete as to be almost unheard of in the Premiership, let alone by a side so far adrift at the bottom. They were no doubt helped by Gloucester reminding us they remain Gloucester, so brilliant when they want to be but flaky enough to be unrecognisable when they don't. \"Coach legs\" did not do justice to the torpor of their opening minutes.\n\nThat 17-0 lead was the least of Irish's deserts, as they tore into their visitors, Josh McNally driving through the latest unconvincing phalanx of defenders for their first try and the lively Piet van Zyl dummying through the fringes of a maul for the second. And all that before the 20-minute mark had been reached.\n\nFor all the excitement of the crowd, swollen by the belated celebrations for St Patrick's Day, the feeling remained sharp that this was far too early to consider this a home win, especially when the opposition are as capricious as Gloucester. Sure enough, Irish's lead was gone in a 10-minute blur before the break.\n\nThe visitors finally gained a foothold from a too-long Irish throw, and James Hanson was driven over between the posts. Five minutes later, a penalty to the corner preceded a Tom Marshall try. Three minutes later again, Gloucester hit their highest note yet, Marshall and Willi Heinz dazzling down the left before Lewis Ludlow crossed on the right. Irish were stunned to find themselves trailing by two.\n\nTheir decline continued after the break. They could make nothing of a brilliant run by Van Zyl, and two further Gloucester tries in the third quarter, both scored with a certain swagger, opened up a 16-point chasm. Mark Atkinson had just had a try disallowed for obstruction, when he dummied clean through for Gloucester's fourth, and it was his run that set up Marshall for a flamboyant dive into the corner for a 33-17 lead.\n\nWe should have known better than to think that was the end of it. Irish owned the final quarter, Theo Brophy Clews finishing smartly off an inside ball from Joe Cokanasiga with 15 minutes to go, before the burly winger crashed through three defenders on his way to the left-hand corner. Irish had two points for their endeavours. It will not be enough, but on a day like this they look every inch a Premiership asset.",

                "body": "After Donald Trump's order late on Friday supporting a ban on transgender troops except under \"limited circumstances\", gender rights groups said they would \"vigorously defend\" existing legal injunctions on the implementation of the exclusionary measures.\n\nJennifer Levi, the Glad transgender rights project director, told the Guardian: \"It's extremely disappointing to see these gross misstatements about transgender people's ability to serve, particularly given the thousands of people who have been serving for decades, including in high positions of responsibility.\"\n\nOn Friday, the White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\" - wanting to transition gender - \"presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality\".\n\nThe ban, a modification of Trump's full ban issued last summer in a tweet, disqualifies US troops who have had gender reassignment surgery.\n\nBut it allows current transgender service members who have not undergone reassignment surgery to remain, as long as they have been medically stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex before joining the military and as long as they are able to deploy across the world.\n\nThe defense secretary, Jim Mattis, also recommended that anyone diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the Obama administration ended the Pentagon's longtime ban on transgender service in 2016 may continue to serve.\n\nHowever, enlisted men and women who have not already been approved to transition gender would still face exclusion.\n\nIn a memo released on Friday, Mattis argued that \"men and women who serve voluntarily accept limitations on their personal liberties - freedom of speech, political activity, freedom of movement - in order to provide the military lethality and readiness necessary to ensure American citizens enjoy their personal freedoms to the fullest extent.\"\n\nAt least four cases challenging the ban are working their way through the courts. Glad's Levi said the Trump administration's order would not affect the group's legal strategy to block the ban through the courts from moving forward.\n\nShe said: \"We knew that this implementation plan was going to be announced , and we will continue to defend the cases. It's the same ban we've been challenging and we will continue to challenge.\"\n\nOther rights groups also condemned the policy, which reverses Obama's 2016 order.\n\n\"What the White House has released tonight is transphobia masquerading as policy. This policy is not based on an evaluation of new evidence,\" Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT and HIV Project, said in a statement.\n\n\"It is reverse-engineered for the sole purpose of carrying out Trump's reckless and unconstitutional ban, undermining the ability of transgender service members to serve openly and military readiness as a whole.\"\n\nOther groups, including the American Military Partner Association, also criticized the measures.\n\n\"This administration chose to announce this policy late on a Friday night, under cover of darkness, because they are embarrassed by it, and they should be,\" David Stacy, director of government affairs at the Human Rights Campaign, told the Military Times.\n\n\"We have 15,000 or more transgender troops and their families who are going to wake up tomorrow with their lives in chaos.\"\n\nNancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said: \"This latest memorandum is the same cowardly, disgusting ban the president announced last summer. No one with the strength and bravery to serve in the US military should be turned away because of who they are.\"\n\nBu the policy changes have divided active-duty troops. According to a Military Times poll, 53% said they supported Trump's comments last summer stating the military should not \"accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity\" because the services \"cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption\".\n\nMore than one in three troops surveyed - 38% - said they strongly approve of Trump's stance. But 35% of troops surveyed disapproved of the comments, 24% strongly.",

We would not be allowed to operate if we had lack of control that could result in anything leaving the four walls of our facility here.\"\n\nA Russian embassy spokesman said Aitkenhead's comment \"amounts to admitting that the secret facility is a place where new components of military-grade poisons are being researched and developed\".\n\nOn Friday, EU leaders promised an \"unprecedented\" diplomatic response to the attack after backing May's assertion that Moscow was responsible.\n\nThe bloc is recalling its ambassador to Russia for \"consultations\" on the Salisbury attack.\n\nRussia has vehemently denied any responsibility for the incident, while Vladimir Chizhov, Russia's EU ambassador, said that \"from the legal point of view the Russian state had nothing against him [Skripal]\".\n\nThe 66-year-old Skripal was accused of working for MI6 over several years, in particular disclosing the names of several dozen Russian agents working in Europe.\n\nHe was sentenced to 13 years in a high-security prison in August 2006, before being freed in the 2010 deal that saw 10 Russian sleeper agents expelled from the United States.\n\nAccording to Timoshkov, whom Skripal had known since school, he did not see himself as a traitor as he had sworn an oath to the Soviet Union.\n\n\"Many people shunned him. His classmates felt he had betrayed the motherland,\" he said.\n\n\"In 2012 he called me. We spoke for about half an hour. He called me from London. He denied he was a traitor ... [he told me] he wrote to Vladimir Putin asking to be fully pardoned and to be allowed to visit Russia. His mother, brother and other relatives were [in Russia].\"\n\nRussia's ambassador to the UK sent well wishes to Skripal and his daughter on Friday, saying he hoped for their recovery.\n\nAlexander Yakovenko wrote to the Wiltshire police DS Nick Bailey, who was left seriously ill after he was exposed to the poison as he went to the Skripals' aid.\n\nBailey said his experience had been \"completely surreal\" after he was discharged from hospital.",

                "title": "Bulldogs walking on AFLW sunshine despite rain-sodden Ikon Park",
                "body": "\"I think it's in our blood,\" said Ellie Blackburn, as she stood on the grand final podium, premiership medal draped around her neck. \"I can't hold that cup up alone. KB, get up here.\" And so, not for the first time in Bulldogs history, the crestfallen captain obliged, joining her deputy on stage to dually hoist the cup. Katie Brennan, clearly no stranger to Bulldogs folklore, then threw in the now-iconic Bob Murphy gesture, tearing away her polo shirt to reveal red, white and blue guernsey underneath.\n\nThe parallels with Murphy, however, were superficial alone (no matter the Bulldogs' ill-fated first appeal, in which their lawyer inexpertly argued that it would be cruel for two Bulldogs captains to miss their teams' premierships). Brennan, the victim of gendered inequity in the AFL and AFLW's disciplinary systems, had as recently as Friday looked as though she could lead her side onto the ground given talk of a last-minute supreme court injunction.\n\nIn the end, however, the captain did as leaders often do: Brennan chose the selfless route, giving up the opportunity to lead her team into the decider, but pursuing justice for women through the Human Rights Commission. \"The fight for gender equality is as every bit as important to me as the grand final,\" Brennan said in a club statement on Friday. \"And the decisions I have made reflect both of those priorities.\"\n\nAfter the game, the players insisted Brennan's case had galvanised the group, who saw her suspension as \"yet another challenge\". \"We've had so many obstacles to overcome this season, and so many injuries,\" said ruck Tiarna Ernst. \"It felt like just one of those extra things. [But] we had trust in the whole 30, the whole playing group. We knew someone would fill her position. There wasn't a worry that we couldn't get the job done.\"\n\nBonnie Toogood agreed, but was more effusive when talking of her leader. She pointed to her game-day boots, inscribed with Brennan's No3. \"I put it [No3] on there for when she got injured, but also this week especially,\" she said.\n\nShe [Katie] deserves it just as much as us, and she was playing with us in spirit. I know I was thinking of her playing. She has done so much for women's footy, this club, and the girls we have. I can say wholeheartedly I played for her.\n\nAmongst her jubilant teammates, and eskies filled with beer, Brennan eschewed the polo for a grand final day playing guernsey, graciously greeting those who had come to mingle with the team. Clad in red, white and blue, a fan embraced her, stating solemnly: \"You deserved to be there.\" \"I am here,\" was her defiant reply. One by one, fans and media alike cried as Brennan held back tears, respectfully subdued.\n\nIn the end, the win was as much about Brennan as it wasn't. No matter her fellow captain and coach's fitting gesture post-game, the AFL's crude dismissal of the clear case for gendered discrimination evident in her suspension put a significant dampener on the occasion. For fans of the women's game - often those most well-versed in feminism - it spoke of a collective fear that the league is being mismanaged in its second season by an organisation that lacks the same passion for AFLW regularly on display from its ardent supporters.\n\nIn that sense, the fact the final was played at a ground with limited cover - in a rather unfortunate downpour - only added fuel to fire. Many AFLW fans had called for the game to be hosted at Etihad given the superior facilities on offer including, most pertinently, a roof. However, with the game held at amateur Princes Park, thousands queued in torrential rain with forecast thunderstorms and lightning, and rumours the game could be called off. In response, many thousands more stayed away altogether. The end result, a crowd of just 7,083 was a disappointing, if predictable, outcome in the conditions.\n\nIkon Park was clearly ill-equipped for the occasion, the ground floor - including several blocks of women's toilets - flooding, while Missy Higgins' pre-game entertainment routine was cancelled without warning, purportedly due to fears the stage would damage the sodden ground. In her place, 17 girls danced in ponchos to a PA system that failed in those areas under cover (where most fans were). Thanks to dark clouds looming overhead, meanwhile, Ikon's much-maligned floodlights were also called into action.\n\nIn the media centre, Champion Data statistics went down, while Channel Seven's graphics also failed. No doubt, with Carlton's requested injection of cash, the ground has the capacity to become a worthy home of women's football. As it stands, however, the use of its facilities for a grand final only reinforces AFLW's second-class citizen status.\n\nNone of that, nor their beloved captain's suspension, however, could dampen the victorious Bulldogs' spirits. After a vigorous rendition of Daughters of the West the team retreated into the locker room, with shouts of \"players only!\" There, with the door slightly ajar, the players belted out Katrina and the Waves classic Walking on Sunshine as lagers were poured into the newly-minted Western Bulldogs 2018 Cup. By the time they were done, sunshine had poured onto Ikon Park, not a grey cloud in the sky.",

The flipside, Scum, pondered: \"How can an entire nation be so fucking thick?\" A bracing introduction to the disaffected, often damning eye that the young London four-piece (Clottie, Rosy Bones on drums, LED on guitar and Naima Jelly on bass) cast over their world before documenting it in rambunctious, idiosyncratic post-punk. \"British people are overly polite, which staggers progress,\" they told Beat magazine. \"We need to talk more openly about sex, religion and mental health. We are human, after all.\"\n\nFearless, omnivorous Goat Girl (named in reference to Bill Hicks's lusty alter ego, Goat Boy) found each other, and their sound, in Brixton indie venue the Windmill, signing to Rough Trade (over Domino and XL)two years ago before releasing anything. Taking their time and choosing the right home has served them well - their eponymous debut sounds self-assured: 19 songs crafted with care, in which dirty grunge riffs take strange left turns.\n\nClottie's dark drawl is an unscratched itch on the lusty, harum-scarum The Man, while Creep, with its keening fiddle, gives voice to the rage of women harassed on public transport (\"I really want to smash your head in\"). It's a weird, wily and unpredictable record, getting under the surface of things. Expect to hear Goat Girl trip-trapping over your bridge very soon.\n\n* Goat Girl is released on 6 April on Rough Trade.

                "body": "Hundreds of thousands of students have joined anti-gun March for Our Lives rallies across the US in one of the largest expressions of popular opposition in the modern era.\n\nAt dawn in Washington, a queue of buses from around the US - Ohio, Virginia, Connecticut, Vermont - congregated as students poured from the doors and spilled into the thousands already marching on the streets.\n\nTheir chants cut through the cold and echoed along Pennsylvania Avenue. \"This is what democracy looks like,\" was the rallying call from the throngs of these young, diverse, and impassioned marchers, standing behind a movement born out of violence and tragedy.\n\n\"We call BS,\" they said in unison - reviving the speech made by 18 year-old Emma Gonzalez that demanded sweeping reform of America's gun laws in the hours after 17 of her teachers and fellow students were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida last month.\n\nIn the five weeks since the shooting, the Parkland students have galvanised a national movement, breathing new life into the call for gun law reform and rejecting the conservative orthodoxy of the powerful gun rights lobby spearheaded by the NRA.\n\nThey have already successfully lobbied for substantial reform in Florida after decades of inaction, and led thousands of students in school walkouts around the US earlier this month.\n\nOrganizers expected Saturday's rally in Washington to draw half a million people - a crowd comparable to the Women's March in January last year and the anti-Vietnam war protests of the 1960s. Rallies were taking place at over 800 locations around world, including London, Sydney, Tokyo, Mumbai and other parts of the US.\n\nCassie Pearce, 17, had ridden in her school bus for 10 hours from Manchester, Vermont with dozens of her classmates. Clutching a sign that said \"I should be writing my college essay, not my will\" Pearce said: \"I'm here because enough is enough. We have a right to be heard. We don't want to be killed in school.\"\n\nSophia Hiltz and Alanis Moulier, both 16, had not travelled as far, but just a day ago their close friend Jaelynn Willey, had died in gun violence at another American high school - Great Mills high school in Maryland. Willey was killed by a student who brought a handgun on campus and opened fire. It was at least the 33rd time a gun was fired at an American school this year, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\n\"I saw her fall,\" said Moulier. \"It shows it can happen to anyone, anywhere. It just happens.\"\n\nHiltz said: \"Something needs to be done, and if it doesn't change we will keep doing what we're doing. We will not stop.\"\n\nHundreds of students from Great Mills marched together, wearing green and carrying signs with Jaelynn's name and face.\n\nDonald Trump, who left Washington on Friday evening to spend the weekend at his luxury members club, Mar-a-Lago, in south Florida, signed a budget less than 24 hours before that contained no substantial clauses on gun control. In a meeting with lawmakers in the aftermath of Parkland, the president had signalled support for stronger background checks on gun purchases and raising the minimum age for buying high-powered rifles.\n\nBut the NRA staunchly opposed these measures and Trump appears to have abandoned the proposals.\n\nOn Saturday morning, shortly before the speakers - all of whom were expected to be teenagers - took the stage in Washington, the White House issued a statement applauding \"the many courageous young Americans exercising their first amendment rights\".\n\nThe administration also drew attention to minor reforms the president has called for, including a move by the justice department on Friday to ban bump stocks, the accessory that allows rifles to mimic the rapid fire of automatic weapons.\n\nA group of student journalists from the Stoneman Douglas newspaper, the Eagle Eye, were invited to guest-edit the Guardian's US website this weekend. Eleven students covered the rally in Washington, interviewing other survivors of gun violence from Stoneman Douglas and elsewhere.\n\nParkland student Jordan Khayyami, 15, said: \"I think that legislatures should be aware that the next generation of voters is right in front of them so if they don't want to promote change then we will vote for change.\"\n\nRobert Runcie, the Broward County schools superintendent who administers the district Stoneman Douglas is part of, said: \"Stoneman Douglas students have driven and impacted a dawn of a national movement. I think this generation may prove to be the greatest generation.\"\n\nThe scenes of thousands of students on the streets was overwhelming to many of the victims of gun violence who attended the Washington rally.\n\n\"I did not expect this. I'm still astounded,\" said Mark Barden, whose seven-year-old son Daniel was one of the 20 children murdered at Sandy Hook in 2012. \"To me, it looks like our entire nation is finally on board, on the right side of this issue. It's so inspiring and encouraging and overwhelming, and beautiful to me.\"\n\nBarden has spent five years pushing for stricter gun control laws, first with the support of Barack Obama's White House, then continuing when gun control again dropped off the national agenda.\n\nHe said the rally in Washington was \"like nothing I've seen, ever, to be honest with you. It's got a different tone and different feel.\"\n\nBarden lauded the young activists now leading the movement. \"They're young enough not to be intimidated or bullied by the status quo, or lawmakers or are locked up in the pocket of corporate greed.

                "body": "Tributes pour in for Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame who died of injuries after walking into siege in Trèbes\n\nEven by the high standards of duty and self-sacrifice expected of professional soldiers and police officers the world over, the courage of Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame was extraordinary.\n\nBy offering to swap places with hostages held by a terrorist gunman who had already killed three people and had declared his allegiance to Islamic State (Isis), the decorated officer would have known he was almost certainly walking to his death.\n\nIn the last three years, attackers with Islamist sympathies have attacked - and in certain cases killed - French police, gendarmes and soldiers on more than 10 occasions.\n\nArmed with nothing but this knowledge, Beltrame strode across the car park of the SuperU store in Trèbes, a small town near Carcassonne, to confront Radouane Lakdim, a self-described \"soldier of the caliphate\".\n\nThe Frenchman of Moroccan origin had carried out three separate attacks that day, culminating in a three-hour siege at the supermarket, where he killed a member of staff and a customer and took several hostages. Beltrame left his mobile telephone line open, enabling police and special forces outside the supermarket to hear what was going on. When they heard shots, they stormed the store, killing Lakdim, and finding Beltrame gravely injured after being shot and stabbed.\n\nAfter the gendarme was helicoptered to hospital, France held its breath and hoped for a happy ending. At around 6am yesterday morning, that hope was shattered.\n\nA brief statement from the interior minister, Gérard Collomb, announced that Beltrame had made the ultimate sacrifice. Then tributes poured in for the 45-year-old officer who, it was revealed, had been preparing to marry his wife Marielle in a church ceremony on 9 June. The couple, already wed under civil law, were planning a religious ceremony. Instead, the priest who would have officiated at the wedding was called to Beltrame's bedside, where Marielle was keeping vigil on Friday evening, to give him the last rites.\n\nNow French investigators are trying to discover how Lakdim, who had been flagged up by the country's intelligence services as a security risk, was able to obtain a weapon and go on a killing spree, gunning down four people.\n\nLakdim, who lived in Carcassonne, was known to police as a petty criminal and small-time drug dealer and since 2014 he had been on France's Fiche S list, meaning he was considered a potential threat. He had also been under surveillance, though intelligence officers reportedly decided he was not a serious risk.\n\nAlthough French police knew he had consulted pro-Islamic State websites, French prosecutor François Molins said there had been no evidence he was planning a terrorist act.\n\nCollomb agreed, saying Lakdim had shown \"no sign of radicalisation\". He described his actions as that of \"a loner who suddenly decided to act\". Isis claimed responsiblity for the attacks without showing any evidence. The claim is being investigated.\n\nA second unnamed person, a male aged 17, was taken into police custody for questioning and Lakdim's girlfriend, 18, was brought in for police questioning on Friday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, Beltrame's family have been paying tribute to the courage of the officer. His brother Cédric said the gendarme would have walked into the supermarket knowing that he would probably die.\n\n\"He certainly would have known that he had practically no chance. He was very conscious of that ... he didn't hesitate a second,\" Cédric Beltrame told RTL radio, adding that it was was \"perfectly appropriate\" to describe his brother as a hero.\n\n\"He gave his life for someone else, a stranger, not even for someone in his family,\" he said.\n\nBeltrame's mother also spoke to RTL on Friday before he died. \"He used to say to me, 'I'm doing my job, Maman, that's all.' That's just the way he is,\" she said.\n\nFlorence Nicolic, Beltrame's cousin, said the gendarme had been passionate about the military all his life.\n\n\"Since he was a little boy, Arnaud has always talked about the army and being a soldier. That has been a passion in his life since he was a baby,\" Nicolic told the BBC. \"He used to play with tin soldiers all the time. His grandfather was in the army and was an idol and he wanted to do it.\"\n\nShe added: \"What he did was so wonderful and so brave, we were very surprised and shocked but when we heard what had happened we not suprised in a sense because that's the (sort of) thing he would do without hesitation. He wouldn't think about the consequences.\"\n\nBeltrame, of the Aude Gendarmerie, grew up in Brittany and had a distinguished career earning commendations and military honours including a military cross.\n\nHe graduated from France's elite military college Saint-Cyr in 1999 with the rank of major and a commendation for his \"resolutely offensive spirit when faced with adversity\". His superior officers noted that he was prepared to \"fight to the end and never give up\".\n\nFrom Saint-Cyr, Beltrame underwent training for the gendarmerie, including for the special intervention unit the elite GIGN (Groupe d'intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), whose missions include counter-terrorism and hostage rescue.\n\nHe was given military honours in 2007 following a two-year posting to Iraq, and later spent four years as part of the Garde républicaine at the Elysée Palace before becoming a special adviser to the secretary general of France's ecology ministry. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 2016.\n\n\"Lieutenant-colonel Arnaud Beltrame died serving the country to which he had already given so much. In giving his life to bring to an end the murderous actions of a jihadist terrorist, he has fallen a hero,\" President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday.\n\nAs a former member of the elite anti-terrorist police, Beltrame had trained for such a situation. As deputy commander of the Aude Gendarmerie, he had organised an exercise simulating a terrorist attack and mass killing in a supermarket only last December.\n\nEven as they trained, Beltrame and his gendarmes must have thought such a scenario unlikely in a sleepy town like Trèbes. It now seems tragically prescient.",

There was a school shooting nearby in Marylandlast week.\n\nSteve Craig, 64 and Maddie Craig, 21, New Castle, Pennsylvania\n\nThe father and daughter came to Washington to show their support for the Parkland students, and to advocate for a ban on assault weapons.\n\n\"I think the second amendment needs to be repealed and amended. I don't think the right to own a gun should be unlimited,\" Steve Craig said.\n\nMaddie Craig said she thought social media had changed the gun control debate, allowing students to speak directly to each other and share their experiences. \"For Columbine, there wasn't that social media presence.\" Now, she said, \"you can hear every student's opinion. There's a lot more awareness of what's going on across America.\"\n\nAlice Gambino, 42, Silver Spring, Maryland\n\nGambino's two sons, 15 and eight, were too afraid to come to the rally, worried that the large crowds would attract \"gun crazies\" and that there might be another act of violence.\n\n\"You don't have to go. I'll go for you,\" she told them.\n\nGambino said this was her first protest for gun control. \"I think I was waiting for someone else to do something,\" she said.\n\n\"Seeing that the kids in the last attack had to rally themselves, I felt very guilty.

They had guns. It was really chaos. They kicked down the door. It was really loud. A lot of us hadn't seen guns before,\" Meelock said.\n\n\"I was close to it,\" said Wedin. \"We went on lockdown, we were all waiting to know if we were going to be OK. If there was a threat to us. We were all planning what we were going to do if we had to get out the window.\"\n\nThe shooter had posted on social media and in private messages before the shooting that he was depressed and had guns, they said.\n\nAyana Trottier, 17, Turtle Mountain reservation, North Dakota\n\nTrottier had traveled as part of a group from from the Turtle Mountain Indian reservation in North Dakota near the Canadian border. Her school's student council had organized the trip to show their support for Parkland students, and in reaction to the series of threats their school and town had faced in recent weeks.\n\nIt was the teenagers' first march. Trottier and the other young women women a ceremonial ribbon skirts to show the importance of the march. \"They're very sacred,\" she said.\n\n\"We want our voices to be heard,\" she said. \"As minorities we understand feeling speechless or not being heard.\"",

                "title": "Unprotected GKN left to brave the cold corporate winds alone",
                "body": "As the takeover deadline looms, MPs and unions voice fears for Britain's industrial future if the deal is allowed to go ahead\n\nIt is a company that dates back to Britain's industrial revolution: an ironworks in south Wales that started in 1759 and supplied the tracks for Brunel's Great Western Railway. It has become, as GKN, a global engineering giant supplying car and aerospace parts, employing 60,000 around the world and 6,000 in the UK. But now corporate raiders loom in the form of a controversial £7.8bn hostile bid - in which Theresa May's government has been sidelined, despite its aspiration to develop a new UK industrial strategy.\n\nBidder Melrose has set a deadline of 1pm on Thursday for GKN shareholders to accept or reject its largely paper-based bid. Insiders describe the situation as finely balanced. Melrose, which is about the fifth of the size, says GKN has lost its way, repeatedly missing profit targets; it says its approach of buying underperforming businesses, restructuring them and selling them on in three to five years will generate far more value. As of Friday, just under 10% of GKN shareholders were backing the Melrose bid, broadly in line with the 9% support for the GKN board.\n\nGKN, which earned £658m last year on sales of £9.7bn, says that Melrose has not offered enough with a bid worth approximately 457p against a GKN share price of 428p. GKN proposes its own restructuring, merging its West Midlands car parts business with US group Dana. GKN warns that jobs around the UK will be at risk, from its headquarters in Redditch through to its aerospace components operations in and around Bristol.\n\nMeanwhile, a string of politicians, from both the Conservative and Labour parties, as well as trade union Unite, accuse Melrose of operating a short-term model that will damage Britain's industrial base. They would like Greg Clark, the business secretary, to intervene. But few observers believe he has the legal power to do so. Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary, said: \"Our takeover law is simply inadequate when it comes to protecting British businesses. What happens in this country would not be allowed to happen in France, Holland or Germany.\"\n\nMelrose critics say the company has a poor record as a long-term owner of businesses, when it has been unable to sell them on. They point to Brush, a supplier of generators to the oil and gas industry based in Loughborough, which Melrose has owned since 2008. Last month Melrose said 270 UK jobs were at risk at a firm that employs 790 in the country. It said that Brush was the victim of an industry-wide downturn, but GKN supporters argue that a long-term investment strategy might have seen Brush invest in an attempt to diversify into the more promising area of renewables. \"Last year GKN spent £262m on R&D; Melrose spent £223m over five years,\" said one source close to the company.\n\nMeanwhile Airbus, GKN's most important customer, has warned that it expects whoever wins the takeover battle to continue to invest in R&D. Earlier this month, it warned against a short-term ownership approach. Tom Williams, the chief operating officer of Airbus's commercial aircraft division, said: \"It would be practically impossible for us to give any new work to GKN under such an ownership model when we don't know who will be the long-term investor.\"\n\nProfessor Chris Carr from Edinburgh University, who once worked at GKN, said: \"If you look at this company, these industries operate on 50-year perspectives.\"\n\nMelrose is run by a group of executives, led by executive chairman Christopher Miller, who are among the best-paid public company bosses in the UK. Last year Miller and three other top executives shared in a bonus payout of £160m worth of shares, after a five-year incentive plan paid out. A previous plan matured in 2012, paying £126m in shares, largely to the same top executives.\n\nEarlier this month Simon Peckham, Melrose's chief executive, defended the pay of the company's bosses in front of MPs on the business committee: \"I appreciate that this is a difficult subject, but let me put the other side of the equation, which is that, other than to pay those tax levies we have just talked about, in the 15 years I have worked for Melrose, I have never sold a single share in it.\" A Unite official, Steve Turner, also giving evidence, said Melrose bosses had \"trousered over £400m\" in the past decade, during which time GKN has invested £500m in UK manufacturing.\n\nCompetition regulators can block or impose conditions on a merger, but Melrose has no meaningful overlap with GKN. Clark can only intervene in a takeover - and so force it to be considered by the Competition and Markets Authority - on grounds of national security, media plurality or financial stability. GKN has a modest defence parts business and its work is not critical to defending the nation. However, this has not stopped Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, from writing to Clark to raise concern because GKN supplies parts for F-35 fighters, A400M military transport planes and the Ajax armoured vehicles used by British armed forces.\n\nHe is not the only Conservative to be concerned, demonstrating that the desire for a more assertive industrial policy has gone across the party divide. Rachel Maclean, Tory MP for Redditch, where GKN is headquartered, worries that 260 staff at the head office will lose their jobs if the takeover goes through, and while she would like Clark to intervene, she acknowledges that, under current law, \"he only has a narrow remit\". Citing Airbus, she said that \"there are so many things pointing to a takeover not being a good idea\" and hoped that \"shareholders would think very carefully about the implications of their decision on the economy as a whole\". The MP acknowledges that sentiment in her party is shifting, because \"as the economy becomes ever more globalised, policy and thinking has to evolve\".\n\nIn November May unveiled an industrial strategy white paper that she said would create \"the conditions in which successful business can emerge\" and \"identify the industries that are of strategic value\". Its approach, however, was focused on investment and tax breaks in a range of key areas, including automotive, rather than takeover protection.\n\nEarlier this month Unilever decided to shift its HQ from London to Rotterdam, where Dutch law offers greater protections against takeovers. Unite highlights alternative options which would help protect companies like it and GKN. One is to give long-term investors extra voting rights to protect from short-term takeovers.\n\nCarr warns: \"You do wonder what industrial companies we will be left with in a global world, post-Brexit.\"\n\nTroublesome takeovers\n\nProposed takeovers of British industrial firms rarely pass without comment and a number of deals in recent years have faced concerted opposition. Here are some of the most contentious transactions.\n\nKraft and Cadbury, 2010\n\nKraft, the US food giant, was ultimately successful in its £12bn pursuit of Cadbury, one of the most venerable names in British industry. But the process was marked by stiff political and trade union opposition. The then business secretary, Lord Mandelson, warned Kraft against attempting to make a \"fast buck\" out of the Creme Egg maker, while unions warned that up to 30,000 jobs could be at risk. Kraft prevailed but immediately damaged its reputation by closing a Cadbury factory in Keynsham, near Bristol, despite indicating previously that it might keep the site open. Not only did 400 workers lose their jobs, but the example of Keynsham is still used by unions to warn about takeovers of British industrial firms.\n\nBAE Systems and EADS, 2012\n\nThe proposed €35bn (£31bn) merger of Britain's biggest defence manufacturer and the Franco-German owner of Airbus foundered in the face of political, union and media opposition. The British, German and French governments could not reach agreement on the corporate structure of the business, which would have combined two of the most politically sensitive companies in Europe. Angela Merkel, in particular, harboured the deepest concerns about the deal, for which she saw no strategic logic. Chastened by the experience, neither business has pursued a transformative deal since.\n\nPfizer and AstraZeneca, 2014\n\nWhen US drugs giant Pfizer attempted to buy the Anglo-Swedish drugs maker for £69bn, it was attacked on both sides of the Atlantic for admitting that tax savings were a key factor in its bid. David Cameron, then the PM, said he was neutral about the bid, but MPs and trade unions raised concerns over the offer, suspecting that Pfizer would strip out R&D jobs. However, AstraZeneca was also adamant that Pfizer's approach - at £55 a share - undervalued the company and Pfizer walked away. AstraZeneca is trading at around £48 currently.\n\nKraft Heinz and Unilever, 2017\n\nHeinz's £115bn approach for Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group behind Marmite and Magnum ice-cream, fell apart rapidly in the wake of strong opposition from the bid target. Kraft Heinz, the US maker of Philadelphia cream cheese, abandoned its interest after Unilever, which employs 7,000 people in the UK, made clear it had no interest in a deal. Political and trade union disquiet over the proposed transaction had barely started to be heard. But Unilever's determination to protect itself more adequately against further overtures led to it choosing Rotterdam over London as its main HQ this year.",

                "body": "Aggressive American investor's toughest test may be the strictness of financial regulators\n\nLife may have just got more exciting for the bosses of Barclays - and not in a good way. Last week the bank revealed that Edward Bramson - a US-based investor who admits that some people would describe him as \"pond scum\" - had notched up a 5.2% shareholding, making him Barclays' fourth-biggest investor. The disclosure was required once Bramson passed the 5% mark.\n\nBramson is not just any shareholder. He is an example of the aggressive activist investors that are buying stakes in UK companies with the aim of shaking things up and extracting returns. Barclays welcomed Bramson to its shareholder list but the greeting was no doubt made through gritted teeth. Bramson's record of dogged agitation suggests Barclays' bosses could now be in for a hard time.\n\nBramson has bought stakes in a series of British companies in the past 15 years and has reaped returns averaging 22.8% a year. He typically does so by buying a sizeable stake, demanding a seat on the board and then pushing for cost cuts, payouts to shareholders and other changes that boost returns.\n\nBramson is based in New York, where he operates from an office on the 32nd floor of a midtown Manhattan block looking out at the Chrysler Building and the East river. But though his style is transatlantic, Bramson was born and grew up in England. His mother was British and his father American.\n\nHe moved to New York in 1975, aged 24, to get away from Britain when it was in the doldrums and run by a Labour government he saw as \"dirigiste\". Bramson got into private equity and started his own firm in 1977. Things have not always gone his way: in 1987 he lost $60m after buying Ampex, a US maker of recording equipment. More recently, Sherborne's stake in fitness equipment firm Nautilus also lost money.\n\nIn 2003 he abandoned private equity for activism and launched Sherborne Investors, whose first investment was 4imprint, a promotions company. Sherborne describes itself as a \"turnaround investment firm\". Other more blunt descriptions for activist investors like Bramson include \"corporate raider\" and \"asset stripper\".\n\nIn a rare interview in 2015, Bramson said he had been called \"pond scum\" but that big investors in his fund, including Aviva and BlackRock, saw things differently. \"All those people know what we do. It is not a secret. They are the largest investing institutions in the UK or in the world. They don't think it's anathema,\" he told Bloomberg Markets magazine.\n\nIf a company resists, he enlists the support of other large shareholders that are sometimes investors in Sherborne, which supply it with money and agree to the fund taking up to 25% of the gains. Bramson raised £700m in July for his next investment. It was Sherborne's biggest fundraising yet, suggesting he had something significant in mind. The prospectus said Sherborne would find an undervalued company with \"operational deficiencies\" and that its investment would not be passive.\n\nBarclays has, therefore, been warned. Its chief executive, Jes Staley, has already sold Barclays' African business, got out of European retail banking and set the bank up to cut branches as customers go online. But investors have not been impressed: its market value languishes well below its assets and the valuations of other European banks. The shares, 250p three years ago, are currently changing hands at 203p.\n\nThe most likely target for Bramson's shake-up is Barclays' investment bank, whose status has swung from prized possession to expensive underperformer. What he has in mind remains to be seen. Bramson contacted Barclays after the bank's annual results on 22 February to let the bank know he was building a stake. He and his partner at Sherborne, Stephen Welker, met Barclays' head of investor relations but there is no meeting planned as yet with Staley.\n\nBramson's style is to sit tight and work out his demands. Unlike other US activists such as Carl Icahn or Eric Knight, who agitated at HSBC a decade ago, Bramson does not use the media to conduct a campaign against the company's management.\n\nHe may be publicity-shy but that does not stop him from being highly aggressive. At fund management group F&C he built a 20% stake, ousted the chairman in 2011 and spent more than two years pushing for cost cuts and a revamped investment strategy.\n\nAt Electra, Bramson bought a 30% stake in 2013 and worked for almost two years to install himself and another director chosen by him on the board. He installed himself as the stand-in chief executive, standing down in December 2017.\n\nBut Barclays - currently valued at £34bn - will be a more difficult nut to crack than Bramson's other investments. A 5% shareholding gives him far less influence than he had at F&C or Electra, whose smaller size let him buy big stakes.\n\nSherborne has not previously invested in banks, which are strictly regulated. The Bank of England is unlikely to want him calling the shots at Barclays, which is regarded as systemically important to the financial system.\n\nBut Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at stockbroker Jefferies, said that after placing such a big bet on Barclays, Bramson would not sit back. \"Sherborne's managing directors have at best limited experience in banks investing,\" Dickerson said. \"Investors should take note that, however out of character, [Sherborne's] investment in Barclays consumes nearly all of its capital and so is clearly a massive active bet.\"",

Sean Ingle caught up with the Oxford native who got into rowing at a state school club:\n\nIf two boat races just isn't enough, there are also the two reserve races. For the women, Blondie (Cambridge) take on Osiris (Oxford). In the men's race, it's Cambridge's Goldie against Oxford's, er, Isis.\n\nIf two boat races is two too many, perhaps this is more up your street - Spitalfields City Farm holds the Goat Race today. It's ... well, self-explanatory really. But here's some extra info:\n\nIn 1845, after 15 years of trial runs and squabbles over the best location, crews from Oxford and Cambridge first raced the four-and-a-bit miles from Putney to Mortlake.\n\nOxford wore dark blue, Cambridge light blue. The records show that Cambridge won by 10 lengths. For the next 170 years, not much changed - the crews rowed west along the Tideway, and a team in blue won.\n\nIn 2015, the women's race was finally relocated to the same stretch of water, meaning we now get two races. Otherwise, the Boat Race(s) remains the same, part of the Saturday springtime trifecta alongside the Grand National and the Cup Final.\n\nThe outcome means little to those outside the respective universities, but that doesn't stop us watching in huge numbers, and rooting for one shade of blue for no particular reason. It's a tradition. The women's race starts at 4.30pm GMT, the men's at 5.30pm.",

In Port Elizabth Warner was highlighted for the impact of the bandages on his hand - the result of finger injuries suffered while batting - on the ball and on day one in Cape Town Australia bowler Pat Cummins inadvertently stepped on the ball.\n\nAfter the first Test in Durban Australia's coach, Darren Lehmann, said both sides would try various \"techniques\" to get the ball to reverse swing.\n\n\"Obviously, there are techniques used by both sides to get the ball reverse and that's just the way the game goes,\" Lehmann said after the Durban Test. \"I have no problems with it, simple. You'd have to ask the umpires and ICC about that one [whether it is legal]. I don't mind the ball moving, I have no problems with it at all.\"\n\nFormer players were quick to react to the incident on social media, with South African-born former England captain Kevin Pietersen accusing Lehmann of being involved in the plan.\n\nAnother former England captain, Michael Vaughan, tweeted: \"Mr Bancroft may end up on the naughty step.\"",

                "body": "Accusations of social cleansing as housing associations and councils sell to private sector\n\nTenants opposed to the social cleansing of city centres will protest outside an auction at a luxury hotel where property developers and private landlords will bid for £7.2m worth of former social flats and houses.\n\nNearly one in 10 of the lots, which are being auctioned by leading estate agent Savills at the Marriott hotel in London's Grosvenor Square on Monday, are former social housing, with 14 lots being sold by housing associations and six by councils.\n\nThey include three housing association flats in Croydon, two housing association flats in Camberwell and a housing association house in Harlesden. These three areas have more than 7,000 families in temporary housing and 104 people sleeping on the streets, according to the most recent government figures.\n\nIn the last Savills auction in February, more than 15% of the lots were sold by social landlords, including a two-bed housing association flat in Bayswater sold for £603,000 and a housing association flat in Paddington belonging to a woman who was forced to move after her housing benefit was cut by the so-called bedroom tax.\n\nThese sales are part of a wider trend that has seen some housing associations sell off social housing in high-value inner city areas in order to fund new developments, which tenants claim are frequently let at close to market rents, or even sold on the open market to private buyers.\n\nOne, the country's biggest housing associations, Genesis, is at the forefront of this commercial drive. The 32,000-home landlord, which operates across London, has four lots listed for sale. In February, Genesis sold 23 lots of social housing, including a two-bedroom flat in Maida Vale sold for £417,000, a one-bedroom flat in Notting Hill sold for £401,000 and a flat in Kilburn sold for £450,000.\n\nGenesis is set to merge with neighbouring London housing association Notting Hill Housing, which is selling five flats worth more than £1.6m in the auction.\n\nPeter Denton, a retired engineer who became a Genesis tenant 40 years ago during his wife's terminal illness, said he was saddened by the loss of so many affordable homes. \"Social housing was meant to house the poorer sector of society and should not be treated as a saleable cash cow,\" he said.\n\nGemini Verney-Dyde, who was rehoused from a squat by Notting Hill Housing in the 1970s, said: \"If you sell off central London property because of its value, you are essentially socially cleansing.\n\n\"The only people who can buy those properties are wealthy people.\"\n\nGaynor Aaltonen, a writer, who lives in a Genesis flat in Maida Vale, said housing associations were selling London's inheritance to the rich: \"It is a great creative city - it is not just a city for bankers. But it won't have any life any more if it all goes.\"\n\nMolly Ayton, a Genesis tenant of 39 years, said she had paid for her flat many times over with her rent: \"They were helped to buy these flats with public money so they should remain as social housing.\"\n\nGenesis chief executive Neil Hadden told Inside Housing magazine in 2015 that housing people on the lowest income was not his \"problem\" any more as his focus was supplying homes at different price points. The company's last annual report reveals it completed 159 homes in 2016. Of these, only three were rented at social levels, which are typically less than half the cost of market rents. In the same period, it sold 58 social homes to the private sector.\n\nGenesis and Notting Hill tenants report that flats that were once rented to their friends and neighbours on a social housing basis in central London are now being used as profitable Airbnb rentals, rented out for at least twice the rate by buy-to-let landlords, or put on the market for £1m-plus.\n\nJudi Wilson, who lives in a Genesis flat in Brent, said the flat below her was sold at auction a few years back and was now used as an Airbnb rental. \"There is a constant turnover of guests, some of whom have held wild parties,\" she said.\n\nPeter Robinson, who lives in a Genesis flat in west London, said the two flats above him were sold after the tenants moved out: \"At least 50 potential buyers so far have been shown round the flat immediately above me. Maybe the £1m-plus price tag is putting them off.\"\n\nWestminster MP Karen Buck, whose constituency includes thousands of Genesis and Notting Hill properties, said both associations were becoming developers rather than social housing providers: \"Genesis and Notting Hill began life in my constituency as a response to private sector squalor and Rachman-type landlords. Both of them have lost sight of their mission to provide decent social housing in areas like Paddington.\"\n\nThe auctioning of social homes was depriving her constituents of vital social housing, she added. \"It sticks in my throat to see social housing sold off in a swanky hotel.\"\n\nGenesis said it was still committed to helping those who find it difficult to meet their housing needs in the marketplace. \"Over time, our approach to delivering this in the most effective way has had to evolve in step with changing government policies and a difficult operating environment,\" said a spokesperson. Scarce government funding had forced it to become more commercial but it was replacing social homes: \"We have built far more social rent homes than we have sold.\"\n\nNotting Hill Housing said it still provided Londoners with good quality homes, and any profits from sales were invested in affordable housing. \"Times have changed and the lack of government grants brings pressures, but any commercial work and property sales we undertake is done to create greater surpluses to invest in more affordable housing,\" it said, adding that it sold properties in high-value areas to fund development of family homes elsewhere in London.\n\nSales of housing association social homes to the private sector have more than tripled since 2001, with 3,891 social homes sold in 2016. Overall, more than 150,000 homes for social rent have been lost since 2012 - mainly through the government's policy of converting social rents into affordable rents and right-to-buy purchases.",

                "body": "I was raised to think that the only way I could protect myself was to have a gun. Now I teach others they don't need weapons in their lives\n\nIn Oakland, where I live, young people wake up every day to another person killed by gun violence. It's a never-ending nightmare. This gun violence is swept under the rug by people afraid of a world without guns. They forget what it was like before they had access to one.\n\nIf the answer to violence were more violence, things would be better by now. But they're not. As a teenager, I watched people fall victim to firearms. Sometimes these gun deaths were self- inflicted. Other times they were caused by someone else. The common denominator was the ready access to these weapons of mass destruction they call guns.\n\nThis year we saw something happen in the world that hasn't happened in a very long time: the youth fought back. They stood up and said: \"Enough is enough.\" Nobody has the desire to be another face on a T-shirt. Nobody has the desire to be another RIP. Nobody has the desire to leave behind family, memories, significant others, and their futures.\n\nYet because of gun violence we have that fear going to school, work, airports, vacations, and being on the road. Gun violence isn't only in schools, or street corners, or even the mall. It's on the freeway when you change a lane, RIP Bianca Roberson. It's in the neighborhood when you wear the wrong hoodie on the way home from the store, RIP Trayvon Martin. Its standing in your grandma's backyard at night, RIP Stephon Clark.\n\nYou can be anywhere and at any time someone could walk in, unannounced, and take your life. Even the police. I wasn't always opposed to guns. In fact, I was raised to think that the only way I could protect myself was to have one.\n\nI remember how easy it was in my neighborhood to obtain one. I remember holding the steel in my hand and tucking it in my pants. I remember how my attitude changed, how easy it was to just think about pulling it out and just shooting. Having a gun did something to me.\n\nLucky for me there were programs at my school that took me from being a fear-induced, gun-toting, trigger-happy teenager to a passionate peer educator with a mission to help kids like me with a rough upbringing. I want to make sure they aren't swallowed by society's expectations of what to expect from someone from my neighborhood.\n\nI learned from that program that violence comes and goes in a full circle. The only way to end that circle is to step out of it and teach others the same.\n\nGun policy, like technology, needs to advance with the times. It needs revising every year to keep up with current life situations. As a country, a state, as human beings we need to realize that just because something is written doesn't mean it won't need changing.\n\nThe only way to fix anything is to first realize it's broken, and then accept that and change it. That starts with the youth, the adults and the lawmakers. The ball is at your feet: what will you do to make this shot?\n\nSmooth Wickliff is an Oakland native and is an alumnus of Teens on Target",

At the Guardian our coverage will be led by survivors from the Parkland shooting in Florida.\n\nWe've handed over our US site to student journalists from the Eagle Eye, the newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, and they will be directing our stories about the gun reform demonstrations over the weekend.\n\nIn a guest editorial, the students have set out a number of proposed changes to current gun laws - including March for Our Lives pledges like banning semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines.\n\n\"We believe federal and state governments must put these in place to ensure that mass shootings and gun violence cease to be a staple of American culture,\" the students wrote.\n\nAs part of the guest-editorship, students Rebecca Schneid and Dara Rosen managed to bag an exclusive interview with Bernie Sanders this week.\n\nSchneid and Rosen asked the Vermont senator: \"What do you feel is the importance of [movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter] these kinds of grassroots movements on changing policy?\"\n\nSanders replied: \"Extraordinarily important. That's how change takes place. I've said it a million times in every speech that I give. Change never takes place from the top. It always comes from the bottom on up. So right now, when you have large numbers of young people all across this country who are saying to the leaders of this country, 'When we go to school we want to feel safe,' that will have an impact, absolutely, to my mind.\"\n\nThe Guardian will have live coverage of the more than 800 separate rallies taking place on Saturday, with contributors from the Eagle Eye as well as our own reporters across the country.\n\nMarch for Our Lives has a tool to find your nearest march here.\n\nUnions come to aid of undocumented workers\n\nSome US unions are stepping in to protect their undocumented members, creating a new battlefront between the Republican party and organized labor, Mike Elk reported for the Guardian this week.\n\nThe leadership of North America's Building Trades Unions has traditionally been one of the whitest sectors of the labor movement. Civil rights groups have repeatedly sued construction unions to admit African Americans, and for decades, unions like the Carpenters would call immigration authorities to deport undocumented workers.\n\nHowever, over the last two decades as construction unions sought to organize larger numbers of undocumented workers, the attitude of labor has changed. Now, in the era of Trump, many labor leaders see an opportunity to accelerate those changes.\n\n\"Has the Trump era accelerated our efforts? Absolutely,\" said the Painters Union president, Ken Rigmaiden. \"There are too many reasons to mention but one, in particular, is forcing 11 million immigrants back into the dark side of the construction economy, where wage theft and intimidation thrive.\"\n\nWhat we're reading\n\n* While hailing the success of the anti-gun movement that has led to Saturday's March for Our Lives, some activists are urging that that momentum should also be used to tackle gun violence in poor and minority communities, the Guardian reported this week. Community organizers from around the US met in Atlanta, Georgia on Thursday to discuss how the current enthusiasm can be channelled into stopping gun violence in inner cities.\n\n* After months of rumors, Sex and the City actor Cynthia Nixon entered the race for New York governor this week. Nixon will be taking on the incumbent Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, and early indications are she is planning to run to the left of the centrist Cuomo. But can she win? According to CNN analyst and polling expert Harry Enten: \"The answer is yes.\" (Although it currently seems unlikely.)",

                "body": "The Week in Patriarchy is a weekly roundup of what's happening in the world of feminism and sexism. If you're not already receiving it by email, make sure to subscribe.\n\nTrump-era media really is something else. Otherwise smart and interesting publications are working so hard to \"appeal to both sides\" that they've completely abandoned their integrity in the process.\n\nTake the Atlantic, who announced a new roster of high-profile columnists this week, including Kevin D Williamson - a writer who compared a nine-year-old black child to a primate, and who argued that women that have abortions - along with their doctors and nurses - should be executed by hanging. (In case you were wondering, yes, this is a literal plotline in The Handmaid's Tale. Chapter 6.)\n\nWhen I asked the Atlantic for comment, a spokesperson responded that the magazine has \"a large number of contributors who represent a broad spectrum of views\". She wrote that while \"diverse viewpoints\" are core to the magazine's mission, they have \"strict standards for how these viewpoints are expressed in our pages\".\n\nIn other words, The Atlantic doesn't mind employing a marquis columnist who thinks women should be hanged for having abortions so long as he doesn't say as much in the magazine.\n\nBut believing America should execute women in genocidal numbers (one in four women in this country will have an abortion) is not a \"diverse viewpoint\" - and the fact that one of the nation's leading political magazines could defend it as such indicates a serious moral crisis in mainstream media.\n\nGlass half full\n\nThe March for Our Lives is this weekend in Washington - and I, for one, cannot wait to see America's kids in action. (Already this week they've guest edited Guardian US.)\n\nWhat I'm RTing Who I'm reading\n\nCecile Richards in her new book, Make Trouble; the inimitable Elena Ferrante on feminism; and the New York Times in an incredible look at just how much racism black boys face.\n\nWhat I'm watching\n\nA video on why female condoms are so damn hard to get.\n\nHow outraged I am\n\nTwitter is failing women. In a new Amnesty report, the human rights organization shows the sheer vitriol directed at women on Twitter and how the social media company does little to remedy it. (Full disclosure - the harassment I've faced is part of the report.) On a scale of one to 10, I'm at an eight - mostly because I'm too tired to be any more furious.\n\nHow I'm making it through this week\n\nFriday was National Puppy Day (I LOVE these made up internet holidays) and the pictures did not disappoint.",

                "body": "The singer, 36, talks about being a shy child, how her mother taught her about empathy and why life is all about phases\n\nMotherhood is the best and the worst thing I'll ever do. The beginning is awful. Your body gets turned inside out and there's no gratitude for it afterwards. But after six months, it's the most amazing thing. I have a problem with breastfeeding though. Your child won't even look at you. It's so rude. They don't look at you adoringly. They're just: \"Shut up, bitch, give me your tit.\"\n\nI was a very insular and shy child. Every extrovert is a closet introvert. When I was 15 I decided I'd had enough of being manipulated by other people and being what other people wanted me to be, and I decided to change everything. I'd accept invites to parties I wouldn't have had before. I'd volunteer for stuff in class I hadn't before. It was a conscious effort. I felt like I was dying inside. I had to force it, but then it became very natural.\n\nMy mum is a socialist and I had that drummed into me as a child - the idea that everyone deserves to live a good life. I'm not very religious, but before bed every night, she'd make me pray. She'd tell me to say goodnight to all the dead relatives, to the trees and the sky, and then she'd put bits in from the day to thank people who'd invited us for dinner, or to think of the person we'd seen on the street asking for money, or the person on the news dealing with something. That taught me about empathy.\n\nKindness has become very uncool. But I think it's the coolest. The world needs empathy so badly right now because nobody is immune to any problem. People can become homeless so easily. People's lives can fall apart. If someone in this government made a very bad decision, we could be seeking asylum in another country. We need to close the distance between people.\n\n#MeToo is complex. There are far too many issues to deal with in one hashtag. There are two major problems. One is everyday sexism. There is inequality between men and women, and there are sweeping statements made about women that are incorrect based on socially cultivated prejudice. And the other is much more extreme - where people have been raped, or abused, or had other horrendous things happen to them by powerful men. I think it's really difficult to have a conversation about those things when you lump them all in together.\n\nI'm a decent cook. Paella is my specialty. I'm half Spanish so it's a nostalgic food for me; it reminds me of childhood. Also, not a lot of people can make a proper paella, so people find it impressive when I serve it for them. I normally just follow Jamie Oliver's cookbook.\n\nMy baby has taught me I'm capable of anything. I think that's why many women have children and come back and do better than they have before. I'm much more confident about my inadequacies. I don't care about them any more.\n\nLife is hard, having a child with someone is hard. But I've realised that life is all about phases. If you hang in there and do the work, you will get out the other side. You'll survive. There were times after I had my child when I thought: \"This can't be for ever!\" But then you come out the end of the year and you realise: \"Oh yeah, I do love you!\"\n\nI've always been a piss-taker. I think people take life too seriously. I bumped into an old teacher of mine the other day, and he said: \"Paloma, you were always capable of fitting into any subculture,\" and I think it was just because I liked a laugh. There are things that are serious, but a lot isn't.\n\nPaloma's new album, The Architect, is out now. For tour dates, go to palomafaith.com",

                "body": "Outgoing correspondent Shaun Walker discusses the challenges of covering Moscow, and his hopes for his new beat - Budapest\n\nShaun Walker spent over a decade reporting from Moscow and has recently written a book about the Putin era and the search for a new Russian identity. As he prepares to start a new life as the Guardian's central and eastern Europe correspondent, he reflects on his years in the country\n\nWhy did you first decide to become a journalist?\n\nI always wanted to write, but I came to journalism through Russia, rather than vice versa. I'd studied Russian and Soviet history at university and went to Russia to learn the language when I graduated. I planned to stay for a year and ended up staying for 14 - first working for an NGO, then a local magazine, then for the Independent for six years and the Guardian for the past four and a half.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being a foreign correspondent?\n\nThe incredible variety. You aren't confined to a thematic specialisation and have a whole region to cover, so in the space of a month I could move from covering the war in eastern Ukraine, to high Kremlin politics, to stories about the ballet or Russian cuisine. I met presidents, billionaires, warlords and cosmonauts, as well as many \"ordinary\" people who turned out to have extraordinary stories. Of course, it can be mentally tough to cover abuses of power, injustice and inequalities. But the core of the job is learning about the world and meeting people who are always interesting and sometimes inspiring. It's an incredible privilege - I can't think of anything I'd rather be doing.\n\nCan you tell us a bit about what it's actually like to live in Moscow?\n\nMoscow has become immeasurably more liveable during the time I've been there. As the political climate got worse, the city got better, with nicer places to eat and drink and an urban makeover that means there are many more pedestrianised zones and fantastic parks. There is also a slow but noticeable change in attitudes: Moscow is becoming a much friendlier place, which is partly a generational thing, I think.\n\nWere you ever prevented from going anywhere or covering particular stories?\n\nOn the whole, except for border zones and the Arctic, you can travel to most places in Russia with no problems (though the immense distances can sometimes pose logistical challenges). The issue is usually more about access. Many people are alarmed by the idea of talking to a foreign journalists and some topics are really difficult. The whole story about Russian electoral interference has been hard to cover from Moscow. While there are still people around the Kremlin who can give insider information on internal politics, the world of intelligence and security is completely closed off. The recent story about the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, for example: there's not all that much you can do in Moscow except listen to angry denials.\n\nLooking back at your time there, which story are you proudest of?\n\nProbably the most extraordinary standalone story I wrote during my time in Russia was the tale of the two sons of Russian deep cover spies. The kids thought their parents were Canadians until the FBI came knocking on the door and it turned out they were actually KGB agents from Siberia. The family was deported back to Russia and the two young men had to start life in a country they had never visited, and come to terms with the years of lies from their parents.\n\nThe first six months of 2014 were the most intense period of my career so far - from the revolution on Maidan in Kiev, through the annexation of Crimea, the war in eastern Ukraine and the downing of MH17. It was an exhausting and depressing story to cover but extraordinary to bear witness to such momentous events. The brazen Russian lying and disinformation around the conflict was frustrating and tiring, but officials in Kiev and western diplomats also often had skewed ideas about what was going on. I realised that there were very few people who were able to speak to all parties in the conflict: officials in Moscow and Kiev, separatist warlords, ordinary people on both sides of the lines.\n\nWhat are the challenges of being a foreign correspondent?\n\nOne of the hardest things about working in Russia is that so many people believe all journalists are biased and that it's impossible that a western journalist would even try to be objective. These days, of course, that's an issue journalists are facing not only in Russia.\n\nIn fact, many of the challenges foreign correspondents face are the same as those for all journalists. I have been thinking a lot about the responsibilities of journalists recently. My book has just come out, and doing promotion for it has been an instructive experience. Often, when interviews I've given about the book are published, I've felt my ideas were quoted out of context, or am confused as to why people have picked out particular strands. It can be very disconcerting to have a long conversation appear in print as two or three quotes, which of course is what we do with our interviewees all the time. Being on the other side of the interview is a very good reminder of how much trust people are putting in you when they agree to tell you their stories.\n\nYou're heading to Budapest next. What are you most looking forward to in your new beat?\n\nCentral and eastern Europe is a fascinating region that seems to have been a bit overlooked in recent years. When most of the former Warsaw Pact countries joined the EU, many people assumed it was a kind of End of History moment, of peace and harmony on a united, democratic European continent. Now, leaders in Hungary, Poland and elsewhere are challenging that consensus, the UK has voted to leave the EU, and all the certainties of a decade ago suddenly seem fragile. I'm looking forward to exploring the bigger stories and trends - the rejection of liberalism, the effects of Brexit and the role Russia is playing in the region.",

                "title": "'Charismatic' Charles Leclerc poised to lift Sauber to a different level",
                "body": "When the lights go out at Albert Park to usher in the new Formula One season on Sunday morning, performances at the sharp end of the grid will be under intense scrutiny. For Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, the Australian Grand Prix is a long-standing return to the day job, but for Charles Leclerc the race is heavy with import, personal and professional.\n\nWhen the young Monégasque lines up on the grid, it will be the culmination of one lifelong dream and the beginning of another as he attempts to emulate the success of the two four-times world champions ahead of him on the grid.\n\nIn July of last year, midway through his domination of the Formula 2 series and on his way to winning the championship, Leclerc was at the Hungaroring where, despite his success and being part of the Ferrari Driver Academy, a future in F1 still seemed a long way off. \"It would be a lie if I said I don't think about it. I do,\" he told me at the time. \"Sometimes I just dream about it but for now it is a dream and I need to make it a reality.\" In Australia he has palpably done so and in remarkably short order.\n\nOnly 20 years old, Leclerc will start for a reinvigorated Sauber team who, while firmly still at the back of the grid, harbour ambitious intent of which he is a fundamental part. The team have a new deal to use this year's Ferrari engines. They are branded as Alfa Romeo, a welcome return for the marque that brings a glorious swathe of red to the white Sauber livery. More important, Alfa is owned by Ferrari and the deal comes with the strong backing of its president, Sergio Marchionne. He wants to see the brand and Leclerc do well.\n\nThe workforce at Hinwil in Switzerland has increased and will continue to do so throughout the year and the car they have produced is an entirely new concept. Complex and aggressive, it has proved a handful to drive and they have as yet to unlock its potential. Pace, they believe, is coming, though not in Australia.\n\nFor Leclerc, it is part of his journey to what is expected to become a seat with Ferrari but, much as he has revelled in coming so far, it is but the first step. \"It feels amazing,\" he says. \"But once you sign you immediately have another goal and another dream. It feels great because I achieved what I have wanted since I was very young but on the other hand I can't stay on that positive note for too long, this is only the beginning.\"\n\nLeclerc has been through an emotional mill to get this far. The death of Jules Bianchi, his godfather and close friend after a crash at the Japanese Grand Prix in 2014 was hard to deal with. Then last year his father died before the fourth round of the F2 season at Baku. He weathered those blows and showed great maturity to maintain his success on track.\n\nBoth of these huge influences on his life will be remembered by the driver on Sunday. \"My father worked for the last 18 years before he passed for me to get to that point so I will think of him,\" he says. \"Jules helped me a lot and we were hoping to race together but that did not happen, so I will think of them both in Melbourne. It will be a special weekend for me. It will feel very, very special.\"\n\nIn 2016 Leclerc won the GP3 series at his first attempt, with Frédéric Vasseur's ART team. Vasseur had also worked with Leclerc in karting and, now the principal at Sauber, the Frenchman is well placed to judge his new charge. \"I know perfectly that he's fast,\" he says. \"But the most important thing for me is to have someone charismatic in the team. Able to motivate the guys to be bring the team with him and to be pushy when he has to be pushy and to try and calm everybody down when he has to.\"\n\nThis is a tall order for someone new to F1 but one on which Vasseur feels confident Leclerc can deliver and that will be invaluable should he make it to Ferrari. But Leclerc can be forgiven a brief time to enjoy the moment on the grid in Melbourne, aware that the real task is just beginning.\n\n\"F1 always feels unreal until you arrive and get your first seat,\" he says. \"When I think about it, it is quite crazy to race against people like Fernando Alonso, when I remember watching him from the balcony in Monaco. But you quickly come back to earth and realise you have to work, this season is very important for me and I really need to deliver.\"\n\nSauber are hopeful they can bring out the best in their car given time. Should they do so, they will be joining what will be hugely competitive midfield for whom Australia is only the opening round of what is likely to be a bruising season-long bout.\n\nBehind the big three of Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull, competition for fourth will be fierce. The greatest step forward is expected from McLaren. Having ditched Honda for Renault engines and been bullish about the quality of their chassis, a move to the top of the midfield is their minimum target. Reliability problems plagued testing and Alonso has warned that the Australian Grand Prix is likely to be the team's low point. Having had a short lead time in integrating the engine to the car, the Spaniard is optimistic that rafts of planned upgrades will pay dividends especially in the second part of the season.\n\nTheir difficult task will be compounded by a works Renault team fielding their strongest car for several seasons, Force India once again showing they will be able to punch above their weight and the potential dark horses Haas, who have brought a simple but highly effective concept and package to the new season that has proved impressively quick in Australia. The gap to the front remains but behind them margins are going to be tiny.",

The system is expected to give way to snow in northern, central and eastern parts of the UK from Wednesday, although major disruption is not likely.\n\n\"We're now a lot further into spring than at the beginning of March. The ground is warmer, the sun is stronger because it is higher in the sky and we have more hours of daylight at the end of March compared with the beginning of the month.

                "body": "* County confirm interest in signing cricket's biggest name\n\n* Kohli keen to tune up for English conditions before August Test\n\nSurrey have confirmed their interest in signing Virat Kohli on a possible short-term deal before India's Test series in England this summer.\n\nReports on Saturday suggested a deal has already been struck, with the Indian captain expected to miss the one-off Test with Afghanistan in Bangalore on 20 June and a Twenty20 series with Ireland in order to tune up for English conditions.\n\nAlec Stewart, the county's director of cricket, insists this is not the case but should the timings work and the Indian board give it the all clear then the draw of signing the sport's biggest name is undeniable.\n\n\"I did enquire a while back about Kohli when it appeared to be a possible option for him to play county cricket but was told by the BCCI that India were playing Ireland in T20s and an inaugural Test v Afghanistan in June,\" said Stewart. \"If he does now become available we would look at it again to see if it could potentially work around our current overseas arrangements.\"\n\nSurrey already have Mitchell Marsh as their overseas player for the 2018 season but Australia's five-match one-day series against England, starting on 13 June, would open up a three-week need for a replacement. It would in theory give Kohli three Division One fixtures - versus Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl, Somerset at Guilford and Yorkshire at Scarborough - before India's tour begins with the first of three Twenty20s at Old Trafford on 3 July.\n\nThe five-Test series that starts at Edgbaston on 1 August is what sits firmly in Kohli's sights, of course, with success against the red Duke ball in England the one glaring gap his otherwise stellar cricketing CV. The 29-year-old's previous Test tour of England in 2014 saw him return just 134 runs from 10 innings as India succumbed to a 3-1 series defeat. Kohli has previously said he was \"thankful\" for the effect this had on his career.\n\nSpeaking about the chance to play county cricket in future during India's 4-0 home victory over England in 2016 -- a series dominated by his batting -- Kohli said: \"I would love a month to get used to playing in the conditions and understand what the wickets play like in that phase of the year.\"",

                "body": "Glasgow is making a play to become the new headquarters for Channel 4 with the support of Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister.\n\nThe city's audacious challenge to rivals such as Birmingham, Liverpool, Cardiff and Manchester is being backed by senior Scottish television executives as well as Channel 4's former head of nations and regions Stuart Cosgrove.\n\nThe broadcaster, which is government owned but funded chiefly by advertising revenue, said this month it was moving its headquarters out of London and would establish three new \"hubs\" in the nations and regions of the UK in an effort to diversify its output.\n\nLong-resisted by Channel 4 executives, the move will see about 300 posts being relocated, including a number of Channel 4 News jobs, though 500 staff will remain at its central London base.\n\nGlasgow's backers argue the city is an ideal fit for Channel 4 given its thriving contemporary arts scene, ethnic and urban diversity, and its independent broadcasting sector.\n\nSturgeon signalled Glasgow's interest in bidding when she addressed the Edinburgh TV festival in August: \"Glasgow is, after all, a major creative industries hub which is already home to two other national broadcasters.\"\n\nSusan Aitken, leader of Glasgow city council, said the city had \"a high concentration of skills, academic excellence and a highly qualified workforce\" in a letter to Alex Mahon, Channel 4's chief executive.\n\nGlasgow has a major BBC production base, STV's headquarters and a small Channel 4 office that commissions Scottish productions, but it is competing with major cities closer to London that also have significant broadcasting industries.\n\nCardiff is home to the BBC production studios where Doctor Who is made; Greater Manchester includes the media city hub at Salford, while Birmingham also has a BBC production hub, a BBC \"drama village\" at Selly Oak and ITV's Gas Street studios.\n\nThe Scottish government and its arts agency, Creative Scotland, are putting much heavier emphasis on film and television spending after some years of relative neglect, including backing plans for new film studios close to Edinburgh. The hit historical fantasy Outlander is also partly made in Cumbernauld near Glasgow.\n\nThe BBC is increasing its investments in Scotland, including £30m for a new digital Scottish television channel broadcast from Glasgow. However, the latest report for the industry body Pact said only 4% of the UK's total broadcasting industry workforce was based in Scotland, compared with almost with 62% in London.\n\nDavid Smith, the Scottish representative on Pact, said: \"Glasgow is part of Channel 4's DNA. The city has a strong and diverse television culture, it is home to the producers of so many well-loved Channel 4 brands and the channel has had a base here since 1991. Moving the channel's national HQ to Glasgow would be clearest possible confirmation that Channel 4 is for all the UK.\"",

                "body": "When I first heard about Cynthia Nixon's foray into politics her queer qualifications weren't the first thing on my mind. That soon changed...\n\nChristine Quinn would like everyone to know that Cynthia Nixon is an \"unqualified lesbian\". You see Nixon, who is best known for her role in Sex and the City, hasn't completed the training required before one can apply for a highly-coveted lesbian license. This means she has no business running for political office. The very idea is outrageous!\n\nQuinn, who is best known for her role as a sore loser in the 2013 New York mayor race, made these comments to the New York Post on Tuesday, shortly after Nixon announced she was going to be challenging sitting governor Andrew Cuomo in September's Democratic primary. Cuomo, of course, is best known for his role in ensuring the New York subway remains the most dysfunctional mass transit system in the world.\n\nClearly Quinn never takes the subway, however, because she is supporting Cuomo in re-election and is very angry Nixon would have the temerity to throw herself into the race.\n\n\"Cynthia Nixon was opposed to having a qualified lesbian become mayor of New York City,\" Quinn told the Post. \"Now she wants an unqualified lesbian to be the governor of New York.\" One surmises from this that Quinn may still feel a tad resentful that Nixon didn't support her back in 2013.\n\nAfter all, rule no. 475 in the Complete Lesbian Handbook states that you must unequivocally support everyone who shares your sexual orientation even if you don't agree with their policies. But, obviously, Nixon hasn't read up on that.\n\nWhen I first heard the news about Nixon's foray into politics her queer qualifications weren't the first thing on my mind. So, I am thankful to Quinn for reminding me to get angry about it.\n\nThe problem with today's super-speed news cycle is that you can sometimes miss an opportunity to get outraged. This severely limits your opportunity to jump on Twitter or Facebook (although I guess we're not doing that anymore) and explain to everyone why your righteous anger means you are much better than everyone else.\n\nAs a public service then, I've rounded up a few other important issues you might want to get outraged about this week.\n\nMarlon Bundo is unqualified to be a gay bunny\n\nThere are currently two books about bunnies on the bestseller list. One is by Charlotte Pence, the daughter of Vice President Mike Pence. It features the family rabbit and is called \"Marlon Bundo's Day in the Life of the Vice President.\" This would be cute if it wasn't for the fact that it helps humanize a man with terrifying views who wants to disenfranchise women and minorities.\n\nThe other book was released by John Oliver. It's a parody of the Pence publication in which Marlon Bundo is gay. The book is a fun way to make a point about Pence's vile views on same-sex relationships and all the proceeds go to two good causes: the Trevor Project and AIDS United. Great, right?\n\nWrong. If you derive even the smallest amount of amusement from Oliver's book you are a simpleton and probably a homophobe. \"Why is the rabbit, gay exactly?\" demanded a Slate article, explaining why Oliver's bunny book is bad.\n\n\"Bunnies can't be gay, not in the sense that makes you a target of hatred and oppression; that's only for humans.\" The writer goes on to explain that \"living as a real live gay person in the Trump era is not very funny -- in fact, it's by turns terrifying and exhausting.\"\n\nI am also a real live gay person living in the Trump era and I confess I hadn't realized that I ought to be so angry about this bunny book. But Slate is right. Marlon Bundo is unqualified to be a homosexual rabbit; the idea is utterly outrageous and frankly quite offensive.\n\nJordan Peterson is being oppressed again\n\nSpeaking of a lack of qualifications, I would like to remind everyone that there does not exist a human on this earth qualified to criticize Jordan Peterson. You see Peterson, the controversial Toronto professor who seems to have become a god amongst not-very-intelligent men, is the most cerebral man in the world, and if you think he is a pretentious bigot you clearly don't have the intellect to understand him.\n\nSuch was the substance of a series of extremely angry tweets fired off by Peterson this week in response to a critical article in the New York Review of Books by Panjak Mishra.\n\nPeterson is always telling people that they must \"toughen up\" and not take offence, but clearly Mishra's review was far too offensive to ignore. But don't worry, Peterson put the guy in his place. \"And you call me a fascist? he tweeted at Mishra. \"You sanctimonious prick. If you were in my room at the moment, I'd slap you happily.\" Very intellectual insult that. Very smart man, Peterson. The absolute smartest.\n\nUnpatriotic passports will be the ruin of Britain\n\nFinally, I take you to the UK, where a heated debate about passports is going on. The post-Brexit passport is going to be a very British shade of blue; a real win for patriots who have long been horrified by the passport's current red hues. However, it seems this new passport will be made by a Franco-Dutch firm.\n\nThis is an absolute outrage and the Daily Mail devoted half its front page on Friday to a banner asking Britain's rule class \"Why DO you hate our country, its history, culture and the people's sense of identity?\" It's a difficult question with no easy answers. Probably someone should ask Jordan Peterson.",

                "title": "From Luke Shaw to Marc Albrighton: 10 underrated Premier League players | Nick Miller",
                "body": "Marc Albrighton (Leicester City)\n\nAt various points during their title-winning season, praise was shared around the Leicester side. Jamie Vardy, N'Golo Kanté and Riyad Mahrez were the obvious ones, Wes Morgan, Danny Drinkwater and Kasper Schmeichel got their plaudits too, but Marc Albrighton went under the radar. And so he still does, despite his game improving further since then. What is particularly impressive about Albrighton, aside from his tireless work rate and fizzing delivery from the flanks, is that his performance levels do not seem to drop whether he is playing on the right or left, wing or wing-back, or wherever he's asked to play.\n\nBen Davies (Tottenham Hotspur)\n\nBy now, none of Tottenham's attacking players can qualify as underrated. At various points they have all been proudly lauded by Mauricio Pochettino as among the best in the world, in most cases quite correctly. Ben Davies is a slightly different matter, not least because most of the discussion around their left-back/wing-back slot concentrates on Danny Rose no longer being in the team. But Pochettino would not keep Rose on the bench just to make a point: he is able to omit Rose because Davies has been so solid this term. He is not the best player in this Spurs side, but he might be the most underrated.\n\nPascal Gross (Brighton)\n\nIf someone were to sell you a car, a top-of-the-range model that would usually go for £25,000-plus, but they ask for only £3,000, you would gleefully skip away with the vehicular bargain of the year. That is essentially what Brighton did when they bought Pascal Gross from Ingolstadt last summer: while most other clubs were breezily splashing flamboyant fees on players without a second thought, the Seagulls were charged £3m for Gross, the player who had created the most chances in the Bundesliga in the last two seasons. He has been a prolific creator in England too, so do not be surprised if it is Brighton fielding telephone number-length bids next summer.\n\nIdrissa Gueye (Everton)\n\nAfter being lauded for his scouting successes at Leicester, things have not gone quite as well for Steve Walsh at Everton. But one of his first signings has turned out nicely: Idrissa Gueye came to England with Aston Villa, not the greatest place to display his talents, but Walsh saw that he was better than he was showing in that spiralling Villa side. Which has proved to be the case at Everton, and he has been a rare consistent constant at the base of their midfield, while all else around him has looked rather less solid. A new four-year contract, signed in February, shows that Everton rate him at least.\n\nKi Sung-yueng (Swansea City)\n\nMilan's interest in a player is no longer quite the stamp of approval it once was, but the suggestion that Gennaro Gattuso's lot are keen on signing Ki Sung-yueng when his Swansea contract expires in the summer is at least an indication that the South Korean midfielder is handy. Which, of course, is a conclusion you could reach by watching him. An economical passer, Ki is one of those midfielders who keeps the ball moving, is stronger than his skinny frame suggests and was a key man as they escaped relegation last season. If they are to avoid that fate again, he will have to perform in similar fashion.\n\nJamaal Lascelles (Newcastle United)\n\nPlenty was made in the last two seasons of Jamaal Lascelles's maturity, and his willingness to tell senior colleagues some home truths when they needed telling. He was the straight-talker Newcastle needed. But all of that, while clearly admirable, tended to obscure his ability as a defender, and that might be why he is not as highly rated by those beyond Tyneside as he should be. All you really need to do to appreciate his importance to Newcastle is watch them play without him: their usually strong defence (they've conceded fewer goals than Arsenal) is greatly reduced without their leader.\n\nBen Mee (Burnley)\n\nIt was James Tarkowski who got the England call-up, and deservedly so, but those who watch Burnley every week will probably tell you that his central defensive partner has been just as impressive this season. Ben Mee, one of many players discarded by bigger clubs but who have rebuilt their careers under Sean Dyche, probably does not get more attention because he is not an especially attention-grabbing defender. He is the definition of unfussy, the sort of defender who you might not notice is there until he stops an opposition attack by simply being in the right place.\n\nPedro Obiang (West Ham United)\n\nThis season has been almost exclusively desperate for West Ham, from the owners, manager, most of the players and the stewards asked to stand in the way of marauding protesters. But Pedro Obiang has been one of the few bright spots, sometimes holding the midfield together with his fingertips, particularly standing out in the early days of David Moyes when things were looking a bit more promising. It is probably not a coincidence that West Ham's form has nosedived since Obiang suffered a knee injury: coping without him for the rest of the season will be a perilous business.\n\nLuke Shaw (Manchester United)\n\nThere are any number of ways to be underrated. Most Premier League players can live with social media indifference, most have to deal with rather more direct feedback during games, and they will struggle on after sniffy media appraisals too. But when your manager does not rate you, and what's more, seems to take every possible opportunity to publicly show his distaste, that will sting a little. José Mourinho's problem with Luke Shaw, whatever it is, might be well-founded, but for everyone's sake it should probably be resolved one way or another soon: this is a player too talented to be lost.\n\nWillian (Chelsea)\n\nIt's pretty hard to go under the radar in the Premier League, and impossible when you play for Chelsea. Plenty of people rate Willian very highly, not least Antonio Conte who will praise the Brazilian at any given opportunity, while more attention goes to Eden Hazard or N'Golo Kanté. What's notable about Willian is how he plays when the team around him is underperforming: he was Chelsea's best player in 2015-16 when they imploded under José Mourinho, and is on his way to being their top man this term as they struggle to grab a Champions League spot.",

                "body": "The author on living in a land of divisions and borders, small-town myths and generous skies\n\nThe Welsh word cynefin is often translated as \"habitat\" in English, but in usage it goes deeper than that: an individual's homeland, their topographical idiolect, the place where they belong. My favourite definition is \"a landscape which, as you step into it, feels like arriving at your hearth\". For me that hearth-place is the countryside within a 10-mile radius of the old Welsh longhouse outside Abergavenny my parents bought as newly weds. When I was three they moved the family to London. Six years later we returned to the longhouse where I lived for the rest of my childhood and teenage years.\n\nDespite those formative years in London, the life and culture I associated with that longhouse always remained \"home\". Wales, which we returned to nearly every weekend, offered me an access to otherness, to belonging within what felt like a more ancient, visceral world than the streets of Blackheath or Richmond.\n\nAs I grew older it was the internal borders of the area - social, linguistic and topographical - that became increasingly informative, its latticework of division and meeting between Welsh and English, the housing estate and the rural, the tended field and the wild plateau, the industrialised valleys and the low-lying market communities. My comprehensive school was what my mother called a \"proper comprehensive\", meaning that pretty much everyone went there. It was situated beneath a beautiful hill, but also one of the poorest housing estates in the country. Both filled my classroom windows - the graceful dome of the Deri's deciduous woodland rising above the grey pebbledash two-up, two-downs of Underhill Crescent.\n\nPlaying rugby, meanwhile, meant making frequent bus journeys into the south Wales valleys to witness yet another strikingly different way of living: poor in wealth, rich in community. And then, at the end of the school day, I'd get off the bus and return across the fields to that low house again, beyond the town, beyond the village, it's own defiant, isolated statement of location and already, for me, deeply clothed in association and memory.\n\nWhen I think of those adolescent years I remember them as a time of border crossings, of moving easily between extremes of natural beauty and petty violence, destructive young men and elemental hills, the claustrophobia of small-town life and the freedom of hilltop midsummer skies. And I remember, too, those crossings provoking my early attempts at trying to render in language what I saw and heard around me - the epiphanies of the natural world and stories from the unreported lives of people I had yet to find represented in my reading.\n\nThese attempts became my first poems - character sketches, moments from the secret myths of small-town big men, farmers, friends. That endeavour - to deploy the writer's voice as a conduit for the voices of others - has since become a consistent vein in my work. The early Welsh bards called themselves \"carpenters of song\", and that has always felt like the truest description of my writing, whether in poetry, prose or drama; an attempt to create a shape in words through dovetailing my voice with the experience of others. It was in Gwent's landscape of borders I began sharpening the tools for such work and where I first discovered a pressure to speak and a purpose as to why I should put the blade to the wood.\n\nThe Green Hollow by Owen Sheers will be published by Faber next month.",

Some days I'll just have coffee - plain black espresso -and not eat until lunchtime - just a lot of coffee. I am small, with a big round face, but all my life I've been a fat man struggling to burst out - I have an unstoppable Welsh appetite. I come from a family where, whether you were bored, sad, happy, going out or staying in, you ate. Eating is the reward I crave every day for the indignity of having to work. So about 15 years ago, in a bid to keep my weight down, I gave up carbs: I don't eat rice, pasta, bread, or potatoes.\n\nLunch\n\nI work from home, so I'll often go for a walk to buy salmon sashimi or a big soup and salad. Other days, I might make myself something to eat, but then I'll keep going and eat everything until the fridge is bare.\n\nSnacks\n\nI'm pretty good until the evening, when I'm watching TV and have a pavlovian reaction. My wife and I binge-watch, and I binge while I'm watching. Yoghurt, two pounds of grapes, loads of nuts, cheese. On tour, the difficulty is not doing so after the show is over. For porky actors, like me, post-show is when they start eating and drinking.\n\nI haven't had a drink in 35 years, and at 4pm I stop the coffee and stick to fizzy water.\n\nDinner\n\nOn tour I'll go to Waitrose and I buy smoked salmon, cheese, cherry tomatoes, a punnet of strawberries ... I eat out alot and if you don't make a fuss, it's easy to eat the way I do.\n\nI never, ever eat sugar ... except when it's Pudding Club: once a month, my daughter and I go to an expensive restaurant - or we raid the pudding section at M&S - and eat nothing but carbs and desserts.\n\nGriff Rhys Jones's Where Was I? is at Plough Arts Centre, Great Torrington, 24 March and the Courtyard Theatre, Hereford, on 29 March",

                "body": "With its subtle racial politics, this semi-autobiographical Brit comedy from the star of Luther and The Wire makes high art out of council-estate life\n\n\"Good evening, sir!\" shouts Valentine (Jimmy Akingbola) at a passing stranger on arrival at his new home on a London estate. \"Fuck off,\" comes the reply. The year is 1985, race riots are on the news, and, in this small corner of Hackney, the penny has yet to drop among some white residents that Africa is not a country.\n\nA labour of love for its creator and star, Idris Elba, In the Long Run tells the tale of an immigrant family making its way in Britain and is based on Elba's own childhood. While viewers might be surprised to find the words \"sitcom\" and \"the former Stringer Bell\" in such close proximity, more remarkable is that it features a majority black cast. Not since Desmond's and The Crouches have we seen so many black characters at the centre of a British comedy rather than residing ignominiously on the fringes as best friends and neighbours. That, in 2018, this is deemed unusual should see all senior TV commissioners forced to wear hair shirts as a public act of penance - I'm thinking a week for every series commissioned with all-white leading characters.\n\nElba plays factory worker Walter, who we first find reading a letter from back home in Sierra Leone. Walter's mother is concerned about his younger brother. \"[Valentine] has become unruly,\" she complains. \"I am too old to be chasing him around with my shoe.\" And so he is dispatched to live in London with Walter, his wife Agnes and their son Kobna. A professional footballer turned DJ, Valentine isn't keen on hard work - \"People work nine to five here,\" says Walter. \"That's a very long time,\" replies Valentine in alarm. Instead, he likes to party hard. As well as igniting a carnival atmosphere in local pubs, he sends delighted ripples through the uteruses of all women within a three-mile radius. No wonder Walter's friend Bagpipes (Bill Bailey), already punching above his weight with his young wife Kirsty, is looking worried.\n\nIn the Long Run is stylishly shot; bathed in oranges and ochres, it basks in the fabrics and furnishings of the era. The show also manages to make high art out of estate living, dwelling on the light reflected in the puddles on the walkways and on the tower blocks that glow with activity at night. Even the pub looks like an excellent place to be, with its swirly carpet, flock wallpaper and the abandoned sofa by the front door where kids wait for their parents to stagger out at closing time.\n\nMatters of racial politics are deliberately kept on the down-low here, though the ingrained prejudice on the estate is clear. When an elderly neighbour complains to Agnes about the proliferation of \"coloureds\" in the community, she hastily adds, \"No offence, love. I know you're not like that.\"\n\nIn the Long Run is less likely to prompt belly laughs than instil a warm glow, and has the unmistakable feel of a comedy still finding its feet. At its heart, however, it's a joyful portrait of community and camaraderie, of home and belonging, of dreams and joie de vivre. \"I'm going to make my mark here,\" Valentine tells his nephew. He's already on his way.\n\nThursday 29 March, 10pm, Sky1",

                "body": "It is stubbornness on my part, but I refuse to give up leeks. The allium leaf miner is a pesky thing that has taken up residence around here and likes to shred anything in the allium family, though it seems especially partial to garlic, leeks and bulbing onions.\n\nI've given up on onions, but I can't bring myself to give up leeks and garlic. I cover everything I grow with fine mesh netting from March onwards. The leaf miner lays its eggs in two periods, March-April, then that lot hatch and lay eggs in October and November, making overwintering leeks very vulnerable. It's tiny, only 3mm long, and thus often finds cracks and holes to make its way to its progeny's favourite dinner. Garlic can soldier on, but I find the leeks are often in tatters and then rot over the winter.\n\nThis year I am going to employ a different method. I'm going slim and small. I'm going to successionally sow leeks and pick them when they are a little fatter than my thumb, but not much more. This is an excellent trick for small gardens regardless of miners: you can fit many skinny baby leeks in where spacing for mature leeks would be prohibitive, and they taste heavenly - delicate with not a hint of toughness.\n\nRather than sow leeks now for transplanting out just when the miner is on the wing, I'm going to sow in situ (leeks germinate best in soils at 10-15C) from the third week of April into June; I'll sow them in wide drills, aiming to get the seed 1cm apart, with 15cm between rows. I'll pull the leeks when they are 15-20cm high (after about 13 weeks).\n\nI'm hoping to miss the majority of flies, and even if I do get a few infestations, they will be pulled before the second generation can take hold. Of course, if you don't have leaf miner, sow a batch indoors now and be eating leeks by June. Choose fast-growing, early varieties such as 'Nipper', 'Bulgaarse Reuzen-Lincoln' or 'Sprintan' F1.\n\nYou don't have to limit yourself to baby leeks: beetroot and turnips are far superior when picked small and sweet. Space the seed 2.5cm apart in rows 20cm apart, or patches or blocks with the seed 5cm apart in every direction. Thin to 7.5-10cm apart for perfect small beet and turnips. You should get about 30 plants per 30cm2 and be ready to pick within 9-12 weeks. If you give them a little wider spacing, say 15cm between plants, you can encourage very rapid growth indeed.",

                "body": "Owen Smith has called Jeremy Corbyn's decision to sack the former shadow Northern Ireland secretary a \"mistake\", and defended his choice to break with Labour party policy by calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.\n\nSmith, who was sacked on Friday evening after writing an article in the Guardian on the issue, said his decision to openly support a second Brexit vote was based on principle, and warned the Labour party was in danger of \"sleepwalking\" towards adopting a Brexit position that would damage the British economy.\n\nIt comes as Corbyn was entangled in another antisemitism row after the Labour leader admitted he had been wrong to support a graffiti artist in 2012 whose work in London's East End contained apparently Jewish bankers playing a game of Monopoly, with their tabletop resting on the bowed naked backs of several workers.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday morning, Smith said it was clear that Corbyn wanted to adopt a more Eurosceptic position on the Brexit process than he did, and said Labour needed to \"show leadership on the issue\".\n\n\"It's the biggest economic crisis that our country will have faced for many, many generations, and I think there is a danger that we sleepwalk towards effectively supporting a soft Brexit outcome that we know is going to be damaging to our economy,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the first instance I can think of in living memory when a government is pursuing a policy that they know is going to make our economy smaller and reduced people's livelihoods and life chances, and I cannot understand why we in Labour would support that.\"\n\nThe shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, backed the decision to sack Smith, and said the MP for Pontypridd could not sit on the Labour frontbench and advance a position that is not Labour party policy.\n\nSmith said in response: \"It's interesting to have Dianne Abbot defending the decision. She said something very similar just a couple of months ago and she hasn't been sacked.\n\n\"For Jeremy Corbyn in particular, who's always understood the value of people standing by their principles. It's the position that he's often adopted, and it's certainly a value in him that others have extolled and, in truth, I think that's all I've done. I've stood by my principles on what I think is the most important economic and security issue facing our country for generations. Labour needs to shift its position and that's what I was trying to achieve.\"\n\nSmith's sacking is likely to further inflame tensions in the Labour party over Brexit. On Friday, the former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain said Smith had been the victim of \"terrible Stalinist purge\".\n\nSmith refused to be drawn on Corbyn's latest antisemitism row in the Today interview.\n\nIn 2012, Corbyn had offered his support to the American street artist Mear One, whose mural had been scrubbed off a wall after a number of complaints over its antisemitic imagery.\n\nIn response to a Mear One Facebook post about the mural after the artist learned it was going to be removed, Corbyn responded: \"Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.\"",

                "body": "If England are trounced in New Zealand Test series the ECB will come under increasing scrutiny for agreeing to this schedule\n\nIt is taking a while for England's batsmen to have a chance to get back in the saddle after being bowled out for a paltry 58 in their first innings. On Friday and Saturday there were just 26 overs of cricket at Eden Park and those batsmen dutifully shuffled around the field, no doubt noting that the ball was not jagging around quite so deviously as on Thursday afternoon and wondering whether they might do a bit better when their next chance comes along.\n\nAll this rain could be construed as good news for England supporters. Perhaps it was possible to spy a path out of this mess after all. It would be long and difficult and would probably require the batsmen to occupy the crease about six or seven times longer than they managed on Thursday. But survival was now a possibility. The batting coach, Graham Thorpe, acknowledged on Saturday evening \"the weather gives us a glimmer\".\n\nAfter an almost blank Saturday - there were 17 balls before the rain, enough for Henry Nicholls to register his half-century - there remained a minimum of 198 overs in this match. New Zealand led by 175 runs. With the forecast improving it seemed that England would have to bat for more than four sessions to save the game, an outcome that would fill Harry Houdini with pride and some surprise after that capitulation on Thursday. Not since 1902 has a side scoring 58 or less escaped with a draw in Test cricket - on that occasion the Australians were saved by rain in Birmingham.\n\nThursday's collapse was jaw-dropping. The Kiwis could not believe what was happening. \"Never in our wildest dreams did we expect that\", said Trent Boult. Jimmy Anderson had never witnessed anything quite like it either and it was hard to gauge whether he was indulging in some deadpan humour when he said: \"It's not ideal. But it happens\".\n\nThose of us who are supposed to be experts were invited to deliver a simple and immediate explanation for such a hapless batting display. We did our best. It's the woeful preparation in Hamilton; it's too much white ball cricket; it's the pink ball; the players are too jaded; or too rusty; or too blasé; or too pampered. They can't block; they can't battle and their feet looked stuck in drying cement. It's the selectors; the coach; or the captain. Michel Barnier. It's the ludicrous schedule on England's longest tour since 1962-63; it's the poverty of county cricket and the ridiculous domestic schedule, which will only get worse. We could even fall back on the excellence of Boult, who had the impudence to make the ball move at pace. Take your pick.\n\nThere is probably a grain of truth in most of the reasons above. My favourite probably centres on the scheduling. The players will not complain about this since some of them are eager to pop off to the Indian Premier League straight after this series and they recognise that they are getting well paid for their work by England and by their T20 franchises. They can hardly whinge. The multi-format players may be jaded; the Test specialists may be rusty. But this schedule is regarded as a matter of absolute commercial necessity. All those white-ball internationals have to be played and there is no time for any more red-ball preparation since the IPL is underway immediately after the Christchurch Test. How can the value of a balanced cricketing schedule ever compete with all that?\n\nIf England are trounced in this Test series the England and Wales Cricket Board will come under increasing scrutiny for agreeing to this winter's schedule, which will add to the mounting disquiet over how they are running the game at home. Test cricket, as opposed to the Test match venues in England, now appears to be low in their priorities. In 2020 first-class cricket will, to an even greater extent, take place at the margins of the season, while the prime months for playing cricket - June, July and August - will be mainly devoted to two T20 competitions. Fast bowlers and spinners, which the Test team badly needs, are seldom required in first class cricket in April and early May; they may not be that essential in late September. Once again the prospect of commercial gain easily trumps the pursuit of a balanced schedule and a potent Test team.\n\nThe ECB seems more concerned that those counties with Test grounds, which are also the chosen venues for the new T20 tournament to be introduced in 2020, are in good shape come the brave new world. Glamorgan, for example, have just announced that \"2017 has been a good financial year\" with \"an underlying profit of £1.646m\". The same release confirms that they have received £2.5m in compensation\" from the ECB. Why? For \"not applying to host Test matches from 2020 to 2024\". They are not the only Test match ground to receive substantial sums for not hosting a Test match. If this trend continues I'm hoping that someone will pay me not to write articles. Perhaps the ECB will oblige.\n\nKnowledge of these handouts has led to increasing exasperation among those counties not on the Test rota, who do not appear to figure much in the ECB's plans (though they have been promised an annual £1.3m handout from 2020. Why? For not hosting matches in the new T20 tournament, of course, and, ahem, agreeing to those new T20 plans).\n\nBut now those non-Test match counties are beginning to realise that they have been sleepwalking towards their own demise over the last couple of years. Back in Auckland any more sleepwalking from England's batsmen and they head to Christchurch one down in the series.",

I am a communication specialist and make sure they are asked questions they understand and give the answers they want to give.\n\nLast year, registered intermediaries (RIs) like me supported around 6,000 vulnerable people to give evidence. Our input helped them find the courage to do this, kept them going once they'd started, and made their evidence easier for juries to understand.\n\nWe're a new profession that started about 10 years ago. We are a small band of around 135 people covering England and Wales and have already influenced change within the criminal justice system. Sadly, our funding is woefully inadequate and we can help a only tiny percentage of those entitled to our service. Our help falls far short of the 20,000 child sexual abuse cases that are reported to the police every year.\n\nSo much more could be achieved in providing equal access to justice if the scheme were properly resourced. We spend a lot of time, and arguably waste public resources, travelling huge distances. One week I went to south Wales, Wiltshire and Cornwall to assist with police interviews. Some intermediaries choose to work with defendants in family courts, or in Department for Work and Pensions appeals.\n\nWe are desperately short of male intermediaries, and have all sat with men as they are questioned about their abuse. It's not always a problem. But surely it would be better, on such sensitive issues, to offer a choice between a man and a woman.\n\nWhile many cases are handled sensitively, there is always the risk that people can't explain themselves without our support. We are trained teachers, speech and language therapists, mental health nurses, psychologists. Some of our skills are quite niche. I have worked with many people with autism who are selectively mute, for example, and other RIs have used eye-blink technology with people who can no longer speak, or symbol communication systems for the adults with learning disabilities who were abused in their care homes. These are professional skills that take years to hone.\n\nThe needs of vulnerable people are often neglected and our skills can be underplayed. In part this is because our expertise is not always visible - people don't see the hours of joint work with barristers that it takes to turn their six-page cross examination into two pages of child-friendly questions, with pictures to help understanding. Once those questions are well formulated, I'll sit, with intense concentration, next to someone as they answer. I'll be weighing up whether each question was understood, but I won't necessarily need to say a word.\n\nWe spend hours waiting with people with autism before they go into court, trying to distract them. We manage precariously high levels of strain for adults on the verge of giving up, and spend time preparing visual props so that people can show, rather than tell, what happened. One of the worst parts of the job is public denigration in the court room. One barrister caustically called me Madam Interrupter to undermine me and win his case.\n\nAn overwhelming percentage of people in prison have speech, language and communication difficulties - too easily, they find themselves bewildered and without a voice in the criminal justice system, where the language and pace is almost impossible for many to understand. If you don't understand the process of your trial, or have support to give your evidence, how can the trial be fair? Sometimes people are defendants because their vulnerability has been exploited.\n\nAs our profession comes of age, surely the public deserves a robust system of recruitment, training and quality assurance to ensure safety of provision within the law. Our work is part of an important re-evaluation of who, in our society, is \"capable\" of giving evidence and being heard. We urgently need greater resourcing - our best practice is superb - but the limitations of the scheme put the notion of justice in jeopardy.\n\nEsther Rumble is a registered intermediary and member of Intermediaries for Justice\n\nThis series gives a voice to the staff behind the public services that are hit by mounting cuts and rising demand, and so often denigrated by the press, politicians and public.

                "body": "Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans, on the removal of four Confederate monuments and what it means for the city's future\n\nHere I was, the mayor of New Orleans, in the midst of a building boom like no other, the city filled with million-dollar construction jobs, and I couldn't find anyone in town who would rent me a crane.\n\nThe people of the city of New Orleans, through their elected government, had made the decision to take down four Confederate monuments - statues of Robert E Lee, Jefferson Davis and Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, and a monument honoring the White League, a Reconstruction era organization of racial militants - and it wasn't sitting well with some of the powerful business interests in the state.\n\nWhen I put out a bid for contractors to take the statues down, a few responded. But they were immediately attacked on social media, got threaten­ing calls at work and at home, and were, in general, harassed. Afraid, most nat­urally backed away.\n\nOne contractor stayed with us - but then his car was firebombed. From that moment on, I couldn't find anyone willing to take the statues down.\n\nI tried aggressive, personal appeals. I did whatever I could. I personally drove around the city and took pictures of the countless cranes and crane companies working on dozens of active construction projects across New Orleans. My staff called every construction company and every project foreman. We were blacklisted. Opponents sent a strong message that any company that dared step forward to help the city would pay a price economically and even personally.\n\nCan you imagine? In the second decade of the 21st century, tactics as old as burning crosses or social exclusion, just dressed up a little bit, were being used to stop what was now an official act authorized by the government in the legislative, judicial, and executive branches.\n\nThis is the very definition of institutionalized racism. You may have the law on your side, but if someone else controls the money, the machines or the hardware you need to make your new law work, you are screwed. This is the difference between de jure and de facto discrimination in today's world. You can finally win legally, but still be completely unable to get the job done.\n\nAs I continued to look for someone who would tear down those monuments, I learned more and more that this is exactly what has happened to African Americans over the last three centuries. The picture painted by African Americans of institutional rac­ism is real -- and it was acting itself out on the streets of New Or­leans during this process in real time.\n\nLearning the story of these structures, why they were built and by whom, made clear to me, probably for the first time in my life, the lens through which many, though certainly not all, Southerners have seen our regional identity since the civil war.\n\nThe statues were not honoring history, or heroes. They were created as political weapons, part of an effort to hide the truth, which is that the Confederacy was on the wrong side of not just of history, but of humanity.\n\nThe monuments helped distort history, putting forth a myth of Southern chivalry, the gallant \"Lost Cause\", to distract from the terror tactics that deprived African Americans of funda­mental rights from the Reconstruction years through Jim Crow until the civil rights movement and the federal court decisions of the 1960s. Institutional inequities in the economic, education, criminal justice and housing systems exist to this very day.\n\nThe misuse of history is inflamed by the anger burning through demonstrations today, anger fueled by white suprem­acists and neo-Nazis who have stolen the meaning of Southern heritage from many whites who abhor their ideology but still hold hard to a rose-colored nostalgia for the past.\n\nI am well aware of the emotional investment of many Southerners whose ancestors fought in the civil war, of the popular interest in historical events, of how families lost loved ones, came through, and coped. I do not mean dishonor to these people. My concern is with the political meaning of the monuments in New Orleans, who put them there, and why: the perversion of history.\n\nOnce I learned the real history of these statues, I knew there was only one path forward, and that meant mak­ing straight what was crooked, making right what was wrong. It starts with telling the truth about the past.\n\nThese last eight years have given me the wonderful privi­lege of serving as mayor of the city where I was born and raised. New Orleans is a town with a song in its heart and a swing in its step. We also have a history of racial injustice that we must never stop confronting in order to build a stronger and more equitable city for all who call it home.\n\nIn the end, we got a crane. But even then, opponents at one point found their way to one of our machines and poured sand in the gas tank. Other protesters flew drones at the con­tractors to thwart their work. But we kept plodding through. We were successful, but only because we took extraordinary security measures to safeguard equipment and workers, and we agreed to conceal their identities.\n\nEveryone alive today has inherited this country's difficult history. The big message we should hear from the streets of Baltimore and Ferguson and Charlottesville and New Or­leans is that we are not done - we have more work to do.\n\nMitch Landrieu is the mayor of New Orleans\n\nAn excerpt from In the Shadow of Statues: A White Southerner Confronts History by Mitch Landrieu, published by Viking, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House, LLC.

                "title": "Canada: more arrests as protest against oil pipeline expansion heats up",
                "body": "One of Romilly Cavanaugh's first jobs was an environmental engineering position at the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which carries crude and refined oil across western Canada.\n\nTwo decades later, Cavanaugh was arrested for blocking the entrance of a facility belonging to her former employer, as part of a wider protest against plans to expand a pipeline snaking from Alberta's oil sands to the Pacific coast.\n\nShe was one of more than 115 people detained this week in the Canadian province of British Columbia as an indigenous-led protest against the Trans Mountain Expansion project heated up.\n\nOn Friday two federal MPs - Green party leader Elizabeth May and MP Kennedy Stewart of the New Democratic party - were arrested after they joined protesters attempting to block construction work related to the expansion. Elsewhere, more than 60 actions unfolded across Canada in a show of solidarity with the protests.\n\nSpearheaded by Texas-based Kinder Morgan, the C$7.4bn project proposes expanding an existing pipeline to lay nearly 1,000km of new pipeline from Alberta to Vancouver's coastline.\n\nThe project, which still needs be obtain numerous local permits and approvals, would nearly triple the flow of Alberta's landlocked bitumen to the west coast and dramatically increase oil tanker traffic in the Pacific.\n\nAfter Kinder Morgan launched preparatory work this month in Burnaby, near Vancouver, indigenous leaders called on people to raise their voices.\n\n\"Bold action is needed now,\" said Will George, a member of Tsleil-Waututh Nation. \"This is the moment to either stand with Indigenous Nations in the fight for a safe climate and clean water, or else watch as Kinder Morgan continues business as usual and destroys any chance for a safe and livable planet.\"\n\nAn estimated 10,000 people heeded the call, marching through the streets of Burnaby two weeks ago. The protests have continued ever since, attracting between 50 and a few hundred protesters each day, from toddlers to octogenarians.\n\nOthers across Canada have spoken out in support of the project, which would allow Canadian oil to access new global markets.\n\nAfter his government approved the plans in late 2016, Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, described it as the right decision for Canadians. \"Our duty is to permit infrastructure so Canada's resources get to market in a more environmentally responsible way, creating jobs and a thriving economy,\" he said.\n\nCavanaugh - who worked at Trans Mountain from 1991 to 1996 - was surprised to find herself in the spotlight.\n\nShe said that concerns over climate change, the risk of an oil spill and the several First Nations that have legally challenged federal approval of the project prompted her to turn up at the site on Tuesday and volunteer to join activists blocking the gates of the Kinder Morgan facility.\n\n\"I lived in fear when I worked for Trans Mountain, because the reality is that no amount of equipment or people is going to change the fact that in the event of a spill, they will be able to recover very little,\" she said. \"It's not that the company doesn't care. They do care. But the reality is, if there's a spill into a river or the ocean, there's very little they can do about it.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that things may have changed in the more than two decades since she left. \"And I'm sure they have gotten better,\" she said. Pointing to concerns about oil spills, particularly those involving diluted bitumen, she added: \"But the laws of nature and physics have not changed since the 90s.\"\n\nShe stressed that she was not anti-industry. \"But what I'm opposed to is building more fossil fuel infrastructure in the midst of a climate crisis. We need to be scaling back, not moving in this direction,\" she said. \"It's like Justin Trudeau is trying to promote Blockbuster video in a time of Netflix. What is he doing?\"\n\nThe belief is what pushed her - at the age of 55 - to be arrested for the first time in her life. \"It's a scary thought,\" she said. \"I can go to jail, I can have a very stiff fine, I can be sued by Kinder Morgan for what they say is damages to their business.\"\n\nAfter vowing to appear in court in June and not block the facility again, she was discharged. On Friday, Cavanaugh returned to the site to protest but stayed away from the gates of her former employer's facility. \"For me it was just important to get out there and take a stand against something that I think is a huge mistake.\"",

                "title": "Want to lower the abortion rate? Support pro-choice policies",
                "body": "The chief lesson of a new report is that making abortion illegal or hard to get doesn't end abortion, it just makes it less safe\n\nWant to lower the abortion rate and prevent maternal deaths worldwide? Support pro-choice policies. That's the takeaway from a new report from the Guttmacher Institute, which looks at abortion around the world.\n\nThe chief lesson of the report is one pro-choice advocates have known for years: that making abortion illegal or hard to get doesn't end abortion, it just makes it less safe. And opposition to abortion tends to come along with opposition to contraception and women's rights more broadly - and the limited contraception access that results means a higher abortion rate.\n\nBy contrast, nations with robust women's rights protections, liberal abortion laws and easily accessible birth control (especially long-acting birth control) have some of the lowest abortion rates in the world.\n\nJust look at the data. The region with the highest abortion rate is Latin America and the Caribbean, despite the fact that this same region has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world. Outlawing abortion doesn't make it any less common, but it does make it less safe. And the stigma that comes along with outlawing it - in addition to the legal consequences - means women who terminate pregnancies clandestinely may hesitate to seek help when they desperately need it, and may be seriously injured or even die as a result.\n\nAnd there are legal consequences. American anti-abortion activists swear up and down they don't want to punish women who have abortions, but this claim is belied by the reality for women in many countries where abortion is illegal. Women do go to jail if they're suspected of ending their pregnancies - even when they say they simply had a miscarriage.\n\nAnd American pro-lifers do say they would be happy to jail doctors who perform abortions. Some even say they would treat those doctors as murderers, leaving them open to the death penalty. The fate of women who self-induce their own abortions remains unclear.\n\nWomen suspected of doing so have indeed been prosecuted here in the US, with nary a peep from the pro-lifers who say women who end pregnancies are victims, but by basic logic must believe they're also murderers. So that's their plan for ending abortion: lock 'em up. They'll also say something about fostering a \"culture of life\". That's code for no sex before early heterosexual marriage, and then no birth control.\n\nThat women now marry at an average age of 26, with educated women marrying and delaying childbirth even later, makes this proposition laughable. Women like our freedom - including the freedom to be sexual beings while we also pursue an education, a career, and a life of our choosing.\n\nWe like figuring out who we are before we choose someone to spend our lives with (if we ever choose someone to spend our lives with). Going back to the days of virginity until marriage and marriage at 22? It isn't going to happen. And this shift is happening worldwide, with women across borders and cultures choosing to plan their families and space out their births when they can.\n\nBut those bad old days when women were at the mercy of fate is what American pro-lifers want to legislate. Their politics are not just about abortion - they're about a broader view of women's place in society (which apparently should be at home, raising children). Why else oppose the most effective way to reduce the abortion rate - free and easily accessible contraception? Why else oppose the policies that would make it easier for women to have babies and work outside the home?\n\nYet the American pro-life movement and their Republican representatives do oppose all of this. Relegating women to subservient roles, blocking access to contraception and threatening women and doctors with jail hasn't worked to prevent abortion anywhere in the history of the world, but that won't stop them from trying again.\n\nThanks to improved abortion and contraception technologies, abortion rates are dropping, and where they are unsafe, they're often safer than they used to be. Medication abortion, wherein women take a pill or combination of pills to induce a miscarriage, has proliferated, with the pills available even in many places where abortion is highly restricted.\n\nBecause this method doesn't require any instruments entering a woman's body, the chances of a botched job are lower - instead of using twigs or coat hangers, more women use things like ulcer medications, and a lot more of them live.\n\nStill, these abortions are not as safe as legal procedures overseen or performed by a trained medical professional. More than half of abortions worldwide are either unsafe or not as safe as they could be. Around 22,800 women die every year from unsafe abortions. These deaths are almost entirely preventable - we could get that number close to zero, but we choose not to.\n\nAbortion occupies strange territory: both a common and normal part of women's lives all around the world, and also deeply stigmatized and rarely discussed in terms of health instead of politics or religious morality.\n\nWestern pro-life groups have helped export this view overseas, manipulating US international aid dollars to prevent it from helping women in the most vulnerable of circumstances, if those women want so much as information about abortion - any organization overseas that receives American aid dollars can't tell a woman about her rights or her options. And in much of the world, abortion stigma means women have few people to turn to, and may not even be able to speak in confidence with their doctors for fear of judgment or legal repercussions. No wonder so many women still take matters into their own hands.\n\nThis is all a choice. We know safe, legal abortion decreases abortion related deaths. We know widespread access to contraception, and especially reliable long-acting methods like the IUD, decreases unintended pregnancies and in turn abortions.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has totally cut off even information about abortion for women overseas. And domestically, they've caved to ideological, science-hostile pro-life groups who tell women to plan their families \"naturally\" - that is, with the rhythm method instead of contraception.\n\nNatural family planning is a great option and women should know how to utilize it if they choose, but they should also know that according to the Department of Health and Human Services, for every 100 couples using natural family planning in a year, about 25 will wind up pregnant. Those aren't the odds most women look for in contraception (by contrast, fewer than one women in 100 will become pregnant using a hormonal IUD).\n\nThe global numbers on abortion tell a clear story of progress and feminist gains. But we're not nearly as far as we could be - only because those who claim to value \"life\" are compromising women's lives for their own ideological aims.",

                "body": "Love was in the air the moment US writer Noah Charney set foot in Ljubljana. And after he met his future wife, there was a whole country to get passionate about, with dramatic landscapes, curious traditions and great food\n\nBack in 2000, as an American student studying in London, I embarked on a Eurorail trip - a sort of smorgasbord of travel in European cities. You buy an open ticket that allows you to travel indefinitely by train throughout Europe. But prior to my own Eurorailing adventure, I'd lent my Lonely Planet: Europe on a Shoestring to five friends who had already been on such a trip, asking them to add notes, suggestions, annotations. All five, without colluding, said Slovenia's Lake Bled was the single most beautiful place they had seen in Europe.\n\nFast-forward to 2006, when I was a postgraduate student, and I wound up embarking on a longer, \"slow food\" version of my rail smorgasbord. I lived in eight European cities, each for at least a month, to get a feel for what it would be like to move there indefinitely. After forays into Venice, Florence, Rome, Madrid and Leiden, I ended up in Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital. And that is where I fell in love - with the country and the future Mrs Charney.\n\nThis is what I fell in love with.\n\nIn order to marry her, on our wedding day, I was obliged to survive the dreaded shranga, a gauntlet of pre-nuptial feats of manliness required of aspiring grooms from beyond the Slovenian mountain village confines. Once I'd got through the nerve-racking bouts of scythe-sharpening, bark-shaving, axe-wielding and, yes, even wife-buying traditions, and was permitted by the grumpy-looking villagers to enter the church and carry on with my wedding, I knew that this was the place for me, and have since come to feel truly a part of it.\n\nSlovenia has been, for me, a land of opportunity. This has meant that I've become something of Slovenia's foreign cheerleader, and recently I even released a book, Slovenology: Living and Travelling in the World's Best Country, that is part memoir, part travelogue, and part essay collection singing its praises.\n\nThere are only so many times that Slovenia can be called a \"hidden gem\" and still claim to remain hidden. But those who come to this tiny country nestled between the Alps and the Adriatic seem to feel they've discovered a little-known paradise. While cheap flights from London have made it an easy weekend destination, and the capital, Ljubljana, is popular on the stag and hen circuit, the entire country boasts wonderland landscapes. Beyond the confines of charming, Zürich-like Ljubljana, Slovenia offers travellers a destination that is easy to navigate (with English spoken just about everywhere). It is one of the safest countries in the world, not to mention the cleanest (it won National Geographic's 2017 World Legacy Award, as the most sustainable tourist destination, and Ljubljana was Green Capital of Europe in 2016).\n\nHaving chosen this country as my new homeland, settling in the charming three-castled alpine town of Kamnik, just north of the capital, I wanted to get to know it in a more intimate way. I wanted a local's-eye-view of the secret facets of this \"hidden gem\". And so I hatched a plan. I set about contacting people I found interesting - for instance, the great folk-rock musician, Vlado Kreslin, the world-famous chef Janez Bratovž, and the expat Bosnian actor and director, Branko Đurić - and requested interviews. To my delight, everyone acquiesced. In Slovenia, everyone writes their own email, and even the prime minister is just a message away. I struck up friendships and collaborations with many of the people I met in this way, working my way through a who's-who of interesting Slovenians.\n\nVlado Kreslin, a Bruce Springsteen-like musical icon in Slovenia, introduced me to the wonders of Prekmurje, the furthest-flung region of the country, on the Hungarian border. This is a flatland of storks and slow-churning wooden mills on the river, with a lively and culturally influential population of Gypsies. Kreslin grew up here, in his father's gostilna, or country inn, listening to bands mixed of Slovenians and Gypsies, and speaking a dialect that is unintelligible to most Slovenes. My wife and I attended a party at the Kreslins' weekend home there, with dozens of other guests, from DJs to government ministers, all gathered around a bubbling cauldron of bograč, a rich goulash spiked with paprika from the nearby Pannonian plain, and ripping apart deep-fried catfish from the nearby Mura river. After dinner, Kreslin and his friends, members of his band but guests, too, grabbed instruments and played an impromptu concert, just for the pleasure of it, as the moon rose high above the roll and roil of accordion, violin, guitar and hammered dulcimer.\n\nAs a tourist I'd found Lake Bled a bit twee. It was only when I went with actor/director Branko Đurić, as a co-organiser of the short-lived Bled Film Festival, that I saw the magic it can conjure. We'd gathered at a villa on a cliff above the lake, which had once been a favourite residence of Tito. Celebratory homemade schnapps was consumed, and as night fell we were rowed out to the single, church-topped island in pletne, gondolas manned by capped oarsmen. A trail of floating candles guided us to the cascade of stone steps that led up from the island's mooring to the medieval church. The festival guests used the steps as seating, and the mooring became a stage upon which we gave out the awards. And then the partying began, with the church's schnapps-fueled priest particularly keen to take a selfie with American actor Armand Assante. It was Lake Bled at its best, without the trappings of tourism, in a light as magical as anything I could imagine.\n\nBut of all my encounters, the one that taught me most about my adopted country was this summer's road trip with Janez Bratovž, tasting indigenous Slovenian ingredients for his next cookbook. Bratovž is the godfather of nouvelle cuisine in the former Yugoslavia - the first to introduce carpaccio and rare steak to a land of delicious but well-done cutlets doused in cream sauces. He picked 20 key ingredients that he uses in his cooking and, together with photographer Matjaž Tančič, we spent the summer crisscrossing the country, visiting the finest producers. Steps from the border with Italy, in Goriška Brda, we tasted what many think is the world's best prosciutto, or pršut. Just 80 legs a year from indigenous, wonderfully fatty blackstrap pigs are prepared by Uroš Klinec and pre-sold to select restaurants around the globe. From the Caravaggesque darkness of his cellar, a vegetarian's nightmare (but this carnivore's delight) of hanging hocks of ham, we emerged on to his sun-soaked patio, overlooking the wine-rich hills, and enjoyed prosciutto so delicate and light that it melted on the tongue.\n\nAcross the country, in Kreslin's Prekmurje flatlands, we tasted the finest Styrian pumpkin seed oil, hand-pressed in century-old presses by the Kocbek family, and of such flavour and delicacy that it is used not only to dress salads, but as a sauce for ice-cream and to lace bars of dark chocolate. We wound through the hills of Tolmin, above the emerald Soča river, a real-life Narnia (one of the movies was filmed here), to meet a farmer bringing back the colossal, leopard-skinned Soča river trout, with flesh so delicious that today it is only served as a carpaccio. This was the site of Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, where this king of trout nearly became extinct in the first world war, as hungry soldiers flung grenades into the river to catch a meal.\n\nAt the salt flats near Piran, on Slovenia's 46km of karstic coast, we met Dario, whose family has been harvesting salt for generations, in flats that date back to the Roman empire, when salt was used as pay (the term salary comes from salaria, meaning salt).\n\nWe drove up a mountain in Dolenjska, in the south east, with a mountain-sized sheep farmer eager to show us his dominion, arriving at the top only to find the still-warm remains of a gutted sheep, which showed that a bear was lurking somewhere nearby in the darkness barely held back by the ebbing twilight (I opted to stay in the car for that one, while Tančič took photographs of the farmer and Bratovž kept an eye out for bears and wolves).\n\nWe dipped down to the Istrian peninsula to meet former property lawyer Aleš Winkler. He sold his fancy Ljubljana flat, bought 30 goats as lawnmowers for his rural holiday house, taught himself online to make cheese and this year gave the keynote speech for Slow Food International, teaching Italians and French how to make a proper chèvre.\n\nBack in the Kamnik region, in the vast meadow atop mesa-like alpine mountain Velika Planina, there are odd, low-slung shepherds' huts that recall The Shire and are full of traditional artefacts (including a rain-repelling shepherd's gown made of strips of shaven wood and anti-witch knives carved with runes). Here, we sampled breast-shaped Trnič cheeses (which always come in pairs).\n\nThis summer's travels with Bratovž opened up locations and delicacies that I'd never have found on my own, and for which I am most grateful, for they allowed a constellation of indigenous ingredients to show me an intimate, insider's portrait of my adopted country.\n\nI remain just as in love with Slovenia (and, of course, with my Slovenian wife, for whom I endured such unusual \"feats of manliness\") as ever. For it is the Slovenia of passionate, in-the-know Slovenians that offers the most magic. And if you happen to read this and decide to move here, the first beer is on me.\n\n* Noah Charney is the author of Slovenology: Living and Traveling in the World's Best Country.

                "title": "Debussy by Stephen Walsh review - a fine biography of a painter in sound",
                "body": "The French composer was once dismissed as a Romantic or 'impressionist' who prioritised mood and feeling. This life digs deep into his innovations\n\nIt turns out that Claude Debussy lived exactly as any self-respecting artist should. He drank too much, showed unwise taste in women, never got the hang of money and assumed that anyone who didn't see music exactly the same way as he did was a duffer. He often thought of taking his own life but it was actually his first wife who pulled the trigger on herself, standing in the Place de la Concorde to make sure everyone noticed. Finally, the great composer died young, or youngish, leaving posterity to speculate about just where his genius would have taken him next.\n\nDon't imagine, though, that Stephen Walsh's compelling new biography, published to coincide with the centenary of Debussy's death, consists simply of one slack anecdote after another. As Walsh himself says in his introduction, the lives of composers are all too often told as if the music were an incidental afterthought to be wedged untidily between stories about bad debts and great parties. Walsh, by contrast, insists on pulling Debussy's compositions into the heart of this biography, treating them as the essential register of emotional and intellectual existence. Life, on this occasion, finds itself in the novel position of being required to fit around art.\n\nAs a sulky Paris Conservatoire student in the 1870s, Debussy had been apprenticed to a tradition in which all the great questions of form and content had been decided at least a century earlier. The boy's job, as his masters saw it, was to absorb these inherited templates, add his five sous-worth of fancy, before handing them on duly refreshed to the next generation of nimble-fingered prodigies. Debussy, instead, aimed to do nothing less than rebuild music from the bottom up or perhaps, more accurately, from the inside out. He would produce sequences of what he called \"colours and rhythmicised time\" that expressed his inner vision, rather than ready-made sounds to be crammed into some pre-arranged shape. Form would follow content, even if that meant that the form had no beginning or end, no climax or lull, but instead appeared as an uninterrupted weave held together by its own dense internal logic.\n\nContemporary critics were quick to call Debussy an impressionist, the musical equivalent of Monet, for the way he prioritised mood, feeling and scene over story and message. Debussy loathed the label, and Walsh agrees that this impulse to slot the composer into an existing grid is ironic, given that his habitual non-compliance is exactly what drove him to strike out for the borders in the first place. All the same, Walsh suggests, that's no reason to dismiss the more general point that Debussy was, as this book's subtitle has it, \"a painter in sound\", a composer for whom the visual was worked into the very marrow of the music. Debussy's off-duty hours were spent at the Louvre rather than the Opéra, while at the salon of his great friend, the painter Henry Lerolle, he was most likely to make a beeline for Edgar Degas and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.\n\nTo demonstrate how this painterliness was manifested in the music, Walsh offers a series of close readings of Debussy's best known pieces, showing sight and sound cross-wired to the point of synaesthesia. For example, he explains how in Nuages the drifting chords, fragmentary melodies and layered (rather than blended) harmonics become rather than describe a high grey sky with a blurred, shifting cloudscape. Elsewhere Walsh digs deep into Debussy's stylistic advances - the pentatonic scales, the unresolved chords, the eccentric pedalling - to show that the result was a set of \"colours\" that had not been heard, or seen, before in French music. To follow the argument it helps if you know your chromatic from your whole-tone, although Walsh is careful to keep the really technical stuff to a minimum. Instead he deploys a delightfully fluent prose to carry the general reader along in the right direction.\n\nIf Walsh can do small, he can also go large and he finishes his finely tooled biography by squaring up to that old question of whether Debussy represents the end of one musical epoch or the beginning of another. For while the audience at the first night of Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902 might mutter about its radical formlessness and harmonic jumble, the fact is that by the time of the composer's death 16 years later he was being written off as distinctly old hat. Indeed, for sharp young critics such as Jean Cocteau, Debussy was nothing but an ageing Romantic whose murmurings about nightingales and moonlight seemed to belong to the last gasp of the 19th century. Not until after the next world war did the mists clear and it became once again possible to take the long view. Debussy was no longer regarded as an impressionist, producing washy metaphors of fauns or waves. Rather, the way was clear for him to be restored to his proper place as a sonic modernist, whose music not only made its own meaning but also pointed the way ahead for the next 100 years.",

                "body": "At 50, two decades of stable family life fell apart. In this extract from her memoir, the novelist recalls finding strength in the chaos - and a new voice\n\nAs Orson Welles told us, if we want a happy ending, it depends on where we stop the story. One January night I was eating coconut rice and fish in a bar on Colombia's Caribbean coast. A tanned, tattooed American man sat at the table next to me. He was in his late 40s, big muscled arms, his silver hair pinned into a bun. He was talking to a young English woman, perhaps 19 years old, who had been sitting on her own reading a book, but after some ambivalence had taken up his invitation to join him. At first he did all the talking. After a while she interrupted him.\n\nHer conversation was interesting, intense and strange. She was telling him about scuba diving in Mexico, how she had been underwater for 20 minutes and then surfaced to find there was a storm. The sea had become a whirlpool and she had been anxious about making it back to the boat. Although her story was about surfacing from a dive to discover the weather had changed, it was also about some sort of undisclosed hurt. She gave him a few clues about that (there was someone on the boat who she thought should have come to save her) and then she glanced at him to check if he knew that she was talking about the storm in a disguised way.\n\nHe said, \"You talk a lot don't you?\"\n\nIt was not that easy to convey to him, a man much older than she was, that the world was her world, too. He had taken a risk when he invited her to join him at his table. After all, she came with a whole life and libido of her own. It had not occurred to him that she might not consider herself to be the minor character and him the major character. In this sense, she had unsettled a boundary, collapsed a social hierarchy, broken with the usual rituals. She could have stopped the story by describing the wonder of all she had seen in the deep calm sea before the storm. That would have been a happy ending, but she did not stop there. She was asking him (and herself) a question: do you think I was abandoned by that person on the boat?\n\nTo speak our life as we feel it is a freedom we mostly choose not to take, but it seemed to me that the words she wanted to say were lively inside her, mysterious to herself as much as anyone else. He was probably the wrong reader for her story, but I thought on balance that she might be the right reader for mine.\n\n¶\n\nEverything was calm. The sun was shining. I was swimming in the deep. And then, when I surfaced 20 years later, I discovered there was a storm, a whirlpool, a blasting gale lifting the waves over my head.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure I'd make it back to the boat and then I realised I didn't want to make it back to the boat. Chaos is supposed to be what we most fear but I have come to believe it might be what we most want. If we don't believe in the future we are planning, the house we are mortgaged to, the person who sleeps by our side, it is possible that a tempest (long lurking in the clouds) might bring us closer to how we want to be in the world.\n\nLife falls apart. We try to get a grip and hold it together. And then we realise we don't want to hold it together.\n\nWhen I was around 50 and my life was supposed to be slowing down, becoming more stable and predictable, life became faster, unstable, unpredictable. My marriage was the boat and I knew that I could not swim back to it. It is also the ghost that will always haunt my life. I will never stop grieving for my long-held wish for enduring love that does not reduce its major players to something less than they are.\n\nI am not sure I have often witnessed love that achieves all of these things, so perhaps this ideal is fated to be a phantom. What sort of questions does this phantom ask of me? It asks political questions for sure, but it is not a politician.\n\n¶\n\nWe sold the family house. This action of dismantling and packing up a long life lived together seemed to flip time into a weird shape; a flashback to leaving South Africa, the country of my birth, when I was nine years old, and a flash forward to an unknown life I was yet to live at 50. I was unmaking the home that I'd spent much of my life's energy creating.\n\nTo strip the wallpaper off the fairytale of The Family House in which the comfort and happiness of men and children has been the priority is to find behind it an unthanked, unloved, neglected, exhausted woman. It requires skill, time, dedication and empathy to create a home that everyone enjoys and that functions well. This task is still mostly perceived as women's work. Consequently, there are all kinds of words used to belittle this huge endeavour. If the wife and mother has been impregnated by society, she is playing everyone's wife and mother. She has built the story the old patriarchy has designed for the nuclear heterosexual family, and of course added a few contemporary flourishes of her own. To not feel at home in her family home is the beginning of the bigger story of society and its female discontents. If she is not too defeated by the societal story she has enacted with hope, pride, happiness, ambivalence and rage, she will change the story.\n\nThe moody politics of the modern home had become complicated and confusing. There were many modern and apparently powerful women I knew who had made a home for everyone else, but did not feel at home in their family home. They preferred the office or wherever they worked because they had more status than being a wife. Orwell, in his 1936 essay Shooting an Elephant, noted that the imperialist \"wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it\". The wife also wears a mask and her face grows to fit it, in all its variations. Some women who were the main earners in their family were being slyly punished by their men for any success they had achieved. Their male partners had become resentful, angry and depressed. Women are not supposed to eclipse men in a world in which success and power are marked out for them. It is not easy to take up the historical privilege of dominance over women (with a modern twist) if he is economically dependent on her talents. At the same time, she receives the fatal message that she must conceal her talents and abilities in order to be loved by him.\n\n¶\n\nIt was futile to try to fit an old life into a new life. The old fridge was too big for the new kitchen, the sofa too big for the lounge, the beds the wrong shape to fit the bedrooms. Most of my books were in boxes in the garage with the rest of the family house. More urgently, I no longer had a study at the most professionally busy time in my life. I wrote wherever I could and concentrated on making a home for my daughters. I could say that it was these years that were the most self-sacrificing, and not the years in our nuclear family unit. Yet, to be making this kind of home, a space for a mother and her daughters, was so hard and humbling, profound and interesting, that to my surprise I found I could work very well in the chaos of this time.\n\nI was thinking clearly, lucidly; the new situation had freed something that had been trapped and stifled. I became physically strong at 50, just as my bones were supposed to be losing their strength. I had energy because I had no choice but to have energy. I had to write to support my children and I had to do all the heavy lifting. Freedom is never free. Anyone who has struggled to be free knows how much it costs.\n\n¶\n\nCelia came to the rescue. She was an actor and bookseller in her early 80s. One evening in her kitchen in late January, she started to sing something to me in Welsh. I told her I didn't understand Welsh.\n\n\"Well, I was born in Wales and you weren't, but what I was thinking while I was singing is that you need a place to write.\"\n\nShe pointed towards the shed at the back of her garden. It was where her husband, the late, great poet Adrian Mitchell, had sometimes written in the spring and summer. It was built under an apple tree. In three seconds flat, I agreed to rent it from her. Celia knew I was financially supporting \"quite a crowd\", as she put it, so we sealed a manageable deal over a glass of the Havana rum she had a liking for, and which she preferred to mix with Coke. Every time she drank Havana rum, she raised her glass to toast the miracle of the high literacy rate in Cuba. \"By the way,\" she said, \"next time the communal boiler is on the blink in your flat, you'd better all come over for a hot bath.\"\n\nEveryone deserves a guardian angel like Celia.\n\nCelia understood that I would be writing at all hours, and introduced me to her many friends as She Who Lurks in the Garden. No one was allowed to interrupt me on her watch; to knock on the door and solicit a conversation (the weather, the news, the arrival of cake) or even to convey an urgent message from the Mistress of the House. To be valued and respected in this way, as if it were the most normal thing in the world, was a new experience. I did not know it then, but I would go on to write three books in that shed. It was there that I would begin to write in the first person, using an I that is close to myself and yet is not myself.\n\n¶\n\nTo separate from love is to live a risk-free life. What's the point of that sort of life? As I wheeled my electric bike through the park on the way to my writing shed, my hands had turned blue from the cold. I had given up wearing gloves because I was always grappling in the dark to find keys. I stopped by the fountain, only to find it had been switched off. A sign from the council read, \"This fountain has been winterised.\"\n\nI reckoned that is what had happened to me, too.\n\nTo live without love is a waste of time. I was living in the Republic of Writing and Children. I was not Simone de Beauvoir, after all. No, I had got off the train at a different stop (marriage) and stepped on to a different platform (children). She was my muse but I was certainly not hers.\n\nAll the same we had both bought a ticket (earned with our own money) for the same train. The destination was to head towards a freer life. That is a vague destination, no one knows what it looks like when we get there. It is a journey without end, but I did not know that then. I was just on my way. Where else was there to head for? I was young and lovely, I boarded that train, opened my journal and began to write in the first person and the third person.\n\nDe Beauvoir knew that a life without love was a waste of time. Her enduring love for Sartre seems to have been contingent on her living in hotels and not making a home with him, which in the 1950s was more radical than I believe even she realised. She remained committed to Sartre being the essential love of her life for 51 years, despite their other attachments. She knew she never wanted children or to serve his breakfast or run his errands or pretend she was not intellectually engaged with the world to make herself more lovable to him. She was appalled by middle age, in ways I did not completely understand. All the same, as she had written to the writer Nelson Algren, in the flush of their new love: \"I want everything from life, I want to be a woman and to be a man, to have many friends and have loneliness, to work much and write good books and to travel and enjoy myself ... \"\n\nI was intrigued by her wish to \"be a woman and to be a man\" because it was obvious to me that femininity, as written by men and performed by women, was the exhausted phantom that still haunted the early 21st century. There were not that many women I knew who wanted to put the phantom together again. She is a very tricky character to play and it is a role (sacrifice, endurance, cheerful suffering) that has made some women go mad. This was not a story I wanted to hear all over again. It was time to find other main female characters with other talents *\n\nExtracted from Deborah Levy's The Cost of Living, published by Hamish Hamilton on 5 April.",

                "body": "Sharing your opinion - or someone else's - on your shirt is a guaranteed conversation starter\n\nI have long avoided slogan T-shirts. When a cause or belief is fashionable enough to make it on to a mass-produced top, I don't feel any desire to join in. Now that our every bad choice is archived on social media, ready to ambush us at any time, I am conscious that my declarations of belief or commitment could resurface when I may no longer stand by them. If I am honest, I like to keep my politics to myself and I am not keen on giving strangers an excuse to strike up conversation.\n\nBut, right now, the slogan T-shirt is unavoidable. The catwalk and the high street are full of proclamations, from \"This is what a feminist looks like\" and \"Love Trumps Hate\" to, simply, \"Immigrant\". At the Golden Globes in January, a \"Poverty is sexist\" sweatshirt, worn by actor Connie Britton, baffled some commentators. You can buy the appearance of giving a damn with T-shirts declaring \"Punk not war\", \"Liberté, Egalité, Humanité\" and, of course, \"Feminist\".\n\nI decide to join the herd and wear, if not my own, someone else's convictions writ large.\n\nFirst up is a long-sleeved Breton top from Dior, bearing the question, \"Why have there been no great women artists?\" It is the title of art historian Linda Nochlin's 1971 essay, so I wear the top to dinner with my artistic pal, the one most likely to have read the work.\n\n\"Haven't there?\" she asks the moment I remove my coat. \"What about Louise Bourgeois? Jenny Saville? Frida Kahlo?\"\n\nIt is a quote from an essay, I tell her. From the 70s. About the patriarchy. She hasn't read it. If I am going to carry off this sloganeering, I will need to swot up on my new wardrobe.\n\nThe designer Katharine Hamnett has been making big, bold statements on T-shirts since the 1980s, including her famous 1984 photo opportunity with Margaret Thatcher in which she wore one announcing \"58% don't want Pershing\", her 2003 \"Stop War, Blair Out\" T and \"Vote Tactically\", which was resurrected for last year's general election.\n\nHer current collection largely focuses on Brexit, her trademark block capitals demanding a \"Second Referendum Now\" or just \"Cancel Brexit\". The latter shirt also bears a quote from Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, in smaller font: \"If British voters changed their minds they would be welcomed back with open arms. Everyone would be for it.\" I wear it, tied at the waist, to an old schoolfriend's birthday drinks. I am confident that her political views roughly align with my own and, sure enough, she deems it \"cool\". Encouraged, I take a selfie in the loos and post it on Instagram, where it prompts a flurry of likes.\n\nVivienne Westwood has been one of the most prolific designers and wearers of slogan T-shirts since the 70s. In 2012, she launched her Climate Revolution campaign with an edgy, post-punk T-shirt. More recently, she urged us to \"Support junior doctors\" and \"Save the Arctic\".\n\nI try one of her classics, \"I AM NOT A TERRORIST. Please Don't Arrest Me\", created in collaboration with civil liberties group Liberty in 2005 to protest against the government's proposed anti-terror laws. I wear it to meet a friend in Birmingham, where it passes without comment. I feel very \"white privilege\". Later, on a train, I find myself sitting opposite a young girl in a hijab. She looks at my T-shirt, then, warily, at me. I hope that publicly declaring my own non-terrorist status doesn't make it appear that I am less certain about everyone else's.\n\nNext, I try out a red Lisa Marcario sweatshirt with the words \"We are all immigrants\" neatly embroidered in small letters. I like the fact that the message feels radical, but its presentation is not shouty. Unfortunately, my colleagues initially fail to notice my statement.\n\nI revert to Hamnett's succinct \"Cancel Brexit\" for a party at which I know just a handful of guests. Before long, the slogan prompts an interesting discussion with an entrepreneur. He tells me he found himself conflicted after voting remain, only to discover that his business vastly improved after Britain voted to leave. Later, a girl drapes herself around my shoulders and tells me I look \"fucking amazing\". I am not convinced she is on board with the anti-Brexit message, but I take the compliment anyway.\n\nA man I have not spoken to during the evening clocks my T-shirt and seems affronted. \"You can stick anything on a T-shirt,\" he scoffs. \"You could stick 'Rape Everybody' on a T-shirt.\"\n\nI am taken aback by the suggestion that the messages are comparable. The pleasure of Hamnett and Westwood's smart slogans is that they are witty and provocative, and they have a point. \"Not that I would,\" the man adds, \"but I could.\" I pull my coat on over my T-shirt and head home.\n\nWearing slogans means I think less about the style and fit of my clothes, and more about what they stand for, which is good. Getting dressed takes on a new significance and I am glad to know more than I used to about anti-terrorism laws. And art. And even Brexit.\n\nPerhaps, then, slogan T-shirts are less to educate others (quite patronising, as wardrobe choices go) and more to force you, the wearer, to become better informed. And while it is easy to accuse slogan fans of virtue-signalling and jumping on bandwagons, sometimes even the smallest protest feels good.\n\n* T-shirts: Save the rainforest, £55, and I am not a terrorist, £55, both viviennewestwood.com.

                "body": "These raisin-studded buns are packed with spice and make a welcome Easter alternative to chocolate\n\nIn 1592, Queen Elizabeth forbade bakeries in England to make any spiced buns except for burials, Easter Friday or at Christmas. Some say she did so because they were too special to be eaten all year round. In Jamaica, however, no such law was ever decreed, so for hundreds of years they've eaten these delicious spiced buns as and when they wished, sometimes with a little stout thrown in for good measure. They may not have the royal seal of approval, but they have mine.\n\nJamaican Easter buns\n\nPrep 40 min\n\nProving 2 hr\n\nCook 25 min\n\nMakes 12 buns\n\nFor the buns\n\n75ml almond milk\n\n30g sunflower spread (I use Pure)\n\n100g sultanas or raisins\n\n50g grated apple (ie, about ⅔ apple)\n\n1 tsp ground cinnamon\n\n½ tsp allspice\n\n½ tsp ground nutmeg\n\n½ tsp ground ginger\n\n1 tbsp molasses\n\n75ml Guinness or Dragon Stout\n\n275g strong white bread flour\n\n60g caster sugar\n\n¾ tsp dried yeast\n\n¼ tsp salt\n\nTo decorate\n\n125g icing sugar\n\n2-3 tbsp hot water\n\nGround cinnamon, for dusting\n\nHeat the almond milk in a saucepan just to a boil, then turn off the heat, drop in the sunflower spread and leave it to melt. Meanwhile, put the dried fruit, apple and spices in a bowl, add the molasses and stout, mix to combine and leave to soak.\n\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Once the milk mix has cooled to lukewarm (don't worry if there are still some lumps of sunflower spread; it just needs to be soft), pour it into the dry ingredients, followed by the fruit and all its soaking juices. Mix well with a spoon, then bring everything together with your hands; the dough will be a bit sticky.\n\nTransfer the dough to a well-floured surface and knead for five to 10 minutes, re-flouring the surface as necessary, until it's soft and smooth. Oil a bowl, shape the dough into a round, put it in the bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to rise in a warmish place for an hour. (It won't rise a lot because of all the fruit.)\n\nLine an oven tray with baking paper. Divide and shape the risen dough into 12 equal-sized buns and put on the lined tray. Leave to rise for another hour, then heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Bake the buns for 10 minutes, turn down the heat to 180C/350F/gas 4, rotate the baking tray and bake for 10 minutes more, until the buns are golden brown. They should have formed a bit of a crust and sound hollow when you tap the base.\n\nPut the buns on a wire rack to cool (or enjoy them warm from the oven with sunflower spread and marmalade). When the buns have cooled, decorate them. To make the icing, put the sugar in a bowl and gradually beat in the water until it's the consistency of double cream. Spoon a little over each bun to coat and finish with a sprinkling of ground cinnamon.\n\nFood styling: Rukmini Iyer",

                "body": "Give them coping strategies, value their autistic traits and don't push them too far outside their comfort zone\n\nKnow that your child's autism is part of who they are. It doesn't make them any less valuable. Encouraging your child to behave in a non-autistic way will not increase their chances of being happy and successful; being accepted for who they are and supported with the things they find challenging will.\n\nBe aware of your child's sensory differences. They may process sound, smells, tastes, textures, touch and light differently. If so, fix the environment rather than expecting them to cope. Give them noise-cancelling headphones in noisy places; create a quiet space they can retreat to during get-togethers; don't make them wear clothes whose textures are painful to them; if they hate birthday parties, don't make them go.\n\nTry to limit anxiety. Offer structure (visual timetables) and routine (do the same for every holiday), and don't push them too far outside their comfort zone (but do push them a bit).\n\nFill in the missing blanks. Explain unspoken social rules and use logic: \"You shouldn't scream as it hurts other people's ears and they won't want to do nice things for you if you do.\" Write the explanation down, with visuals, along with suggestions of what the child can do if they think they are going to scream.\n\nValue autistic traits. My son doesn't lie, he's never sly or manipulative, and it would not occur to him to put anyone down. These are some of the many reasons why people like him and I'm proud to be his mum. If he weren't autistic, would these qualities be there? Impossible to know, but I suspect his autism has helped to make him the funny, kind and clever boy he is.\n\n* Autism: How To Raise a Happy Autistic Child, by Jessie Hewitson, is published by Orion Spring at £14.99.

                "title": "The Wren Hunt by Mary Watson review - a magical YA debut",
                "body": "Two factions battle for survival in this complex and slippery tale of ancient spells cast in contemporary Ireland\n\nThe Wren Hunt occupies an eerie, in-between place, where fantasy and reality meet in a contemporary Ireland infused with ancient magic. Two rival magical factions, the judges and the augurs, are locked in a fierce battle for nemeta - magic - and so for survival. For the past few years, the judges have been winning and coming close to destroying their sworn enemies for good, but Wren Silke, an augur with a powerful and dangerous gift, is determined to change that.\n\nIntent on saving her family, Wren undertakes a secret assignment that leads her into the heart of their enemies' world. Cassa Harkness is a powerful judge who has spent her life researching a transformative spell that will seal the fate of the factions. Wren infiltrates her house as an intern, and must navigate its treacherous corridors, as well as her own desires for knowledge, and for a handsome judge guard.\n\nVariously described as folklore, fantasy and mystery, The Wren Hunt wears its labels lightly, shedding one genre for another with a sort of slippery grace that initially confuses. But the story takes flight once Wren is ensconced in the judges' territory, and the book settles into a deft equilibrium between thriller and myth. Watson's writing has the sort of poise rarely found in a debut, moving the plot at a steady pace, shot through with moments of true beauty.\n\nWren is a flawed and likable protagonist. Her talent is unusual even among the augurs, and serves to incapacitate as well as to illuminate her. Her motivations are complicated, and while she is level-headed for the most part, her anxieties will be recognisable to any teen who has felt as if they might be getting everything wrong - though, hopefully, not with quite so much at stake. The progress of a love interest is believable and well paced, if a little secondary to the story.\n\nThe Wren Hunt is engaging contemporary storytelling that rings with ancient resonances. While fans of Maggie Stiefvater, Peadar Ó Guilín and Melinda Salisbury will find plenty to savour here, the book is its own thing entirely.",

                "body": "Five of the best ... films Have a Nice Day (15)\n\n(Jian Liu, 2017, Chi) 78 mins\n\nSomewhere between Pulp Fiction, Takeshi Kitano and Daniel Clowes, this deadpan, lo-fi crime caper almost feels like an authentic snapshot of modern-day China, despite the fact it's animated (rather beautifully). Centred on a stolen bag of cash, the entertainingly tangled plot takes in gangsters, chancers, cosmetic surgery and even some corrupt Buddhist monks.\n\nThe Square (15)\n\n(Ruben Östlund, 2017, Swe/Ger/Fra/Den) 151 mins\n\nThe absurdity of the art world is fully embraced in this Elisabeth Moss-starring satire, whose exhibits include annoying installations, pretentious marketing gurus and an ape impersonator. Claes Bang plays the Stockholm gallery director supposedly in control of all this, but who struggles to separate the sublime from the ridiculous.\n\nYou Were Never Really Here (15)\n\n(Lynne Ramsay, 2017, UK/Fra/US) 95 mins\n\nThis superbly controlled thriller takes us into the mind of a troubled loner (Joaquin Phoenix) who is sucked into a political conspiracy on his mission to retrieve an abducted girl. The details are only vaguely sketched out; it's more of a fragmented collection of moments (many of them brutal, a few darkly comical), but it all adds up to an unforgettably intense experience.\n\nSweet Country (15)\n\n(Warwick Thornton, 2017, Aus) 113 mins\n\nA panoramic western and a powerful history of 1920s Australia - a time when racism went unchecked and an Indigenous Australian farmhand (Hamilton Morris) and his wife could expect no justice for having killed an abusive white settler. On the run across the stark wilderness of the Northern Territory, with Bryan Brown's posse in pursuit, their story becomes almost a biblical parable, told with breathtaking cinematography.\n\nThe Third Murder (15)\n\n(Hirokazu Kore-eda, 2017, Jap) 125 mins\n\nAn original take for a murder-mystery: the only thing we can be certain of is the killer's identity. A strange man (veteran actor Kôji Yasuko) confesses to killing his factory boss, but his story keeps changing. Is he even the killer? It's down to his defence lawyer (Masaharu Fukuyama) to investigate. This thriller's spiritual as well as criminal.\n\nSR\n\nFive of the best ... rock & pop gigs Ms Banks\n\nThe 23-year-old London rapper Ms Banks (her real name is Tyra, hence the moniker) got a massive boost last November when Nicki Minaj declared herself a fan via the medium of Twitter. This one-off gig will showcase her forthcoming EP, The Coldest Winter Ever, as well as her ever-growing list of dexterous guest verses and mixtape deep cuts.\n\nOmeara, SE1 Wednesday 28 March\n\nThe Aces\n\nDo you enjoy Haim's fusion of sun-dappled melodies, 70s nostalgia and immaculate hair but wish they had better songs? Same. Good news, though, because Utah quartet the Aces are pretty good at the songcraft bit, with recent single Lovin' Is Bible a big, unselfconscious slab of glittery guitar pop. Expect more on their debut album, When My Heart Felt Volcanic.\n\nThousand Island, N5, Tuesday 27 March\n\nAmber Mark\n\nRaised across Europe and Asia before eventually settling in New York, newcomer Amber Mark's pillow-soft, slow-burn output reflects this sense of restlessness. She's into storytelling and concepts too, with last year's self-produced 3:33am EP detailing grief, while next month's Conexão EP focuses on creating a new love. Expect to be a bit overwhelmed by it all.\n\nThe Camden Assembly, NW1, Friday 30 March\n\nFriendly Fires\n\nDig out that old Hawaiian shirt and practise your wobbly indie dance moves - everyone's second-favourite sixth-on-the-festival-bill trio are back, back, back after a six-year hiatus. Those hoping to just bask in the warm glow of nostalgia be warned: in a recent interview they said their new music is \"long and expansive and drawn-out\". Plan your toilet breaks accordingly.\n\nLeeds Beckett University SU, Thursday 29; The Waterfront, Norwich, Friday 30 March; touring to 5 April\n\nMC\n\nZhenya Strigalev\n\nEuropean and US jazz clubs, the adopted homes of exciting St Petersburg-born saxophonist Zhenya Strigalev (pictured) for a decade, have been steadily nourishing his bebop-to-Ornette-Coleman sound and quirky composing skills. This gig launches Strigalev's jazz and electronics fusion album Blues for Maggie, with like-minded expat Russian pianist Boris Netsvetaev in a powerful lineup.\n\nThe Vortex, N16, Wednesday 28 March\n\nJF\n\nFour of the best ... classical concerts Holy Week festival\n\nNigel Short curates this year's traditional pre-Easter week of choral music. Short's own group Tenebrae give one of the concerts, joining up with the Aurora Orchestra for Arvo Pärt's Passio (Wednesday 28 March), and there are also appearances by Ex Cathedra, the Gesualdo Six, the Tallis Scholars, Polyphony and the Gabrieli Consort.\n\nSt John's Smith Square, SW1 Monday 26 March to 1 April\n\nTombeau de Debussy\n\nThe second weekend of concerts marking the 100th anniversary of the death of Debussy includes Birmingham Contemporary Music Group's specially commissioned programme of tributes. New pieces by Jungeun Park, Sinta Wullur, Frédéric Pattar and Julian Anderson are interleaved with Dukas, Bartók, Satie, Ravel and Goossens.\n\nSymphony Hall, Birmingham, Sunday 25 March\n\nThe Royal Opera: Coraline\n\nMark-Anthony Turnage's new opera is adapted from Neil Gaiman's fantasy novella for children, about a girl who opens a mysterious door in her house to discover the Other World. Mary Bevan is Coraline in Aletta Collins's production, with Kitty Whately and Alexander Robin Baker as her parents.\n\nBarbican Theatre, EC2, Thursday 29 March to 7 April\n\nContemporary Evenings\n\nThe BBC National Orchestra of Wales continues its 90th birthday celebrations, with a programme conducted by Jac van Steen that mixes new works with pieces previously premiered by the NOW. The premieres come from Mark D Boden and Guto Puw, the revivals from Alun Hoddinott, Michael Berkeley and Sarah Lianne Lewis.\n\nBBC Hoddinott Hall, Cardiff, Wednesday 28 March\n\nAC\n\nFive of the best ... exhibitions Damien Hirst\n\nStill painting dots after all these years, Hirst shows his latest canvases, plus several sculptures, in the sublime setting of Houghton Hall. It was built for Sir Robert Walpole, Britain's first - and most corrupt - prime minister. Walpole might have found Hirst's art bewildering but would admire his wealth. Rich man's art in a rich man's house.\n\nHoughton Hall, nr King's Lynn Sunday 25 March to 15 July\n\nThe House of Fame\n\nPunk artist Linder is not one to do anything by the book: instead of staging a retrospective, she has \"convened\" this show in which her work is juxtaposed with favourites from the 1600s to today. Inspired partly by a residency at Chatsworth, her choices range from Jacobean architect Inigo Jones to pieces by Mike Kelley and Heidi Bucher.\n\nNottingham Contemporary, Saturday 24 March to 24 June\n\nKen's Show\n\nKen Simons is an art handler, which means he is professionally qualified to touch and move works of art. I saw his team do great work once, when an artist demanded her entire exhibition be rehung in hours. But Simons has seen it all in his 30 years at Tate Liverpool and gets to choose the artists that have meant the most to him, Turner and Rothko (pictured) among them. Good for him: let's have more real people choosing real art for our galleries.\n\nTate Liverpool, Friday 30 March to 17 June\n\nAll Too Human: Bacon, Freud and a Century of Painting Life\n\nSome of the greatest British art of the 20th century is brought together in this treasury of perception, paint and feeling. It is not a head-to-head comparison of Bacon and Freud. The show is nearly stolen by another formidable duo: Frank Auerbach and Leon Kossoff. Everyone should see their fierce, paint-laden visions of the streets of London. They'll show you something that will make you change your mind.\n\nTate Britain, SW1, to 27 August\n\nNOW\n\nJenny Saville gets a mini-retrospective as part of this survey of Scottish art. Saville is a pungent painter of the human body and should perhaps be considered in a Scottish context. A graduate of Glasgow School of Art, her expressive realism has a lot in common with older Glasgow painters such as Peter Howson and Ken Currie, making up in passion for what it lacks in subtlety.\n\nScottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Saturday 24 to 16 September\n\nJJ\n\nFive of the best ... theatre shows\n\nMinefield\n\nMemory is a minefield in this remarkable show, made by Argentinian artist Lola Arias with veterans from both sides of the Falklands war. These are men who would once have tried to kill each other but now stand on stage and hug. It's a moving, delicate piece that uses individual lives as a historical document.\n\nNorthern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne Saturday 24; York Theatre Royal Wednesday 28 to 31 March; touring to 14 April\n\nBuggy Baby\n\nInnovation is synonymous with The Yard, which has proved itself one of the most risk-taking and invaluable theatres over the last few years. Josh Azouz's bold, hallucinogenic play about two refugees and a baby trying to survive in a space without hope is another cracker, director Ned Bennett mixing horror and comedy to brilliant effect.\n\nThe Yard, E9, to 31 March\n\nSummer and Smoke\n\nAnyone who has seen Patsy Ferran on stage will know that she is a talent to be reckoned with, but she announces herself as a bona fide star in this rare revival of Tennessee Williams's sizzling boy-meets-girl drama. In Rebecca Frecknall's deceptively simple production, she is mesmerising as the buttoned-up young woman who discovers erotic desire, playing the drama's constant tug between body and soul, flesh and spirit with exquisite control.\n\nAlmeida Theatre, N1, to 7 April\n\nLove from a Stranger\n\nWho would have thought an Agatha Christie could be such fun? But this one is, in Lucy Bailey's atmospheric production which doesn't entirely disguise the creaks but more than makes up for that in the way it builds tension. The show taps into the current paperback vogue for psychological domestic thrillers in which a woman chooses a man who is not to be trusted, throws in a dash of Peeping Tom and then springs a few subversive surprises of its own.\n\nOxford, Saturday 24; Guildford, Tuesday 27 to 31 March; touring to 21 July\n\nThe Little Matchgirl and Other Happier Tales\n\nArriving back at the theatre where it began and that fits it like a glove, Emma Rice and Joel Horwood's reworking of Hans Christian Andersen's tear-jerker is a real treat. There is nothing mawkish about these reworkings of well-known tales, often given a contemporary spin to remind us that we still live in a world where the lives of the poor can be snuffed out like a match.\n\nSam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, Tuesday 27 March to 21 April\n\nLG\n\nThree of the best ... dance shows Sutra\n\nOne of the great dance-theatre creations of the early 21st century, Sutra is a playful, witty and humane exploration of the rituals and philosophy of the Shaolin monks. It is choreographed by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and performed by the monks themselves, perfectly framed by Antony Gormley's designs.\n\nNew Theatre, Oxford Saturday 24; Sadler's Wells, EC1 Monday 26 to Wednesday 28 March\n\nBallet Lorent: Rumpelstiltskin\n\nThis is the third collaboration between choreographer Liv Lorent and poet Carol Ann Duffy, an updating of the fairy story that explores the forces of greed and love, and the experience of being an outcast in a regimented society. The music is by Murray Gold.\n\nPitlochry, Saturday 24; London, Friday 30 & 31 Mar; touring to 29 September\n\nJoan Clevillé Dance: Plan B for Utopia\n\nJoan Clevillé utilises the vividly contrasting, charismatic talents of Solène Weinachter and John Kendall in this playful meditation about the nature of utopia, how we communicate our hopes and how we imagine a better world.\n\nSkipton, Saturday 24; Bournemouth, Thursday 29, Totnes, Friday 30 & 31 March\n\nJM",

                "title": "Can we all just stop banging on about diversity in films?",
                "body": "A Wrinkle in Time is an important moment for women of colour but the incessant fanfare undermines its significance\n\nAva DuVernay, director of A Wrinkle In Time, spoke on the red carpet at the London premiere about how important the film was because of the diversity of the cast and crew, because the main protagonist is female and because it is part of the desire to bring a more diverse range of storytellers to the fore. Mindy Kaling, who is in the film, described DuVernay as a \"movement\", and Time magazine wrote about how the movie will change Hollywood.\n\nReviews suggest the film is dreadful. It has a 40% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Guardian's Amy Nicholson gave it two stars, and one of those stars was purely for what Oprah did to her eyebrows. I can feel you getting annoyed with me. \"What's the matter, Romesh, are you against diversity? Are you delighted that the patriarchy has been reinforced by the failure of a film with a female protagonist?\" Well, no.\n\nBefore A Wrinkle In Time came out, you would be hard pushed to find anybody to describe at length what it was about. All the press centred on how great it was to have a female director of colour, to have a female protagonist of colour and how DuVernay \"wasn't just casting actresses\" but \"leaders - icons\". I'm not suggesting any of this is bad, by the way. This is obviously long overdue. But why does everyone have to bang on about it so much?\n\nTrumpeting diversity undermines what you are trying to achieve in the first place. It should happen without fanfare. There are people who are opposed to this sort of thing, and so when a film wears diversity on its sleeve, and then falls short, they throw up their hands and say things like: \"This is what happens when you don't do things based on merit\" and, \"Do you remember the good old days when black characters were played by white blokes?\" Nobody wants these people to be happy. These people should be presented with diverse films and not told this is part of \"a movement\". This is just how it is.\n\nMaybe I'm being unfair. DuVernay probably did not want to focus on these aspects of the film, but that was all she was asked about. And there's something distasteful about me ignoring all the struggles she will have had as a black female director in Hollywood as I focus on how the film is being promoted. But I do think we all have a responsibility to push the discussion of these sorts of films away from \"a cause\".\n\nA recent Kermode and Mayo podcast featured a listener who had written to say they had found Black Panther a bit boring, and hoped that its shortcomings did not remove Hollywood's appetite for films with a black superhero at the fore. You what, mate? I remember being chased out of school by bullies throwing eggs. I ran to where my mum was waiting. She flipped out and started battering the bullies with her handbag. For two weeks, everyone called me Mummy's boy and the girl I was going out with split up with me because she couldn't take the embarrassment. That fortnight was more fun than watching Batman v Superman, but I don't remember anyone saying that movie was going to undermine the future of films with white men saving the world.\n\nBlack Panther is a great film. It has the most compelling villain of any Marvel movie, and it deals admirably with the issue of diminishing jeopardy in a million superhero films where the world is going to end. It also has an almost completely black cast and some kick-ass female characters. It deserves to be judged on its own merits. We should not be talking about this film as a giant leap forward for movie-making; we should be talking about it as one of the most exciting Marvel films for a while. I would also argue that a film set in Africa having a lot of black characters in it should probably be a given, and also that Wesley Snipes must be bloody furious that everyone's forgotten about Blade.\n\nGhostbusters is another example. After it was announced the 'Busters would all be women, breaking all stereotypical traditions from the original film except for the one with the underwritten one-dimensional black character (\"You guys are really smart about this science stuff, but I know New York and can borrow a car from my uncle!\"), the internet cracked under the pressure of a million fanboys expressing disdain from their mum's basement. The director, Paul Feig, was forced to defend these decisions and the film became a cause, with some reviewers scared to criticise it. It underperformed at the box office and the unfortunate consequence is that a load of internet losers think they've been proved right. You can find them now campaigning for the destruction of every copy of The Last Jedi.\n\nAnnouncing a diversity initiative, or making it a cause, exerts unwanted pressure. This is not restricted to movies. When the BBC's then director of television, Danny Cohen, announced that it would put at least one woman on every panel show, this made the job of every woman on a panel show more difficult. All three of them were livid. In short, we should all be pushing to make more diverse films, TV shows and business opportunities. But we probably shouldn't mention it.",

                "title": "'I'm just not snobby': how Christopher Bailey restyled Burberry",
                "body": "As the designer stands down after 17 years, he explains how he turned an ailing raincoat maker - with a reputation for 'chav check' - into one of the world's biggest luxury brands\n\nIn fashion, serious players tend to adopt outlandish characters. Karl Lagerfeld is the mischievous time traveller, with his powdered 18th-century pompadour and solid gold Apple watch. Alexander McQueen played the tattooed bad boy. Anna Wintour, with her titanium bob and poker face, is the sphinx of the front row. But Christopher Bailey is the most unsettling fashion luminary I have dealt with. Bailey, who leaves Burberry this month after 17 years, is the most successful British fashion designer of his generation, with a trophy cabinet full of industry awards, an MBE and a salary big enough to make business page headlines.\n\nBailey's shtick is that he is normal. Bailey is nice. Not nice as in lethally charming, or nice as in seductively conspiratorial, just nice as in nice. It is hard to explain how disarming this is, when you are used to operatic ego. The week before his final Burberry catwalk show, I arrive at Thomas's cafe inside the Burberry store in London's Regent Street 15 minutes before I am due to meet him, but he is already there, tucked in a corner banquette. He spots me, puts away his phone and jumps up to greet me with a Tiggerish bounce. \"How are you? Lovely to see you! Have you had a busy day? Did you have lunch? Would you like anything to eat?\" Bailey's wholesomely sandy-haired looks give him an air, even at 46, of having just stepped out of an advert for cornflakes, or Lego, or cocoa. He is unremarkably dressed in a neatly buttoned denim shirt and dark trousers, his only accessory a plain gold wedding band.\n\nWhat Bailey has achieved, however, is not normal at all. He transformed an antiquated coat maker into one of the world's top luxury brands. He gave Burberry such momentum that it had a halo effect on the rest of British fashion, making London fashion week a draw again. He is the only non-founding designer to have made himself so fundamental to a leading brand as to be awarded control of the boardroom as well as the design studio, as Bailey was for three years until last summer. But then, while on holiday in Italy with his husband, the actor Simon Woods, and their daughters (Iris, three, and Nell, two), he decided to leave Burberry. It was \"one of the most difficult decisions I have made, but also one of the easiest\". The design studio has been handed over to his successor, Riccardo Tisci, but until the end of this year Bailey remains attached to Burberry in an advisory role, giving him a few months' breathing space until he takes on whatever is next. Woods - Daddy to their little girls, while Bailey is Dad - is delighted.\n\nAt its best, fashion involves a kind of synaesthesia: put on a truly great party dress, and confidence and excitement seep into your skin like a happy pill melting on your tongue. A perfect cashmere sweater envelops you in comfort and nostalgia as evocatively as perfume. This effect has always been fundamental to the seductive power of iconic fashion brands, but at Burberry, Bailey realised that 21st-century technology would allow him to take this to the masses for the first time. Advertising posters dispensed squirts of Burberry fragrance when a wrist was placed beneath a sensor. With livestreamed catwalk shows and Spotify playlists, Bailey used the internet to bring the experience of high-end shopping to an audience watching on their phones. This was fashion's Industrial Revolution.\n\nBailey was born in Yorkshire, near Halifax, son of a joiner and a Marks & Spencer window dresser. At 29, he had designed for Donna Karan in New York and spent five years as Tom Ford's right hand at Gucci when he was approached by Rose Marie Bravo, the American businesswoman who had recently taken charge at Burberry and embarked on a revamp, hiring Kate Moss for an ad campaign. Both Bailey and Bravo tell the story of their meeting, in a hotel bar in Milan in late 2000, as if it were a first date. \"I walked in and there was this glorious woman, smiling, fizzing with energy... she completely seduced me,\" Bailey says. Bravo has described it as \"like divine intervention\". They talked for hours about what they could make Burberry into.\n\n\"There wasn't any other brand for us to emulate,\" Bailey says. \"We are not a traditional luxury company with a history of making shoes or bags for the aristocracy. We make coats. It's quite practical.\" In the 1870s, a draper called Thomas Burberry noticed how the crude lanolin coating on shepherds' smocks kept out rain while being cooler and lighter than traditional waterproofs, and experimented with treatments for Egyptian cotton until he came up with gaberdine, a breathable fabric that kept rain out. He patented it, and soon after received a commission from the British army to make \"trenchcoats\" for officers. But by the time Bravo and Bailey arrived on the scene, Burberry had declined into \"a check design heading towards oblivion... overdependent on tourists, licensees and the grey market\", Bravo said in 2002.\n\nRainwear may be utilitarian, but rain is poetic, and Bailey made Burberry stand for both. There are 46 trenchcoats in the current collection, from the honey-coloured, belted gaberdine classic to a laminated silver lace that, while waterproof, would look more at home on a red carpet than trudging a footpath. \"I used to cycle a lot as a kid, along Haworth moor, near where the Brontës lived,\" Bailey says. \"When it's sunny, it's beautiful, but when it's misty and rainy, it's almost more magical. I love proper weather.\" In 2012, the show finale was a cloudburst that sent rain streaming down on the Perspex marquee covering the catwalk and audience. In 2014, a show in Shanghai ended with Cara Delevingne taking flight, Mary Poppins-style, with a magic umbrella. The company HQ in Pimlico, central London, which Bailey helped design, is built around a glass atrium made to amplify the noise made by raindrops. Why settle for identifying your brand with anything as analogue as a logo when you can appropriate the weather? What, after all, could be more British?\n\nBailey had been at Burberry less than two years when a paparazzi photograph of actor Danniella Westbrook in a Burberry check outfit and handbag, pushing her daughter in a Burberry check buggy, whipped up a tabloid frenzy about \"chavs\" driving the brand downmarket. Bailey remembers it as \"a strange moment. On a personal level, I felt very uncomfortable with all the media aggression towards this one person. But also, I am just not snobby. I grew up in a working-class family. I went to quite a tough school.\"\n\nBailey has tried to smooth the edges of the brand's somewhat fractious relationship with class - he is fond of pointing out that the trenchcoat has been worn by everyone from Sid Vicious to Princess Margaret - but the tale of the \"chav check\" cast a long shadow. In his early Burberry collections, he worked hard to frame Burberry as a high-class outfit: a serene colour palette, an unflashy aesthetic, shows soundtracked by soulful singer-songwriters. This new Burberry projected an RP kind of Britishness, with moodboards peopled by the nation's artistic greats, ad campaigns with sharp-cheekboned young aristocrats. Famous names - Freud, Delevingne, Beckham - recurred. More recently, a more democratic vision has emerged, celebrating working-class culture. Last September, by which time he knew he was leaving, though the audience didn't, his catwalk show was accompanied by an exhibition of British documentary photography, from Ken Russell's portraits of postwar London kids, posing and smoking in bombsites, to Martin Parr's images of rainy picnics and jostling in the queue for the buffet.\n\nBailey's own love of art began with the Yorkshire Sculpture Park near his home, and a Lowry in the hall. \"In the house where I grew up, the telephone was at the bottom of the stairs, and where we sat to talk, my parents had a Lowry print - I mean, like a photocopied print. That is such a vivid memory, looking at that for hours while I was on the phone to my friends. I had an amazing upbringing, because of the values my mum and dad instilled and the beautiful place we lived, but it wasn't by any stretch of the imagination fancy.\"\n\nWhen Bailey was a student in London, his father wanted to buy his mother a watch she had seen in a magazine for Christmas. \"He saved up for it, sent me a cheque, and I cashed it and went to the store in Bond Street with a big wedge of cash in my pocket. I'd never bought anything from that kind of shop before; none of us had. We were all excited. But they were so rude to me, intimidating and snooty. They made me feel belittled to the point where it was a really awful experience. It was an 'entry price point' watch, but of course we didn't know that. It was a lot of money to us. And when I called my dad, I had to lie to him, to pretend it had been this magical experience, because that was part of what we all thought we were buying. My dad worked really hard for that money, and that was a really important moment for my family.\" He stops, and smiles. \"But my mum loved her watch, anyway.\"\n\nAs well as class, Bailey's Burberry has been about gender. In a time when feminism, gender roles, equality and gender fluidity have been front of mind in newsreels and popular culture, the premier British fashion brand has been one whose iconic piece - the trenchcoat - is unisex. \"That was one of the things that attracted me to Burberry in the first place,\" Bailey says. \"In 2001, when I was trying to work out what Burberry was about, I wrote a list and put both 'masculine' and 'feminine' down. That is part of the magic of the trenchcoat. The only real difference is which way it crosses.\" (By sartorial tradition, a man's double-breasted jacket or coat fastens left over right and a woman's right over left.) \"My team and I have talked many times about doing away with that and having it just one way. But we are all so familiar with the motion, even if we aren't conscious of it. The trenchcoat is unisex, but it talks about gender, if you know what I mean.\"\n\nIf he crafted a Burberry that was about Britishness, class and gender, it was also, inevitably, about Christopher Bailey. \"I came to this job straight from five years with Tom [Ford] at Gucci, which was a very nomadic life. For three or four years, I didn't have a home. I mean, literally. I just lived in hotels.\" Pining for home, he found Burberry, whose trenchcoats were made in Yorkshire, and made the brand into his own love letter to home. \"I suppose, in a way, I made Burberry up to suit myself. I am from Yorkshire, I grew up cycling in the rain. Someone else might have seen this brand quite differently. Maybe I'm just, you know, a massive egomaniac.\" He looks quite taken with this idea.\n\nIf he hadn't been fashion's first 21st-century visionary, Bailey could have made a great spy. He notices everything, remembers everything: he can place our waitress's accent, remembers the names of my children. His everyman persona extends to a habit of disappearing himself from his own sentences, answering questions about what he thinks or feels with answers about what \"lots of people\" think or feel. The effect is somehow humble and distancing at the same time. He is always warm, but never intimate: he has a habit, when he makes a point, of reaching out as if to clasp my arm, but he never makes contact. When the waitress brings my pot of tea, she puts down a wooden egg timer, explaining the darjeeling will be brewed when the sands have emptied. It is a very Burberry touch: cosy, nostalgic. Bailey, who masterminded every detail of this most English of tearooms, is drinking a strong cappuccino.\n\nThere is only one point during our two conversations when any spiky edges come into view. We are talking about how Bailey's own upbringing contrasts with his daughters' lives, since he earns \"a lot of money - as the world knows\", he says, turning pink. Shortly after he became the first gun-for-hire designer to combine the CEO role with design duties in 2014, a salary package that was estimated at almost £15m provoked one of the biggest shareholder revolts in British business history. After a series of bruising boardroom encounters, Bailey handed back the CEO role last July, appointing Marco Gobbetti from Céline. With hindsight, was taking on both roles a mistake? He looks down at his hands, which are suddenly busy brushing crumbs from the tablecloth. (There are no crumbs. The artisan cookie on the saucer of Bailey's cappuccino is untouched.) \"Look, it was never something I aspired to do. It was not on my radar. I still believe I - we - made the right decision for that moment.\"\n\nThe business world, he feels, was not prepared to believe a designer could be a CEO. \"Tom understands business, a brand, how to motivate people, and I learned a lot from him. But for lots of people, the idea of a designer is this person throwing chiffon into the air and seeing how it falls.\" Anyway, the dual role didn't work out. \"And if I had known how much it would end up taking me away from the things I really love to do, I probably wouldn't have done it.\"\n\nThe next time I see him, it is the Saturday night of London fashion week, after his final show, and he is taking a bow in front of Naomi Campbell, Chelsea Clinton and 1,200 others, stars of the British fashion industry who have come to say goodbye to the Burberry-Bailey era. Farewell catwalk shows tend towards mawkish overindulgence of ego - designers walking the aisle flanked by adoring supermodels, the front row reaching out to touch hands as if for a papal blessing, carnations on every seat to be thrown in gaudy heartbreak - but the focus of this show is a new rainbow version of the Burberry check, which Bailey has designed in order to have this collection stand for LGBTQ rights. The visual symbolism is of the Burberry check, lightning rod for class division and social prejudice, recast as a badge of tolerance. Backed by donations to charities, this goes beyond the fuzzy kind of lip service to equality and diversity commonplace in fashion right now to something more tangible.\n\nAfter the show, Bailey is mobbed by well-wishers - Kate Moss has to elbow her way through the throng - until he disappears to have dinner with his husband and his parents, who have travelled to London for the show along with his closest friend since schooldays, a psychiatric nurse who still lives in Yorkshire. His daughters stayed home and watched the show on livestream. (\"Look! It's Dad!\" Iris called out to the babysitter when Bailey took his bow.)\n\nThree days later, Bailey comes down from his sixth-floor office to fetch me for a cup of tea. We are at Burberry's London headquarters now, rather than the store. The top button of his shirt is unbuttoned this time, and he is wearing suede desert boots instead of polished shoes. He makes a point of being the one to hold the lift door open for everyone else as we rise to a sixth-floor meeting room full of enormous bouquets that arrived on the day of the show. An assistant brings builders' tea for me, mint tea for Bailey.\n\n\"I didn't want to do a greatest hits,\" he says when I ask about the last collection. \"I knew early on that I wanted this last show to have a positive message, a real one. It might be seen as commercially sensitive, but the area of LGBTQ rights is personal to me, and I'm really happy we did it.\" Sunday morning was lovely, he says - \"We had a nice walk, before my parents went home\" - but since then he has been feeling pensive. \"It will take some adjusting to figure out what my identity is outside of... this,\" he says, sweeping an arm around the room, the flowers, the meeting table, the assistant stationed outside. \"And I literally hadn't given it any thought until Sunday. When it hits me is when I think about my team. Seventeen years is a long time to work with people. They have been there with me through incredible sadness [Bailey's previous partner, Geert Cloet, a fellow fashion designer, died of a brain tumour in 2005 at the age of 36] and then finding happiness. They were at my wedding, they know my children. And I have been through the same with them. And that's what it comes down to in the end, isn't it? People.\"\n\nWhat Bailey wants next is \"some balance in my life\". The family have recently moved from Kensington to north London to be close to Hampstead Heath while the girls are growing up. He is looking forward to having more time for family life. \"Simon is so much cleverer than I am. He is an extraordinary man and an incredible father. I am learning how to do lots of things from him.\" As to 2019, he claims innocence. \"I don't have a plan, I really don't. I am excited by doing something new, but that could be something big, or something small. You can bop me one on the head if it turns out later that I'm not telling the truth right now.\" It might be a more tangential move than to another design studio. (Angela Ahrendts, with whom Bailey worked closely at Burberry from 2006 to 2014, left to join Apple, and Bailey's interest in technology is well known.) \"I will say that I wouldn't have left this job that I love just to go and do the same thing somewhere else. That would feel strange, because this was a bit special.\"\n\nJess Cartner-Morley is fashion journalist of the year 2018.\n\nCommenting on this piece?

                "body": "An indulgent Easter menu of slow-cooked lamb, chocolate- orange money bread and a sweet, cheesy dessert\n\nLike many other religious festivals, with their food traditions that stand on very feeble historical legs, Easter is, for me, simply an excuse to eat things I wouldn't normally indulge in. Chocolate-soaked bread? I'll have that as a morning snack. A rich shoulder of lamb with lots of lemon and mint? That'll be my main. And for dessert? A Middle Eastern cheesy bake soaked in cardamom sugar syrup. Feel free to pick and choose when you're doing the big shop for next weekend, but I'll be having the lot. Happy Easter.\n\nChocolate and orange monkey bread (pictured above)\n\nMonkey bread is an enriched sweet bread made with lots of pieces of soft, sugar- or syrup-coated dough all stuck together, and you eat it by tearing apart the warm, gooey, soft bread, much as a monkey might. If you don't have a large bundt tin, improvise with a 28cm cake tin with an upturned bowl in the middle, to create a hole in the centre. The loaf will keep for two days, but it needs reheating before serving.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 3 hr (including proving)\n\nServes 12\n\n200ml whole milk\n\n90ml water\n\n40g caster sugar\n\n60g unsalted butter, plus 10g extra, melted, for greasing\n\n1 tsp vanilla essence\n\n7g sachet fast-action dried yeast\n\n280g strong white bread flour\n\n280g plain flour, plus a little extra for dusting\n\n¾ tsp salt\n\n100g dark chocolate chips\n\nFor the sauce\n\n135g unsalted butter\n\n120g soft dark brown sugar\n\nFinely grated zest of 1 large orange\n\n80g golden syrup\n\n2 tbsp Dutch processed cocoa powder\n\nGently warm the first five ingredients in a small saucepan on a medium heat for a minute or two, until the butter is almost melted and the milk is tepid - take care not to overheat the mixture, otherwise you'll kill the yeast. Turn off the heat, then whisk in the yeast and set aside for 15 minutes, until slightly frothy.\n\nPut both flours and the salt in the bowl of a free-standing mixer with the dough hook in place, add the yeast mixture and knead for three minutes; start on the lowest speed and increase to medium, pausing every now and then to scrape down the sides so you incorporate all the flour. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and spread it out slightly. Scatter the chocolate chips in the middle, fold over the dough to enclose them, then knead for five minutes by hand, until it is springy and soft, and the chocolate is evenly distributed. Put the dough in a large floured bowl, cover with cling-film and leave in a warm spot for 45 minutes, until it has almost doubled in size. Meanwhile, brush the inside of a large bundt tin (24cm in diameter at the top, 20cm at the bottom, 8cm high) with the melted butter.\n\nFor the sauce, put all the ingredients in a small saucepan on a medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, for three to four minutes, until the butter, sugar and syrup have melted together into a thick, rich sauce.\n\nRoll the dough into a long sausage, then cut into 24 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then drop them one by one into the sauce, until roughly coated all over. Put the coated balls of dough in the bundt tin, building up the layers in the tin as you go. When all the dough is coated, pour any remaining sauce over the contents of the tin, then cover and leave in a warm spot for 45 minutes, until nearly doubled in size again.\n\nHeat the oven to 160C/320F/gas 2½. Bake the monkey bread for 35 minutes, until well risen and golden brown, then leave to cool for five minutes. Put a large plate on top of the tin and invert the bread on to the plate. Lift off the tin, leave the bread to rest and cool for 10 minutes more, then serve warm.\n\nSlow-cooked lamb shoulder with mint and cumin\n\nMarinate the lamb overnight if you can, so the flavours really seep into the meat, and give it four hours at the very least. If you're planning to eat this on the day of cooking, you'll have to get going first thing, because it needs six and a half hours in the oven, but it's fine to be cooked a day ahead, then kept in the fridge, ready to be shredded and warmed up in its own juices.\n\nPrep 12 min\n\nMarinate 4-12 hr\n\nCook 6½ hr\n\nServes 4-6\n\n2 lemons, zest finely grated, to get 1 tbsp, then juiced, to get 4 tbsp\n\n6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n\n1 tbsp paprika\n\n½ tsp fenugreek seeds, lightly crushed\n\n2 tsp ground cumin\n\n25g mint leaves\n\n15g coriander\n\n3 tbsp olive oil\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n1 large lamb shoulder (about 2kg)\n\n1 celeriac, peeled and cut into 3cm-wide wedges (850g net weight)\n\n5 large carrots, peeled and cut in half, widthways (600g net weight)\n\n2 whole heads garlic, cut in half widthways\n\nPut the lemon zest, lemon juice, crushed garlic, spices, herbs and oil in the small bowl of a food processor with a teaspoon and a half of salt and plenty of pepper. Blitz to a rough paste and set aside.\n\nPut the lamb in a large bowl and stab the meat all over about 30 times with a small, sharp knife. Rub the spice paste all over the meat, massaging it into the incisions, then cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for at least four hours (and ideally overnight).\n\nHeat the oven to 170C/335F/gas 3. Transfer the lamb and all its marinade into a large, high-sided baking dish about 30cm x 40cm. Cover the tray tightly with tin foil and roast for an hour, then turn down the heat to 160C/320F/gas 2½, add the celeriac, carrots and half garlic heads (put these in cut side up) to the tray, and cover again with the same foil. Roast for another four hours, basting three or four times during the cooking time (and resealing the tray with foil each time).\n\nRemove the foil and roast for another hour and a half, until the lamb is browned all over, the meat is falling apart and the vegetables are caramelised.\n\nKanafeh\n\nThis cheese-filled pastry soaked in sugar syrup is hugely popular throughout the Middle East, and with good reason. You can eat it warm, when the cheese is soft and melted, or at room temperature. You will need to go to a Middle Eastern grocer to find the kadaifi pastry, or buy it online (it freezes well, so stock up). Serve kanafeh as a dessert or afternoon snack with mint tea or coffee. It's best eaten fresh, but if you need to keep it for more than a few hours, refrigerate and reheat in the oven later.\n\nPrep 8 min\n\nCook 80 min\n\nMakes 24 slices\n\n1 generous pinch saffron\n\n330g caster sugar\n\nSeeds from 10 cardamom pods, crushed (I use a pestle and mortar) - you want ⅓ tsp)\n\n1 tbsp lemon juice\n\n170g ghee, melted\n\n400g kadaifi pastry\n\n200g hard mozzarella, grated\n\n70g Rosary goat's cheese, or another soft variety, crumbled\n\n70g feta, crumbled\n\n60g shelled pistachios, roughly blitzed in a food processor\n\nPut the saffron in medium saucepan, pour over 120ml boiling water and leave to steep for 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar and ground cardamom seeds, then bring to a boil on a medium-high heat, swirling the pan frequently, until the sugar dissolves. Off the heat, stir in the lemon juice, then leave to cool.\n\nHeat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Brush the base and sides of a 34cm x 24cm Swiss roll tin with 10g of the melted ghee.\n\nPull apart the pastry so it's not all squashed together, then pulse a few times in a food processor to shred it slightly (you may need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your machine). Transfer to a large bowl and mix with the remaining 160g melted ghee, until the pastry is completely coated. Press two-thirds of the pastry firmly into the tin, then sprinkle over the three cheeses. Top the cheese with the remaining pastry, spreading it out in an even layer, then bake for 35 minutes, turning the tin around halfway through, until golden brown and crisp. Take out of the oven and leave to cool for 10 minutes.\n\nOn a work surface, lay out a piece of baking paper that is just bigger than the tin, then flip the kanafeh on to the paper, so it is upside down. Carefully lift the kanafeh on its paper back into the baking tin, so it remains bottom side up.\n\nWarm the sugar syrup on a medium heat for a minute, to thin it down a little, pour evenly over the kanafeh, then sprinkle on the nuts. Leave to rest for 10 minutes before cutting into slices and serving warm or at room temperature.\n\nFood styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay",

                "title": "Should I have a baby to please my dying mother?",
                "body": "You need to step back when you feel so overwhelmed, says Annalisa Barbieri\n\nMy mother was recently diagnosed with a terminal disease, with a prognosis of two to four years. I am 34, close to my mum and she's a great mother, but for the last few years she has been pressuring me to have a baby. And since being diagnosed, she has upped the pressure.\n\nMy partner of 12 years has never wanted children. Although I imagined I would have children when we met in our early 20s, it didn't seem important at the time and I hoped he might change his mind. I assumed I would get broody at some point, and that would force the issue - but I never have.\n\nEven before my mother's diagnosis, it was something I worried about constantly. Due to my age, I knew I had to make a choice between my life with my partner (which I am worried will be consumed by a child) and having a baby. I decided I was going to use the next year to travel and would resolve whether to leave my boyfriend and find a partner who wanted children. However, this timeline has been torn to shreds. It isn't just for my mother that I want to have a child while she's alive, it's also for me, because I would value her help.\n\nI don't want to break up with my partner. Although we have our problems, I can't imagine being with anyone else. My mother loves him, too, and would be devastated if we broke up. I don't know if I would have time to break up, heal, meet someone I could fall in love with, get pregnant and have a baby in the time my mother has left. I feel that I'm in an impossible situation. It also doesn't help that I live a 10-hour plane ride from my parents.\n\nI'm really sorry to hear about your mum. That alone would be enough to unbalance anyone. Facing loss is bound to make you look at life and want to accelerate everything to fit it into your mum's last few years. But you clearly cannot have a baby just for your mother's sake. Nor can you stay with your boyfriend if this relationship isn't going in the direction you want, simply because your mum would be devastated if you split up. There are so many different scenarios that may unfold with your mother's illness, that you cannot hinge any big life decisions around it. That's before we factor in the huge distance between you.\n\nWhat I see is that this concerns three things: coming to terms with your mother's illness and prognosis; whether you want to stay with your partner; if you want to have a baby. I don't see the last two as connected to the first.\n\nHave you ever focused on what you want? Your choices seem to have been dictated by other people. You seem to have been planning to have a baby at some point, but buried that desire because your partner didn't want one, but now your mother's illness has made you a little braver and enabled you to think about what you might want. However, the specialist I consulted this week (psychotherapist Carol Leader, bpc.org.uk) and I disagreed on this - she didn't detect that you really wanted a baby, but I did. And perhaps this reflects the contradictions within you. \"It's wishful thinking that there is one perfect choice,\" Leader said. \"Any decision comes with some loss, some pain as well as gain.\"\n\nWe all need to balance what's more gain than pain to make any decision. But how can you do that under the shadow of this awful news? What you need to do is step back when you feel so overwhelmed.\n\nLeader had some good, practical suggestions which may help you: \"Try to spend a month acting as if you've decided to have a child, and a month acting as if you've decided definitely not to have one. This can give you some space to allow you to move from this stuck place you're currently in.\"\n\nShe also asked: \"How would you feel if your partner said he'd changed his mind and wanted to have a baby?\"\n\nAnd I'd like to add: how would you feel if your mother suddenly stopped putting pressure on you? These exercises may help you focus on what you really want and from that, hopefully, you can think about what to do next.\n\nYou need to talk to your partner. Your relationship should be able to sustain an honest conversation. Your partner's response may clarify things for you. Your mother is ill, but needs to stop telling you to have a baby \"to give her life meaning\" (which is what you said in your longer letter). This is a really difficult situation. \"There is no magic solution,\" says Leader, \"only real ones.\"\n\n* Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

                "title": "'A grand illusion': seven days that shattered Facebook's facade",
                "body": "\"Dumb fucks.\" That's how Mark Zuckerberg described users of Facebook for trusting him with their personal data back in 2004. If the last week is anything to go by, he was right.\n\nSince the Observer reported that the personal data of about 50 million Americans had been harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, it has become increasingly apparent that the social network has been far more lax with its data sharing practices than many users realised.\n\nAs the scandal unfurled over the last seven days, Facebook's lackluster response has highlighted a fundamental challenge for the company: how can it condemn the practice on which its business model depends?\n\n\"This is the story we have been waiting for so people will pay attention not just to Facebook but the entire surveillance economy,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.\n\nSince Zuckerberg's \"dumb fucks\" comment, Facebook has gone to great lengths to convince members of the public that it's all about \"connecting people\" and \"building a global community\". This pseudo-uplifting marketing speak is much easier for employees and users to stomach than the mission of \"guzzling personal data so we can micro-target you with advertising\".\n\nIn the wake of the revelations that Cambridge Analytica misappropriated data collected by Dr Aleksandr Kogan under the guise of academic research, Facebook has scrambled to blame these rogue third parties for \"platform abuse\". \"The entire company is outraged we were deceived,\" said the company in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nHowever in highlighting the apparent deceit, the company has been forced to shine a light on its underlying business model and years of careless data sharing practices.\n\nSure, the data changed hands between the researcher and Cambridge Analytica in apparent violation of Kogan's agreement with Facebook, but everything else was above board. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica got hold of and used to deliver targeted advertising based on personality types - including activities, interests, check-ins, location, photos, religion, politics, relationship details - was not unusual in the slightest. This was a feature, not a bug.\n\n'Extremely friendly to app developers'\n\nThere are thousands of other developers, including the makers of dating app Tinder, games such as FarmVille as well as consultants to Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign, who slurped huge quantities of data about users and their friends - all thanks to Facebook's overly permissive \"Graph API\", the interface through which third parties could interact with Facebook's platform.\n\nFacebook opened up in order to attract app developers to join Facebook's ecosystem at a time when the company was playing catch-up in shifting its business from desktops to people's smartphones. It was a symbiotic relationship that was critical to Facebook's growth.\n\n\"They wanted to push as much of the conversation, ad revenue and digital activity as possible and made it extremely friendly to app developers,\" said Jeff Hauser, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \"Now they are complaining that the developers abused them. They wanted that. They were encouraging it. They may now regret it but they knowingly unleashed the forces that have led to this lack of trust and loss of privacy.\"\n\nThe terms were updated in April 2014 to restrict the data new developers could get hold of, including to people's friends' data, but only after four years of access to the Facebook firehose. Companies that plugged inbefore April 2015 had another year before access was restricted.\n\n\"There are all sorts of companies that are in possession of terabytes of information from before 2015,\" said Jeff Hauser of the Center for Economic Policy and Research. \"Facebook's practices don't bear up to close, informed scrutiny nearly as well as they look from the 30,000ft view, which is how people had been viewing Facebook previously.\"\n\nFor too long consumers have thought about privacy on Facebook in terms of whether their ex-boyfriends or bosses could see their photos. However, as we fiddle around with our profile privacy settings, the real intrusions have been taking place elsewhere.\n\n\"In this sense, Facebook's 'privacy settings' are a grand illusion. Control over post-sharing - people we share to - should really be called 'publicity settings',\" explains Jonathan Albright, the research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. \"Likewise, control over passive sharing - the information people [including third party apps] can take info from us - should be called 'privacy settings'.\"\n\nEssentially Facebook gives us privacy \"busywork\" to make us think we have control, while making it very difficult to truly lock down our accounts.\n\n'The biggest issue I've ever seen'\n\nFacebook is dealing with a PR minefield. The more it talks about its advertising practices, the more more people join the #DeleteFacebook movement. Even the co-founder of WhatsApp, Brian Acton, who profited from Facebook's $19bn acquisition of his app, this week said he was deleting his account.\n\n\"This is the biggest issue I've ever seen any technology company face in my time,\" said Roger McNamee, Zuckerberg's former mentor.\n\n\"It's not like tech hasn't had a lot of scandals,\" he said, mentioning the Theranos fraud and MiniScribe packing actual bricks into boxes instead of hard drives. \"But no one else has played a role in undermining democracy or the persecution of monitories before. This is a whole new ball game in the tech world and it's really, really horrible.\"\n\nFacebook first discovered that Kogan had shared data with Cambridge Analytica when a Guardian journalist contacted the company about it at the end of 2015. It asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and revoked the Kogan's apps' API access. However, Facebook relied on Cambridge Analytica's word that they had done so.\n\nWhen the Observer contacted Facebook last week with testimony from a whistleblower stating that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted the data, Facebook's reaction was to try to get ahead of the story by publishing its own disclosure late on Friday and threatening to sue to prevent publication of its bombshell discoveries.\n\nThen followed five days of virtual silence from the company, as the chorus of calls from critics grew louder, and further details of Facebook's business dealings emerged.\n\nA second whistleblower, the former Facebook manager Sandy Parakilas, revealed that he found Facebook's lack of control over the data given to outside developers \"utterly horrifying\". He told the Guardian that he had warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach but was discouraged from investigating further.\n\nAt around the same time it emerged that the co-director of the company that harvested the Facebook data before passing it to Cambridge Analytic is a current employee at Facebook. Joseph Chancellor worked alongside Aleksandr Kogan at Global Science Research, which exfiltrated the data using a personality app under the guise of academic research.\n\nDemand for answers\n\nPoliticians on both sides of the Atlantic called for answers. In the US, the Democratic senator Mark Warner called for regulation, describing the online political advertising market as the \"wild west\".\n\n\"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,\" he said.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission plans to examine whether the social networking site violated a 2011 agreement with the agency over data privacy over its data-sharing practices.\n\nIn the UK, MPs summoned Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to give evidence to a select committee investigating fake news.\n\n\"I think they are in a very bad situation because they have long benefitted from the tech illiteracy of the political community,\" said Hauser.\n\nThe backlash spooked investors, wiping almost $50bn off the valuation of the company in two days, although the stock has since rallied slightly.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zuckerberg finally broke his silence in a Facebook post acknowledging that the policies that allowed the misuse of data were a \"breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it\".\n\nFacebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, added her own comment: \"We know that this was a major violation of people's trust, and I deeply regret that we didn't do enough to deal with it.\"\n\nThe company will investigate apps that had access to \"large amounts of information\" before the 2014 changes and audit thousands of apps that show \"suspicious activity\". The company will also inform those whose data was \"misused\", including people who were directly affected by the Kogan data operation.\n\nThese actions don't go far enough, said Vaidhyanathan.\n\n\"Facebook has a history of putting on that innocent little boy voice: 'Oh I didn't know that I shouldn't hold the cat by its tail',\" he said. \"I think we're tired of it at this point.\"\n\nThese problems were pointed out by scholars years ago, said Robyn Caplan, a researcher at Data & Society, but Facebook's response was slow and insufficient.\n\n\"They have been trying to put out a lot of little fires but we need them to build a fire department,\" she said.",

                "body": "Programmes to tackle poverty could be just as effective in the fight against tuberculosis as medicines and vaccines, research has found.\n\nEradicating extreme poverty would lead to an 84% reduction in TB cases by 2035, according to a report published to coincide with World Tuberculosis Day on Saturday.\n\nNine scientists and policymakers carried out research examining incidences of TB across 192 countries for a study that appears in Lancet Global Health.\n\nThe conclusions were reached by looking at the links between people living on less than $1.90 a day and the coverage of various social programmes in each country. Researchers then related this to the current levels of TB, projecting the associations forward 20 years.\n\nMore than 95% of deaths from TB occur in low- and middle-income countries, so the association between poverty and TB are well established. However, researchers say the latest findings are significant in providing new evidence of the links.\n\n\"This study is important to show that preventative measures have great impact,\" explained Daniel Carter, research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\n\"We tend to only engage with TB patients when they are already ill, but this is not enough to eliminate TB. Poverty reduction could be just as effective in tackling the disease as drugs and vaccines.\"\n\nCarter, who co-authored the study, added: \"Science is sexy but poverty elimination is not. If a biomedical tool were to show the same efficacy on TB it would be immediately implemented, but expanding social programmes requires more political will and ambition from health and development leaders.\"\n\nTuberculosis is among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. In 2016, 10.4 million people fell ill with TB and a further 1.7 million died from the disease.\n\nThe bacterial infection mainly affects the lungs and can be spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person. There is a vaccine for TB, but it has limited effectiveness.\n\nThe countries worse affected by the disease include India, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nIn its 2015 End TB Strategy, the World Health Organisation, for the first time, called for social support and poverty alleviation strategies for people with TB.\n\nNow scientists say there is a growing body of evidence that social programmes are alleviating the burden in some regions.\n\nA study in Brazil found a state-led cash transfer programme, conditional on eligible families sending children to school and giving them basic vaccinations, can improve treatment outcomes for TB by 10%.\n\n\"Social protection programmes, such as Brazil's Bolsa Familia scheme, could potentially lift vulnerable individuals far enough out of poverty that they never contract TB in the first place,\" said Carter.\n\nThe programme covers around 14 million families - amounting to 25% of the Brazilian population - who have a family per capita income of less than £30 a month. Cash assistance of £35 a month to each household has halved extreme poverty in the region.\n\nCarter said the 10% improvement figure is significant because the programme is not specifically targeted at TB patients. If such a programme was extended to all those suffering from TB it would be incredibly cost-effective.\n\nCarter acknowledges drugs and vaccines for TB play an important role, but added: \"Eradicating TB will never be about DNA sequencing or shorter drug regimens. Biomedical innovation takes money and time - two things TB patients do not have.\n\n\"Anti-poverty policies are available now and the evidence suggests they work. The battle to end TB is not just against a pathogen, but an ideology.\"\n\nTom Wingfield, clinical lecturer in infectious diseases at Liverpool University, agrees.\n\n\"Recent global TB control strategy has been disproportionately focused on medicines and tests rather than addressing the social causes of the TB epidemic.\"\n\nWingfield has been gathering evidence of the links between poverty reduction and TB in shanty towns near Lima, Peru along with the research group, Innovation for Health and Development.\n\nThe team examined the hidden costs in TB-affected households including travel to clinics, food and lost income. When the costs exceeded a fifth of a household's annual income the patient was more likely to abandon treatment or die.\n\n\"Our findings had identified a crucial factor explaining why medicines alone were not controlling TB. In response we provided social and financial support for affected households - bank transfers of up to $40 a month and visits by our research nurses,\" he said.\n\n\"The intervention was a success. Supported TB patients were significantly more likely to complete their treatment or be cured, and their children were more likely to take medicine to prevent TB.\"",

I might wake in a shepherd's hut or a cave; last week, I woke in the Jordanian desert and discovered hyena tracks nearby. I've had wolves, leopards and elephants loitering, and once woke up with a snake in my tent. By nightfall, I'm usually so exhausted that I spark out by 11.30pm.\n\nEat\n\nMy diet depends on my location. I've eaten bush rat in Uganda and maggot stew in South Sudan, and can easily lose 10kg during a long expedition. If I'm in England, I try to stick to three square meals, ideally smoked salmon and scrambled eggs for breakfast, mozzarella and avocado salad for lunch, then curry for dinner. I'll have the occasional burger, but every few months I do a vegan detox week: it's not much fun, but I feel great at the end of it.\n\nWork\n\nThere's no average day on an expedition, but if I'm writing at home, I'm very disciplined. I'll aim for 3,000 words a day from 9am to 5pm, punctuated by a lunchtime walk. I remove any distractions: no phone, no internet. My mantra is, \"Write something - it's better than nothing,\" and if I get cabin fever, I'll decamp to a local pub or cafe. On trips, which can last six months with no days off, I keep journals, organise daily logistics and sort visa issues. It's intense and I love it, but I've not had a holiday for five years (although my mother says my life is one big holiday).\n\nFamily\n\nIt's a tricky balancing act keeping in touch with people, and the wedding and party invites are a bit sparse. I don't have a significant other - my lifestyle's not conducive to a conventional relationship - but after my next big trip next year, I think I'll go on a wife hunt.\n\nFun\n\nI'm planning to treat myself to an actual holiday this year, and do some more routine stuff like going down the pub with mates. Relaxation when I'm travelling is usually reading. I'd also like to restart some old hobbies like boxing and yoga, and to enjoy some simple walks in the park.\n\n* Levison Wood is a supporter of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award.",

                "title": "Time for change: Ann Enright on Ireland's abortion referendum",
                "body": "Recently I spoke to a reasonable, sane Irishwoman who said that she was against abortion and because she was so reasonable and sane, I was curious what she meant by that. Was she against the morning after pill? Certainly not. What about chemical abortifacients? They did not really worry her too much. So, what about terminations before 12 or 13 weeks, the time when woman are often given the all clear to confirm their pregnancy to family and friends? This woman was not, all things considered, against terminations during this window, when pregnancy is not considered medically certain. She was also, just to make clear, in favour of abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape and incest. In 1983 this woman might have voted \"against abortion\", despite the fact that she is not against abortion, especially if it happens during those weeks when the natural loss of an embryo is called miscarriage. She just found abortion, in general, hard to vote \"for\". Had there been no referendum in 1983 - where people with a range of uncertainties were asked for a single \"yes\" or \"no\" - then limited abortion might well be available now in Ireland, in the way that the morning after pill is legally available and widely used.\n\nThe 1983 referendum was a little like the Brexit referendum - a population voting about something that seemed, on one side, clear, and on the other, contingent and hard to describe. As it turned out, the language problem worked both ways. In order to bring the issue to a vote, a new legal term had to be minted, one that did not appear in any previous laws. The eighth amendment to the Irish constitution acknowledges the right to life of \"the unborn\" and this seemed to invent a new category of rights-holder, possibly a new kind of person. By acknowledging the \"equal right to life of the mother\" an impregnated woman was changed from a human being into a relationship, that of motherhood, and a peculiar equivalence established. Pregnancy was a binary state, in which two souls temporarily shared the same blood supply. The question of who had it first was neither here nor there and a fertilised egg was a grown adult, temporarily inconvenienced by being a few hundred cells large.\n\nIn 2016, there were 63,897 live births in Ireland. The medical estimate, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is that up to a quarter of pregnancies end in miscarriage, which means that around 20,000 conceptions could have failed in Ireland last year due to natural causes. If all life is sacred, then all life did not get the memo.\n\nThe pro-life view is taken more from theology than biology. Its supporters in Ireland did not foresee, or did not care about, the medical consequences of their unnatural view - the decisions gone wrong, the danger to the life of the impregnated woman, such as the case of Savita Halappanavar who died of septic shock in a Galway hospital, when a miscarriage could not be treated until the foetal heartbeat stopped.\n\nThey did not care about the psychological consequences, and the cruelty of that indifference was hard, as a society, to live with. Arguments about suicide (how to believe her?), about rape (how to believe her?) reinforced the fact that \"a mother\" could not be in charge of herself, because she had no self in the way we usually understand the word - this was set aside, for the duration. Once impregnated, a woman was reduced to a body, and that body was no longer hers. On the one side we have miracle, on the other, meat.\n\nIn March 2014, a refugee Ms Y arrived in Ireland and discovered that she was pregnant as the result of multiple rapes in her country of origin. She had no passport or papers and was turned back at a British port, when she tried to travel there for a termination. Back in Ireland and suicidal, she was told she could be detained under mental health legislation, and she agreed to stay in a maternity hospital instead. There, she went on hunger strike, until delivered by caesarean at 30 weeks. In the years since 1983 we have learned that there is no answer to the question: \"How much suffering is too much suffering?\" The question is irrelevant because the psychology of the mother is irrelevant, as are social or practical concerns.\n\nUnlike Ms Y, most women are not confined to Ireland and many make the decision to travel to Britain to avail themselves of abortion services there. This is not so much an Irish solution (pretend it isn't happening) as a middle class one. It depends on people having literacy skills, credit cards, supportive parents if needs be, an amount of spare cash. It is not a solution for people in denial about what has happened to them - the woman who doesn't want it to be true; the couple who took a chance; the woman who has other issues, who has enough going on, who is depressed, or poor, who has three children already and no time. The girl impregnated by her stepfather, or her uncle, or her father, or by any man who has power over her, or over the people who might help her. The woman unsure of her visa. The woman who is alone, or feels herself to be suddenly and overwhelmingly alone, just now.\n\nConservative figures from the charity Rape Crisis reveal that 3,265 Irish women went to Britain to procure abortions in 2016. This was down more than 50% from a high of 6,673 in 2001. The biggest shift happened among women in their 20s (those born after the referendum of 1983), with numbers declining more than 60%, from 4,089 to 1,563. Figures may be disputed in this fiercely debated topic, but there is no doubting a significant reduction over the same years in which the general population rose by nearly 25%. A more open and secular society has not resulted in more abortion, but less.\n\n¶\n\nPro-life campaigners don't seem to trust people much, though in my experience people do the best they can. They talk as though floodgates were about to burst open, as though women are naturally opposed to the rights of \"the unborn\". But having children is a complicated business, it is not a war. Many children are conceived by accident, or in a state of doubt, and their mothers bring them - half in dread, half in hope - into the world. Other babies are born after long months of their mother's anguish and incomprehension that her body should be so used - and after her body, her life.\n\nThe referendum on abortion was held in 1983, when contraception was also illegal in Ireland. Can you imagine how freaked out that made everyone I grew up with about sex? Do it once, and everything changes. Perhaps this informs the way pro-lifers think about mothers in general, perhaps even their own - that she is always trapped; that we must be saved from her rage, her sense of life's unfairness, her murderous intent.\n\nThere is an overlap of nine months, when the smaller life depends on the bigger, and not the other way around. This is just true. If a foetus dies, the body surrounding it does not die, or not usually. The mother's life is the more powerful thing. This is very frightening, when you think about it. So, yes, women are very frightening, despite their almost universal willingness to please people, to smile and be nice.\n\nThe pro-life movement controlled the terms of the debate in Ireland, so it remained a religious discussion in which all conceptions are fully realised, as opposed to potential, human beings. This is something you either believe or you don't, but it is difficult to get outside their language, which has the weight of culture behind it. So I want to suggest two small shifts in the words we use. The first is to replace the word \"pregnant\" with \"impregnated\", to restore a sense of causality to a condition that is sometimes seen as self-enclosed. The other is to swap out the phrase \"unwanted pregnancy\" with its echoes of unwanted gifts, or what used to be called \"unwanted advances\" or \"attentions\" (now called harassment), and to use the more radical \"pregnancy without consent\".\n\nSex without consent is a terrible thing, we are all agreed on that. We understand the horror of rape - to have someone inside you for 30 seconds, or 10 minutes, to enter your body without your joyful invitation, this is known to be a terrible violation, a trauma from which it is hard to heal. We see the power dynamic here. We imagine, or remember, the pain inflicted and the pleasure taken, and we condemn the act absolutely. But this sense of drama - of a battle of wills - is also a distraction from an ethical argument that might be made about your body: who gets to use it, and on what terms.\n\nIf a conceived embryo is already, and instantly, a full human being, this raises questions about what human beings can do to each other, and why. This is not the way I usually think - my thoughts about abortion are always uncertain and, I hope, slow to judge - but if you want an absolute argument about all this, then here it is. What right does another human being have to be inside your body for the best part of a year, to make their way out of your private parts in a bloody, difficult and painful way, and then turn to you for nourishment, not to mention love - perhaps for the rest of your life?\n\nIn the nine months occupation that is a pregnancy, the embryo has no agency, it doesn't mean to be there, and no intention to cause harm. But an absence of intention does not confer any rights. Just because someone does not mean to use you does not give them the right to use you. The fact that an embryo can not ask for consent does not mean that consent must be given. An embryo takes no pleasure from its presence in your body, but this does not give it ownership of your body any more than a grown man has ownership over your body's interior. The hidden fact in the eighth amendment is that the term \"unborn\" does not mean \"human being\" as the mother is a human being - if it did then the mother's rights might also be asserted. The \"unborn\" here is code for \"biology\", \"happenstance\" or \"life itself\".\n\nIt may be argued that when a woman consents to unprotected sex she is also consenting to carry any resulting pregnancy to term, but I do not know if you can make an agreement with someone who does not yet exist. The hidden power, in this contract-with-no-one, lies not with the physically powerless embryo, or the legally powerless pregnant woman, it lies with the father, or with the father-as-state, who asserts control, from a sometimes indifferent distance, over both.\n\nThis argument may sound slightly absurd, not to mention harsh, but it is exactly as harsh and as absurd as the eighth amendment to the Irish constitution, which is widely understood without making any sense.\n\nIn 2016, people in Britain and the US voted for the tribal and the symbolic when they went for Brexit and for Trump. We know something about all this in Ireland because we had a tribal, symbolic vote in 1983. We saw the cruelty of that symbolic choice play out in our hospitals, and airports, and in our lives for more than 30 years. We know how debilitating it is to argue with the religious right and how wounding it is to face down their trolls.\n\nIf we, in Ireland, can repeal the eighth amendment, that shift will echo around the world. It will be heard in El Salvador, where women have been imprisoned for the natural loss of their babies, it will be heard in those Australian states where abortion is both available and illegal at the same time, it will be heard in Poland where 30,000 people marched against the further restriction of abortion laws, and won. It will be heard in the US, where state by state the rights conferred by Roe v Wade are being whittled away to the especial detriment of poor women; women who own little or nothing, not even the body in which they walk around.\n\nThe message it will send is not just about women's right to choose, it is about how countries work. Democracies must also be allowed to change.\n\n* Repeal the 8th, edited by Una Mullally, is published by Unbound.",

                "body": "Our columnist was able to conquer most of the Roman diet but stopped short at the dormice\n\nJulius Caesar conquered much of Europe and Asia Minor, and brought Egypt into the sphere of Roman influence for the first time to boot. He invaded Britain and installed a puppet regime, but opted not to press ahead with his campaign because he disliked the weather. But there was one thing he couldn't conquer: the Roman Senate, who murdered him rather than allow him to end the Republic and install himself as emperor.\n\nThis week, I experienced something similar. I conquered Caesar's breakfast. I conquered his main course. I even conquered his dessert. But I couldn't conquer his hors d'oeuvre.\n\nFor breakfast, I made a wheat pancake. Wheat pancakes are one of the innumerably grim ways that Europeans tried to get enough carbs in their diet before Marco Polo supposedly brought pasta back from China, and if you ever want to feel a surge of gratitude towards Polo, I recommend eating one. It's easy enough to make: just remove almost everything that's worthwhile from a pancake and substitute wheat and water. (The Romans managed to conquer the half of the world without potatoes in it, more's the pity.)\n\nDinner was easier: roast boar with olives and dried fruit. Pudding was a doddle, too: the Romans made ice-cream by making their slaves collect vast quantities of ice and snow, storing them underground (the ice, not the slaves) and using these stores as walk-in freezers. I followed the more ethical course of buying an ice-cream maker and chucking the bowl in the freezer for a bit. I pair a simple vanilla ice-cream with a traditional Roman honey cake: eggs, honey and flour beaten together, slapped into a cake tin.\n\nBut what I couldn't do was kick off my meals like Caesar: with a starter of edible dormouse. Not because they are endangered - actually, the humble Glis glis is considered a pest - but because no butcher would sell me one and I wasn't sure I could buy one from a local pet store and kill it without ending up on the RSPCA watchlist.\n\nStill, I think I've found a new world to conquer: the edible dormouse is well-placed to become next year's hot food trend, and I'm sure there are plenty of local authorities or businesses who would pay you to dispose of theirs relatively humanely. A pop-up restaurant in which you are paid to source the meat: who needs an empire when you've got that?",

                "body": "Nothing damages a sporting institution quite so much as a name change but annuals were dying off long before the internet\n\nThere is a new theory, probably devised by researchers at one of the newer universities, that you can tell the approximate age of British sports followers by how they refer to what began as the Football League Cup, a competition that has gone under 10 different names in the past 38 years.\n\nSome of us resolve the problem by referring to it hardly at all. But if it's anything, it has to be the League Cup. And in refusing to mention the sponsor du jour, I would say we are doing football a favour. Nothing damages a sporting institution quite so much as a name change.\n\nThis week it was announced that the 48-year-old Sky Sports Football Yearbook would cease publication unless a new sugar daddy can be found. If the name means nothing that is probably because it is still known to most of us as Rothmans, a name that disappeared when tobacco advertising was banned in 2003.\n\nWe could pause here for a joke about Rothmans themselves being killers, though I prefer to think that the book was really named after Benny Rothman, the once-reviled-now-revered old leftie who led the mass trespass in the Peak District (and was duly jailed) in 1932 to open up the grouse moors to ramblers.\n\nOf course the internet has played a part; it does that. It certainly helped do for David Wallechinsky's quadrennial Olympic history, last published in 2012, which was reaching a size so massive it could have been used in the weightlifting. But sports annuals were dying off long before the net took hold. It was guiltless in the loss of Rothmans' oval-balled brothers covering rugby union (1972-2000) and rugby league (1981-98) and has a cast-iron alibi for the failure of John Wisden's Rugby Football Almanack (1923-25).\n\nStats books don't generally get reviewed or passed from hand to hand or picked up by book groups. The rugby Wisden's cricketing big brother (1864 to date) made itself talked about by adding trenchant and independent comment when Victoria still reigned. This was hardly an option for anything under the aegis of Sky Sports, an organisation that dislikes its commentators even calling a game dull and is so dominant in English football that an article on virtually any aspect of the game - except maybe Whither the Offside Law? - would run up against its commercial interests.\n\nThough it could not save Wisden's long-ago dip into rugby, the distinctiveness of the name, known to people who know nothing else about cricket, has been a major factor in the almanack's success. It wouldn't have lasted long, as the Australian Murray Hedgcock once wrote, \"if the founder had been John Smith, Jones or Robinson\" (Rothman might have been OK.) Nor if his successors had kept rebranding it as Capital One or Carabao.\n\nThis has resonance far beyond publishing. How are Arsenal supporters going to describe their match-day destination once the oil money runs out? The stadium has only ever had a sponsor's name. This problem regularly arises whenever the vagaries of capitalism dictate the end of longstanding sponsorships so successful that they have been inextricably linked with an event.\n\nGillette made itself synonymous with one-day cricket in the early days of the genre. Then the company did some research and decided consumers were starting to associate it with cricket rather than razor blades. After 18 wildly successful Lord's finals it pulled out in 1980. I don't think it is a coincidence that the much-loved county knock-out tournament thereafter began a slow but inexorable decline.\n\nTwo of jump racing's biggest events used to be the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury and the Whitbread Gold Cup at Sandown. No one can remember which bookmaker sponsors either event now and both occasions have lost a fair chunk of their resonance.\n\nOne might also argue that tennis's Miss Chris Evert damaged her brand by spreading confusion and changing her playing name to Mrs Lloyd. However, one can also see that now-fading custom in a more romantic light as a sign of devotion and commitment. Or one might do if the marriage had lasted. Or indeed her next two.\n\nOne of the problems with Rothmans/Sky was that the book became hobbled by changes in the game itself. The beauty of the old positional charts, showing who played where on the field in each club lineup from game to game, was ruined by tactical fluidity, mass substitutions and, above all, squad numbering.\n\nThere was also a lovely column listing each club's managers since recorded time began. A single column can now do no justice to, for instance, Notts County's 71 changes (I think). They almost need a book of their own. And the editors never quite found a satisfactory way of dealing with the wholesale promotion that came after the founding of the Premier League in 1992 whereby the Fourth Division instantly became the Third. Then it was all changed again with the invention of the Championship.\n\nThis was in line with the era's general obsession with title-inflation whereby club secretaries, town clerks and the like all became chief executives and editors became editors-in-chief etc. But in football it is a confusion and irritation that still bedevils any discussion of a club's history. Or any reading of Rothmans.\n\nOne fears more such books will be casualties, even without name changes. Ruff's Guide to the Turf (founded 1842) seems to have followed the sport's traditions and been shot silently behind a screen. And tThe well-established Playfair Cricket Annual and the Cricketers' Who's Who must be on the threatened species' list. But there is one remarkable survivor.\n\nThe Athletic News Football Annual was founded in 1887 and lasted 59 years. It morphed into the Empire News and Sunday Chronicle annual and then the News of the World and then the Nationwide. And it still stands. Use it or lose it. Memo to publishers: try not to change the name again.",

                "title": "Black Panther's legacy: will the record breaker finally smash Hollywood bias?",
                "body": "Black Panther is on track to become the highest grossing superhero movie of all time, which could help make the film a game-changer for black cinema and diversity behind the camera for years to come.\n\nWhether Hollywood executives will treat the global sensation as a turning point for the industry, however, remains to be seen.\n\nRyan Coogler's smash Marvel film, which has continued to break records since its February release, has powerfully exposed the lie of the stubborn Hollywood myth that \"black films don't travel\", with its massive success in Asia and markets across the globe. It has earned more than $1.2bn worldwide, and domestically in North America, the film with a nearly all-black cast is expected to soon surpass the The Avengers to become the biggest-ever superhero film.\n\n\"Normally, what Hollywood does when something is successful is they try to copy it,\" said Darnell Hunt, a sociology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and co-author of an annual report on diversity in Hollywood. \"I would hope that this movie becomes a milestone in the industry's thinking about what's viable both domestically and internationally.\"\n\nThe film has proven once again that not only do diverse audiences want diverse stories, but that movies and television shows that feature people of color often perform better across all racial groups than predominantly white stories. But despite overwhelming evidence - including the recent success of Get Out, Hidden Figures and Girls Trip - some critics remain skeptical that Black Panther will yield the long overdue shift of studios truly supporting diversity.\n\n\"We've known for many decades that black-themed films can play a role in resuscitating the film economy,\" said Mia Mask, a Vassar College film professor and expert in African American cinema. In the 1970s, black films played a major role in helping revive studios during a difficult financial period, she said, but added, \"That didn't really change the way Hollywood did business.\"\n\nSome fear that powerful studio executives may be having the cynical reaction that Black Panther's success is due in large part to its ties to a comic book and franchise with worldwide fans and brand recognition.\n\nBut that interpretation seems to ignore the movie's unique appeal, said Mike Sargent, the co-president of the Black Film Critics Circle. It's not another film where actors like Will Smith or Denzel Washington \"happen to be black\", he said, but it rather embraces black identity with its setting in the fictional African kingdom of Wakanda, which has not been colonized.\n\n\"What makes it so groundbreaking is that you have characters ... who are proud of their heritage. The story itself deals with the history of people of color on this planet,\" he said. \"The reason it's a cultural phenomenon is it's fresh, it's new. It's something that nobody has seen.\"\n\nSargent said he was hopeful the movie would break the \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" that black films will fail internationally, and that it would lead to more opportunities for black science fiction and Afrofuturism: \"What Black Panther will do is open the floodgates for all these stories.\"\n\nHe compared it to The Blair Witch Project inspiring films in the \"found footage\" sub-genre: \"Hollywood follows the money.\"\n\nHunt, who has documented the slow progress for representation on screen, noted that the demographics of studios remain \"frozen in time\" and that even if black actors get more and better roles, it's unclear how quickly film-makers of color will get financial support.\n\n\"The executives who make decisions, they don't look like America. They don't look like the global market.\"\n\nHunt's recent analysis of 2016 films found that while black actors occupied 12.5% of roles in top movies, only 8.1% of the writers were people of color.\n\nOn a smaller scale, Black Panther will likely translate to new opportunities for Coogler, co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole, and the film's stars, some of whom were relatively unknown, and those projects could then create more jobs for underrepresented people, Hunt added.\n\n\"You start to dismantle some of the obstacles to making these kinds of films.\"\n\nJeff Bock, the senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations, said Black Panther is now in a special category with a handful of movies that dramatically dominated the industry and popular culture, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, ET, Titanic and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n\nBlack Panther will have a long-term legacy, he added: \"The weird fear that a predominantly African American cast couldn't open a film has just been blasted out of the water, once and for all.\"\n\nIf Coogler's film encourages a boom in black cinema, the projects should extend across genres, said Nicol Turner Lee, a Brookings Institution fellow who has written about the film: \"Black actors have been traditionally assigned roles that are not as representative of the full scope of their talent ... Black Panther showed the fluidity of black actors and what they can do.\"\n\nThe shift toward better representation is not just about a single film, added Mask, citing film-makers like Ava DuVernay. The success of her film A Wrinkle in Time meant this month marked the first time in history that two major-budget films by black directors led the box office.\n\n\"It's that growing critical mass of people who are finally breaking out and breaking through that is more of a game-changer than any one individual film,\" she said.",

                "title": "Formula One: Lewis Hamilton claims pole position for Australian Grand Prix",
                "body": "Hamilton's performance leaves rivals reeling Kimi Raikkonen to be in second place on the grid\n\nLewis Hamilton claimed pole position for the Australian Grand Prix, with a dominant performance in Melbourne that left his rivals reeling as he and Mercedes proved their car is once again ominously strong over the single lap discipline. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was in second place but a full six-tenths back and followed in third by his team-mate Sebastian Vettel.\n\nThe two Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo were in fourth and fifth but very close to the Ferraris. Ricciardo will start from eighth however because he has been given a three place grid penalty after not slowing sufficiently behind red flags during second practice on Friday.\n\n\"I am very, very happy with that lap, it was one of my best,\" Hamilton said.\n\nHaving secured his fourth world championship last season and in doing so taking 11 poles, Hamilton has made the best possible start to the new campaign by putting his Mercedes at the front of the grid for Sunday's race.\n\nHamilton put in the quickest lap on the first hot runs in Q3, proving metronomic at Albert Park. His first run with a time of 1.22.051 was exactly the same time as he had set in Q2. Vettel was three-hundredths back on his first run. Hamilton's second however was simply untouchable, a masterful performance even with Mercedes able to turn up the qualifying mode on the car, he exploited it perfectly. His time of 1.221.164 was an all time lap record but more importantly was six-tenths quicker than Raikkonen in second and had seven-tenths on Vettel in third.\n\nThis, his fifth pole in a row in Australia, makes him the first driver to take the top spot for so many consecutive races at Albert Park and moves his career tally up to 73. It is Hamilton's seventh pole in Melbourne and he has now surpassed his hero Ayrton Senna's record of six poles at the Australian Grand Prix. Senna took all his in Adelaide, while Albert Park has hosted Hamilton's successes.\n\nMercedes are attempting to secure a fifth consecutive drivers' and constructors' championship to match the record set by Ferrari between 2000 and 2004 and with the car looking immensely strong this is exactly the start they would have wanted.\n\nThe final session was red-flagged after Valtteri Bottas clipped the inside of the kerb at turn one and it pushed him wide, he lost his back end and took a major hit into the wall on the outside of turn two. The Finn was unhurt but he was out of qualifying. The team have a lot of work to do on the car and he will start from 10th.\n\nHamilton had topped the time-sheets in Q1, with a 1.22.824, two-tenths up on Raikkonen and ahead of Vettel and Verstappen. But Vettel hit back in the second session with a fine run that was a tenth up on Hamilton.\n\nThe two Red Bulls opted to use the supersoft tyres in Q2, meaning they will be able to start the race on the harder rubber, in contrast to the other teams who all used the softest, ultrasoft rubber in the second session. The Red Bulls will be able to stay out longer in their opening race stint, giving them strategy options on Sunday, with team principal Christian Horner suggesting the race may well require only one pit stop.\n\nHaaas confirmed their pre-season promise with Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean in sixth and seventh while the two Renault's of Nico Hülkenberg and Carlos Sainz were in eighth and ninth.\n\nMcLaren, looking to return to top form now using Renault engines, had a difficult session as Fernando Alonso had warned would be the case in Australia. He went out in 11th place in front of his teammate Stoffel Vandoorne. The two Force India's of Sergio Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon had a slow start to their season, having finished in fourth in the constructors' championship last year, they were knocked out in 13th and 15th respectively, with Williams' Lance Stroll in 14th.\n\nBrendon Hartley in the Toro Rosso, now powered by Honda engines was eliminated in 16th place in Q3 with his teammate Pierre Gasly in 20th. The Williams rookie Sergey Sirotkin in his first F1 qualifying went out in 19th. The Two Saubers also went out in Q3 but Chalres Leclerc impressed on his F1 debut, finishing in 18th just one-tenth down on his far more experienced teammate Marcus Ericsson.",

                "title": "Secret Teacher: we're setting dyslexic children up to feel like failures",
                "body": "It is Monday morning and our year 3 literacy lesson is under way. The child I'm funded to work with is using an iPad while they have a break, watching a show aimed at helping children with additional needs develop communication skills. I walk around the classroom supporting others. We're looking at using adjectives in Roman myths. Jenny asks how to spell \"tiny\"; Kearon needs the spelling for \"flaming\" at the same moment Behnam wants \"sanctimonious\".\n\nJohn is struggling more than the others. Even if I write the word for him he rarely copies it correctly and his letters are back to front, upside down, and sometimes more a squiggle than anything else. Out of the corner of my eye I see him drawing a cartoon on the side of his page. I ask him to start writing. He strings a few words together, and then goes back to drawing. I don't have any more time to support him because my 1:1 is ready to begin work.\n\nI have some first-hand experience of the struggles my class are facing. I was never diagnosed with dyslexia - there were no assessments for it when I was at school - but I feel I have some of the characteristics. The noise of the classroom interferes with my ability to hear sounds in words. I regularly need to use a spell checker, and feel lucky that the schools in which I have worked have been happy for me to do so.\n\nBut I believe the current system is failing dyslexic pupils. Research suggests dyslexic children are more likely to suffer low self-esteem, poor motivation and concentration. Our local council's dyslexia guidance stresses the importance of early recognition and intervention, and there are a number of ways teaching can be adapted to help meet students' needs - simplifying written instructions, presenting only a small amount of writing to them, or using audio devices. Yet shortage of time, staff and technical equipment means it's very hard to give such targeted assistance.\n\nI've seen huge delays in assessments to determine what support a child might need - right across special educational needs (SEN) in the schools I work with. This is particularly the case for specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia that may not be deemed severe or urgent.\n\nI write endless lists of observations about children struggling with a range of issues, including spelling. Meetings are set with teachers or senior management for those with education, health and care plans (EHCPs), but there are many children without plans who also need help. Funding attached to the EHCP buys in people like me to work with specific students, but the others seem to slip through the cracks. Although we do our best to support all children, it is ad hoc and chaotic. I see them falling behind in their learning as a result.\n\nThe leadership teams at the schools I work with are aware of the problem but are working under the same constraints as the rest of us. There simply isn't time, with the staff we have, to embark on interventions.\n\nIn a 2016 National Education Union survey of ALT members working in state-funded schools in England, 83% reported that children with special educational needs were not getting enough support. One teacher said: \"It's frustrating and heartbreaking to see the amount of children not getting adequate support, let alone the in-depth support they need, due to lack of money, and the system's reticence to actually put a child on the SEN register.\" From what I can see, the situation has not improved.\n\nSats also present a challenge. There is no specific support for dyslexics in these tests, although it is possible to apply for extra time for any child as long as there is supporting evidence. At two of the schools in which I've worked, children can use spell checkers or dictionaries during the essay-writing component, but the work has to be edited independently by the child. Those who can't spot misspelt or wayward words will still be at a disadvantage.\n\nPreviously, teachers and union leaders have raised concerns over the impact of \"draconion\" spelling tests on dyslexic children. Changes made this year allowing teachers to judge overall aptitude rather than expecting children to meet every criteria should help those who struggle with spelling. According to Sarah Hannafin, senior policy adviser for NAHT, dyslexic children should be \"less disadvantaged... than they were in previous years\". But judging pupils on such narrow measures doesn't give us a rounded picture of ability or intelligence.\n\nIf I took the Sats test today, I doubt I would pass it. I moved through school at a time when spelling and grammar were important but not essential. I was given the support I needed to grow. This gave me space to develop my creative writing without worrying about perfect spelling. I gained the confidence in myself as a learner - starting out in the remedial maths and English set at school and ending up with a PhD in health education.\n\nThe picture is very different for the children I teach. As a result of too little targeted support and stringent tests, I worry many will enter secondary school believing themselves to be failures. But I don't feel I'm in a position to give these children the level of help they need or deserve.\n\nFollow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach, like us on Facebook, and join the Guardian Teacher Network the latest articles direct to your inbox\n\nLooking for a teaching job?

                "title": "The Long Take by Robin Robertson review - a melancholy love song to America",
                "body": "Modelled on Hollywood's postwar glory years, this masterful epic follows a second world war veteran across the US, and shows Robertson at the peak of his powers\n\nIn one of his more pontifical essays, TS Eliot declared that a poet could not be considered great unless he - he, necessarily - had produced an epic. The pronouncement takes for granted that there is general agreement on what constitutes an epic. But is there? Homer's Iliad, Virgil's Aeneid, Dante's Divine Comedy, certainly; but what about, say, Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock, Louis MacNeice's Autumn Journal, Basil Bunting's Briggflatts, or even Philip Larkin's The Whitsun Weddings? An epic does not have to be of epic proportions, nor does it need to take the lofty classical tone; it can be humble, like us, composed, as WH Auden has it, of Eros and of dust.\n\nIn The Long Take, which has an epical feel, Robin Robertson, one of the finest lyric poets of our time, deploys his artistic reach in a fiction narrative of more than 200 pages, composed in a mixture of verse and prose. It is a beautiful, vigorous and achingly melancholy hymn to the common man that is as unexpected as it is daring. Here we have a poet at the peak of his symphonic powers taking a great risk, and succeeding gloriously.\n\nRobertson sings of arms and the man, though his model is not Virgil but the movies, and in particular the black-and-white (or soot-and-silver) masterpieces produced by Hollywood in, roughly, the latter half of the 1940s and first half of the 50s, such as Out of the Past, Kiss Me Deadly and The Big Combo. As Walter Friedländer, who was an émigré professor at Berkeley, California, and makes a brief appearance, gleefully observes of these films, \"At last! / German Expressionism meets the American Dream!\"\n\nRobertson's protagonist, Walker, is an emblematic figure, one of the walking wounded who survived D-Day and the invasion of Europe and returned home to find themselves outcasts in a world busy again with its perennial pursuit of money and power, and impatient of yesterday's superfluous heroes. A Nova Scotian, Walker remembers home with hallucinatory clarity - \"The frozen harbor like a terrible accident: as if some ballroom's chandeliers had fallen, leaving smashed shards of inch-thick ice\" - but knows he cannot go back there, not after the things he has seen, the things he has done.\n\nHe is, in his way, as much a casualty of war as the friends and foes who died in the slaughterhouse that was the coast of Normandy in the summer of 1944. Robertson, who must have given years to researching his material, writes of war with appalling immediacy, surveying the carnage with a calmly Homeric eye. His battle scenes are composed not of titanic struggles but, much more tellingly, of fleeting, unforgettable glimpses, lit as by the light of shellbursts: \"Naked soldiers dead on the beach, clothes blown off by an anti-tank mine. I was staring at their crew-cuts washed flat by each wave, then the hairs springing back up.\"\n\nWalker's postwar odyssey takes him first to New York, which yields a magnificent opening flourish to the book:\n\nAnd there it was: the swell\n\nand glitter of it like a standing wave -\n\nthe fabled, smoking ruin, the new towers rising\n\nthrough the blue,\n\nthe ranked array of ivory and gold, the glint,\n\nthe glamour of buried light\n\nas the world turned round it\n\nvery slowly\n\nthis autumn morning, all amazed.\n\nThree cities, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, form the scarred and tattered backdrop of the narrative: \"Cities are a kind of war, he thought: / sometimes very far away then, quickly, very close.\" Walker heads to California as a result of a chance meeting in a New York bar with the film noir director Robert Siodmak. The long train journey west - \"like his life, going by too fast\" - is a tour de force of narrative verse writing; The Long Take, like Nabokov's Lolita, is rapturously in love with America, that great, sad, sprawling, lovely land, in all its aspects, even the cheap and tawdry. Crossing the desert, Walker encounters Palm Springs: \"In this place, the sand-traps are the only things that are real.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, he makes a friend, the fictitious Billy Idaho, a fellow veteran, who \"was black, small and wiry, bright-eyed\", and who will come to a ghastly end; there are acquaintances, too, reporters on the newspaper where he finds a job, writing features about the denizens of Skid Row, many of them soldiers like himself, adrift in a peacetime in which there are \"no jobs for us, the guys who fought, y'know, / fought for freedom\". Down there, in the lower depths, Walker hears the siren call of self-destructive repentance for what he has done in the war, a call that in the end he will have no choice but to heed:\n\n\"I can stop now,\" he said,\n\nputting his mouth to the mouth of the bottle,\n\n\"I'll make my city here.\"\n\nThe Long Take is a masterly work of art, exciting, colourful, fast-paced - the old-time movie reviewer's vocabulary is apt to the case - and almost unbearably moving. Walker is a wonderful invention, a decent man carrying the canker of a past sin for which he cannot forgive himself. What Siodmak says of Walker can also be said of Robertson, that he has \"what we call / deep focus. Long eyes for seeing.\"\n\n* John Banville's latest novel is Mrs Osmond (Viking).

                "body": "Lt-Col Arnaud Beltrame was shot in throat by gunman Redouane Lakdim after exchanging himself for one of the people held in supermarket\n\nThe French gendarme who was shot after he swapped places with a hostage being held by a terrorist gunman has died.\n\nInterior minister Gérard Collomb announced the death of Lt-ColArnaud Beltrame shortly before 6am French time on Saturday.\n\n\"We will never forget his heroism, his bravery, his sacrifice. With a heavy heart, I send the support of the entire country to his family, friends and colleagues of the Gendarmerie of the Aude,\" Collomb tweeted.\n\nShortly afterwards, President Emmanuel Macron issued a statement saying he was \"deeply moved\" to learn of the officer's death from his injuries.\n\nBeltrame was left fighting for his life after he was shot in the throat by Radouane Lakdim at the end of a four-hour supermarket siege in the sleepy town of Trèbes near Carcassonne in southern France on Friday.\n\nThe gendarme had volunteered to take the place of a female hostage being held by Lakdim, who had gunned down a member of staff and a customer at the store, after shouting his allegiance to Islamic State. Earlier, the 25-year-old had hijacked a car, shooting and seriously injuring the driver and killing the passenger, and had shot at a group of CRS playing football.\n\nBeltrame's death bring the total number of those killed to four; fifteen others were injured, at least one critically.\n\n\"In offering himself as a hostage to the terrorist hiding in the supermarket in Trèbes, Lieutenant-Colonel Beltrame saved the life of a civilian hostage, and showed exceptional courage and self-sacrifice,\" Macron wrote.\n\nHe said the hero officer had shown \"exceptional sang froid\" and demonstrated the finest \"military virtues\" that merited the \"respect and admiration of the entire nation\".\n\nBeltrame, 44, of the Aude Gendarmerie, originated from Brittany, in western France, and had a distinguished career earning distinctions, commendations and military honours at every step.\n\nHe graduated from France's elite military college Saint-Cyr in 1999 with special praise for his \"resolutely offensive spirit when faced with adversity\". His superior officers noted that he was prepared to \"fight to the end and never give up\".\n\nFrom Saint-Cyr, Beltrame underwent training for the gendarmerie, including for the special intervention unit the elite GIGN (Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), whose missions include counter-terrorism and hostage rescue.\n\nHe earned the military cross in 2007 following a two year posting to Iraq, and later spent four years as part of the Garde Républicaine protecting the Elysée Palace before becoming a special advisor to the secretary general of France's ecology ministry. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 2016.\n\n\"Lieutenant-colonel Arnaud Beltrame died serving the country to which he had already given so much. In giving his life to bring to an end the murderous actions of a jihadist terrorist, he has fallen a hero,\" Macron added.\n\nAfter offering himself for the hostage swap on Friday, Beltrame left his mobile telephone line open, enabling police and special forces outside the supermarket to hear what was going on. When they heard a shot, they stormed the store, killing Lakdim, and finding the Lt-Col gravely injured.\n\nBeltrame was flown to hospital by helicopter where he died of his injuries early on Saturday morning.",

The car was under recall for problems with the gear shifter.\n\nTerms of the settlement, which was filed in Los Angeles superior court, have not been disclosed.\n\nYelchin was remembered in February during the In Memoriam section of the 2017 Oscars.\n\nThe film world was shocked when it was announced that Yelchin had died following the freak accident at home involving his car.\n\nBorn in Russia in 1989, Yelchin was brought to the US as a baby after his champion ice-skater parents were classed as refugees by the State Department. He began acting professionally aged 9, and appeared in TV shows such as Curb Your Enthusiasm and Criminal Minds, as well as films such as Alpha Dog and Fierce People.\n\nHowever, it was being cast as Pavel Chekov, navigator of the USS Enterprise in the 2009 Star Trek film, directed by JJ Abrams, that brought his name to a wide international audience. His immediate likability in the role saw his career expand rapidly: he starred alongside Felicity Jones in Like Crazy, the Sundance award-winning romance directed by Drake Doremus, and with Patrick Stewart in Green Room, the punk-club horror film directed by Jeremy Saulnier.\n\nYelchin also reprised his Chekov role in subsequent Star Trek films - Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek Beyond - the latter of which was released shortly after his death.\n\nWith Reuters",

                "body": "Just being more precise about your occupation on a form could save you £700 a year\n\nMiles Brignall\n\nNext time your car insurance renewal comes through, don't fall into the trap of describing yourself as unemployed if, for example, you are retired, a student or a housewife/house husband. If you do, you could end up paying 50% more.\n\nThat was the warning this week from an insurance comparison website, which ran a series of quotes where the only adjustment was the recorded occupation.\n\nMoneySuperMarket says students and retired people who mistakenly describe themselves as \"unemployed\" have the most to lose - potentially up to £700 a year in the worst cases. Retirees who do the same may have to cough up an additional 37% , it found.\n\nIt's the same for stay-at-home parents: if ticking \"unemployed\" instead of \"housewife\" or \"home keeper\" option, applicants could see their costs rise by 26%. If you are retired, but put yourself down on your renewal as a housewife/home keeper, this may well add 6%. And calling yourself a \"student\" rather than an \"apprentice\" could save 13%, or £181. In each case, all other factors were the same.\n\nKevin Pratt, consumer affairs expert at MoneySuperMarket, says: \"To get the best cover, at the best price, you have to choose the most accurate answer at every stage. That can mean trying alternatives to find the one that best matches your situation, instead of plumping for whatever seems most obvious. It's worth taking your time.\"\n\n* Car insurance premiums are set to fall by £35 a year after the government announced measures to curb the high number of whiplash claims.\n\nThis week, the justice secretary, David Gauke, unveiled plans to introduce the Civil Liability Bill through the House of Lords, which will set out changes to the way these claims are calculated and paid.\n\nThe bill aims to set fixed amounts of compensation and halt the practice of settling whiplash claims without medical evidence, he says.",

                "title": "Alarm bells ring as ADT charges £513 for a nine-minute visit",
                "body": "Quoted call-out fee more than doubled after engineer replaced £20 battery\n\nMiles Brignall\n\nSecurity company ADT billed a couple for £513 for an engineer's visit that lasted just nine minutes.\n\nThe Conways, who live in Newcastle and have had their burglar alarm for 20 years, had, until recently, paid ADT a regular fee to monitor their system.\n\nThey were sent the extraordinary bill after an engineer replaced their alarm's back-up battery. These can be bought online for less than £20.\n\nFrancis Conway, who - ironically - is an electrical quantity surveyor who deals with electrical contractors all day, originally assumed there had been a mistake when he looked at the invoice. The figure was more than two and a half times the £200 call-out fee they were quoted.\n\nBut he says that when he questioned the bill, pointing out they had been loyal customers for over a decade, he could not believe it when the company confirmed that the sum was correct, even though the invoice clearly states that the engineer had only been in their house for nine minutes.\n\nThe case would appear to set a new record at Guardian Money as the worst case of apparent overcharging reported by a reader.\n\nBut it's also not the first time a customer has complained that they felt ADT had charged over the odds. Money's Consumer Champions have received a number of complaints about the high call-out charges, not helped by the fact that there appears to be no tariff of call-out charges published on the ADT website.\n\n\"I work in the industry, so I understand that they have to reflect the cost of getting to and from a property, and the cost of any parts.\n\n\"But a bill of over £500 for nine minutes' work - it's just ridiculous. Had ADT sent a bill of £250 or so, I would have paid it without any fuss, but there was no way I was going to pay that,\" says Conway.\n\nHe adds: \"I wrote to them pointing that we were longstanding customers who'd paid for a service agreement over the years, and inviting them to change it to something more reasonable, at which point I would pay it.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it when they wrote back saying that, having reviewed the bill, it was correct. What planet are these people on?\"\n\nAfter Money raised the case with the company, ADT was swiftly on the phone. It has now reduced the charge to the originally quoted £200. The firm has given them the battery, for which it normally charges £67, free, as a \"gesture of goodwill\".\n\nIt says a one-off error occurred when they called to book the engineer, which resulted in them being quoted an incorrect price. \"This is being investigated, but unfortunately was not identified when the customer initially reached out to us. We have now rectified this,\" it says.\n\nHowever, a look at ADT's Trustpilot reviews page, which is littered with unhappy customers, suggests these kinds of bills may not be uncommon.\n\nTwo weeks ago, an ADT customer, calling themselves Nina21, wrote: \"A recent invoice for the installation of one additional wireless movement detector, for which the engineer was on site for 36 minutes, amounted to £448.43, equivalent to about £780 per hour.\n\n\"After 20 years with this company, we are considering changing.\"",

                "title": "'Britain seems broken now': the Brexit refugees leaving for a new life in Europe",
                "body": "The EU referendum result spurred a life-changing move to a better standard of living for these couples and families\n\nAn increasing number of Brits disappointed and angry about the referendum result are opting to start a new life in Europe before the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. They include Vishal Vora, who has quit London for Berlin and says \"Britain really seems broken now\", and Liz and Gary Trow, who have relocated to France, saying that their daughter is enjoying a more multicultural environment.\n\nSome of the escapees have been setting up their own businesses, while others have managed to secure equivalent or even better jobs. And some have used this as a chance to make a career switch. And, rather than isolating themselves in the traditional expat enclaves, many are keen to embrace the local communities in their host countries.\n\nIn the week it was announced that the UK and EU have reached an agreement on a Brexit transition deal, Guardian Money spoke to three families who have upped sticks about how difficult it was to make the move and how they are coping.\n\n'For an academic Britain is finished'\n\nVishal Vora is happy to describe himself as a Brexit refugee. The 37-year-old says that \"for an academic, Britain is finished\" so, following the June 2016 vote, he and his family decided to emigrate.\n\nHe is a legal academic and his wife, Abbie, is a magazine journalist. They have three children: Ramona, five, Grayson, two, and baby Margot, who is two months old.\n\nVora got a research fellowship in Germany and the family moved to Berlin last autumn. They have swapped their former home in Stoke Newington, north London - where they were \"living like Victorians, four of us in a tiny one-bedroom flat ... many people wondered how we managed\" - for a beautiful and spacious \"altbau\" (old-build) flat in the centre of the German capital.\n\nHe adds: \"My salary is €51,000 (£44,500). We rent a 122 sq metre three-bedroom flat in the city centre with tenure for life, and the €1,835 (£1,600) a month rent includes heating, water and housekeeping. The only extra is electricity, which is around €50 (£44) a month. By contrast, my monthly mortgage payments on my 27 sq metre flat in London are £1,000.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the couple's children are in free full-time kindergarten, which Vora says would have cost £1,800 a month in London. They have traded a car for a family cargo bike. Vora works outside Berlin and pays €400 (£350) a month on train fares. The family reckon food is pricier in Berlin but of better quality.\n\nVora says: \"I don't think it would be fair to blame Brexit entirely for our decision to leave the UK, though it played a big part. The problems in this country stem from what happened in Thatcher's reign: selling housing stock and not replacing it and privatising public services.\n\n\"The UK has been neglected for decades and it shows: public transport is a joke, the NHS is falling to pieces, the education system is broken. I wanted to give my children the best start in life and I wanted the basic stuff - housing, education and healthcare - to be sorted. I feel in a country like Germany, this stuff - basic human rights, perhaps, in the western world - is sorted and doesn't cause me sleepless nights.\"\n\nAs a consequence, the difference between their lives in London and Berlin \"is as clear as night and day. Although we rent here, this isn't seen as a failure: 83% of the population rents with secure tenure. It's a contract for life, should we choose to stay here.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Full-time childcare is free and medical care is superb - my wife gave birth to our third child here eight weeks ago. She was able to stay in hospital for four days, we never felt pressured to go home and they provided everything for the baby. We had two other children in London at a top teaching hospital, and the difference was huge. My wife was basically asked to leave within 12 hours of giving birth.\"\n\nVora is a research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, which is funding his post-doctoral research into the role of legal identity among British Hindus, while Abbie gave up her permanent job in the UK to allow him to take this position. \"She will begin freelancing in the next 12 months or so, but at the moment is enjoying being a full-time mother of three,\" he says.\n\n\"I visit London often for work and it will always be home, but with great regret, until the basic stuff is sorted - which won't happen in my lifetime - I don't see myself moving back. I value quality of life far too much to ask my family to put up with all of the above just to live in London. Things are going to get worse for the UK before they begin to get better.\"\n\n'I had no connection here any more'\n\nLiz, 35, and Gary Trow, 40, made the decision to start a new life in France with their daughter, Lara, 12, soon after the referendum.\n\nUncomfortable with the result, the couple felt they were in a minority in the Dorset coastal town of Poole, where there was a higher-than-average vote in favour of leaving the EU (58.2% versus 51.9% for the UK as a whole).\n\n\"I'm worried it makes the UK seem unwelcoming to people from other countries,\" says Liz. \"As an accountant I can see this affecting the stability of small businesses who rely on a continuous supply of European employees.\n\n\"With my grandad passing away, I felt I had no real connection or need to be here any more. No one was depending on us - it just felt like this is the time to do it.\"\n\nThe couple sold their house in Poole and bought a farmhouse and gite in the Loire valley, leaving the UK in March 2017. They relaunched Les Vigeants as a triathlon holiday centre and hosted their first guests last May.\n\nHaving come from an area where the majority of the population are white British (88%, according to 2011 census data for Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch), the couple are happy that their daughter is growing up in a more multicultural environment. \"The children round here are fluent in English and they are fluent in French, and have Dutch friends as well,\" she says. \"That's such a wonderful way to bring a child up - it's so different to what we were doing in the UK.\"\n\n'A kneejerk reaction after the vote'\n\nTerence Sheehan, 51, and his partner Emma Holmes, 44, both from marketing backgrounds, have been taking Spanish evening classes to demonstrate their commitment to their new homeland since moving to Alicante in Spain, from Chiswick, west London, in June 2017.\n\n\"It's respectful to learn Spanish and be seen to be at least attempt to pick up the language as quickly as you can,\" says Sheehan.\n\n\"We are here not to just kind of mix with the expat community - we're here to mix with the Spanish community as well.\"\n\nHe adds that rather than deter them, the Brexit vote acted as a catalyst for the couple to follow through with plans to move to Spain.\n\n\"It made us determined to make that move and to make sure everything worked out for us, which it has. It was almost a kneejerk reaction when we heard the result - just to get on with it and do our best. I still can't believe the way the vote panned out. I'm a European first and foremost.\"\n\nSheehan says the property management company that they have set up, Holmes & Co, started \"almost by accident\" after a contact of a neighbour in Alicante asked for his help to market a holiday villa. \"One property led to another, and we now look after about 10,\" he says.\n\nSheehan says expats are locked in a guessing game over the Brexit negotiations.\n\n\"People are concerned about the impact on their lives and how it will affect them in terms of healthcare, the exchange rate - will they get the same value for their money? Is the pound going to weaken?\"\n\nHe adds that there is also growing unease among retirees over whether UK pensions are going to be affected.\n\n\"Also, when we leave the EU, expats are thinking about applying for Spanish citizenship because that will allow them to have the same benefits,\" he says.\n\n\"April 2019's going to be interesting. But I can't see too much happening in terms of there being a dramatic change for everyone - there's just too much to lose for the Spanish and for the British government.\"\n\n'We lost £50,000 overnight'\n\nAlan Barber couldn't believe the referendum result. \"I'm still not sure Brexit will happen. To me it made no sense at all,\" he says.\n\nBarber, 61, and his wife, Julia, 57, arranged the completion of their house sale for the day after the vote. They had planned to transfer the proceeds into euros to fund their new life in Castelo Branco, Portugal. But after the vote, the pound fell to its lowest level in 31 years.\n\n\"We lost £50,000 overnight,\" Barber says. \"When we went to bed, the pound was quite high because everyone forecast that we were staying in, and when we woke up it had gone through the floor.\"\n\nEven worse, a week later and the day before they were to fly out to Portugal, the owner of the house the couple were buying found out they were from the UK and put the price up beyond their means.\n\n\"So that house fell through and we said to the agent in Portugal: 'We're leaving, we're on our way, you need to find us something.' So he found us two schist stone houses, which are in a stunning location - better than the first one.\"\n\nWith the loss on the exchange rate and higher than anticipated costs on the replacement property, the couple converted their new home into a bed and breakfast.\n\nIn a nod to their Gaelic roots, Barber called the B&B Casa Tus Nua, which means \"the house of new beginnings\" in Irish. \"But in Portuguese it's the 'house of the naked women', so all the neighbours thought we were opening a brothel,\" Barber says. Recently the couple expanded the business by buying the nearby Vale Mourão restaurant.\n\nDespite the initial upheaval, Barber likens their arrival in Portugal to \"the steam rising off a wet jacket in a warm room - you can almost see the stress leaving you when you get here\".",

                "body": "Form of credit has been identified as the unhealthiest for mental well-being by a public health group\n\nVicky Shaw\n\nPayday loans have been identified in a new report as the \"unhealthiest\" form of credit, with unauthorised overdrafts coming second.\n\nMore than 500 borrowers were asked about the impact that different forms of credit had on them to compile the findings.\n\nThe report, from health education charity the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) ranked payday loans as having the most negative impact on mental well-being, followed by unauthorised overdrafts, doorstep loans and weekly payment stores.\n\nThe research was welcomed by Michael Sheen, who this week revealed he has decided to scale back his acting career to devote himself to campaigning against high-interest credit providers such as Wonga and BrightHouse, and working to find fairer alternative sources of credit.\n\nSheen, probably best known for playing Tony Blair in several films, has launched the End High Cost Credit Alliance, a campaign group of politicians, charities and tech firms that will work to promote more affordable ways of borrowing.\n\nHe says: \"We share a moral responsibility to help protect vulnerable customers from the harm high-cost credit causes. The evidence on the impact on our health and well-being is now overwhelming. We have the evidence. Now we need action.\"\n\nFor each form of credit that someone said they had used in the past two years, those surveyed were asked how trying to keep up with repayments made them feel - for example, angry, depressed, anxious, ashamed or guilty.\n\nNearly half (49%) of credit users who drink alcohol said they drink more as a result of their debt, rising to three in five (62%) among payday loan users.\n\nThe report found catalogue credit came out with better scores than some more mainstream forms of credit.\n\nIt said catalogue credit can become part of people's weekly budgets and the products involved - clothes and consumer goods - may make people feel good, even if only for a short time.\n\nCredit unions came out very positively in the report. These are not-for-profit co-operatives owned and controlled by their members.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been investigating the high-cost credit sector, and in recent years has capped the overall cost of a payday loan.\n\nTrade body UK Finance, which represents banks and other financial firms, points out that an unauthorised overdraft is not something which is marketed to people, and tends to happen when someone has miscalculated their finances.\n\nMeanwhile, banks point out that they send text alerts to help people avoid slipping into the red.",

                "title": "10 of the best hacks for happy camping",
                "body": "A campfire feast and a warm, comfy tent are among the many joys of a night in the great outdoors. Ten seasoned campers offer their best tips\n\nTake a compass\n\nWhen arriving at your campsite determine the direction of east and pitch the tent's main door facing that way. When the sun rises, it will warm the tent from the front all the way through as you wake up. It's much nicer to poke your head out of the door first thing in the morning to be greeted by the sun on your face than to begin the day on the shaded side.\n\nSimon McGrath, author of Camping with Kids\n\nCampfire fish supper\n\nRather than using foil to cook fish over a fire, soak a few sheets of newspaper in water, wrap up the fish and tie at both ends, then lay the parcel on the fire. It takes a bit longer but the fish comes out steamed and you can burn the paper afterwards. Leave no trace.\n\nAndy Pietrasik, Guardian Travel\n\nBag of tricks\n\nYou can't always light a fire, but it's nice to have natural flame. Take some tea lights and place them in white paper bags (the sort you get from bakeries) with some sand or stones in the bottom to weigh them down. Arrange a circle of them around the camp to shine their light and create a cosy atmosphere.\n\nDaniel Start, Wild Guides author\n\nDig a tandoor oven\n\nThis is fairly labour intensive (commandeer the kids) but digging a tandoor-style oven is a camping showstopper. Dig a pit around 40cm deep, line it with foil and push tent pegs into the pit wall 15 to 20cm from the top to support a grill. Marinate diced chicken or lamb (salmon also works and requires less cooking time) in spices, yoghurt and lime juice for several hours. Get a big fire going nearby and add some rocks, as they retain heat. When the embers are glowing, shovel them and the hot rocks into the pit, place the rack of meat on the pegs and cover the pit, ideally with a board or metal sheet, to seal the heat in - this is crucial. Check the meat after 15 minutes, and gauge how much longer it needs to cook for.\n\nGavin McOwan, Guardian Travel\n\nTuna for tea\n\nI'm all about minimalist, lightweight camping, which is quite extreme but works for me. A firelighter in a used tuna tin is a great way to heat water for a cup of tea (in a tin cup, obviously). Put holes in the bottom of the tuna tin to give the lighter air to breathe.\n\nSean Conway, endurance adventurer\n\nFeel the heat\n\nI take one of the smooth, rounded rocks that I've surrounded my campfire with and wrap it in my woolly hat. Great for tucking inside my jacket while sitting outside on a cold night, or warming up my sleeping bag.\n\nKimberley Grant, author of Wild Guide Scotland\n\nIt's in the bag\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that the lighter and more slimline I can make my rucksack or panniers, the more I'm going to enjoy a camping trip. To this end I've developed a fondness for carrying aluminium foil Ziplock pouches. I use them for storing food - they stand up by themselves once there's something in them, so they're easy to eat out of too - as dry bags for clothes, and as a pee bottle (marked very clearly). Not only are they featherweight, incredibly cheap (from about 30p) and as slim as paper when not in use, they mean I can dispense with bowl, plastic boxes, conventional dry bags and, err, a pee bottle.\n\nDixe Wills, author of Tiny Campsites\n\nHot water bottle\n\nI take a one-litre Sigg aluminium water bottle, fill it with boiling water before I go to bed, wrap it in my fleece or a sock and use it as a hot water bottle to warm my sleeping bag - it's perfect for drinking first thing too.\n\nPhoebe Smith, author of Extreme Sleeps: Adventures of a Wild Camper\n\nLight diffuser\n\nShine your headtorch through a clear water bottle to make a much nicer, diffused tent light.\n\nAlastair Humphreys, adventurer & author\n\nFire starter\n\nRemove the lint from the filter of your tumble dryer and take it with you. A bundle of super-dried cotton and synthetics, it will ignite from sparks instantly and makes an ideal fire starter.\n\nJames Warner Smith, author and editor, Cool Camping",

Serre-Ponçon lake is a short walk away, for swimming or fishing, and nearby Boscodon forest has a host of hiking trails. At the campsite, there's a volleyball court, kids' play area and botanical garden home to nine species of butterfly. By night, the stargazing is superb.\n\n* Pitch for two from €13, campeole.com\n\nLe Chant-hibou, Auvergne, France\n\nSetting Countryside\n\nPitches 20\n\nActivities Swimming, stories, animals\n\nThis small yet spacious site on a modest farm not only has a petting zoo, where children can cuddle up to the animals - in summer there are daily activities such as helping collect eggs, making cookies, face painting, riding tractors and storytelling around a campfire. The site is flat, with a pool (plus toddlers' pool) in the middle, so little ones can run free while parents keep an eye on them.\n\n* Pitch from €8, plus €5 per adult, lechanthibou.com\n\nCamping La Pointe, Brittany, France\n\nSetting Woodland\n\nPitches 60\n\nActivities Fishing, wildlife\n\nPitch up on one of the spacious spots on the banks of the Aulne, where the owners allow you to fish for salmon in the stream. They also deliver patisserie each morning to your tent, and encourage you to sit with a glass of wine and watch the wildlife (red deer, squirrels, woodpeckers, tawny owls). But make time to explore the rest of the Crozon peninsula too.\n\n* Pitch for two from €15.50, lapointesuperbecamping.com\n\nD'Olde Kamp, Ansen, Netherlands\n\nSetting Woodland\n\nPitches 40\n\nActivities Den building, feeding animals\n\nThis woodland site has a choice of open field camping or more private pitches, and finishing touches such as coffee on tap, warm bread to order, fire pits, an outdoor pizza oven and free wifi. It offers all the benefits of a countryside location without the feeling of roughing it. Goats, donkeys, chickens and rabbits are your neighbours - kids can help feed them with the farmer and get a \"farming diploma\".\n\n* Pitch for two from €19, plaggenhut.nl\n\nLandgoed de Barendonk, Beers, Netherlands\n\nSetting Woodland\n\nPitches 30\n\nActivities Cycling, hiking, geocaching\n\nDon't be fooled by the name of the village: this campsite is distinctly family friendly. On the Barendonk estate (complete with historic Flemish homes and barns), this dairy farm is a patchwork of green fields surrounded by a moat. Though there are spaces for campers and caravans, there is an area exclusively for tents. There's also a bad-weather sitting room where you can dry clothes, eat, sit and plan your next day's cycle (available to hire on site), stroll or geocache challenge (rentable GPS treasure hunt available).\n\n* Pitch for two from €13.20, barendonk.nl\n\nCamping de la Cascade, Coo, Belgium\n\nSetting Riverside\n\nPitches 40\n\nActivities Trail running, cycling, canoeing\n\nThis small campsite sits on the Amblève river in the Ardennes, a region of forests and rolling hills. Here campers can fish, swim, walk, bike and stroll through a little-visited landscape, while cars are kept at a distance (no vehicles stay on pitches once unloaded). Nearby, in the village of Coo, are tumbling cascades that look like something out of a fairytale. And to round things off nicely is the famous Belgian beer - there are 15 to choose from in the on-site bar.\n\n* From €9.75 per pitch plus €2.80 per adult, camping-coo.be\n\nZur Mühle, Black Forest, Germany\n\nSetting Woodland\n\nPitches 30\n\nActivities Hiking, cycling\n\nNot to be confused with a site of the same name over in Bavaria, Zur Mühle offers stepped pitches with hillside views between shady trees. The emphasis is on relaxation - this is a peaceful site - no clubhouses or play areas. There is a stream for paddling, and guided walks and cycle routes for the more energetic. With fresh bread available to order and some groceries on site, this is the perfect place to simply pitch up and do nothing at all.\n\n* Pitch from €4, plus €4.90 per adult, camping-kirnbach.de\n\nCamping Mexico, Bregenz, Austria\n\nSetting Lakeside\n\nPitches 40\n\nActivities Cycling, hiking, swimming\n\nThere aren't many campsites where you can look into two other countries from the door of your tent, but Camping Mexico is not like other campsites. Near the shore of Lake Constance - a huge, shining body of water that borders Austria, Germany and Switzerland, it offers the chance to wild swim after a day's walking or sightseeing. And there is much to see. An easy-to-follow cycle route runs alongside the site and as far around the lake as you care to venture. Then, when you've had enough, jump on one of the regular trains back.\n\n* Pitch from €7, plus €9.50 per adult, camping-mexico.at\n\nCamping Lindenhof, Bern, Switzerland\n\nSetting Lakeside\n\nPitches 50\n\nActivities Cycling, swimming\n\nLindenhof lies amid the vine-covered slopes of Seeland, a stone's throw from Lake Biel, with views stretching to the Jura hills opposite. Cycle alongside rivers, hike to nearby Creux du Van (the Swiss Grand Canyon) or walk through the vines. The site itself is proudly ecological, heating the accompanying farm with solar energy and wood from its own forest, while the apples and cherries grown in the orchard are sold on site.\n\n* Pitch from €10.25, plus €7.70 per adult, camping-lindenhof.ch\n\nCamping Val d'Or, Enscherange, Luxembourg\n\nSetting Countryside\n\nPitches 76\n\nActivities Paddling, cycling, Nordic walking\n\nThink camping and the tiny Grand Duchy of Luxembourg doesn't often leap to mind. But its relative anonymity means it's not teeming with tourists. Set on a blissful bend of the babbling Clerve river, Val d'Or offers sociable pitches for those with kids and more private places with high hedges across a footbridge. Speaking of little ones, it has three playgrounds, one of which is water themed. There are mountain bikes for hire, two nature walks starting right from the site, a bar and free wifi.\n\n* Pitch for two from €19, valdor.lu\n\nCamping Carso, Trieste, Italy\n\nSetting Woodland\n\nPitches 20\n\nActivities Fruit picking, rock climbing\n\nRun by the same family since 1932, this working organic fruit and veg farm is a mix of field and woodland, where campers can pick their own produce, or buy supplies, regional wines and local honey from the onsite shop. The green credentials don't end there: the owners are also keen to do their bit, insisting on saving water and minimising waste. For a true eco-break, the train stops a couple of kilometres away at Sistiana.\n\n* Pitch for two from €10.50, campingcarso.com\n\nCamping Camino de Santiago, Burgos, Spain\n\nSetting Countryside\n\nPitches 40\n\nActivities Birding, cycling, pilgrim-watching\n\nIt may be named after the (at least) 500-mile pilgrim path to Santiago de Compestela in Galicia, north-west Spain, but blisters, backpacks and offerings to St James are not requirements for a stay here. In fact, the focus is very much on taking it easy. From an on-site restaurant to fresh-baked goods delivered daily, the owners do what they can to make staying in one place heavenly. There's occasional guided birdwatching (the area is home to 361 species), pilgrims to spot, and pitches are divided by hedges for privacy.\n\n* Pitch from €4.50, plus €5 per adult, campingcamino.com\n\nCampsite Port Massaluca, Catalonia, Spain\n\nSetting Riverside\n\nPitches 10\n\nActivities Fishing, kayaking, birdwatching\n\nGriffon vulture, alpine swift, peregrine falcon ... If you're already reaching for the binoculars, this Catalonian campsite, around 200km west of Barcelona, will not disappoint. At the confluence of the Matarraña and Ebro rivers, below the dramatic, sandy-coloured cliffs, all these birds can be spied nesting in the rocks above the campsite. If you're more excited by zander, carp, bass, perch and catfish, then you'll be in your element too, as it's also the perfect site to fish - though there is competition from the local kingfishers, herons, cormorants and grebes, naturally.\n\n* From €9.30, camping-portmassaluca.es\n\nQuinta dos Moinhos, Braga, Portugal\n\nSetting Mountains\n\nPitches 6\n\nActivities Exploring, cycling\n\nIt may only have six pitches but there's plenty on offer at this site in northern Portugal: table tennis, boules, and mountain bike and kayak hire. The nearby village of Vila Nune is worth a meander - especially on Mondays, when the market is on - and slightly further away is Serra de Cabreira, which has hiking trails by the herd-load. Nearby are Alvão natural park and Peneda-Gerês national park.\n\n* Pitch from €8.50, plus €4.75 per adult, quinta-dos-moinhos.com\n\nCampsite Nature Ferie, Hals, Denmark\n\nSetting Beach\n\nPitches 28\n\nActivities Cycling, canoeing, swimming\n\nIf you thought private beaches were the preserve of five-star hotel guests, think again. Because for €10 a night campers have access to an exclusive stretch of coast near the northern tip of Denmark and ride complimentary bikes (or their own) on a number of cycle trails - try the North Sea Cycle route to, or the national number 5, which takes in the entire eastern seaboard.\n\n* From €10 per adult, en.natuurvakantiedenemarken.nl\n\nFyrvapplingen Fiskecamp, Uppsala, Sweden\n\nSetting Lakeside\n\nPitches 30\n\nActivities Foraging, cycling, swimming\n\nA 1½-hour drive north of Stockholm is this spacious campsite, with several cycle routes just a turn of the spokes away. While its lakeside location means it's perfect for swimming and fishing too, its emphasis is on getting close to nature. Surrounded by woodland - where you can forage for food - each pitch offers space and tranquillity, and there's a communal barbecue.\n\n* Pitch from €9, fyrvapplingen.se\n\nCamp Vala, Mokalo, Croatia\n\nSetting Beach\n\nPitches 15\n\nActivities Swimming\n\nNear the island of Korčula (said to be the birthplace of Marco Polo), this small coastal campsite combines sea, mountains and woodland. With pine and olive trees spread over its pitches, shade is assured in the midday heat. It's also within walking distance of a shingle beach where bathers can look out for rays, crabs, sea urchins and starfish. There's an onsite pizza place and a beach bar, both with reasonable prices.\n\n* From €6 plus €6.50 per adult, vala-matkovic.com\n\nCamp Liza, Bovec, Slovenia\n\nSetting Riverside\n\nPitches 80\n\nActivities Canyoning, biking, rafting\n\nThe problem with many otherwise idyllic campsites can be the huge campervans that park alongside your modest tent. At Kamp Liza campervans and caravans are allowed, but there is a special zone where no vehicles are permitted, only tents - and that's right by the edge of the Koritnica river. From the site there is much to do: walk a section of the Alpe Adria trail, cycle, e-bike or mountain bike in the valleys and hills beyond, or sign up for some rafting, kayaking or canyoning.\n\n* From €9.50 per adult, camp-liza.com\n\nCamp 9 Nature Campground, Silesia, Poland\n\nSetting Riverside\n\nPitches 15\n\nActivities Exploring, cycling\n\nClose to the city of Tarnowskie Góry, the appeal of this small campground is not only the stillness and silence that the streamside pitches offer, but its proximity to several other countries - it's near the border of Slovakia (with its Tatra Mountains to explore), the Czech Republic and little-explored western Ukraine. For war buffs there are bunker tours nearby; for the sporty there are cycle routes right from your tent porch, and for those who want to do nothing at all, you couldn't choose a better spot.\n\n* From £3 per pitch plus £4 per adult, camp9.x-active.com\n\nTartaruga Camping, Zakynthos, Greece\n\nSetting Beach\n\nPitches 150\n\nActivities Turtle watching, snorkelling\n\nThe setting is dreamy: a campsite perched on the terraces among a grove of 700 olive trees, with views of the Bay of Laganas right from your tent flap. You can snorkel with the loggerhead turtles who visit the adjacent beach, eat in the small, onsite restaurant where the owner has sourced the ingredients that day from local fishermen, and fall asleep to the sound of cicadas. Pinch yourself... this place is real.\n\n* Pitch from €3.40, plus €5 per adult, tartaruga-camping.com",

My greatest concern is for young people who face a bleaker future with student debt and housing costs, and a third of my net income - £8,000 a year - goes to support my two eldest grandchildren through university. My son-in-law keeps a spreadsheet to ensure that all five grandchildren benefit equally over the years. A friend, when they heard of this, commented on all those students who don't have wealthy relatives to help them, and I was struck because I don't think of myself as wealthy, though I suppose I have more than many. I see it as \"comfortably off\".\n\nFor 20-odd years I was a chemistry teacher in secondary schools, then in the early 1990s there was a policy of replacing older teachers with cheaper younger ones, and I was given early retirement at 53. My teaching and state pensions total £24,700 before tax, and I earn £5,800 a year gross from a small business I run. I was approached in the 1990s by the local authority and invited to help maintain school swimming pools. When that ended, I set up my own company and spend around 25 hours a month doing the same maintenance work.\n\nMy other income is £1,500 from the solar panels I installed on my roof seven years ago. It cost me £11,000, before the feed-in tariffs were cut, so they have more or less paid for themselves. I am signed up to the Green party and grow my own fruit and veg, and have cut electricity bills to about £800 a year.\n\nMy wife died eight years ago, and two years ago I married someone I met online through Saga Connections. She has her own pension, plus rental income from the house she lived in before she moved in with me, and we split the household bills but keep our finances separate.\n\nI am very anti \"stuff\" and hate shopping. I don't buy clothes - my best suit is 30 years old - and my car is eight years old, and I'll keep it until it gives up on me. I have a £50 mobile, but don't spend more than £5 a year on pay-as-you-go calls. I prefer to spend on experiences. My wife and I eat out once a week and share a bottle of wine every night. We spend around £600 on wine a year and about the same on meals out at the pub. When at home we eat simply: porridge, soup, a cooked meal in the evening and a lot of fruit.\n\nI'm a member of a golf club which costs me a grand a year on fees, equipment and competitions, and I belong to a leisure centre, but as it's a local authority one, it costs about £200 a year for swimming, gym and tennis. My wife likes dancing, so we go twice a week to ballroom and sequence dance sessions, which totals £400 a year. I exercise every day and I'm fit for my age. Recently, I set myself a \"Mile at 80\" swimming challenge and raised £1,000 for the local hospice. I give around £600 a year to that and other charities.\n\nOur extravagance is holidays. We go whenever we like and had seven last year, which was a bit ridiculous. We loved Cuba so much we returned this year at a cost of £1,500 each, but usually we stay with friends when we travel. Luckily for us, we have friends and family in Greece, Spain, France and the Scottish islands.\n\nAs told to Anna Tims",

                "body": "Rare and diverse paintings and drawings reveal visual talents of celebrated Oxford author\n\nThree previously unpublished artworks by JRR Tolkien are to be displayed for the first time as part of a major exhibition coming to the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries this summer.\n\nThe three pieces will be among rare paintings and drawings by the author of the fantasy masterpiece The Lord of the Rings, reflecting the fact that his literary genius extended to his visual imagination.\n\nThe unpublished material was released to the Guardian by the Bodleian in advance of Tolkien Reading Day on Sunday, held on 25 March each year, organised by the Tolkien Society.\n\nThe artworks include a Japanese-style delicate drawing of bamboo from the 1960s. Its title Linquë súrissë is in Quenya, one of the highly developed Elvish languages that Tolkien created. It translates as \"grass in the wind\".\n\nThere is also a black-and-white 1950s abstract bearing Elvish lettering that may have been a book cover design, and an abstract painting from 1914 from his years as an undergraduate at Exeter College, Oxford.\n\nCatherine McIlwaine, the Bodleian's Tolkien archivist, said of the three artworks: \"They don't relate to his fantasy works directly, but two of them have the Elvish text on them, which links them directly to his writings on Middle-earth, the imagined world where The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit were set.\"\n\nShe described the image as \"very intriguing\". \"It looks to me like a book cover design ... Whether he was thinking of creating a new work or whether this was an artefact from Middle-earth, I just don't know. There's nothing else like it, and there's no indication of what it might refer to or what he was thinking. That's [one] for future scholars.\"\n\nTolkien, who taught Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University, designed it on the back of an agenda for a Merton College meeting dated 26 November 1957, two years before his retirement. The success of The Lord of the Rings had exceeded all expectations and he spent his retirement in Oxford re-working The Silmarillion, his earliest work on the legends of the elves.\n\nAs the exhibition will reflect, Tolkien was an accomplished artist, with hobbits, elves and wizards sparking his imagination in words and pictures. Among other illustrations for The Hobbit, he designed the cover for the first edition of 1937, showing stylised mountain peaks, through which hobbit Bilbo Baggins travels on his adventures.\n\nMcIlwaine said the three unpublished artworks were all quite different. \"You wouldn't look at them and think 'that's Tolkien', as you might with his watercolours. They show that he was always experimenting with his artwork. He wasn't afraid to try totally new styles.\"\n\nThe Bodleian Libraries boast the world's largest collection of original Tolkien material, and the exhibition will be further boosted by important loans, including manuscripts of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Anticipating huge interest in the forthcoming exhibition, the Bodleian is using a ticketing system for the first time.\n\nTolkien had sold the illustrations for £1,500 to Marquette University in Milwaukee as he approached retirement, and began to worry about his pension.\n\nMcIlwaine said: \"For the first time, we're going to have some of those manuscript drafts ... together with our amazing collection ... It's really exciting.\"\n\nThe exhibition, titled Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth, runs from 1 June until 28 October.",

                "body": "You can have a racing fit, or a comfort fit, or anything in between (though I sense that 'comfort' is a bit looked down on)\n\nI needed a bike fit. That's what I learned the last time I went for a ride with Belinda, the woman made of iron filings from the Bella Velo cycling club. I had such a suite of learnings from that day - about my fitness, backbone, endurance, valour and preparedness - that this didn't seem like the most important, even though when Belinda said it, all her cycling friends nodded sagely, and one added, \"You do look like you're at a funny angle.\"\n\nIt's gait analysis - you get on a treadmill and someone critiques your tread - only for bikes. Matt Wallace, at Richmond Cycles, hitched my bike up to a machine at the back so I could pedal without moving, and observed these various angles. Certain things he could tell before I even got on, such as that I had flat tyres and my drop handlebars were pointing downwards. I had a spill a while back and just bent them back into serviceable shape, so I've been cycling with my head pointed at the pavement for about three months. We (OK, he) fixed that. He did some old-fashioned tape measurements, and then another one with a laser, which establishes how far the end of the saddle is from the bottom bracket, and therefore where your centre of gravity is. You can have a racing fit, or a comfort fit, or anything in between, though I sense from the off that \"comfort\" is a bit looked down upon.\n\n\"I won't get you sitting up like you're on a town bike,\" Matt said.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" I replied. \"I don't want to look like Miss Marple.\" (Though I do a lot more civic detective work than I do racing if, by \"racing\", we mean \"going faster than anyone else\".)\n\nMatt asked if I'd made any adjustments, which of course I hadn't. Then I remembered that I gave the bike to my uncle when I was pregnant 10 years ago, and he probably spent the entire time I was gestating a human tinkering with it.\n\n\"Is he taller than you?\" Matt said.\n\n\"God knows. He's 82. He's never the same height twice and he keeps replacing his knees.\"\n\n\"He must have a longer reach.\"\n\nMy saddle was too low, so I wasn't getting a full range of movement from my leg. Matt raised that a full three-and-a-half centimetres, which makes it a bit of a white-knuckle ride getting on the bloody thing, but I will admit makes me faster.\n\nMy bars were too far forward, too, so I was having to reach too far, which Matt could tell from an arched back. So he brought the saddle forward and replaced the stem at the front with a shorter one. That made a difference of four centimetres, which is, improbably, all the difference in the world.\n\nThe whole frame is probably a bit too big for me - 56cm - but you can work with a bike that's one size out if you make the right adjustments. My posture is livelier and more aggressive. Zero effort, this cost me, and I'm significantly faster. It's a fitness miracle.\n\nWhat I learned this week\n\nIf your seat moves forward, it has to go up as well to keep the same extension in your leg. Because, if you imagine a big circle, from seat to chain to bars, you have to be at the same point of the circle. Galileo, innit.\n\nZoe wears top from My Gym Wardrobe.

                "title": "Dinner party soundtracker to timeless muse: exploring the Sade complex",
                "body": "Picture the scene: A dinner party. It could be any dinner party, anywhere in North America or Europe, taking place at any point in the last 30 years, but this one happens to be a fictional dinner party thrown by Nathan (James Tupper) and Bonnie Carlson (Zoë Kravitz) in Big Little Lies, the hit TV series about miserable rich people living in coastal California.\n\n\"I love this music. Bonnie, is this Adele?\" asks Reese Witherspoon's character, Madeline, ever-so-slightly loose from the half a Xanax she popped en route.\n\n\"No, it's Sade, actually,\" responds Bonnie.\n\n\"We should get this, honey,\" Madeline says to her husband, Ed, played by Adam Scott.\n\n\"Oh, we have it,\" he replies, bemused.\n\nThe joke is how much all mums love Adele. The joke is that Madeline is trying so hard to appear hip in front of her ex-husband's younger, yoga-toned new wife. The joke is how serenely impervious Bonnie is to any back-handed compliment. The mystery is how, in a career spanning over 30 years, Sade has come to simultaneously symbolise both the dinner party-throwing pretensions of the contemptibly bourgeois and the casually classic style to which we should all aspire.\n\nThis spring, Helen Folasade \"Sade\" Adu, the half-British, half-Nigerian 59-year-old, is making another of her many comebacks with Flower of the Universe, her first new song for seven years, recorded for the soundtrack of the much-anticipated Disney movie A Wrinkle in Time. Announcing the coup, director Ava DuVernay wrote on Twitter: \"I never thought she'd say yes, but asked anyway. She was kind + giving. A goddess ... it's a dream come true.\"\n\nAfter breaking through in 1984 with first album Diamond Life, followed by another three LPs, Sade and her band (also known as Sade) took an eight-year break before returning to the limelight with Lovers Rock in 2000. There was another 10-year break before 2010's Soldier of Love; in between, the singer granted very few interviews, all of which contributed to the image of a very private star who doesn't \"do\" publicity. Fans were left to construct their own fantasy versions of Sade, based only on the music itself, plus a look described by Sade's official website as \"unspecifically exotic and effortlessly sophisticated\".\n\nThis much is consistent whichever side of the Atlantic you find yourself on, but in many other respects there has been a disjuncture between how Sade is seen and received in her homeland versus her reputation abroad. The band's 2000 album Lovers Rock, for instance, peaked at No 18 in the UK charts, but went triple platinum in the US. When, in 2012, Sade outsold even Adele to become the highest-ranking Brit on a list of Billboard's most profitable artists of the year, the UK press was full of baffled and dismissive references to \"elevator music\" and \"heritage acts\". Elsewhere, her reputation has only grown, aided by an army of high-profile fans including Pink and MNEK (who've both covered No Ordinary Love), Nicki Minaj (who explicitly channelled Sade's image on a recent cover shoot for New York Times Style magazine), Jessie Ware, Corinne Bailey Rae, Moses Sumney, Tinashe, Miguel (who designed a line of T-shirts with her face on them) and Jay-Z (who guested on her Moon and the Sky remix). Last summer Drake unveiled a second tattoo of her face on his lower torso.\n\nAccording to Albert Watson, the noted portrait photographer and a longtime personal friend of Sade, the singer has some theories of her own on this disparity: \"I said, 'What is it with the British?' And she said, 'They're tremendously supportive if you're up and coming - nowadays, anyway - but, if you're successful, they're not so crazy about you.'\"\n\nIt also seems that, in the UK, the smooth, soulful \"sophisti-pop\" sound of Sade's music has become unshakeably associated with a particular brand of middle-class smugness with which Sade herself had little experience. Indeed, in a 1985 interview with Spin magazine, she described herself as \"fairly classless, because it's very difficult to class someone who comes from a mixed marriage. There isn't a class structure in Nigeria [where Sade lived until the age of 11], there's a tribal structure and prestige as far as money is concerned.\"\n\nAfter her parents' separation Sade lived with her mother, a nurse, and older brother in Holland-on-Sea, Essex, before moving to London in the late 70s to study fashion design at Central Saint Martins. She supplemented her income selling clothes on a stall in Camden Market, and it was here, legend has it, that she was first approached about singing in a band. \"She said, 'Well, I don't sing at all,'\" recalls Watson, and they said, basically, 'You must be able to - you're black.' Once she got going, there was a tremendous commitment, but I often wonder - if those guys hadn't come up to her, she might have ended up being a fashion designer or something.\"\n\nInstead, Sade's musical instinct was honed in the racially diverse London club scene of the 80s, as her boyfriend from the time, the former style journalist and current BBC Radio London presenter Robert Elms, remembers. \"She was exotic in that she was always kind of preternaturally elegant,\" he says, \"but I don't think the race thing was a big factor, I honestly don't. It was a big factor in the eyes of middle-class rock writers who weren't used to coming from council estates where half the kids had some sort of mixed-race background. It was a factor to the NME.\" Elms also suggests that prevalent press attitudes to black musicians may have contributed to the ongoing undervaluing of Sade's legacy in Britain. \"The media in particular loves its black people to be tortured. Now, Sade is not tortured, and she will not do tortured for public consumption. She ain't Billie Holiday, she sure as hell ain't hip-hop ... Sade is undeniably black; she's African, but she's also from Essex, and they've never liked that either, really. But she's as much working-class white girl as she is African princess.\"\n\nIn terms of not only nationality, then, but race and class too, a certain ambiguity seems to underpin the story of Sade's huge, long-lasting, yet remarkably unshowy success. \"Sade is one of the few people I've ever met who was born minimalist,\" notes Elms. \"Boy George you noticed, because he was flamboyant and extravagant. [With] Sade, it's the exact opposite.\" It's this classic, understated quality that has both defined Sade's own creative expression and made her an ideal model-muse for others. She became a regular cover star of The Face magazine in the mid-80s, and today her largely unchanged image - gold hoop earrings, red lipstick, all-seeing eyes - remains an apparently endless source of inspiration to young artists. London-based illustrator Ted Pearce, AKA Ted's Draws, has sold out of a line of Sade T-shirts and posters, while murals of her face by street artist Dirt Cobain have been spotted all over LA and New York.\n\nIt would be a mistake, however, to assume that this muse-like quality makes her less of a creative force in her own right; she is both muse and musician. Always has been, says Watson, who shot the iconic cover for Love Deluxe as well as several of Sade's music videos, and counts her among the most collaborative of the many stars he's worked with. \"I mean, gigantically involved,\" he recalls. \"I mean, in every little detail, y'know? She's a real perfectionist and a professional. I remember doing the first video with her, and when she came to the editing booth she had every single shot she wanted and every number of every shot ... It was almost as if she created Sade and built that image around herself, but she's actually not like the image.\"\n\nThe people who know her best often speak about this contrast between the mysterious, sexy image and the down-to-earth, funny, loyal woman they know. It's also a contrast that amuses Sade herself, Watson says. \"I photograph people like Jay-Z, P Diddy, 50 Cent and they all love her! They always ask about her and say, 'You worked with her, how is she?' They were being real men, asking how sexy was she and so on. She'd have fallen down laughing if she'd heard that! And I told her. I said, 'All these rappers are interested in you!' She just said, 'That's nice.'\"",

Even when this attitude makes me angry, it seems positive. Not a day goes by when they don't tell me, more or less subtly, that I belong to the past. Not a day goes by when they don't point out that what I say is banal and out of touch with the present, which is their area of expertise. Not a day goes by when they don't find a way to pit their intelligence against mine, and the aim is always the same: to let me know that I should keep quiet. Not to mention that whenever I have trouble with the computer or some other electronic device, they intervene to remind me that I am of the era of the fountain pen and the pay phone.\n\nI look at them and, sometimes with satisfaction, sometimes with alarm, see myself in their bodies, in their tone of voice. Bits of me appear for a few seconds, and I barely have time to recognise them, as when, in a page you've just written, you see flashes of the literary tradition behind you. They naturally don't notice, and that's good. I hope they have as much time as possible to declare themselves miraculously new and set about teaching me a thing or two. I, too, felt different from my mother and pushed out her generation to make room for mine. The cruelty of the latest arrivals, when they feel they're the first to come into the world, is necessary.\n\nI greatly fear the generations who don't proudly leave their parents behind. But I'm also frightened by those who, at 20, leave their parents behind to embrace the mores of grandparents and great-grandparents. I don't understand the young people who would replace the world of today with a golden age when everyone knew their place, that is, in an order based on sexist and racist hierarchies. Sometimes, especially when they declare themselves fascists, they don't even seem like young people, and I tend to treat them even more harshly than the old people who inspired them. Dreaming of a return to the past is a denial of youth, and it grieves me to discover that young women, too, dream those dreams.\n\nI love young people who fight to give their time a new form and demand a better life for the entire human race. I hope my daughters stay that way for a long time. Then - it's in the natural order of things - as they get older they'll find me within themselves, discovering physical details, flashes of personality, thoughts, and will learn to welcome me, make room for me. As happened with my mother and me, they'll discover that, even admitting they're partly me, they'll continue to be themselves. In fact they'll be themselves more fully, with greater autonomy.\n\n* Translated by Ann Goldstein",

You must stop sending me the wrong man this instant. I'm going to be 30, and your game is stale now that we are in the fourth round.\n\nThe first one was bad enough. After I waited and waited for a guy, you finally threw me one when I was 22. Twenty-two! I had my first real, grown-up kiss at 22 - how pathetic is that?\n\nActually, the whole affair was pathetic. He was too busy and preoccupied with money problems to bother making me a Valentine's Day card, let alone planning a Valentine's night out. So I was cheated out of my first real Valentine's Day. I couldn't really introduce him to friends, because I wasn't sure the object of my love life and the mainstays of my social life would get along.\n\nWith the second one, I felt as if you were starting to side with me. It was lit with sparks and laughter. Every moment spent with this one was a fantasy come true. We went to dinners, I even got my very own surprise birthday party, we had fun and were so in love. But apparently I was too mean and free-spirited for his liking. But let's stay friends, he implored, because he will never love anyone else as much as he loved me. I hear his new girl gets a surprise birthday party every year, too.\n\nThe third one I'm not certain could even be called a relationship - it looked like one, but the guy never brought up the topic, so let's call it a quasi-relationship. This one could have worked had he been six years older, not Muslim and financially stable. Living with him was peaceful and pleasant for the most part, but there wasn't enough space to distance ourselves in an apartment meant for one person. And we could never be married or have children, not without the wealth to say, \"Fuck you, world, we don't care what you say about this interfaith union.\"\n\nThat's when I resolved to go for a rich man who was sweet, caring, funny, perhaps a tad too short, but so very intelligent. I knew he was married, but thought he was estranged. He wasn't. He was very happy with his wife, had two beautiful children and lovely Christmas dinners with the entire family.\n\nWhen I said rich, sweet, intelligent and single, I meant put it all into one man. Polygamy is illegal and polyamory is so weird.\n\n* We will pay £25 for every A letter to we publish. Email family@theguardian.com, including your address and phone number.

The story is of a creative spirit finding new impetus in response to both death's approach and the censure of contemporaries and critics. Those who were members of Picasso's private inner circle - gossip about his lifestyle also helped to fire him back up - put the later work forward as some of his frankest, wittiest and most profound.

                "body": "You know those music docs, often found on BBC4 on a Friday night, in which, interspersed with archive footage, you get music journos in front of their record collections showing off how much they know?\n\nWell this HBO four-parter, now streaming on Netflix, ain't like that. Sure, there is archive and there are talking heads. But what talking heads! For starters, the subjects, Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine, take a very active part. They're here, in the flesh and in the foreground. The access isn't bad either - yachts, jets, Bahamas, you got it. Then, on backing, you've got the remaining living members of NWA, Ice Cube, MC Ren and DJ Yella; plus will.i.am, Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith, Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty RIP, Gwen Stefani, Eminem ... the list goes on.\n\nWe begin in 2014, with Dre and Jimmy selling Beats to Apple. Potentially this is the least interesting part - it's just a business deal, albeit a big one ($3bn). But entertainingly, it could have gone wrong, with Dre and his pal Tyrese bragging about it on Facebook. Snoop Dogg acts out how Apple weren't exactly over the moon about that, so it may only be the account of a business deal, but it's the best account of a business deal I ever saw. Allen Hughes, who directed and co-wrote the documentary, even manages to slip in a clip of De Niro in Goodfellas.\n\nFrom there we go back to Jimmy growing up in New York in the 70s, the son of a dockworker, scrapping his way into the music business. And Dre in Compton, LA, in the 80s, with the gangs and the violence, then getting his first mixer and DJing and performing with World Class Wreckin' Cru and then NWA.\n\nThe Defiant Ones is the story of these two characters, on either side of the US and in some ways so completely different, but both super-driven and kind of living the American dream. And drawn inevitably together, like the Titanic and the iceberg, though with a happier outcome. Especially if you like headphones and money.\n\nThey tell it so well. Check out Dr Dre on ego: \"It's almost like a little pilot light, and fame is the gasoline, and once fame gets poured on that ego, you never know if the pilot light is going to go out or it's going to turn into a motherfucking bonfire.\"\n\nAnd it's all so beautifully put together by Hughes, with nice little touches such as when Dre talks about using a crossfader to go from one turntable to the other and the sound also pans across. The Defiant Ones is witty, polished, grand in scale, ambition and budget, while remaining totally engrossing. The other music docs may as well give up now.",

                "title": "Sorry, chaps, but denial won't fix the gender pay gap | Tania Branigan",
                "body": "There are many ways to tackle pay inequality - but trying to explain the problem away is not one of them\n\nKnife-crime injuries are on the rise because people are being stabbed more often. It's not much of an explanation: any police chief would be ridiculed for it. It certainly doesn't justify the rise, or point towards possible solutions. It basically restates the issue in a slightly different way.\n\nYet when it comes to gender pay gaps, exposed by new requirements to publish the difference between average male and female hourly rates, employers are giving us just this kind of response. The reason for the hefty divides, they say, is that senior roles are dominated by men. That does not explain the problem; that is the problem. They are not recruiting or promoting women to top jobs, and in many cases are relying on them to do the lowest-paid work.\n\nIf employers were in genuine ignorance as to how they treated their workers, these figures were an opportunity to educate themselves. Instead, many seem in denial. Several bleat that they pay men and women the same for equivalent work. This has been the law for almost 50 years, though it's still not met in full. It's like expecting praise for paying their tax or filing yearly accounts.\n\nIn fairness, these firms are doing better than most just by revealing their gaps. Organisations with more than 250 employees must publish the information annually - but two-thirds have yet to do so, with the first deadline less than a fortnight away. They include many FTSE 100 companies. Perhaps they don't see it as important. Perhaps they hope their results will go unnoticed among all the last-minute filings. Perhaps they don't plan to file the figures at all.\n\nExecutives are worrying the numbers look bad. I'm afraid it's worse than that, chaps: they are bad. And the attempts to account for them are pretty terrible too. Company statements provide compelling evidence of a new law of physics. Call it Eve's principle: the greater the pay gap, the greater the mental resistance.\n\nSo the British Heart Foundation, which slightly favours women in median terms, sets out a plan to reduce its mean gap of 7.7%. The University of Cambridge, where the median gap is 15% (still below the national average of 18.1%), says it is not closing the divide fast enough and needs to do more.\n\nNow compare with Phase Eight - a womenswear firm, of all things - where the 44 men among its 1,754 employees are so heavily concentrated at the top that the mean gap stands at 64.8%, and median at 54.5%. \"While on first glance our published gender pay gap figures suggest the average man has a higher hourly rate of pay than the average female, this is misleading and does not reflect the true story and culture within the Phase Eight business,\" says the CEO.\n\nThe pay gap figures do not suggest this. They prove it - however many times you look. If that doesn't truly reflect Phase Eight's culture, maybe it should do more to close the divide.\n\nImplicit in explaining away these findings is the idea that this is all society's fault, as if society is not composed of individuals and institutions making choices every day, and as if wild variations across the same sectors are born of the unique, unshiftable requirements of one particular firm. That surely can't explain how easyJet and Tui have median gaps of more than 45%, but British Airways only around 10%.\n\nSocial change will be part of the solution. Supporting fathers better, including through improved paternal leave rights, would allow more women to take a step up in the workplace. But there are plenty of things that companies can do by themselves. And some of them are already doing so. The easyJet and Tui pay gaps exist in large part because almost all their pilots are male. But Tui, where only 5% of pilots are female, makes vague promises of improvements in its statement - while easyJet, which had 4% two years ago, is already on course to a 13% target and aims for 20% by 2020.\n\nSo implement and promote family-friendly policies. Give managers unconscious bias training. (Phase Eight does, at least, do or promise to do both of these.) Recognise that not every job must be done a certain way just because it always has been: the gap across full-time workers is far smaller than when part-time workers are included. Use blind CVs and balance interview panels. Set clear and fair criteria for success. Reach out to diverse candidates - from across ethnic and class backgrounds too - and promote your industry in schools and communities; BA's programmes encourage girls to think about training as a pilot or an engineer. Try \"reverse mentoring\", as Ernst & Young does, with young women helping to shift bosses' attitudes. While you're at it, ask yourself if your top staff should be earning so much and other workers so little. In many cases, the gender pay gap reflects the absurd and unhealthy gulf that has opened up between those at the top and bottom of companies.\n\nNone of these is a solution in itself; all of them would help. They should not be beyond the wit of all these highly paid executives. But if they prove too challenging, let's offer some outside help. That means punishing those who fail to comply, and shaming those with the worst records. The equalities watchdog should publish sectoral and regional breakdowns, and ask the worst offenders for clear, enforceable action plans with numerical targets.\n\nSome bosses hope these figures are the end of the story. The smart ones understand that they should be the start. Enough excuses. Get working on the solutions.\n\n* Tania Branigan is a Guardian leader writer",

                "title": "I was belted at school. It felt unfair, but was it harmful? | Ian Jack",
                "body": "Corporal punishment used to be popular. Now it is argued that the experience condemned pupils to poor health in later life\n\nI imagine he had wanted to be Matisse. Instead, he found himself teaching art to teenage boys in a Scottish provincial town, class after class, day after day, year after year. Life had flashed past. In 1924 he visited the British Empire exhibition at Wembley as an art student, to be thrilled by the new products he found there. Now, 30-odd years later, he stood in his teacher's black gown before form 2F and tried to interest us in this experience: how it was there that he first saw how abstract shapes - a circle, a triangle, a rectangle - could be the basis of a design for a fabric or a poster, such as the one he was asking us to draw for a shipping line. But we had begun to chat among ourselves.\n\n\"The next boy who talks gets the belt,\" he shouted, and a second or two later singled me out as a culprit. It seemed unfair - I hadn't been talking any more than the rest - but I went to the front and stretched out my arms so that they met in front of me, one hand supporting the other. I can't remember how many he gave me - probably three or four rather than six (\"six of the best\" was the phrase) - but he cracked the belt down along the hand, from fingertips to wrist, rather than across it at 90 degrees. He was too furious and out of control to be accurate. The belt's tails reached my lower arm, and by the time I went home two purple stripes had risen on the tender skin. My mother was angry; she even talked briefly of registering a formal complaint. I was glad when the subject was dropped.\n\nBelting was quite usual then. I got it from the deputy head for throwing snowballs in the playground, and from my Latin teacher for making mistakes in my corrections. Belts came in two or three weights and shapes - two-tail, three-tail - and teachers either kept them in handy drawers or looped them over their shoulders and under their gowns as a crafty gunslinger might. \"This is Percy,\" Mr Bachelor, the music teacher, said one day, exhibiting his two-tail model to the class. \"His full name is Percy Cution.\" He did his best to give us a menacing smile and then began to bang out Marie's Wedding on the piano: \"Step we gaily, on we go / Heel for heel and toe for toe\" and so on. We sang vigorously, thrilled by his gothic humour.\n\nIt's difficult now to know what to think of these events: with what degree of distaste (if any) to look back at them; how to fit their memory into a new morality that invites us to redefine previous patterns of behaviour, once thought to be \"normal\", as bullying and abusive. A new book by the always-interesting Scottish writer Carol Craig argues that Scotland's poor health, the worst in western Europe, has its roots in the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences, an American term signifying an upbringing affected by the stresses caused typically by a proximity to drugs, alcohol and violence.\n\n\"As a country, we need to admit that nurturing children has never been one of Scotland's strengths,\" she writes in the introduction to Hiding in Plain Sight. In a piece in this week's Scottish Review, she contends that teachers were encouraged to belt a pupil in front of the class because the Scottish educational system \"was designed to instil fear\". She says that in the course of her research she encountered hardly anyone of our generation (hers and mine) who hadn't been belted, \"many of them multiple times\", for offences as trivial as giggling.\n\nCraig reminds us that the belt was wielded in primary as well as secondary schools, and that girls got belted as well as boys. (I personally have no memory of a girl being belted; to me, it was a gendered punishment.) England was no stranger to corporal punishment in schools either, but Scotland was far more addicted to it - the contrast between the two educational systems grew after English local authorities began to limit the use of the cane in the 1960s. The truth is that the belt was popular in Scotland among parents and teachers, and its banning from state schools in 1987 stemmed from a judgment by the European court of human rights rather than local lobbying. Private schools had to wait until 1998 in England and 2000 in Scotland. Poland had banned it as long ago as 1783, the Netherlands in 1920 and Italy in 1928, but Scotland preserved a reverence for it, perhaps partly because the chosen pain-giver had its own Scottish name, the \"tawse\", a word that, like \"dominie\" and \"lad o' pairts\", appeared frequently in the stern but at one time famously successful story of Scottish education. In 1973, Edinburgh's education committee voted to phase out the belt by 1977, but abandoned the decision after loud opposition from schoolteachers who were zealous of their right to beat children as young as five.\n\nIn 1972, according to logs kept by teachers, the belt was used about 30,000 times on an Edinburgh school population of 80,000, and 494 girls aged between five and 11 were among the 4,201 schoolchildren belted in the spring term of 1973. These statistics come from a piece I wrote at the time. Retrieving one's feelings from that time is a far harder job, but I think they ran along the lines that belting, so far as I could tell, had done me no harm. I had feared a teacher's sarcasm far more. I sympathised with a good friend, a teacher in a rough Glasgow school, who said: \"Basically, it's a matter of convenience ... when you're faced with a class of 40 15-year-old boys who don't want to be there anyway, pelting you with paper balls, the quickest, surest way to get some kind of attention is to belt somebody. Then you can get on with the history of U-boat warfare or why the UN is a good thing.\"\n\nIn the Fife mining town of Lochgelly, saddler John J Dick made the belts known as Lochgelly specials. When I went to see him in 1974, he reported that business was booming, with the home trade supported by exports to particularly Scottish parts of the old empire such as Malawi and New Zealand. Dick had recently discontinued the extra-heavyweight line, but still produced belts in five other varieties, including a 2ft-long, two-tail heavyweight for £1.98. I remember how wary he was of publicity, previous newspaper stories having led to inquiries from people who wanted belts for what he would describe only as \"other uses\".\n\nThe saddlery still exists, run now by the late Dick's daughter, Margaret, who has written a history of the tawse on the company's website. She rejoices in its disappearance - \"for humankind to develop we must stop beating each other, and I look forward to that day\" - but, surprisingly, still makes a few for what she calls \"the collectors' market\". All weights and shapes are available at a price; a two-tail heavyweight now costs £160. Here at least, cruelty has taken on the strange innocence of folklore.\n\n* Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist",

                "body": "Emails reveal rows over Aleksandr Kogan's 'get rich quick scheme' with Facebook data\n\nOne of the world's best universities is coming under increased pressure over how it handled concerns raised about the mass data harvesting at the heart of the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, after a cache of emails revealed heated exchanges between senior academics involved.\n\nThe May 2014 emails seen by the Guardian reveal staff at Cambridge University, including a departmental director, challenged the psychologist who collated data belonging to more than 50 million Facebook users over his plans to strike a deal with the parent firm of Cambridge Analytica. In one email confronting Aleksandr Kogan, his activities are branded a \"get rich quick\" scheme.\n\nThe correspondence reveals the deep anxiety among university psychologists over the activities of Kogan, an assistant professor who, at the time, was involved in talks with Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), the parent company of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nOne of Kogan's contemporaries raised specific concerns over whether university resources including computers and staff had been used to conduct the controversial tests that yielded the data that ultimately ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCambridge University has said it sought and received reassurances from Kogan that no university data, resources or facilities were used as the basis for his work. Kogan remains employed at the university.\n\nKogan and his business partner, Joseph Chancellor, who later went on to work for Facebook, where he remains, harvested data using a personality app developed through Kogan's commercial enterprise Global Science Research (GSR).\n\nThe emails from late May 2014 show Kogan initially tried and failed to elicit the support of two other academics at the university, who had amassed their own trove of Facebook data from volunteers by hosting personality apps on the platform. This did not include data from friends.\n\nProf John Rust, the director at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre, which had pioneered the study of psychology through large-scale data analysis, wrote to Kogan after a face-to-face meeting about a dispute with the two academics.\n\nRust accused Kogan of trying to make $1m in \"personal profit in terms of asset and data\" from the scheme, while only reimbursing his fellow psychologists, Dr Michal Kosinski and Dr David Stillwell, who had led much of the cutting-edge research, with $100,000.\n\n\"When they queried this, you replied that, unless they agreed, you would go on to develop the project without them as the ideas were now in the public domain,\" Rust told Kogan.\n\n\"None of this seems right to me,\" he added, pointing out that Kosinski and Stillwell had honed the department's work on Facebook and personality traits \"for the furtherance of academic research into the prediction of personality and behaviour from online footprints\".\n\nIt is understood Kosinski and Stillwell planned to channel any funds from involvement in the SCL contract into university research. However, negotiations broke down. It was at that point that Kogan and Chancellor opted to harvest their own data through GSR, raising fears they were exploiting the research of their colleagues.\n\n\"I must insist that you do not take advantage of your position in the university to fund a 'get rich quick' scheme at our expense,\" Rust told Kogan in the email. He noted that Kosinski and Stillwell had made another tranche of data available to Kogan and Chancellor \"explicitly for academic research purposes only\".\n\nRust concluded his email to Kogan: \"From our conversation it seems to me that it is unlikely that we are going to agree on this. As well as the relevant line management, I am copying in legal services in the belief that they may be able to assist in independent arbitration before matters get seriously out of hand.\"\n\nThe director of the Psychometrics Centre also wrote directly to Chancellor, asking for an assurance that any participation of commercial projects \"such as the one with SCL Group\" would not use data or other resources gleaned by the university.\n\nReplying to Rust, Kogan said: \"Your accusations are highly inaccurate, unfounded, and quite frankly, bullying.\"\n\nKogan went on to insist that the university's resources or intellectual property were not part of the deal with SCL. \"The amounts you quote represented middle of negotiation amounts,\" he added, saying SCL was unwilling to pay those sums for models they could build in-house.\n\n\"We have used no data and no algorithms from Psychometrics Centre. We have built all our models using our own data, collected using our own software,\" Kogan added.\n\nKosinski then told Rust that he had been informed that Kogan was working on the SCL project \"during his office hours, using university computers and servers, and the work of his interns and post-docs\".\n\n\"This is a clear violation of the assurances both Dr Kogan and Dr Chancellor gave to the university,\" wrote Kosinski, the deputy director of the Psychometrics Centre.\n\n\"The continuation of his unethical behaviour is really disappointing. It shows that the assurances of the faculty member of the psychology department cannot be trusted and the department does not take any steps to solve this issue.\"\n\nKosinski added in the note that while the concerns the academics had flagged over Kogan \"were really serious\" and the damage caused by his action \"very significant\" their complaint appeared to have been \"effectively dropped\" by the department.\n\n\"I believe that this situation is really disturbing to the culture of our department and destroys the good name of the university,\" Kosinski added.\n\nKogan has offered an explanation of his actions in an interview with the BBC and an email to his Cambridge colleagues seen by the Guardian. Kogan told BBC Radio 4 that he thought he was being \"basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica\".\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Kogan said: \"When we initially envisioned doing the project with SCL, we had planned for it to be collaboration with Michal Kosinski and David Stillwell at the Psychometrics Centre.\n\n\"Even though I very much wanted to work with Michal and David, SCL felt that their position of a fee of $500,000 for the modelling portion of the project was not warranted. And so SCL asked me to remove Michal and David from the project.\n\n\"I did my best to find a middle road, but neither SCL nor Michal [or] David ended up moving to a middle ground.\n\n\"John Rust, the director of the Psychometrics Centre, then made a complaint to the university on behalf of Michal and David ... and even though the university's investigation resulted in no support for John's claims, I still lost valuable collaborators that I enjoyed working with.\n\n\"In the end, I believe the Psychometrics Centre wanted to get back on the project, even though SCL had moved on based on their negative experience with them.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica used the data from the profiles harvested by Kogan to build a powerful software program to predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box.\n\nA whistleblower revealed in the Observer on Sunday how Cambridge Analytica used the personal information - taken in early 2014 - to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements.\n\nThe university also revealed that in 2015 Kogan applied for ethical approval to use data collected by his commercial enterprise for his academic research but this was rejected.\n\nCambridge University said: \"We can confirm that there was a dispute between Drs Kosinski [and] Stillwell and Dr Kogan over the question of intellectual property. As a result, we commissioned advice from external lawyers to review the scope of IP rights in the software app 'myPersonality'. However, as this is legally privileged, we are unable to provide further details.\n\n\"We understand that Dr Kogan subsequently made no further use of data from myPersonality. Dr Kogan signed a legal assurance that no data, datasets, models, or software created or developed by doctors Stillwell and/or Kosinski or by any other students or staff at the university, or derived from them, had been or would be used by or for the benefit of SCL.\"",

                "body": "When my wife first raised the idea of accompanying the band - with four other wives and girlfriends - on the penultimate leg of our spring tour, I was sure it would not come to pass. I figured she would eventually realise it was the last thing she wanted to do. If I had to, I was certain I could talk her out of it. I was wrong.\n\n\"What time are we leaving tomorrow?\" she says, the night before.\n\n\"We're meeting the van at 9.30,\" I say.\n\n\"9.30? That's ridiculous,\" she says.\n\n\"We have to be in Morecambe by three,\" I say.\n\nAt 3.30 we convene with the band and the other wives in the hotel. I buy my wife a beer and install her in a seat by the window. She looks out at the seafront, and then at me.\n\n\"I've changed my mind,\" she says.\n\n\"I knew you would,\" I say. \"Too late, though.\"\n\nAfter the gig we reconvene at the same bar some time after midnight.\n\n\"I thought the sound was excellent tonight,\" one wife says.\n\n\"And a very good crowd,\" says another.\n\n\"I want to go home,\" my wife says.\n\n\"You're going to Bury,\" I say. \"Wheels turning, 10 o'clock.\"\n\nThe next day, my wife somehow manages to divert the wives' van to Manchester to visit a museum, a detour that meets with a mixed reception on board. The only time I see her that day is during the gig, four songs after the interval, when the lead singer thanks our wives and the lighting man shines a spot on to their row. My wife is caught frozen, crouching, halfway to her seat from the bar.\n\nThe next day a group lunch is cancelled because the motorway is shut in both directions, with us on it.\n\n\"Animals in the road,\" I say, scrolling through traffic reports. \"It doesn't say what kind.\"\n\nThe wives' van goes to the hotel, while we head straight to the venue: the Sage Gateshead. I send my wife a text that says: \"We have three dressing rooms, and they all have pianos in them.\" I receive no reply.\n\nThat evening the wives colonise one of our spare dressing rooms. None of them, I notice, is my wife.\n\n\"Where is she?\" I say. I'm told she's still in the hotel. Then I'm handed a phone featuring a recent exchange from the WAGS ON TOUR WhatsApp group.\n\n\"What time are you coming to the venue?\" the first text says.\n\n\"I'm never coming,\" is my wife's reply. But she does eventually turn up, and is much merrier by bedtime.\n\n\"The wives think I'm fun,\" she says.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" I say. \"By teatime they all seem pretty pissed off with you.\"\n\n\"Touring is boring,\" she says. \"You don't do anything.\"\n\n\"You don't do anything,\" I say. \"We unload, set up, play, break down and reload. And we finished three crosswords in that traffic jam.\"\n\n\"The driver likes me,\" she says. \"I'm a lot of fun in the van.\"\n\nBy the time we get to York it is snowing hard and there is nowhere to hang about but the venue - the next motel is outside Pontefract, 40 minutes down the road. My wife continues to complain, but everyone has adopted my strategy - treating her as if she is having the time of her life, but is able to say only the opposite due to a brain injury.\n\nThe drive to the hotel that night is scary; snow has settled on the motorway and visibility is poor. As is our custom on the last night, everyone assembles in my room to drain half-bottles of dressing room wine, eat vending machine food and debrief. My wife is not expecting this.\n\n\"What is he doing?\" my wife says, pointing at the accordion player, who is sitting on the floor eating a sandwich and drinking a beer.\n\n\"It's a tradition,\" I say.\n\n\"We'll be gone by four at the latest,\" the bass player says.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" my wife says.\n\n\"Welcome to showbiz,\" I say.\n\n\"I'm never coming on tour again,\" she says.\n\n\"I think we're all agreed on that,\" I say.",

In an instantly memorable delivery, Matthew McConaughey says, \"Time is a flat circle.\" Let's pretend he was talking specifically about TV show revivals. Everything comes back around eventually. It might be repackaged slightly differently so that, even where the years have condemned, age shall not appear to weary them. Shout-out to Twin Peaks' resurgence and the triumphant return of Will & Grace. Even Roseanne, the sitcom about poor, working-class white Americans that I watched and loved as a kid, has been exhumed. Someone thought: this is what 2018 needs! Hollywood loves retreads as much as it loves awards shows: it's all part of the ol' razzle dazzle.\n\nOne retread that I have found surprisingly effective, though? Queer Eye on Netflix. You may remember the original, in which five gay men performed a superficial life makeover for a helpless and hapless straight man, and made him better by virtue of their stylish gayness. Like so many makeover shows of a certain era, it should feel like a dinosaur. The twist here is that it's (mostly) a bloody delight. OK, so there are some crashingly obtuse moments involving an ill-judged \"police stop\" stunt that'll make you yell, \"Jesus Christ, no, what are you doing?\" But this incarnation of the Fab Five feels somehow looser than their forefathers, and the result is largely twee but achingly sincere. Observe the men testing beds with Tom in episode one, for example, and try not to giggle along with them. There is a sweetness oozing out of this revival's every pore. And in 2018, I need that.",

                "title": "Could we have done more to save my dad from cancer?",
                "body": "Dad died three months after his diagnosis. But one question haunts me: should we have asked for a second opinion?\n\nI keep a file on my phone. It is a list of clinical trials, academic papers, cutting-edge treatments I could try if my cancer ever comes back. To know my disease, I reason, is to beat it. In that regard, I understand my genetic status and how that could affect my chances with various immunotherapy drugs. I know the name of a good surgeon in Germany who has had excellent results. Should my cancer come back, I have a plan, an exit strategy that isn't death.\n\nWhen my father was told he had a terminal brain tumour, he thanked the doctor and went for a walk across the dunes with my mother. They sat in a cafe and drank coffee. Dad had a tuna and sweetcorn sandwich on white bread, a treat he allowed himself instead of his usual brown.\n\nOver the next few days and weeks, Dad didn't spend his time frantically Googling treatment options. He didn't launch a GoFundMe campaign to pay for expensive treatment in America. He just accepted the doctor's verdict. It wasn't ideal, he said, the brain tumour, the terminal diagnosis, but there was nothing that could be done. Three months later, he died.\n\nSince his death - and since my own experience with bowel cancer a few months after he died - I have been haunted by a question. Could Dad - and we as a family - have done anything to save his life?\n\nIt began with little blackouts, which the doctors thought were epileptic fits. They happened at night, and sometimes when he was running. When they found the tumour on a scan, they thought it was slow-growing, but Dad knew something wasn't right.\n\nThe second scan confirmed what Dad suspected. It was a glioblastoma, the widow-maker of brain tumours. It was in the brain stem and couldn't be removed by surgery. Radiotherapy was an option, but the doctor said it would be gruelling and might only give him a little more time. Dad was adamant. Thanks, but no thanks, he said, as if he had been receiving well-meaning but unwanted investment advice.\n\nWould I have accepted the doctor's verdict in the same way? A tuna sandwich and a coffee. A walk across the dunes. My case was different, of course. I had a dull, commonplace, and treatable cancer, with a much rosier prognosis (about a 30% chance of death over five years) than Dad's aggressive brain tumour. While Dad's cancer was the Spetsnaz special forces, mine was the catering corp.\n\nBut still. Still. When I had cancer, I learned the power of patient advocacy. I joined support groups and discussion forums on Facebook. Patients shared information about treatment options, interesting clinical trials: does anyone know a good doctor in New York who does laser treatment for lung metastases? Would hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy and surgery be too much for an 84-year-old?\n\nSome of the stories were astounding. There were people who were told there was nothing the doctors could do, only to get a second or third opinion and have their lives saved by a clinical trial. There were people who paid for treatment abroad and came home cancer-free. Could Dad have done the same?\n\nA few years after Dad died, I asked Mum why they placed so much faith in the doctors. I wondered about the fog of trauma, whether it had in any way impaired our collective judgment as a family. Doctors often recommend that cancer patients take notes or bring someone else with them for their appointments - especially the ones when they might be giving bad news. It's good advice. You can enter a kind of dream state, the doctor's words drifting over you, as if they were being said by someone else. Afterwards, punch-drunk, it can be hard to remember the details.\n\nWhy didn't Dad seek a second opinion, I asked my mother? I trod carefully, concerned she would think I was being critical rather than just curious, not wanting to make her feel that I thought she could have done more.\n\nShe didn't need to think about her answer. Why would they question the consultant, she said? All their lives they had had excellent doctors and healthcare on the NHS. Why would it be any different now? A few months before Dad's terminal diagnosis, Mum had a heart attack. In rural Cornwall, the ambulance arrived in nine minutes and she was whisked to a specialist heart unit. \"We had no reason not to believe the doctors,\" she said.\n\nSince Dad's death, I have done what I never did at the time. I have researched what killed him. Glioblastoma multiforme. I read the internet forums of the newly diagnosed. I looked at various treatment options, promising clinical trials on the horizon.\n\nCancer treatment is full of what-ifs. We second-guess ourselves, our doctors. We doubt the choices we have made. What if we had pursued a second line of chemotherapy? The internet has complicated this already murky picture, changing the balance of power between doctor and patient. For better or worse, doctors, the old gatekeepers, no longer have a monopoly on medical knowledge. The democratisation of information can be a patient's best friend, a path to advocacy and self-awareness. But as anyone who has ever Googled themselves into an early grave after experiencing a mild headache, it can be their worst enemy.\n\nWhile I was researching Dad's disease, it became clear that his decision, like everything he did in his life, was rational and sound. The cancer that he had, in the place that he had it, carried a dismal prognosis. Yes, some people survived, but only very rarely. Most, like him, succumbed to their disease.\n\nPerhaps he could have got a few more months if he'd done something differently. Perhaps I could have convinced him to keep a file on his computer, just as I did, or sold him on a maverick cancer doctor in Singapore. But that wasn't what he wanted.\n\nAnd Dad always knew what he wanted from life. He knew what made him happy. Spending time with his family, listening to the radio. Warming up from a run with a hot coffee. Walking on the cliffs with my mother and their dog. Endlessly tinkering with his computer in the study.\n\nDad chose to die as he had lived: without fuss and without wanting to unduly trouble those he loved. He didn't want to waste what precious time he had left trying to live longer. He wanted to see people rather than hospital wards. He went to visit old friends for lots of last suppers. He went with his mates from the Tandem Club for one last ride.\n\nWhile I was researching the tumour that cruelly cut short his life, I realised something else. My desire to find out whether Dad could have done something, whether he could have done more to save or extend his life, was not about him, it was about me. It was about my refusal to let go, my anger that he - my beloved father - was taken long before his time.\n\n* Luke Allnutt's We Own The Sky is published by Trapeze at £14.99.

                "body": "Kirkham Abbey, North Yorkshire: More snow came, but the genie was out, and the dawn chorus continued even as the flakes swirled\n\nThere's a view I'm fond of, and it's worth a short diversion up a steep, anthill-studded pasture to spend a while taking it in. Looking out over the sidewinder course of the Derwent, and the equally sinuous rail line to Scarborough with its toytown signal box, it takes in wooded valley flanks, a ruined priory, and the genteel Georgian doll's house and sweeping parkland of Kirkham Hall.\n\nOn this day, however, something felt wrong, though I had to close my eyes to realise what it was. It was the sounds. A peppery rash of shotgun fire had already made me tetchy, and now some trick of atmospherics, perhaps the layering of air in a clear, cold sky, meant that the other noises reaching my ear were coming from above. The murmurs of subsong, building for several weeks, were gone. Instead, a single goading crow barked over a funk rhythm emanating from a radio half a mile away where two hi-vis figures were working on the old river bridge. Behind that was the pulsed white hiss of traffic on the A64.\n\nFrom across the river, but seeming unnervingly close, the yowl of a chainsaw and the ratcheting chug of some arboreal torture device precipitated a scream of splitting wood, a sound of such violence that I cringed. Then two fighter jets streaked up the valley, pursued by their own raging sonic wake. It was as though a branch from the butchered tree had snagged a tear in the membrane of the sky, a split that ripped and crackled ferociously over my head.\n\nIt took a few seconds for the air to still, and as it did, there was something new. Threading down fine and golden from the brutalised air, it expanded in my chest and behind my eyes. A skylark, lauding the light.\n\nA day or two later more snow came, but the genie was out, and the dawn chorus continued even as the flakes swirled - a Disney combination, too pretty to be real. When it melted, there was not one lark but five, letting down their Rapunzel song, and drawing hedgebound responses from chaffinches, dunnocks and the first yellowhammers of the year.",

                "title": "Has Cynthia Nixon 'de-Mirandafied' herself enough to be a viable candidate?",
                "body": "Nixon needs to make most of her fame for a successful campaign - without the Sex and the City glamour that made her recognizable\n\nIn September 2004, all four co-stars of HBO's Sex and the City gathered in the ballroom of LA's Shrine Auditorium for the 56th Emmy awards. It was a strangely edgy moment, coming as the sitcom was drawing to its six-year close and with three of the four - Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis - all competing for the same accolade of best supporting actress in a comedy series.\n\nWhen the announcement came and the words \"Cynthia Nixon\" rang through the vast hall, the actor looked genuinely stunned - \"flabbergasted\", as she later admitted. Nixon, who played the hard-headed Miranda Hobbes in the show, stumbled on stage to receive her Emmy from the host of a new reality TV series that had just aired called The Apprentice, a bear of a man with an outsized grin on his face under a mop of meticulously combed-over orange hair. His name: Donald Trump.\n\nFast forward almost 14 years, and Nixon and Trump can eerily be mentioned in the same breath once again. This week, Nixon, 51, following in Trump's footsteps, became the second celebrity New Yorker in recent memory to run for high public office - in her case not the US presidency, but the governorship of New York state.\n\nHer timing is certainly striking. Voters in one of the most progressive states in the nation are hardly queuing around the block to elect yet another TV star from the Big Apple a year into what most New Yorkers consider to be the disastrous Trump experiment (and they didn't vote for him in 2016 - Trump lost New York to Hillary Clinton by a whopping 23 points).\n\nMonday's declaration that Nixon plans to challenge the sitting New York governor Andrew Cuomo in the state's Democratic primary brought a torrent of opprobrium, some of it from unexpected quarters. Of the twin New York tabloids, it was the left-leaning Daily News and not the right-wing Post that snarkily recalled her sex scenes in Sex and the City, likening her to Cicciolina, the Italian porn star turned member of parliament.\n\nChristine Quinn, the former speaker of the New York city council, called Nixon an \"unqualified lesbian\" - a peculiar brickbat coming from a woman who is herself lesbian. (Quinn later apologized, saying her comment \"came out wrong\".)\n\nYou don't have to use sexually charged slurs, however, to find Nixon's bid for the governorship of a state with a $168bn budget a stretch, considering she has never held elected office or led a major enterprise. Ester Fuchs, a political scientist at Columbia university who advised Michael Bloomberg when he was New York mayor, pointed out that while Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger were both actors who became governors of California, that state's relationship with fame is entirely different to its east coast cousin.\n\n\"New Yorkers aren't Californians - we don't look at celebrity as a qualification for political office. People in this city are very jaded - they are not starstruck in the same way,\" Fuchs said.\n\nNixon's conundrum is that while she must make the most of her extensive name recognition among the state's 5.8 million registered Democrats - in electoral terms, what else has she got? - she must do it in a way that avoids any whiff of the glamorous lifestyle and Manhattan chic that Sex and the City moulded into televisual gold. It is a reasonable wager that Hermès Birkin handbags and Manolo Blahnik heels will not be featuring on the Nixon campaign trail.\n\nHer new campaign website and launch video go light on SATC but heavy on Nixon's modest background and pristine liberal credentials. She was raised a native New Yorker on the Upper West Side by her single mother, with whom she remains close.\n\nHer acting career kicked off at the age of 12 when she appeared in an ABC television special, and by 14 she made her debut on Broadway. At 18 she had the distinction of appearing in two Broadway shows simultaneously - a wheeze cooked up by director Mike Nichols. Nixon's campaign literature boils this impressive early thespian history down into a Spartan story of hardship, saying that she did all that child acting \"to earn money to pay for her college education\".\n\nNo matter how hard she tries, though, there is no getting round the fact that for most New Yorkers Cynthia Nixon remains inextricably connected to the spiky, sardonic Harvard-trained lawyer she played in the HBO show. Though it would be wholly unfair to judge her by the foibles of that character, so intense was the impact of Sex and the City on a generation of viewers, particularly women, that some of Miranda's aura is bound to stick.\n\nAt least Miranda was the most politicized of the four, with a caustic take on men (\"All I have to do to meet the ideal man is give birth to him\") and a sharp tongue when it came to fairness and justice. For Jennifer Keishin Armstrong, whose 20th anniversary retrospective on the show, Sex and the City and Us, will be published in June, Miranda was \"the smart, skeptical, feminist one. While we have to separate the person from the character, this can only help her cause,\" she said. \"I would advise Cuomo not to underestimate the emotional pull of Miranda Hobbes.\"\n\nSince the conclusion of the show in 2004, Nixon has worked probably more assiduously than any of her co-stars to detach herself from the show, to \"de-Mirandafy\" herself, as the New Yorker put it. Though she appeared in the two Sex and the City movies, she has put most of her effort into rebuilding her career as a stage actor, bagging two Tony awards for Rabbit Hole in 2006 and last year's The Little Foxes. She also earned a Grammy for voicing the audiobook of Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth.\n\nIn her personal life, too, plenty has changed since Sex and the City. She split with the father of her two daughters and went on to marry Christine Marinoni, a public education advocate with whom she has had a son. All of her three children have been put through public schools, and Nixon herself has campaigned passionately over many years as a champion of state education.\n\nEducation ­will be one of the main themes of her campaign, as will gay rights. She launched her gubernatorial bid on Wednesday night at the legendary West Village gay bar the Stonewall Inn.\n\nAmong her other policy priorities will be fixing the crumbling New York subway, which she rides frequently and which falls under the governor's purview, fighting to end mass incarceration, and doing more to close the state's vast equality gap that places the super-rich like Trump cheek by jowl with the struggling poor. Nixon stresses that New York is the single most unequal state in the union, with the top 1% earning 45 times the combined income of the other 99%.\n\nWill this be enough? Progressive Democrats on the left of the party are already fired up, hailing Nixon as the long-awaited antidote to the establishment politics of the much-reviled incumbent.\n\nBut Cuomo is a wily and formidable opponent who has also worked hard at building his liberal credentials, including signing the gay marriage law in 2011 under which Nixon and Marinoni were married. With a daunting lead in the polls of 66-19 over Nixon, he has made sure to leave relatively little space to his left in which she can mobilize. And she must also beware that policies that may delight the progressive neighborhoods of New York City could be anathema to the more conservative towns and countryside in the rest of the state.\n\n\"Cynthia Nixon's got tremendous name recognition, which is the first thing you need,\" said Fuchs, who describes herself as a fan of Sex and the City. \"But that doesn't translate into support - and she may have confused that.\"",

                "title": "Austin bombings: how they unfolded, and what they revealed",
                "body": "Just before 7am on a slightly chilly morning, Anthony Stephan House walked on to the front porch of his home in north-east Austin and picked up a package. It exploded, killing the 39-year-old, who was getting ready to take his eight-year-old daughter to school.\n\nPolice quickly developed theories. Perhaps the intended target was a nearby drug dealer and the attacker got the wrong address. Maybe House was blown up by a device he made himself.\n\n\"Based on what we know right now, we have no reason to believe this is anything beyond an isolated incident that took place at this residence and in no way this is linked to a terroristic attack,\" Brian Manley, the interim police chief in the Texan capital city, told reporters on 2 March, the day of House's death.\n\nThis proved horribly wrong. Over 19 days, five more bombs would detonate and another device was made safe. Austin would soon discover it was in the grip of a serial bomber whose actions were as frightening as they were mystifying.\n\nThe apparently random terror campaign drew comparisons with one of the most notorious American criminals of the last century, the Unabomber. Ted Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23 over a period of 17 years, though. Mark Conditt, an unemployed 23-year-old from a Christian family in the quiet, conservative suburb of Pflugerville, worked on a more accelerated timeline.\n\nThe second package bomb blew up in the kitchen of an east Austin home on 12 March, killing Draylen Mason, 17, a popular student and gifted musician. His mother was seriously hurt.\n\nLater that morning, in another residential neighbourhood a couple of miles away, a 75-year-old visiting her mother's home, Esperanza Herrera, was critically injured when she picked up a package that exploded.\n\nAn everyday activity in the internet shopping era, especially - collecting a cardboard box left on a doorstep - was now cause for anxiety.\n\nThe timing was striking: residents in mundane suburbs targeted as, in the shadow of downtown's glassy, sky-scraping new apartment blocks and offices, thousands of visitors descended on the city for the annual South by Southwest festival, a symbol of Austin's swift evolution from a quiet university town into an internationally renowned destination for young, tech-minded liberals.\n\nThe danger amplified long-standing inequities. Amid community anger, police apologized for implying that House might have killed himself.\n\nAustin has a reputation as America's most politically progressive big city away from the east and west coasts, a quirky cultural oasis deep in the heart of Republican Texas. But, perhaps less obvious to outsiders, it has never escaped the familiar scourges of entrenched racism and police brutality scandals.\n\nTwo days after the first bomb, Traffic Stop, an HBO documentary about the violent 2015 arrest of a black Austin school teacher, was in contention for an Oscar at the Academy Awards.\n\nThe locations and identities of the bomb victims raised the possibility of a racial motive. The two who died were African American, while Herrera is Hispanic. \"We lost two very prominent and talented people in our community,\" Nelson Linder, the president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), told the Guardian.\n\nAll three explosions were east of Interstate 35, the north-south freeway that slices through downtown and has long acted as a de facto segregation line between wealthy, mainly white west Austin and the less prosperous, though now gentrifying, largely black and Hispanic east side; a legacy of structural racism designed by city leaders in the 1920s.\n\nThe authorities declined to define the attacks as terrorism, attracting criticism from those who detected a double standard based on the likely skin color of the perpetrator.\n\nDonald Trump, in the past quick to seize on potentially Islamic State-inspired attacks to advance his immigration agenda, merely said the suspect was \"very sick\".\n\nThe next bomb deepened the mystery. On the evening of 18 March, two twentysomething white men, walking through an affluent, mainly white part of south-west Austin, were badly injured. Not by a package, but from a bomb set off in the dark by a tripwire in the street.\n\nDifferent area, different races, different type of device. \"Whatever his motive is, he's certainly put fear into the city of Austin,\" local resident Lynn Hanson said the next day, out for a walk along a leafy route in Travis Country on a splendidly sunny afternoon. Steps from where she stood the road was blocked by a police barricade and federal agents in head-to-toe white forensics suits gathered evidence.\n\n\"It's certainly a sad state of affairs that you don't even feel like you can walk down your own street without worrying,\" Hanson said. \"It's much more devastating than using a gun, to me, it just seems like the next level up. You kind of get used to weapons.\"\n\nThe authorities appeared baffled, but then another tactical shift prompted mistakes that gave vital clues. At about 12:30am on 20 March a package bomb went off on a conveyor belt at a FedEx warehouse. Then an unexploded package was found at another FedEx facility.\n\nCCTV footage showed they had been dropped off at a store in Austin by a man wearing pink gloves, a baseball cap and a blond wig. The suspect had parked within view of a surveillance camera, a Texas politician told CNN, allowing police to read his license plate and then to pinpoint the location of his cellphone.\n\nThe general public knew no details of his being tracked, although Conditt may have suspected the authorities were closing in. Then, in the early hours of 21 March, a Swat team hunted Conditt down in his car outside a hotel in the Austin suburb of Round Rock. As an officer fired a shot, the suspect deployed his last bomb inside the vehicle, and claimed the final casualty in his short but horrific reign of terror: himself.",

All of the featured speakers at the rally will be teenagers, a spokeswoman for the march said, reflecting the frustration of the young gun control activists, who say the death of their classmates has forced them to tackle a crisis that adults have failed for decades to prevent.\n\nDonald Trump, who has flip-flopped on his support for gun control measures and vowed to support the NRA, which spent more than $30m to back his campaign for the White House, left town on Friday evening and flew to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort.\n\nThe rally organizers say that they support Americans' basic right to own guns, but they are demanding that Congress ban the military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines often used in high-profile mass shootings, as well as close loopholes in the nation's background check requirements for gun sales.\n\nA new survey of American teenagers and young adults found that gun violence was at the top of the list of issues they found most worrying. Americans under 18 were especially concerned, with 53% of them describing gun violence as a major worry.\n\nThe USA Today/Ipsos poll found that more than one in three young people were planning to join the March for Our Lives protests, either in person or via social media.\n\nSheryl Acquaroli, a 16-year-old student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, said she knew immediately she would travel to Washington to join the march. \"It's going to be very revolutionary,\" she said. \"We are going to change laws there, and I want to be part of that change.\"\n\nJon White, 47, whose daughter Katrina fled the school during the shooting, said: \"I don't have a lot of confidence in my generation. I believe in millennials. They're going to make a difference.\"\n\nAmong the performers at the Saturday rally are Lin-Manuel Miranda, Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Hudson and Ariana Grande.\n\nAs hundreds of students from Stoneman Douglas make the 1,000-mile journey to the nation's capital, the Guardian announced an editorial collaboration with the school's award-winning newspaper, the Eagle Eye.\n\nOn Friday, student editors took control of the Guardian's website and published an array of articles, including an interview with independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who told them he believed the NRA's grip on Congress \"may be breaking a bit\" because of their campaigning.\n\nThe Eagle Eye also published a manifesto of demands, including a call to ban the sale of high velocity semi-automatic weapons, expand background checks, and raise the minimum purchase age of rifles to 21.\n\nMembers of the Eagle Eye's editorial staff will also travel to Washington to cover the march as special correspondents for the Guardian.",

                "title": "Stormy Daniels: porn star primed to tell all about alleged Trump affair",
                "body": "The adult star who flirted with a Senate run goes public on Sunday night in an interview that should prove TV gold\n\nStormy Daniels got her start in politics the same way most people get a used dresser - from a post on Craigslist.\n\n\"Seeking a female candidate to challenge David Vitter in the Republican primary for the United States Senate in 2010. We are looking for a candidate with a history in some aspect of the adult entertainment industry,\" read the ad placed in 2008.\n\nVitter, the Republican senator from Louisiana who championed family values, had been ensnared in a prostitution scandal and some cheeky pranksters wanted to troll him on it.\n\nBut soon, what started as a gonzo prank idea was turning into something if not serious then at least real. \"WE HAVE FOUND OUR PORN STAR,\" read a follow-up post.\n\nThe porn star in question was Daniels, and in no time she was grabbing national headlines with her slogan that promised \"Screwing People Honestly\" - unlike her male opponent.\n\nAs wild as that was, that turned out to only be the prelude to Stormy Daniels' main event. She currently faces a much more powerful male adversary, the president of the United States, as she prepares to go public on Sunday in a TV interview to give details about her alleged 2006 affair with Donald Trump.\n\nThe interview with Anderson Cooper, which is expected to break viewership records for CBS's venerable 60 Minutes news magazine show, is easy to dismiss as frivolity. But her allegations, and the legal maneuvers Trump's allies have employed to try to keep them quiet, could have implications spanning not just sex and sexual politics - but campaign finance laws and violence against women.\n\n\"You don't know who become the pivotal players in history,\" said Jonathan Tilove, who chronicled Daniels' first steps in politics as a correspondent for the New Orleans Times-Picayune.\n\n'My daughter's name is Stephanie, not Stormy'\n\nBorn Stephanie Gregory Clifford in Baton Rouge in 1979, Daniels grew up with her mother, who worked as a trucking company manager. Her dad was seldom around. As a girl she loved dancing and horses, but if her parents hoped she might pursue a childhood dream of becoming a vet, it was not to be. She left home and began stripping at 17; by 21 she was performing in adult films under the stage name Stormy Daniels.\n\nShe considers it her real name, but her mother, Sheila Gregory, can't abide it.\n\n\"My daughter's name is Stephanie, not Stormy,\" she said when the Guardian reached her at home Tuesday. \"Please forgive me if you think I'm being rude,\" she added, before hanging up.\n\nGregory may not have made peace with her daughter's career, but by any measure, Daniels is extremely successful at what she does, both in front of the camera and behind it. She started directing in her mid-20s, and won best new starlet at the 2004 AVN awards, referred to as the \"the Oscars of porn\". The following year, she made a number of cameos in mainstream film, including Judd Apatow's blockbuster hit The 40-Year-Old Virgin. (On social media, Apatow has said he admires her work.)\n\nIn 2009, when her Louisiana campaign began, Daniels was living in Florida and not registered with either party. And as those who worked with her, most of whom did not want to speak on the record, quickly realized, she was not going to be a prop, but sensed opportunity. \"She was smart enough to know that we weren't trying to drag her through some college prank, that maybe this was an avenue to explore,\" said a person with knowledge of the campaign.\n\nHer platform, thin though it was, was socially liberal and fiscally conservative. But mainly it was about trolling Vitter, and she was a master provocateur. Asked if she was pro-life, for instance, she said she was \"pro-condom\". Asked if she really just wanted to embarrass Vitter, she replied flatly: \"I don't see how I could possibly embarrass him more than he's already embarrassed himself.\"\n\nMost notable though, was her ability to stay in the public eye, despite her never formally entering the race. \"It was clear she was smart, prepared and comfortable with the media frenzy,\" said Democratic operative Bradley Beychok, who met with Daniels during a \"listening tour\" in Baton Rouge.\n\nThe Craigslist post turned what should have been a low-key election into a national spectacle, and Louisiana is just quirky enough of a place that national election forecaster Nate Silver didn't rule her out. \"She's certainly not without her, um, charms,\" Silver wrote at the time.\n\nDaniels' campaign would prove quite literally explosive. At the height of her political momentum, the Audi belonging to her political manager burst into flames, and though no one was ever apprehended, blurry surveillance footage showed someone loitering around the car and getting into it shortly before it detonated.\n\nSoon after that, and amid a domestic violence arrest, Daniels opted out of the race. Vitter would go on to win, riding the wave of anti-Obama backlash in 2010. But when he ran for governor a few years later, his Democratic opponent won in an upset by reviving the prostitution scandal that Daniels had worked to highlight.\n\nTarget on her back\n\nToday, as she prepares to take on the president, Daniels is - improbably, perhaps, at 39 - on top of her industry, with a confidence and acerbic Twitter profile to match.\n\nHer second foray into politics began in February, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, had paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about her story just before the 2016 election.\n\nIn response to the bombshell, the tabloid In Touch Weekly published an interview with Daniels it had been sitting on since 2011, kept under wraps due to legal threats from Trump's circle. In the interview, Daniels describes in explicit detail a consensual, nearly year-long sexual dalliance with Trump, allegedly begun weeks after his wife Melania gave birth to their son, Barron.\n\nSunday's interview, however, will be the first time Daniels has spoken about the matter since Trump forged his own political career, and the first time she will address the efforts to muzzle her, which she has been fighting in court.\n\nDetails from Daniels' account further shape the narratives that first emerged about Trump and his relationship with women during the 2016 election. More than a dozen women came forward to accuse Trump of sexual harassment and assault in the lead-up to the election. And while Daniels' alleged affair with Trump was consensual, the context is nonetheless informative about how he views women.\n\nAnd Daniels is not alone. Another adult film star, Jessica Drake, who accused Trump of trying to buy sex from her, claims she also has \"confidential information\" about Trump's relationship with Daniels, according to a 2016 non-disclosure agreement or NDA.\n\nOn Tuesday, the former Playboy model Karen McDougal became the second woman this month to challenge Trump's efforts to silence her, announcing she was suing the president to be released from a 2016 legal agreement that restricted her ability to speak about her alleged affair with the future president.\n\nSeparately, a judge this month ruled that a defamation suit brought by former Apprentice star Summer Zervos, who accused Trump of harassing her, may go forward, clearing the path for other sexual misconduct allegations against the president to be aired.\n\n\"It is settled that the president of the United States has no immunity and is 'subject to the laws' for purely private acts,\" the judge declared, citing the precedent set by a lawsuit brought against Bill Clinton by his alleged mistress Paula Jones two decades ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the president, who has denied all the claims brought against him, remains committed to keeping Daniels quiet.\n\nDaniels' legal team, in a clever bit of maneuvering, has offered to pay back every dollar she was paid in the NDA for the chance to speak freely. Her team claims the agreement is null and void because Trump never signed it, and they are moving ahead with the CBS interview despite a threat from Trump's camp of up to $20m in damages.\n\nDaniels now has a target on her back, and her lawyer has said she's been physically threatened and is under 24-hour security. But her background in adult entertainment may give her a rare liberty other women Trump has tried to shame into silence do not possess. Namely, she is not easily embarrassed and she doesn't care if people don't like her.\n\n\"Slut and whore are words used by people who feel threatened,\" she responded to a troll on Twitter who accused her of promiscuity. \"I find power in them.\"",

                "body": "The only Christian girl among the Dapchi schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram last month could have been freed along with her schoolmates but refused to renounce her faith, according to her mother.\n\nLeah Sharibu refused to accept Islam, resisting the entreaties of her classmates to pretend to do so, her parents learned from snatched conversation with her friends.\n\nA faction of Boko Haram kidnapped 110 girls and one boy from the girls' school in Dapchi, a town in north-east Nigeria, in February, and released most of them a month later, after what the government described as \"back-channel\" negotiations.\n\nFive were killed, possibly trampled to death in the overcrowded trucks as they were being abducted.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, Rebecca Sharibu, the mother of Leah, 15, heard girls' voices and the sound of vehicles driving past her house. She was told to stay inside, but when she heard the cars coming back after dropping the girls off, she ran out. All around her were joyful parents and their returned daughters.\n\nBut she could not find Leah anywhere.\n\nFrantic with worry, she found two of Leah's friends and asked them: \"Where is Leah, I can't find my Leah, why did you leave her there?\"\n\nThe girls told her: \"Boko Haram told Leah to accept Islam and she refused. So they said she would not come with us and she should go and sit back down with three other girls they had there.\n\n\"We begged her to just recite the Islamic declaration and put the hijab on and get into the vehicle, but she said it was not her faith, so why should she say it was? If they want to kill her, they can go ahead, but she won't say she is a Muslim.\"\n\nLeah asked her friends to tell her parents to pray for her, they said, but her mother could not find out anything else about how her daughter was, as the army then ordered all of the released girls to report to the hospital.\n\nThey were held there for several hours and then taken to Abuja, where on Friday they were to meet the president, Muhammadu Buhari, in his villa, surrounded by cameras, as he declared their release \"cheery and hearty\". Neither they nor their parents were asked if they consented to this.\n\nInstead of lining them up for photocalls on Buhari's lawn, some Dapchi parents, who did not find their children among those Boko Haram dropped off, wanted to talk to the returned girls to find out what happened.\n\nFatima Mohammed's distraught parents think she is among the five who died, but the army prevented them from confirming this with Fatima's friends, and none of the authorities have made contact.\n\n\"We heard that some of the girls who returned said that she died, but we haven't been able to talk to them or get any official confirmation, so we're still in the dark,\" said her mother, Salamtu Mohammed.\n\nFatima's father tried to search for her in the hospital while the girls were waiting there, but the soldiers guarding them threw him out. There is a chance that she is among the girls taken to Abuja.\n\n\"If they had let us go and talk to the girls, we would know if she is alive or not, or if whoever is taking care of them in Abuja checked. We'd know,\" Salamtu said.\n\nHer father could not speak, but only wept and shook his head, his clothes covered in dirt.\n\nIt is not known exactly how the five died.\n\n\"We just kept moving and moving for three days before we stopped, until we came to a river,\" Hafsat Abdullahi remembered her sister Fatima saying, before she was taken to Abuja. \"We were told to come down from the vehicle and five people were discovered dead. They dug a hole and buried them.\"\n\nThough distraught that Leah remains a prisoner, her parents and the pastor of her church are very proud of her.\n\n\"I am feeling fantastic because she did not deny Christ as her personal saviour,\" said Lathan Sharibu, Leah's father and a policeman. \"That makes me feel great.\n\n\"I didn't think that girl could do something like that because she is young, small and she doesn't talk just like that. She's a very quiet girl.\"\n\nHe added: \"I expect the federal government to bring her back to me the way they brought the others home.\"",

                "body": "Exactly a year out from the state election, thousands of people from across New South Wales - including some on horseback - have marched through Sydney, calling for an end to coal seam gas and coal mining and a renewed focus on renewables.\n\nThe \"Time to Choose\" rally, which began at Martin Place, marched to Prince Alfred Park in the city's south stretching almost 2km along a partially closed Elizabeth Street.\n\nNeha Madhok, from rally organiser 350+, said people had come from across NSW \"to put the state government on notice\".\n\n\"We want the state government and the opposition to know that over the next year we are not going to stop talking about climate change, about coal and gas. We want to repower NSW, we want a renewable energy-powered NSW.\"\n\nThe state government approved 10 industrial solar farms in 2017 - twice as many as the previous year, and has committed to an ambitious zero emissions target by 2050 as part of its climate change policy framework.\n\nHowever, legislation has threatened to weaken environmental protections, and several proposed or operating mining ventures have been the targets of long-running community opposition, as well as several applications for extensions.\n\nOrganisers pointed to the proposed CSG mining in Narribri, open cut coal mining in the Bylong valley, the Southern Highlands Hume Coal project, and Shenhua Mining's attempts in the Liverpool plains as among the threats to the state's environment and communities.\n\n\"There is no safe place for coal seam gas in NSW. It threatens communities, precious groundwater aquifers and farmland, and the climate, wherever it goes,\" said Naomi Hodgson of the Wilderness Alliance.\n\nGlenn Morris, who made headlines in 2016 after riding his horse Hombre across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to raise awareness about climate change, was one of the 25 farmers on horseback.\n\n\"There is devastation because of climate change all across NSW,\" the Inverell farmer said. \"We can't afford to destroy any more healthy land.\"\n\nBob Clarke came from Wollar, a small village near Mudgee, where he said the open-cut Wilpinjong mine was destroying the region.\n\nThe Peabody mining company was granted an extension last year, but it has been challenged in the land and environment court.\n\nClarke, who has lived in Wollar for 30 years, said Peabody had recently started buying nearby land, and the exodus of people had \"broken the community\".\n\n\"There's only four of us left there now,\" he said. \"We're not going nowhere, we're still hanging in there.\"\n\nBill Ryan, in his 90s, said he wanted governments to realise citizens wanted renewable energy now.\n\n\"They've got to take into consideration that this is what the people want. So we've got to get out and let them know they can't get away with backing the mining sector all the time. They have to listen to the citizens.\"\n\nThe Greens MLA David Shoebridge praised the size and breadth of the turnout at the rally.\n\n\"We have First Nations peoples, farming communities, inner city environmental and activist groups, all coming together under the same banner.\"\n\nShoebridge said people wanted to put the environment and climate change on the agenda.\n\n\"The community is concerned. They're talking about renewable energy and a fresh way forward that doesn't involve coal. It's a concern the parliament is almost entirely deaf to.\"\n\nHe said there needed to be a \"just transition plan\" into renewables to support people and communities that relied on industries that had closed.\n\n\"We know for a fact that jobs in the coal industry are drying up. Conditions for those workers are getting more and more severe. Meanwhile there is a wonderful opportunity for ongoing solid employment in the renewable energy sector.\"",

Officials will discuss the date and specific agendas of the April summit.\n\nPresident Moon's envoys visited Kim in Pyongyang earlier this month, and South Korean officials have also brokered a potential meeting between Kim and President Donald Trump by the end of May.

North Korea in 2017 tested its most powerful nuclear weapon to date and test-launched three intercontinental ballistic missiles theoretically capable of striking the US mainland. But since then the North has sent delegates and athletes to the Winter Games in the South.\n\nThere are also concerns in South Korea over whether the appointment of John Bolton, Trump's hawkish replacement of national security adviser HR McMaster, could potentially complicate efforts to set up talks between Trump and Kim.\n\nA South Korean presidential official, who did not want to be named, downplayed such worries on Friday, saying Trump remained firmly committed to the summit and was leading the drive to set it up.\n\nWith Associated Press",

                "body": "The Western Bulldogs banner read today: \"You have come so far, given your very best, today the cup belongs to the daughters of the west.\"\n\nAnd after the week, the season these women have had who could argue? Now after key injuries, finishing minor premiers but being denied a home grand final, and having their captain sidelined in a controversial suspension, the women of the west can hold their heads, and the 2018 AFLW Premiership cup high.\n\nThe weather wreaked havoc over Ikon Park, causing the prematch entertainment to come under a cloud when Missy Higgins had to pull the plug with concerns over the stage potentially causing damage to a rain-soaked ground. The rain also deterred the punters, with only a disappointing 7, 083 turning up for the biggest game of the season.\n\nThe rain eased slightly but was still steady by bounce down after the Bulldogs won the toss, but a slippery ball proved hard to collect in the opening minutes. It was a tight tussle as both sides played desperate, contested football.\n\nIn a reprieve at the halfway mark of the opening term, Jess Wuetschner found the ball inside 50 and delivered it expertly to Sophie Conway. The round three rising star nominee and young gun went on to kick the opening goal of the grand final.\n\nConway found the ball again on the run a minute later after momentum built for the Lions but this time she missed everything. The Bulldogs needed to rally but it was all Brisbane as they charged again through Wuetschner, this time only for a behind. The Lions led the Dogs into the first break by six points.\n\nThe Lions defence denied the Dogs going forward in the second, Kate Lutkins' mitts proving handy. It was tackles a plenty as the Dogs worked hard to keep the Lions off the board, Angelica Gogos laying six by half-time. The score remained unaltered at the main break as the rain continued to pour over Ikon Park.\n\nBoth teams needed to push in the second half in trying conditions, another scoreless quarter would not do. Stand in captain Ellie Blackburn, no stranger to the task of taking the reins, needed to inspire the Bulldogs and was doing her best to let her actions speak for her. She led the disposal count at the half on ten with Lion Ally Anderson.\n\nThe Lions charged early in the third. Kaitlyn Ashmore booting the ball down to find Conway again who missed across the face. The Bulldogs made the most of this with Blackburn going in hard to collect a loose ball where she was momentarily wounded but recovered quickly to the cheers of her Bulldogs faithful. The ball found its way down the ground and Deanna Berry scored the first Bulldogs goal at the two-minute mark to level the scores at 7 a piece. The Bulldogs charged again quickly but only resulted in a behind to snatch the lead by a point.\n\nThen the Bulldogs brought their bite. Kristen McLeod snapped from the bottom of the pack and scored, giving us two goals in the first six minute of the third term, the replacement for Katie Brennan making her sidelined captain proud. A very different ball game from the first half had opened up. The fog also lifted and you could see the city scape appearing from beyond Ikon Park, the rain still drizzling but allowing a more open game. A break from the weather what the Bulldogs needed in what is referred to as the premiership quarter.\n\nThe Dogs kept charging but the Lions were back on with the defence, determined not to allow another to slip through. But in a blow for Brisbane, Tahlia Randall was taken off the ground holding her collarbone after a big tackle on Deanna Berry at the 13-minute mark. This was devastating for the Lions at a time when defensive pressure was needed to change the Bulldogs' momentum.\n\nThe Bulldogs charged again and another young gun and rising star nominee Monique Conti scores a goal and puts them into a 13-point lead.\n\nWith the sting of last year's close loss at the forefront of their minds, Wuetschner got her Lions back on the board with an early goal narrowing the margin to seven. Then Sabrina Frederick-Traub reduces it so six, a losing margin the Lions know only too well.\n\nThe Bulldogs stamped their authority on the game in the third. A free to Emma Kearney in front of goal appears to seal the Lions fate.\n\nBut the Lions rallied and got one back through Wuetschner to make it only a 5-point margin.\n\nAfter a scrap and a quick behind the Lions are behind by six. History repeats itself in the cruellest way.\n\nThey once again know the pain of having grand final glory slip through their hands.\n\nThe Bulldogs' journey is validated in the history books. Backs to the wall, no captain, no problem.\n\nSpeaking to Isabel Huntington, who was on the sidelines today, before the match she told me: \"There have been so many incredible moments but almost, just waking up today has been my favourite, I know I'm not out there on the field but when I woke up like it was Christmas morning today.\"\n\nI can only imagine what she's feeling now.",

My response provides the subject of the first piece in On Borrowed Time, a collection of recent essays. Academics who accept the title of \"public intellectual\", as I now reluctantly do, must range more broadly than their university colleagues but without sacrificing depth. Through their chief weapon - the written word - they try to understand and influence even a little the trajectory of their own society and world.\n\nBecause of the corrupting influence of the Murdoch media, one essay dissects our most influential conservative columnist, Andrew Bolt, and another our most influential conservative newspaper, The Australian. Yet another traces the evolution of the terrifying ideology of the post-al Qaeda group, the Islamic State. Several grapple from different angles with our era's overwhelmingly most consequential and puzzling issue - humankind's failure to rise to the challenge of climate change. Through this failure, are we not all living at the expense of future generations, on borrowed time?\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: While writing, a 50-year-old four-volume collection of George Orwell's essays sat by my desk. Orwell's combination of lucidity, fearlessness, independence, self-deprecating humour and ability to face \"unpleasant truths\" provided a daunting reminder of what a political essay can be.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: I'm about to read Dunera Lives: A Visual History by Ken Inglis, Seumas Spark and Jay Winter and am fascinated to see whether these distinguished historians can find the language to convey a sad and curious rather than tragic second world war detention story, involving the transportation to country Australia of mainly Jewish \"enemy aliens\" arrested in Churchill's Britain at the time of the Dunkirk panic, where the captors were soon apologetic and the captured, in general, unembittered.\n\nTracy Sorensen\n\nThe Lucky Galah\n\nPan Macmillan Australia\n\nYour book in your own words: The Lucky Galah is a story about the 1969 moon landing from the point of view of a pink and grey galah. Stolen from her tree before she has even fledged, Lucky is stuck in a cage with a clipped wing, tantalised by a mammalian story of super-flight, flight beyond the stratosphere. With the help of data emitted by a decommissioned NASA-era satellite dish, she tells the story of Evan Johnson, radar technician, who has come to a remote north-west Australian town to work at the NASA tracking station.\n\nIt's about the fall of (a) man and the rise of a bird: as Evan's fortunes fall, the galah's fortunes rise. It's about a woman, Evan's wife Linda, who tries to impress with cleverly carved carrots and falls for a visiting entomologist. It's about finally tuning in to voices that were there all along.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: I was reading and rereading Donald Horne's The Lucky Country. I was taking note of elements such as the wooden salad bowl, the bead curtain and the pink roll of toilet paper, and thinking about the laconic pest inspector that appears on page 218 of the 1964 Penguin paperback.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: Dyschronia by Jennifer Mills. It's a story about waking up one morning and finding that the sea has gone. As a climate change activist myself, I'm drawn to stories that take imaginative leaps into the future while holding a sense of a more familiar present.\n\nTim Winton\n\nThe Shepherd's Hut\n\nHamish Hamilton\n\nYour book in your own words: It's about a 15-year-old borderline sociopath called Jaxie Clackton. Jaxie's been beaten and cowed all his life. His father's a vicious drunk and his mum recently died of cancer. Jaxie seems doomed to replicate his father's violent misogyny - he's the school bully and the local wild boy. But when he comes home one night, concussed and nursing a swollen eye, he finds his father dead in grisly circumstances and he panics and bolts into the bush with only what he can carry to keep himself alive: a high-powered rifle, a backpack full of food, and five litres of water.\n\nOn the face of it, this begins as a survival story, but it turns out to be a more of a sentimental education. Out in the barren saltlands, Jaxie stumbles upon an isolated camp and his story takes another sudden turn. He encounters a ruined priest who presents an entirely different way of being a man.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: It's a couple of years since I was working on the book but I remember being really impressed by Charlotte Wood's The Natural Way of Things which was provocative and timely. I also really admired Howard Cunnell's Fathers and Sons about a man who grew up without a father and has to learn how to father a girl he adores. His journey is complicated as his daughter transitions to being a boy.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: I've just finished a really lovely book by Jessie Cole called Staying (to be published by Text). It's a book about the lasting effects of trauma and how it radiates through families. It's beautifully written and I'm full of admiration for the heart and the craft in this memoir.\n\nCynthia Banham\n\nA Certain Light\n\nAllen & Unwin\n\nYour book in your own words: A Certain Light tells the story of the interrupted lives among three generations of my family. There's my Italian grandfather, a forced labourer in Germany in the second world war. There's my mother, who migrated to Australia when she was nine. And there is me.\n\nI was a journalist for the Sydney Morning Herald in 2007 when, on assignment in Indonesia, I was in a plane crash. I suffered horrific injuries and for years couldn't write about what happened. It took seven years before I found a way to do it. I would back into my story, writing first about some of the traumatic experiences of family members before mine. In writing about them I found a certain solace; my sense of isolation about my own trauma lessened slightly. I wrote the book because writing is what I do. I wrote it for my son, so he would know what happened to his mother.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million, by Daniel Mendelsohn. I read this book on the plane on the way to Europe in 2015 where I was doing research into my grandfather's second world war experiences. Reading Mendelsohn's incredible story of his search for the truth about his family, lost during the Holocaust, made me feel inspired but daunted as I went about my own quest.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: The Shepherd's Hut, Tim Winton. I read my first Tim Winton novel for HSC English in 1989, An Open Swimmer, and love the rawness of his writing and the way he brings the landscapes and characters of Western Australia alive. I'm looking forward to seeing how he does this in his latest book.\n\nCeridwen Dovey\n\nIn the Garden of the Fugitives\n\nPenguin\n\nYour book in your own words: In the Garden of the Fugitives is my attempt to grapple with how we remember - or misremember - our own pasts, and how we invent rather than recall history as a whole.\n\nOne strand of the novel dramatises the struggles of a young woman artist, Vita, to build a new identity from the rubble of the past, a confessional performance of white guilt which she tries to find a language for through psychotherapy. The other narrative strand is inspired by Sigmund Freud's observation that \"there is no better analogy for repression than the burial which was the fate of Pompeii, and from which the city was able to rise again.\"\n\nFreud believed that the human psyche could be excavated like an archaeological site, made to throw up fragments. Much of my novel is set in Pompeii in the 1970s, where Royce - an Ivy League graduate, one of the silver spoon set - has followed his love interest, Kitty, an archaeologist, over to the ancient city where they spend two summers working in the ruins before something goes horribly wrong.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: Resurrecting Pompeii by Australian archaeologist Estelle Lazer - a fascinating account of her pioneering work on the human remains within Pompeii. Also From Pompeii: The Afterlife of a Roman Town by Ingrid D Rowland, which is a wonderful survey of the various ways the excavations at Pompeii have been interpreted by visitors over time.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: Kate Rossmanith's forthcoming Small Wrongs: How We Really Say Sorry in Love, Life and Law. I'm really interested in hybrid/blended books at the moment, and this one is a close study of remorse in the criminal justice system but is also a memoir about remorse/regret within family life.\n\nMichael Mohammed Ahmad\n\nThe Lebs\n\nHachette\n\nYour book in your own words: Following the notorious Skaf gang rapes in 2000 and the 9/11 attacks on New York in 2001, an explosion of public debate concerning the lives and activities of young men from Arabic-speaking backgrounds in western Sydney spread throughout Australia. The media and politicians gave these young men many names, including Arabs, Muslims, Middle Easterners and Lebanese. But behind the barbed wire, cameras and red-brick walls of Punchbowl Boys high school, the boys went by a different name: Lebs.\n\nThe Lebs is the story of Bani Adam, a second-generation Lebanese-Australian Muslim studying at Punchbowl Boys high school during a turbulent period in which the school had become a war zone of violent, racist, sexist and homophobic tensions. Bani Adam attempts to distance himself from the other Lebs within his school by reading the great works of Shakespeare, Vladimir Nabokov, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Kahlil Gibran and Ernest Hemingway. But when he is finally presented with an opportunity to join a community of white left-wing artists from Sydney's inner west, he discovers that escaping the stereotypes about his identity will be far more difficult than he first imagined.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: I was reading Michael Duffy's Drive By: Inside a Western Suburbs Crime Family just as I had started writing The Lebs. And I was thinking, \"If an ignorant white guy can write a book about dumbass Lebs from western Sydney, then surely an actual dumbass Leb like me can do it.\"\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: The next Australian book I'll read is a poetry collection called The Hijab Files (Giramondo, 2018) by Maryam Azam. Maryam identifies as a Pakistani-Australian Muslim woman from Kellyville. Her ability to blend the experiences of everyday western Sydney with the spiritual and historical language of the Muslim tradition is radical, political, subversive and unique in the purest sense of the word \"literature\".\n\nKitty Flanagan\n\nBridge Burning and Other Hobbies\n\nAllen & Unwin\n\nYour book in your own words: Rather than an autobiography, my book is a collection of funny true stories. I've picked out some of my life's highlights like the time I went to my school dance dressed like a 60-year-old dowager shopkeep, and the time my car was pelted with two dozen eggs by a (justifiably) angry mob. I've also dissected a few of my failed relationships for your reading pleasure because I think stories of failure are funnier than tales of triumph. Plus there are even some handy life hacks, like how not to die while hitch-hiking and how to do a DIY repair on your petrol tank. In some ways I've written the Where's Wally of self-help books, in that this book contains some seriously brilliant advice, you just have to look really really hard to find it.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: Tina Fey's Bossypants. That's why I didn't write an autobiography. I haven't had such an insanely interesting, high-powered showbiz life. I tour regional Australia and mostly hang out with my sister or my pets. I read a lot of David Sedaris while I was writing to remind me that stories about ordinary people can be funny and interesting too.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: The Tattooist of Auschwitz. I have been fascinated by second world war stories since I was 10 and did a school project on Nazi Germany. I found it so terrifying that I drew a ridiculously incongruous border of teddy bears around the page to try to make it less frightening.\n\nEileen Ormsby\n\nThe Darkest Web\n\nAllen & Unwin\n\nYour book in your own words: The Darkest Web takes a deep-dive into three different areas of the dark web, which is like a parallel internet that can only be accessed using special software. Part one, Dark, takes the reader into the darknet markets, where drugs, guns, stolen identities, credit cards and hacking tools are bought and sold. Part two, Darker, examines online hitmen, and follows one murder in particular, as well as my own relationship with the owner of the most profitable murder-for-hire website in history. The final part, Darkest, goes to a place some readers might not want to enter: the world of hurtcore, which is even worse than it sounds.\n\nThe book doesn't merely take place online. I travelled the world to meet many of the characters behind the sites, whether attending their trials, visiting them in jail or having a beer with them.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: Researching The Darkest Web took me to very bleak places and I turned to Liane Moriarty for escape. She is like thinking woman's chicklit but much sharper and funnier than that term implies. I love her quirky structuring of story and incredibly rich and nuanced characters.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: It may not be the very next book I'll read, but I'm really looking forward to journalist Ginger Gorman's book on internet trolls. Besides my obvious interest in the subject matter, I admire her depth of research and way with words.\n\nGeoffrey Robertson\n\nRather his Own Man\n\nKnopf Australia\n\nYour book in your own words: I have reached three score years and ten so I am in my anecdotage, which seemed a good time for an autobiography. It charts my progress from pimply state schoolboy to an Old Bailey barrister and then to acting for prisoners on death rows around the world and trying to bring tyrants to justice. It's an opportunity to think back on some of the absurdities of growing up as one of \"Ming's kids\" in the 50s - the repressive censorship, the white Australia policy, fighting for Indigenous rights and against conscription for the Vietnam War.\n\nThe book moves on to the life of an expatriate but never an ex-patriot in Britain and some of the cause celebres I became involved with at the Old Bailey. It's also been an opportunity to explain my beliefs about the importance of human rights and the need to find new ways of fighting for them in a world which is becoming more polarised and less cooperative. An autobiography is an egregious exercise but I have tried to make fun of myself as well as of my opponents.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: Whilst writing my memoirs I mainly read the memoirs of others. David Hare's The Blue Touch Paper was a treat and Claire Tomalin's memoir A Life of My Own inspired me to greater self-revelation. She's such a good writer: where I talk about the workings of Providence, she speaks of \"the randomness of things\" which better describes the ebbs and flows of my own life.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: I think I will pass on Jacquie Lambie. On this trip I only have time to read on aeroplanes so for my next short flight I bought David Marr's book, Factions (a great title - in the Labor party, factions speak louder than words) and for longer flights, the latest Richard Flanagan, First Person.\n\nMeg and Tom Keneally\n\nThe Power Game (Book Three, The Monsarrat Series)\n\nVintage Australia\n\nYour book in your own words - Meg Keneally: When a boatman on a lonely island off the coast of Van Diemen's Land is murdered, the authorities believe they have the perfect suspect. In 1826, Maria Island - an island dangling off an island dangling off an island, and one of Britain's most remote penal settlements - is home to very inconvenient political prisoner. Thomas Power is the son of a baronet, and a former member of the House of Commons. He's also an Irish revolutionary who is too popular to hang. He has been tucked away in the hopes his followers will forget him, which they show no sign of doing.\n\nThe government hopes pinning the boatman's murder on Power will dent his reputation so he can be executed without causing a revolt. But the murder victim was hardly an innocent, having read all the letters he delivered to the island and using the knowledge in a wide-ranging blackmail scheme. And when former gentleman convict Hugh Monsarrat and his friend Mrs Mulrooney are sent to investigate, they find the evidence is leading them down paths the government doesn't want them to follow.\n\nWe were very interested in exploring the idea that one person's free speech is another's sedition, and the ownership of communication as a path to power.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: The Roving Party by Rohan Wilson, which is a confronting story about a band of trackers and their prey, the Aboriginal people of northern Tasmania. It was so affecting, as tales about the massacre of innocents are, that I occasionally needed a deep-breathing break. The arrogance of the colonists, the flexible morality of the bloody business they were engaged in, and the perspective of the hunted are themes that resonated strongly with me.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: Terra Nullius by Claire G Coleman. This is an alternative story of the colonisation of Australia. I like speculative fiction, and my favourite kind of story is one which jolts you out of your own perspective. I'm also a sucker for novelists who use landscape as a character, which I've been told Coleman does to great effect. The book has won numerous awards and been nominated for the 2018 Stella prize. I'm very much looking forward to it.\n\nMartin Flanagan\n\nA Wink from the Universe\n\nViking\n\nYour book in your own words: Melbourne's west has always been Melbourne's \"other\". Its river, the Maribyrnong, was used as an industrial drain. Its working class community bore the brunt of the depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s. Its football club survived, but only just - its single VFL/AFL premiership, in 1954, having become a dim memory. \"No one expected us to win in 2016,\" says club historian Darren \"Ace\" Arthur. \"Not even us\".\n\nEnter coach Luke Beveridge and captain Bob Murphy, the Lennon and McCartney of the Bulldog revival. The team they conjure into being suffers crippling injuries and limps into the finals in 7th place. No one gives them a chance. They beat four more highly fancied teams, three of them on their home grounds, to win the premiership.\n\nAs the campaign builds, the west, now with one million people of all races and religions, finds it has a cause in common. Bulldog family stories buried for generations come zooming to life. People start seeing the dead and pray to statues.\n\nWhat you were reading when you wrote it: The two books I kept close by were The Book of Fame by Lloyd Jones, a novel which succeeds in being evocative and lyrical while being utterly authentic in sporting terms, and Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood, which I love not just for its language but for the author's shrewd appreciation of ordinary life. As happens in Under Milk Wood, I wanted to create a crowd effect.\n\nThe next Australian book you'll read: Losing Streak by historian James Boyce on the Tasmanian gambling industry - fearless, informed political journalism at its best, and a book that shaped a state election.",

                "title": "White House announces ban on transgender people serving in military",
                "body": "The White House has announced orders to formally ban transgender people from serving in the military, following up on Donald Trump's controversial policy pledge that sparked widespread backlash last year from civil rights groups and US defense chiefs.\n\nDespite opposition from top military officials and previous rulings against the ban, which LGBT rights groups have challenged in court, a memo from the secretary of defense released late Friday night said trans people are \"disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances\".\n\nThe memo did not elaborate on possible exceptions, but said the secretary of defense and secretary of homeland security \"may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals\".\n\nThe announcement claimed that the policy was \"developed through extensive study by senior uniformed and civilian leaders\" and said that based on the advice of \"experts\", the administration has concluded that the \"accession or retention\" of trans people \"presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality\".\n\nWhen Trump originally announced the ban on Twitter, he claimed that the military \"cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption\" of trans service members, despite the fact that studies have found that the ban would have negative impacts on the military.\n\nCritics have argued that the discriminatory policy will cause significant disruptions in the military, force trans members to hide their identities, deprive the military of talented people and reinforce harmful and inaccurate stereotypes about trans people. The president's orders have reversed Barack Obama's policy in 2016, which ended a longstanding rule barring trans people from serving openly in the military.\n\n\"What the White House has released tonight is transphobia masquerading as policy. This policy is not based on an evaluation of new evidence,\" Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT and HIV Project, said in a statement Friday night. \"It is reverse-engineered for the sole purpose of carrying out President Trump's reckless and unconstitutional ban, undermining the ability of transgender service members to serve openly and military readiness as a whole.\"\n\nTrump's directive was already blocked by federal courts in four separate cases, including an ACLU lawsuit, the group noted.\n\n\"The policy effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country,\" Block said. \"Transgender people in our military deserve more from their government than a myth-driven proclamation about their unfitness for full civic inclusion.\"\n\nSarah McBride, the national press secretary with the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ rights group in the US, also condemned the policy in a statement, saying: \"Releasing this news under cover of darkness late on a Friday night means thousands of transgender troops will wake up tomorrow with their lives turned upside down. This couldn't be more cowardly or wrong.\"\n\nNumerous Republican senators, including John McCain, Susan Collins and Orrin Hatch, have criticized the policy, and more than 50 retired generals and admirals signed a letter saying the ban would degrade military readiness.\n\nTrump has also rescinded Obama-era protections for trans students, and vice-president Mike Pence has a long history of backing anti-LGBT policies.",

                "body": "Arrest and deportation of Bel Trew, a correspondent for the Times, is the latest incident in an unprecedented crackdown\n\nEgyptian authorities threatened a British journalist with a military trial and expelled her from the country with no stated cause, in advance of the country's upcoming presidential election.\n\nBel Trew, a journalist with the Times, was arrested on 20 February while reporting in Shubra, a working-class neighbourhood of Cairo, and taken to a police station. Hours later, she was driven to Cairo international airport and forced to board a flight for London.\n\nIn an account published on Saturday by the Times, Trew wrote: \"The charges were never revealed to me. [But] after seven hours of detention, I was threatened with a military trial, a legal process often used against terrorism suspects or dissidents.\"\n\n\"Less than 24 hours after I was first detained, I was marched on to a plane with nothing but the clothes I was standing up in. The choice before me - stay for a military trial or leave - was no kind of choice,\" she wrote.\n\nThe arrest and deportation of a foreign journalist is the latest incident in an already unprecedented crackdown on press freedom in Egypt.\n\nForeign media workers have been subject to imprisonment or arrest in the past, but Trew's expulsion has raised concerns about whether journalists are safe to report in Egypt ahead of the country's upcoming presidential election on 26 March.\n\nIn a statement, the Times said that it had withheld news of Trew's deportation while investigating if she could return to the country.\n\n\"The circumstances of her detention and the threats made against her were sufficiently outlandish to suggest that a mistake had been made, based on a misunderstanding. We have since been trying to ensure her safe return to Cairo, in time to cover the presidential election. It is now clear that the authorities have no intention of allowing her to return,\" the newspaper said.\n\n\"As far as the Cairo authorities are concerned, I am on a list of 'undesirable people' and if I attempt to return I will be re-arrested,\" wrote Trew.\n\nA spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Cairo said that the motivation for Trew's expulsion was still unknown.\n\n\"We have provided support and raised our concerns at the highest levels. The foreign secretary has raised it directly with the Egyptian foreign minister. The Egyptian authorities have not shared any evidence of wrongdoing. We will continue to press them on this case,\" she said.\n\nThe Egyptian government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrew, 33, moved to Cairo shortly before the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak.\n\nSince the current president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power in a 2013 military coup, the climate for Egyptian and foreign media has grown increasingly repressive.\n\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 20 Egyptian journalists are behind bars as of December last year.\n\nEgypt is described as one of \"the world's biggest prisons for journalists\", by the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, ranking 161 out of a total of 180 countries on their annual World Press Freedom Index.",

They'll play Sunday against the winner of Friday night's second semi-final between No2 seed Duke and 11-seed Syracuse.\n\nClemson, in a regional semi-final for the first time since 1997, had a six-minute field goal drought and shot 36% in the first half.

DeVoe's two free throws pulled the Tigers to 78-74 with 14 seconds left, but the Jayhawks were able to hang on.\n\nMalik Newman scored 17 points to lead Kansas, Devonte Graham added 16 and Udoka Azubuike had 14 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out with 2:30 left.\n\nDeVoe finished with a career-high 31 points.",

                "body": "Hundreds of California protesters shut down freeways and marched in the state capital after police fatally shot an unarmed black father in his grandparents' backyard, firing 20 rounds into the 22-year-old who was only carrying a cellphone.\n\nSacramento demonstrators shouting \"Shut it down\" disrupted rush-hour traffic on Thursday night and blocked thousands of NBA fans from entering the Sacramento Kings arena to protest the killing of Stephon Clark, who was shot in his family's home on Sunday after police wrongly assumed he was armed with a gun.\n\nThe protests erupted as body-camera and helicopter videos of officers firing bullets into Clark went viral, with his death sparking comparisons to other high-profile cases of US police killing unarmed black people, including Tamir Rice, Walter Scott and Oscar Grant.\n\nThe Sacramento police department said officers were responding to reports of a man breaking into vehicles, but Clark's relatives told reporters he was likely trying to enter the house through the garage since the house's front doorbell was broken.\n\nOn the video, one of the officers is heard yelling, \"Gun, gun, gun\". Police officials initially told local media that Clark was found with a \"tool bar\" on him, but later clarified that he was only holding a phone.\n\nOn Thursday, the game between the Kings and Atlanta Hawks was played before about 2,000 fans in the 17,000-seat arena. The protesters eventually dispersed, and no arrests were made.\n\nAfter the game, Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé addressed the small crowd from center court, surrounded by Sacramento's players and coaches, and expressed sympathy for Clark's family.\n\n\"We are so very sorry for your loss,\" Ranadive said. \"We at the Kings recognize people's abilities to protest peacefully and we respect that. We here at the Kings realize that we have a big platform. It's a privilege but it's also a responsibility. It's a responsibility that we take very seriously and we stand here before you, old, young, black, white, brown, and we are all united in our commitment.\"\n\n\"We are at a place of deep pain\" because of recent violence directed at black people in Sacramento and elsewhere, said the Reverend Les Simmons, a community leader who joined the protest.\n\nClinton Primm, who was friends with Clark, a father of two sons ages one and three, said: \"He was a great dad. He loved both of them to death.\"\n\nHundreds continued to march in the state's capital on Friday.\n\nSacramento's mayor Darrell Steinberg said he was horrified by Clark's death but wouldn't second-guess the \"split-second decisions\" of the officers.\n\nIndependent experts said the footage from body cameras and the police helicopter raised more questions than they answer.\n\nGeoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina and an expert on police use of force, said the officers may have a tough time explaining why they jumped to the conclusion that Clark had a gun.\n\nHe also questioned why an arriving backup officer had the two original officers turn off the microphones on their body cameras, eliminating what he called \"important evidence\".\n\nIn an ideal world, the two officers should have immediately provided first aid instead of waiting five minutes for backup, added Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nSalena Manni, Clark's girlfriend and the mother of his children, told the Sacramento Bee earlier in the week that the family was struggling to process the tragedy.\n\n\"They're asking, 'Where's Daddy, where's Daddy?'\" she said. \"He was our rock.\"\n\nStevante Clark described his brother Stephon as an outgoing person who was dedicated to his children, in a local television interview: \"He was a people person who everybody wanted to be around. We came from underprivileged, broken homes, but he didn't care about nothing else but his kids.\"",

The district has about 2,700 students at three elementary schools, a middle school and a high school.\n\nStaff and students in the Blue Mountain district have been trained in a program called \"ALICE\" which stands for alert, lockdown, inform, counter and evacuate. Helsel said the rocks are part of the \"counter\" portion of training, fighting back if the intruder makes his way into the classroom.\n\nThe buckets are kept in classroom closets.\n\nKenneth Trump, president of the Cleveland-based National School Safety and Security Services, a K-12 security consulting firm,said the idea was illogical and irrational and could possibly cost lives.\n\nHe said the efforts filled an emotional security need, but would not actually enhance security.\n\nOne high school senior said he supports the plan, adding that throwing rocks is better than throwing books or pencils.\n\nParents also have been supportive of the measure, which was implemented in the fall.\n\n\"At this point we have to get creative, we have to protect our kids first and foremost,\" parent Dori Bornstein told WNEP-TV. \"Throwing rocks, it's an option.\"\n\nThe move comes after 17 students were killed in Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school last month, in the latest US high school shooting.",

                "body": "Small-time drug dealer had been on authorities' radar for several years as a possible future Islamist radical\n\nThe gunman who police say killed three people in south-west France on Friday before being shot dead was a 25-year-old small-time drug dealer with a history of minor crimes. But Radouane Lakdim, understood to have been a French citizen born in Morocco, eventually drew deeper scrutiny by investigators worried he was at risk of Islamist radicalisation.\n\nIn the summer of 2014 Lakdim, who lived in Carcassonne, was put on a watchlist of people considered possible extremists. \"He was added to the list because of his radicalisation and his links with the Salafist movement\" of ultra-conservative Islamism, said Francois Molins, France's top anti-terror prosecutor.\n\nHe was found guilty of carrying a prohibited weapon in 2011 and later for drug use and refusing a court order in 2015, Molins said. In 2016 then in 2017 he was the subject of an investigation by intelligence services, \"which did not bring to light any sign that would indicate he would carry out a terrorist act\".\n\nBut when entering the Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes on Friday, Lakdim shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is greatest), declared he was ready to die for Syria, and demanded freedom for his \"brothers\" before shooting and killing a client and an employee.\n\nOn Friday night a massive police operation was being carried out at the Ozanam housing estate in Carcassonne where Lakdim lived, not far from the police headquarters where he shot at officers earlier.\n\n\"We're in a state of siege,\" one resident at the scene said by phone as heavily armed and masked officers carried out searches.\n\nFew people were willing to talk to reporters, including a relative reached by telephone who quickly hung up.\n\nThe estate has seen an increase in recent years of the kind of drug-dealing and vandalism that have blighted many poor districts across France.\n\n\"We've been alerting the authorities for a while now, there's dealing, there are guns going around, we hear gunshots,\" one retired woman said.\n\nA man in his 40s said he arrived in Ozanam when he was 14 \"but now, I'm getting my mum out, she's had two of her cars set on fire\".\n\nOthers said it was no worse than other housing estates and there had been no signs of radicalisation with Lakdim or other youths.\n\n\"He wore a beard but he was just a regular kid,\" one neighbour said.\n\n\"He came out twice a day to walk his dog; we were really surprised to learn it was him.\"\n\nLakdim's trajectory appears to have followed a grimly familiar pattern in France over recent years of young men progressing from petty crimes into terrorism, often despite surveillance by the authorities.\n\nSince the January 2015 massacre at the Charlie Hebdo newspaper in Paris by two men claiming allegiance to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, more than 240 people have been killed in jihadist attacks.\n\nAfter attacks on the Stade France and the Bataclan concert hall and nearby bars in November 2015, investigators found that the ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving commando member, had both served time for robbery around 2011.\n\nA string of deadly gun and knife attacks has followed, and the interior minister, Gerard Collomb, has said dozens of others have been thwarted by police as the government steps up anti-terror measures.\n\nIn Carcassonne itself, after months of surveillance police arrested a 22-year-old man in June 2016 on suspicion of planning to target American and Russian tourists.\n\n\"The acts carried out today sadly remind us once more, tragically, that the terrorist threat level on our territory has not lessened,\" Molins said.\n\n\"Now mainly internal, it is first of all the result of radicalised individuals living in our country,\" he said.",

The weather suggests we won't be seeing a repeat of the Round 1, 2017 Ikon Park full house today, but AFLW continues to grow in stature. We'll soon start seeing new teams added to the league, increasing the opportunity for female players but presumably at the cost of a few more teething problems while the competition settles.\n\nWe're 15 minutes away from the bounce at Ikon Park.\n\nThe first meeting of these sides in 2018 saw the Bulldogs win by nine points, set up by a four goal to none second quarter. At the rate the weather is going today I'm not sure we're going to get four goals in total.\n\nNote to AFL executives and spectacle chasers, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Some of us love when footy becomes toil and struggle, but then again some of us are Melbourne fans so what other option do we have?\n\nSnorkel vendors. The Bureau of Meteorology rain radars suggest the showers aren't going anywhere by the time the game starts.\n\nYour teams for today:\n\nWestern Bulldogs\n\nB: Libby Birch, Lauren Spark, Natalie Ferres\n\nHB: Hannah Scott, Tiarna Ernst, Nicole Callinan\n\nC: Ellie Blackburn\n\nHF: Jenna Bruton, Bonnie Toogood, Monique Conti\n\nF: Aisling Utri, Kirsten McLeod, Brooke Lochland\n\nFoll: Aasta O'Connor, Emma Kearney, Kirsty Lamb\n\nInt: Angelique Gogos, Kim Rennie, Bailey Hunt, Hailey Wildes, Deanna Berry\n\nKirsten McLeod replaces Brennan.

Bulldogs to win by five points.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our coverage of the 2018 AFLW Grand Final. From 12:30 Melbourne time, we'll find out if the Brisbane Lions can avenge last year's Grand Final disappointment, or whether the minor premier Western Bulldogs will capture their first title.\n\nAs they used to say on TV, \"it's been a big week in football.\" The headline act was, of course, Katie Brennan's suspension and subsequent failed appeal. In a new twist on the time honoured Grand Final week suspension controversy, the case ended up heading for the Australian Human Rights Commission.\n\nThe findings of the commission will come too late for Brennan, who will sit on the sidelines while her team does battle today. At least she'll be dry, after several rain-free weeks across Melbourne the weather this morning is strictly for the ducks. A soggy game will hold no fears for the Lions, having splashed through a narrow win against Fremantle in Round 4.\n\nElsewhere, there was controversy over the location of the Grand Final, with the league opting for Ikon Park (or Princes Park if you prefer) over the MCG or Etihad Stadium. Ironically, the ground that came under fire earlier in the season for not having a professional standard of lighting for night games will end up hosting a day Grand Final in dark and stormy conditions.\n\nAnd while everyone was fixated on the Brennan case and the Grand Final build-up, Carlton quietly became the first club to part ways with their senior coach. Damien Keeping became Damien Letting Go after his side dropped their last five games of the season.\n\nSpeaking of the wooden spooners, perhaps inappropriately on a day where we celebrate the best in the competition, star player Tayla Harris engaged in Twitter biff with an independent women's footy website that mysteriously shut up shop two days later.\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, on the morning of the competition's biggest game Fairfax Media is reporting that the AFL is hell bent on changing the rules of the women's game to artificially enhance spectacle.\n\nNext year the Grand Final will probably be played five-a-side inside a squash court, so let's try and enjoy this one for what it is - two teams thumping the suitcase out of each other in the wet to win the ultimate prize.\n\nAdam will be here shortly. In the meantime, here's Kate O'Halloran's preview of today's match:",

In recent days thousands of people have fled through Russian-created \"humanitarian corridors\", but tens of thousands remain.\n\nStrahan called for all sides in the conflict to seek a political solution as quickly as possible, \"without which, the suffering will continue\".\n\nThe Russian Federation, not a member of the Human Rights Council, suggested amendments to the council's statement on Syria, which softened condemnation of the regime and sheeted home blame for the violence to \"terrorists in the Syrian Arab Republic\", including Islamic State and the Al-Nusrah Front. The US said Russia's last-minute amendments \"make a mockery\" of council processes.\n\n\"Australia opposes the amendments submitted by the Russian Federation,\" Strahan told the council. \"We are concerned that these amendments will weaken this important text.\"\n\nDaniel Webb from the Human Rights Law Centre, an observer to the Human Rights Council session, said Australia was at the forefront of the push to defeat the Russian amendments.\n\n\"Victims of cruelty and injustice all over the world need governments like ours to form part of the UN's principled spine. This kind of action and straight-talking is vital.\"\n\nWebb said Australia's firm position on human rights must extend to its own region as well.\n\n\"As well as rightly and strongly criticising far-away regimes, our government must also be prepared to speak some hard truths to its neighbours.\"\n\nIn recent days at the council session, Australia said it was concerned by Cambodia's repression of political dissent, and by increasing hate speech and violent attacks against religious minorities in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe lead-up to July's election in Cambodia has been marred by increasing political violence, the dissolution of the main opposition party, and the jailing of its leader on spurious charges of treason.\n\n\"We continue to be deeply concerned by the narrowing of the democratic space in Cambodia through actions that restrict opposition parties, civil society and the media,\" Strahan said.\n\n\"It is troubling that the leader of the now-dissolved main opposition, Kem Sokha, remains in detention. The February 2018 Constitutional amendments and the new lèse majesté provision further undermine human rights in Cambodia.\"\n\nThe Cambodian leader, Hun Sen, visited Sydney last weekend, and met the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as part of the Asean-Australia summit. Hun Sen's presence in Australia drew significant protests.",

Tributes poured in on social media for the award-winning author who penned a series of historical thrillers set in Germany during the second world war and cold war.\n\nThe author Ian Rankin tweeted: \"Numbed by the news that Philip Kerr has died. His Bernie Gunther novels are extraordinary, a mix of great storytelling and brilliant research, with a believable (a)moral hero.\"\n\nKerr, who wrote more than 30 books, including 12 Bernie Gunther novels as well as standalone thrillers and non-fiction, was married to fellow novelist Jane Thynne, with whom he had three children.\n\nHis wife wrote on Twitter: \"RIP beloved Philip Kerr. Creator of the wonderful #BernieGunther. Genius writer and adored father and husband. 1956-2018.\"\n\nKerr's publisher Quercus Books said: \"We are very sad to have lost Philip Kerr today, a wonderful man and a great author. We are thinking of @janethynne and all his family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.\"\n\nEdinburgh-born Kerr studies law at university before working as a copywriter at a number of advertising agencies including Saatchi & Saatchi. He is said to have spent much of his time in the job researching an idea for a book about a Berlin-based policeman.\n\nFollowing several trips to Germany his first novel, March Violets, was published in 1989 and Bernie Gunther was born. .\n\nKerr went on to trace the career of the tough-talking detective from 1930s Berlin through the horrors of the Third Reich, into the post-war era and to the cold war.\n\nHe also wrote the Scott Mason novels and a number children's books under the name P B Kerr including the Children of the Lamp series.",

While this six-year-old is close to the top of the weights, he has come down 7lb from the peak rating he had at the end of 2016 and would be nicely treated if Ralph Beckett has got him going in the right direction again.\n\nA fine third in the Hunt Cup that year, Mitchum Swagger goes well when there is juice in the ground and is very fairly priced at 16-1. Beckett won the first Group Three of the European season in France last weekend.\n\nThere is nothing much wrong with Fire Brigade, except the shortness of his odds, which take scant account of the fact that there will be 21 useful animals trying to beat him.\n\n1.50 Doncaster Three handicaps in Dubai have not shown Danzeno in an especially good light over the past two months but at least he will be sharper for the experience and he might be the value in this Listed contest. Soft ground is a help to this slow-starting veteran, as it gives him half a chance to catch up and he was third in a Group One on Champions Day with some give, back in 2015.\n\n2.05 Newbury The Devon National stretched Thomas Patrick's stamina too far but he could go in again back at this distance, with Tom Lacey's yard seemingly in peak form.\n\n2.25 Doncaster Still on a beatable mark at her best, Seduce Me appears to thrive in the mud and she comes from the Karl Burke yard that has been getting some winners. Cymraeg Bounty is a fascinating contender, having joined Olly Murphy and had a hood fitted, but this is a big ask on his first start since August 2016.\n\n2.40 Newbury Oistrakh Le Noir would be the obvious one but he is a short price and his yard is going cold again. The unexposed Ulysses is an interesting alternative with Richard Johnson booked.\n\n3.00 Doncaster Unbeaten in his first three starts last year, Zabeel Prince probably found his final outing at Ascot came too soon after his York win eight days earlier. Described as \"a big baby\" by connections then, he can show his progress by taking this Listed prize at the expense of Tabarrak, who has less scope for improvement.\n\n3.15 Newbury A few of these have no secrets from the handicapper but Kalahari Queen should have more to offer, having bolted up at Exeter last time.",

                "body": "Gareth Southgate believes a new generation of England players are shedding the fear factor that has so undermined progress at recent major tournaments, with his willingness to allow them to express themselves ensuring they now enjoy representing the national side.\n\nEngland won their first away game against the Netherlands since 1969 courtesy of Jesse Lingard's goal just before the hour mark, and have now achieved five clean sheets in succession. Southgate, who will wait on news over the fitness of Joe Gomez and Harry Maguire before Tuesday's game against Italy after both limped away from this victory, praised his players' versatility after surprisingly asking Kyle Walker to fill in at centre-half.\n\n\"We deserved the win, and it was a well-taken goal started by our goalkeeper,\" said the England manager. \"I was really pleased with the quality of our football. The tactical awareness the players showed ... for me, there were lots of individual positives and the most pleasing thing is the players enjoyed their football tonight. They enjoyed having the ball. I was really pleased to see that.\n\n\"We have a different type of player coming through our academies compared to the past, in terms of their ability to play as we did tonight. We want them to express themselves, to play with that freedom. They are capable of playing in a really composed way, which they showed. They think about the angles - some of the angles the back players made were outstanding - and they're intelligent footballers.\n\n\"I should not be inhibiting the way they play. There were a couple of moments when I was thinking, woah what are you doing, but they have absolute belief in their ability. They will concede possession sometimes, for sure, but I am enjoying watching them play at the moment.\"\n\nSouthgate singled out Jordan Pickford, Raheem Sterling and Maguire for particular praise, but also suggested Jordan Henderson's display as captain had caught his eye as he considers who will wear the armband in the summer's World Cup. \"We know about all the leaders in the group,\" he said. \"With Jordan, obviously he's one of the few guys who captains his club. Or has captained his club. He's comfortable in that role. He's comfortable to speak up for the group. He has a mindset for the collective, not the self. That's a hugely important attribute for a captain to have.\n\n\"He worked the game out very well today, spotted the tactical changes the Dutch made in switching their system three times, speaking to others and telling them where to press. He's got some tremendous human qualities and is a certain leader of men.\"\n\nThe only disheartening aspect of the evening was news of at least 90 arrests of England fans in Amsterdam over the course of the day, with the Dutch national anthem booed prior to kick-off. \"I heard some of the booing which isn't acceptable,\" added Southgate. \"The rest ... it's not something I want to hear. Our players have represented their country really well tonight, with pride and some style. Anything that takes away from that performance would be a great shame.\"",

People living in areas likely to be affected by this flooding should take measures to protect their property as much as possible and be prepared to help their neighbours.\"\n\nQueensland's emergency services commissioner, Katarina Carroll, said rapid response teams were being assembled in preparation, including swift-water rescue specialists stationed along the Gulf and up the western coast of the cape.\n\n\"These crews will have the ability to fly into any area requiring assistance within four hours of being notified and will be self-sustaining for 48 hours,\" she said on Friday.\n\nAn initital flood watch was in place for coastal catchments between Townsville and Cape Tribulation and for the Gulf rivers and Cape York Peninsula.\n\nThe bureau said recent monsoon activity had \"primed\" catchment areas for river level rises, and some communities could find themselves cut off.\n\nThe forecast winds were strong enough to cause roof and structural damage if Nora hit a populated area.\n\nNo cyclone has crossed the coast in the forecast area since 2001, but the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she was happy with the preparations.\n\nState Emergency Services personnel and extra police had been deployed to remote communities, and Palaszczuk said regional mayors would be updated every three hours.\n\nSchools could be closed next week, she said, after a meeting with the disaster management committee on Friday afternoon.\n\nThis year's cyclone season has been particularly active.\n\nOn Saturday, another cyclone, named Iris, formed near the Solomon Islands. Iris was a category one, but was predicted to increase to a category two.\n\nLast week, the category two cyclone Marcus hit the city of Darwin, bringing down hundreds of trees and power lines, damaging homes and buildings , and cutting off electricity and water, in the most damaging event in 30 years.\n\nMarcus moved across the top of Australia and out to the Indian Ocean where it intensified to an enormous category five storm, with wind gusts up to 325km/h. It was the strongest storm to form in Australian waters in more than a decade. It has since diminished to a category three and is expected to weaken as it approaches the WA coast.",

                "title": "Gareth's Southgate gamble pays off and increases options for main event | Dominic Fifield",
                "body": "Gareth Southgate departed the Netherlands warmed by the positives. England were far better than a dismal Dutch side - a team more in trauma than transition, and one who will endure a summer off - with the visitors solid, well-drilled and committed, just as they had been in the late autumn against Germany and Brazil.\n\nThey have achieved five clean sheets in succession, but there was a pleasing fluidity to the attacking approach play, too, with the emphasis always forward-thinking. Jesse Lingard's winning goal just before the hour allayed fears this team are rendered painfully blunt in the absence of Harry Kane.\n\nAs causes for optimism the management could point to the authoritative display offered up by Jordan Henderson, captain for the night, and the excellence of Jordan Pickford in goal, or even the slippery running of their match-winner in tandem with Raheem Sterling. A first win over these opponents since Euro 96, for all that the whole occasion served more to underline the decline of the Netherlands team in recent times, is not to be sniffed at.\n\nEven the coaching staff's apparently wackier ideas, such as playing Kyle Walker in a back three despite the original 27-man squad having been loaded with centre-backs, are coming off. The Manchester City full-back was excellent, eager in possession and shrewd in his reading of the game, even if that display, too, probably deserves some context. Nullifying the fitful threat posed by Sporting Lisbon's Bas Dost, a striker who now boasts one goal in 18 games at this level, was never likely to prove a particularly stern test.\n\nAs Southgate pointed out post-match, Walker is naturally comfortable on the ball, regularly tucks inside at City, \"and the added bonus is his relationship with John [Stones], where you could see the positions he took up and the belief they had in each other on the ball. I'm pleased if it surprised people but, for me, it wasn't a difficult decision\".\n\nAnd therein lies the real reason for positivity. At times it is not immediately clear from the outside looking in just what the masterplan is supposed to be. England have 270 minutes of football before colliding with Tunisia in Volgograd at the World Cup proper and at first glance Southgate is still very much in experimental mode for all his regular assertions that if everyone is fit and firing, his first-choice side for the tournament would trip off the tongue. And yet, behind the scenes, there is clearly a level of clarity. The manager's logic is clear to the players. There is a strategy being played out. And that is really all that matters.\n\nWalker's galloping incision of old may have been missed down the right, where Kieran Trippier was not at his marauding best, but he still looked comfortable in a back three, just as Southgate envisaged he would. Even the regular chopping and changing of personnel around him hardly seemed to discomfort.\n\nJoe Gomez came and went, crocked by an awkward fall on his left ankle inside the opening five minutes and replaced in the 10th. Harry Maguire excelled as his replacement on the left of the trio until he, too, hobbled off near the end with a tight hamstring and Eric Dier joined the fray. Admittedly both Alfie Mawson and James Tarkowski would have hoped for more as regular centre-backs seeking a first cap, and Gary Cahill must have been cursing back at home, but the changes ended up fully justified.\n\nThe squad's adaptability will be an asset in Russia, the players' versatility offering the manager a chance to bolster weaker areas if he feels he has personnel capable of filling in where he might otherwise be better stocked. Walker can now be considered one such asset. Dier's ability in defence and midfield was already clear.\n\n\"Sometimes you go to a World Cup taking two players for every position, but I don't want to take six centre-backs,\" said Southgate. \"So if we have people like Kyle and Eric who can slot in if necessary, it may allow us to take more attacking players.\" That, too, seems perfectly reasonable.\n\nA truer test of the quality of this collective will come in the form of cannier opponents on Tuesday even if Italy, too, will be licking their wounds in absentia this summer. The Azzurri will be sterner opponents to prise apart, and the majority at Wembley may go through lengthy periods pining for Kane. But, already, Southgate will feel his group have gained from their involvement in this international window.\n\n\"Holland changed system three times tonight and each time the players responded and identified it, managing to make use of the overloads we had in the right areas,\" he added. \"I knew we had pace and energy, but I was really pleased with the composure in the first two thirds of the pitch.\"\n\nQuietly and efficiently, progress is being made.",

                "body": "The American or Azeri looks most likely to win the €95,000 first prize and a chance to face Magnus Carlsen for the world title\n\nThe world championship candidates tournament in Berlin is about to reach its climax. Fabiano Caruana and Shak Mamedyarov have been the front runners most of the way, so the American and the Azeri will try to hold off any late challenges as they continue their race into the last lap for the €95,000 first prize and the right to challenge Magnus Carlsen for the Norwegian's world crown in London in November.\n\nAfter 11 of the 14 rounds Caruana (US) led with 6.5 points, ahead of Mamedyarov (Azerbaijan) 6, Alexander Grischuk and Sergey Karjakin (both Russia) 5.5.\n\nAll the games of rounds 12-14 can be viewed online, free and live with grandmaster and computer move-by-move commentaries, starting at 2pm on Saturday and at 3pm on Monday and Tuesday. Sunday is a rest day. In a key round 12 pairing on Saturday, Karjakin plays White against Caruana.\n\nFor several rounds now Caruana has had a slender half-point lead but the 25-year-old missed a great chance to extend it to a full point when he patiently built a winning endgame against Ding Liren in Tuesday's ninth round, only to miss a subtle win right at the end, shown in this week's puzzle. China's first ever candidate thus continued his solid debut, drawing his ninth straight game.\n\nThe tragic figure in the drama has been Vlad Kramnik. The 42-year-old Russian, who won the world title from Garry Kasparov and held it for seven years, has long believed he could outplay Carlsen in a match. Kramnik defeated the tournament favourite Levon Aronian in a brilliant game given here last week and took the third-round lead but then completely lost his objectivity, began to play in a risky style and plummeted down the tournament table from 2.5/3 to 3.5/9. He fought back in round 10 by again beating Aronian but the damage was done.\n\nIt remains unclear yet who will be the big winner from Berlin but Kramnik and Aronian are the obvious losers.\n\nMeanwhile there is a potentially significant change at the top of English chess. Michael Adams has been the No 1 with hardly a break since the mid-1990s, but the Cornishman is now aged 46, and it is frequent, even normal, for chess players of all levels to experience a dip in form during their 40s. General slowing down, diminished concentration and stamina for long games, a decline in motivation, take your pick.\n\nUntil 2017 Adams's world rating was close to his all-time peak, and he was firmly established in the world top 20. Then at the end of the year he struggled against the global elite in the London Classic, while so far in 2018 he has shed rating points at Tradewise Gibraltar and for Baden-Baden in the German Bundesliga. Paradoxically he is unbeaten in 18 games, but 13 of those have been draws, many against weaker opposition. His Fide world rating has dropped from the 2740s to barely above 2700.\n\nDavid Howell has taken advantage. The 27-year-old from Seaford, Sussex, is a three-time British champion, although his ceiling in international play has been the world top 50 and the elite 2700 rating. Two weeks ago Howell scored a key Bundesliga win to go ahead of Adams in the live ratings, and stayed just in front after last week's 4NCL games. Mishandling his clock time has been Howell's besetting weakness. Now he has an incentive to overcome it, the chance to collect some of the tournament invitations which flow to a national No 1.\n\nAt his best, Howell has a clear understanding of active strategic chess as in this week's game. Black's 15...dxc4? (15...Ng4 16 e3 Qb6 gives counterplay and keeps Back's pawn structure intact) led to 16 b4! after which White swapped queens, targeted and won the weak c6 pawn, and established a winning passed a6 pawn, all within a dozen moves.\n\nDavid Howell v Conor Murphy, 4NCL 2018\n\n1 Nf3 d5 2 c4 e6 3 g3 Nf6 4 Bg2 Be7 5 d4 0-0 6 Qc2 c5 7 0-0 cxd4 8 Nxd4 Nc6 9 Nxc6 Bxc6 10 Rd1 Qb6 11 Be3 Bc5 12 Bxc5 Qxc5 13 Nd2 Rb8 14 Rac1 Ba6 15 a3 dxc4? 16 b4!

                "body": "Captain heads two goals in stoppage time to steal victory for Portugal over Egypt, and Colombia come from two down to defeat France 3-2\n\nPortugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo scored two stoppage-time goals to steal a 2-1 win over Egypt after Mohamed Salah had given the African side the lead in an entertaining World Cup warm-up in Switzerland on Friday. Salah scored with a thumping drive to put Egypt ahead early in the second half.\n\nHowever, Ronaldo refused to be upstaged and he sneaked in behind his marker to head in Ricardo Quaresma's cross in the 92nd minute. Not content with that, Ronaldo scored again with another header, once more from a Quaresma pass, with the final move of the game. There was initial confusion as they referee consulted the video assistant referee (VAR) system for a possible offside before allowing the goal.\n\nFrance threw away a two-goal lead as they slumped to a 3-2 home defeat to Colombia in a friendly at the Stade de France. Les Bleus were 2-0 up midway through the first half thanks to goals by Olivier Giroud and Thomas Lemar, but Luis Muriel halved the deficit before the break with Radamel Falcao and Juan Quintero scoring in the second half.\n\nBefore kick-off, there was a minute's silence in memory of the three people who were killed in south-western France by a gunman who held up a car, fired on police and seized hostages in a supermarket earlier on Friday. France started with N'Golo Kanté and Blaise Matuidi as holding midfielders. Paul Pogba was left on the bench because of a muscle problem and a lack of playing time at Manchester United, according to the assistant coach Guy Stéphan. Pogba came on as a second-half substitute but made little impact.\n\nLes Bleus enjoyed most of the possession and they were rewarded in the 11th minute when Giroud scored his 30th international goal as he knocked the ball in after David Ospina mishandled Lucas Digne's cross from the left. It was Giroud's ninth goal in the last nine games he has started for France. Lemar made it 2-0 in the 26th from inside the box after being set up by his former Monaco team-mate Kylian Mbappé, who had collected a fine back-heel from Antoine Griezmann.\n\nBut France lacked focus and two minutes later, Hugo Lloris misjudged Muriel's cross, which found the back of the net at the far post. The visitors were more active in the second half and Falcao beat Lloris in the 62nd minute as he latched onto a cross from James Rodríguez. Colombia sealed the win five minutes from time when Quintero converted a penalty after a Samuel Umtiti foul in the box.\n\nChelsea's Victor Moses converted a second-half penalty to secure a 1-0 win for Nigeria away to Poland as both teams warmed up for the World Cup. Moses stroked the ball home from the spot in the 61st minute after winning a fortuitous-looking penalty from the English referee Michael Oliver as the Nigerian took a tumble in the area after marginal contact with defender Marcin Kaminski.\n\nPoland had a strong claim for a goal just before half-time when a sweeping Grzegorz Krychowiak free-kick looked to have crossed the goal-line before being cleared by Leon Balogun but the linesman ruled that the ball had not gone in. Nigeria's teenage goalkeeper Francis Uzoho made a key save early in the second half to deny the Poland captain Robert Lewandowski.\n\nThe win for Nigeria keeps up their run of positive results since they qualified for the World Cup. In their last friendly in Russia in November, they beat Argentina 4-2. Poland face Senegal, Colombia and Japan in Group H at the finals, while Nigeria take on Croatia, Iceland and Argentina.",

Considering it's his debut and he's 19 years of age, it was an impressive performance from an impressive young man.\"\n\nLondoner Rice, who has indicated he is ready to opt for Ireland rather than England, took his introduction to international football in his stride.\n\nHe said: \"I think there is something in me. I'm composed and I'm a calm player. You're only out there for 90 minutes and you have to give it everything you've got. It's a game of football at the end of the day.\n\n\"I'm only 19, but I've had good experiences with West Ham this year and I've tried to take that onto international level tonight. I thought I did well for only being 19 years old on the international scene. I was proud of myself and thought I performed well.\"\n\nHakan Calhanoglu and the Turkey captain, Topal, sent long-range efforts high and wide as Colin Doyle, winning his second Ireland cap 10 years and 304 days after his first, was largely untroubled in goal despite the pressure.\n\nIndeed the visitors might have taken an 18th-minute lead when Hogan ran on to Jeff Hendrick's pass and rounded Volkan Babacan, only to fire into the side-netting.\n\nTurkey needed only seven minutes of the second half to go ahead when Calhanoglu and Yusuf Yazici worked a short corner and the latter crossed for Topal to volley home from close range.\n\nMaguire and James McClean started to come to the fore as the Republic made their presence felt, although Doyle needed two attempts to claim Calhanoglu's skidding 67th-minute effort with Turkey in the driving seat.\n\nO'Neill shuffled his pack after an hour, handing McClean a more accustomed midfield role and he almost made an impact with 15 minutes remaining when he broke free down the left and fired in a dangerous cross that was thumped away by Okay Yokuslu.",

                "body": "The champions Exeter moved 11 points clear at the top of the Premiership after Joe Simmonds' late penalty thwarted Bath 20-18.\n\nThe young fly-half booted half of his team's points, while his older brother - the England No 8 Sam - scored a try, along with the Chiefs lock Jonny Hill.\n\nBath looked to have done enough for a crucial victory in their play-off push when the Wales international fly-half Rhys Priestland, making his first appearance after injury for two months, converted the replacement Paul Grant's try 13 minutes from time. Bath had trailed by 11 points 15 minutes earlier, yet they displayed deep reserves of character and commitment to fight back, with Matt Banahan claiming a well-worked try and Freddie Burns kicking two penalties. But ultimately they were denied and even a losing bonus left them four points behind fourth-placed Newcastle and games beginning to run out.\n\nThe England head coach, Eddie Jones, looked on as Exeter quickly moved into their impressive close-quarter driving game, which created a platform for Simmonds to kick them ahead through a sixth-minute penalty.\n\nBath struggled to get going and could find no answer to Exeter's sustained intensity, with the Chiefs proving masters at keeping possession.\n\nSimmonds sacrificed a kickable penalty to turn the screw by finding touch inside Bath's 22, and the home side could not escape as the Chiefs patiently put together phase after phase in pursuit of an opening try. And it duly arrived after 23 minutes as a dominant Exeter pack laid siege to Bath's line and Hill claimed a try that the referee, Wayne Barnes, awarded following confirmation from the television match official, Rowan Kitt.\n\nSimmonds added the conversion to open up a 10-point lead, but Bath then enjoyed the best spell of their half, securing a period of territory and keeping Exeter pinned back, even if some of their attacking play was laboured.\n\nTwo Burns penalties in nine minutes cut the gap, though, and Exeter trooped off at half-time with only a 10-6 lead, having seen Bath rewarded for some overdue front-foot rugby led by number eight Taulupe Faletau and flanker Matt Garvey. But Bath were immediately rocked back during a punishing opening nine minutes of the second period as Exeter went through 24 phases of play inside the home 22 before Sam Simmonds touched down from close range and Joe Simmonds converted.\n\nExeter's heavy-duty approach had to take a toll and they led by 11 points with 30 minutes of the contest remaining. Bath had to respond quickly and Burns obliged by sending a pinpoint kick rolling into Exeter's 22 for Banahan to capitalise on by grasping a kind bounce and putting his team back into contention.\n\nThe score lifted Bath's game across the board, and Exeter and, despite Rob Baxter making several changes off the bench, Exeter could not initially respond as Taulupe Faletau's sharp midfield break ended in a 67th-minute scoring pass to Grant.\n\nPriestland's conversion edged Bath ahead but Exeter then laid siege to the opposition 22 once more and Simmonds' late penalty clinched it.",

                "body": "Castleford held on to resist a remarkable comeback from the Super League champions, Leeds Rhinos, for their fourth successive victory - with Luke Gale's 40th-minute drop goal ultimately the difference as the Tigers won the first meeting between the sides since last October's Grand Final.\n\nThe most anticipated match of the season to date did not disappoint. Leeds had set an ambitious target of breaking the all-time crowd figure for a regular-season Super League game here, set in 2005 when 24,005 watched Wigan play St Helens at the DW Stadium. While the final figure fell just short of that total, Leeds were able to register their own highest attendance in Super League history, with 23,246 watching the best game of the campaign thus far.\n\nCastleford began superbly, scoring 24 unanswered points in a blistering 20-minute spell. They started the scoring when Gale kicked on for his half-back partner, Jamie Ellis, to touch down, and then doubled the lead in incredible fashion when a width-of-the-field play was finished by James Clare - before further tries from Alex Foster and Junior Moors made it 24-0.\n\nBut how Leeds responded. Their revival was inspired by two players at the opposite ends of their careers: in the pack, the outstanding Jamie Jones-Buchanan produced another all-action 80-minute display, and at full-back off the bench, Jack Walker further enhanced his reputation. The fact that Leeds did not concede another try once Walker had emerged on to the field epitomised the impact he had on their fortunes.\n\nThe comeback began when the captain, Kallum Watkins, finished magnificently from a towering Richie Myler kick, before a second try from Ash Handley further reduced the deficit. Leeds were suddenly on top, but Gale's drop goal on the hooter, the only point Castleford scored in the final 55 minutes, stretched the lead back out to 15.\n\nLeeds' cause did not appear to be helped when the forward, Brad Singleton, was sent to the sin bin. But even without him the Rhinos clawed back the deficit further when Handley scored his second. Watkins soon followed suit with 10 minutes left, before Ryan Hall reduced the gap to a solitary point with a wonderful finish. Agonisingly, though, Watkins pushed the decisive conversion wide and, somehow, Castleford held on.\n\nElsewhere, a hat-trick from the wing, Tom Lineham, helped Warrington beat Wakefield 32-34, their second consecutive victory in Super League. The Wolves trailed at half-time against a Wakefield side looking for their fifth win in six games, before tries from Mike Cooper and Ben Murdoch-Masila secured victory.\n\nCatalans remain bottom of Super League heading into the Easter period following their sixth defeat in seven games. The Dragons were beaten 42-16 at Hull, the Black and Whites scoring seven tries to Catalans' two as they ran out comfortable winners ahead of the first Hull derby of the season next Friday.\n\nSt Helens continue to set the pace at the top of the table heading into Easter, following a comfortable 30-6 victory over Hull KR. Wigan remain in second after a comprehensive victory over Huddersfield, who remain in the bottom four.",

                "body": "* Banega and Lanzini on target for 2014 World Cup finalists\n\n* Messi on the bench for Argentina but failed to appear on the pitch\n\nLionel Messi watched from the stands as Argentina began their World Cup build-up with a lacklustre 2-0 win over Italy at the Etihad Stadium. Ever Banega and Manuel Lanzini both struck in the latter stages to put some gloss on an otherwise underwhelming performance.\n\nMessi, the chief attraction for the majority in attendance at Manchester City's half-full stadium, did not feature and sat up high alongside another missing attraction in the injured Sergio Agüero.\n\nThe game did liven up in the second half, but neither side over-exerted themselves.\n\nItaly, looking to rebuild after their failure to qualify for Russia 2018 and in the interim care of Luigi Di Biagio, threatened only in flashes and their best player was arguably the veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon.\n\nThose present included Wayne Rooney but the atmosphere was deflated before kick-off when it was announced Messi was not in the starting line-up. The five-time world player of the year was named among 13 substitutes but unbeknown to many in the stadium, there was no chance of him featuring.\n\nCity fans instead had to make do with the presence of Nicolás Otamendi in the Argentina defence, while behind him the former City back-up goalkeeper Willy Caballero made his international debut.\n\nOtamendi had one of the first serious chances of the game, heading straight at Buffon, who was winning his 176th cap after reversing a decision to retire from international football. Ángel Di María also shot at the Juventus No1 in a lively start, but that pace soon dropped.\n\nThe rest of the first half was played at a crawl, with Argentina creating opportunities before the interval for Leandro Paredes, Nicolás Tagliafico and Gonzalo Higuaín all the crowd had to cheer. The latter two were saved by Buffon, the 40-year-old backing up his claims he is still the best man for the job despite calls for him to stand aside.\n\nLorenzo Insigne sliced wide for Italy when he should have scored early in the second half, and Lanzini headed over for Argentina.\n\nIt was not long before the crowd began to entertain themselves with Mexican waves which briefly lifted the atmosphere, but the chants for Messi to come on were wasted.\n\nCaballero boosted his World Cup chances with good saves from Antonio Candreva and Insigne before Banega struck with a sweet left-foot shot after 75 minutes. Lanzini then beat Buffon with a fine curling effort to wrap up victory 10 minutes later.\n\nWhile 20-year-olds Federico Chiesa and Patrick Cutrone made their debuts for Italy, much of Di Biagio's lineup consisted of veterans held over from the qualifying campaign.\n\nDuring the singing of the national anthems, each member of Italy's squad wore the No 13 shirt of the Fiorentina defender Davide Astori, who was found dead in his hotel room this month after a suspected cardiac arrest. They also wore black armbands and a moment of silence was observed in their former national team-mate's memory before kick-off.\n\nArgentina face Spain in Madrid on Tuesday at Atlético Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano while Italy will face England at Wembley.",

But the Wales manager does not believe the forward - who this week became his country's leading scorer - should leave the Bernabéu.\n\n\"It's Real Madrid - there are only a handful of clubs who have got that aura,\" Giggs said. \"Of course you would want to stay there. What's Gareth won, three Champions League titles? The proof is in that. When you are at clubs like that, you are always going to win things. Gareth has the ability to score every type of goal and there are similarities with Cristiano Ronaldo. They both started out as wingers and they are now goalscorers.\"\n\nGiggs's spell as Wales manager started with a 6-0 win over China, inspired by a Bale hat-trick, but he acknowledges he has plenty to learn and has said he tried to pick the brains of Chelsea's Antonio Conte and the England rugby union head coach, Eddie Jones. \"I spoke to a lot of managers in the time I was out of the game,\" said Giggs. \"I was busy and always watch other sports. I was in between Conte and Eddie at a charity dinner and I was constantly trying to talk to them. That was a nightmare actually as Eddie was trying to ask me questions about Sir Alex Ferguson and I wanted to get everything out of him.\"\n\nGiggs had four games in interim charge of Manchester United after David Moyes was sacked and found it an enlightening experience.\n\n\"I learned a lot about how lonely it was when I was United manager,\" he said. \"When you shut the door of your office and everyone else has gone home, you're on your own.\n\n\"It's good to have people around and you want those people to be the ones you trust, but it can still be a lonely place. Ultimately you're the boss and you have to make the decisions.\"\n\nAsked where he could get better as a manager, Giggs said: \"I am not a naturally outgoing person. Everything just comes with that little bit of experience.\"\n\nWales will face Uruguay in the China Cup final here on Monday. Uruguay beat the Czech Republic 2-0 on Friday with goals from Luis Suárez and Edinson Cavani.",

                "body": "Canadian follows up Olympic bronze with first world title Osmond is first Canadian woman to win worlds since 1973 Olympic champion Zagitova comes in fifth after three falls\n\nOlympic bronze medalist Kaetlyn Osmond of Canada won the figure skating world title Friday with a nearly perfect performance as Olympic champion Alina Zagitova fell a jaw-dropping three times and crowd favorite Carolina Kostner turned in a lackluster skate - both tumbling completely off the podium.\n\nOsmond, who skated first in the final group, watched with amazement from the sidelines after Zagitova's and Kostner's disastrous programs handed her the title and deprived the two favorites any medals at all. Japan's Wakaba Higuchi finished second and teammate Satoko Miyahara was third.\n\nSkating to a Swan Lake-Black Swan suite, Osmond easily won the long program with 150.50 points for a total score of 223.23. She hit seven triples with only a minor deduction for stepping out of a combination jump, seemingly leaving the door open to either Kostner, who had an eight-point lead after the short program, and the young Russian jumping genius, Zagitova, to battle for the title.\n\nBut Zagitova fell on a straight lutz, missing a combination, then fell again on two subsequent combinations. The 15-year-old waited two minutes to start her jumps, which in theory raises their value, but in this competition she seemed sapped of energy. The crowd rallied behind her in sympathy after the second fall, clapping rhythmically to urge her on.\n\nAll Kostner had to do was skate clean. But her nerves showed when she doubled a triple lutz. And she fell on a triple salchow late in the program. All of her artistic prowess couldn't make up for the errors in what could be her last world championship in her home country no less.\n\nIn the ice dance, Olympic silver medalists Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron of France skated with nary a wardrobe mishap to lead the short program with a season's best performance.\n\nPapadakis wore the same tropical flare dress that came undone during the Olympics - this time with extra safety measures sewed in during a trip to their training home in Montreal.\n\nAnd Cizeron had on his sleeveless muscle shirt as they performed perfectly executed direction-changing spins in unison and quick-moving rhumba steps to Latin dance and a musical medley including Ed Sheeran's ''Shape of You.\"\n\nAfter the opening of her dress made headlines in South Korea, Papadakis said she made sure that it wouldn't ''open in anyway,\"\n\n\"And it didn't,\" she said triumphantly.\n\nThere was something about the Italian ice that brought out the best in the ice dancers, with all top three couples in the short skating season-best performances.\n\nThe French couple, the only Olympic medalists at worlds, had 83.73 points ahead of US couple Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, who pierced the 80-point ceiling for the first time. Canadians Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje finished third with 78.31.\n\n''We wanted to go home from the Olympics and keep improving and really put out an incredible performance,\" Hubbell said, adding that they were especially pleased to have achieved the highest levels for all their elements. ''We really feel we gave our best performance today.\"",

                "body": "Labor's newest federal MP, Ged Kearney, says she will play a role in Labor's national conference in the middle of this year arguing for a more \"humane\" policy on asylum seekers and offshore processing.\n\nIn an interview with Guardian Australia before her arrival in Canberra on Monday, Kearney acknowledged that some people in her Melbourne electorate of Batman - the seat the former ACTU president held for the ALP in last weekend's byelection - would be \"on watch\" as she made the transition from candidate to her new life as a federal parliamentarian.\n\nKearney said her constituents \"will want to see me argue and work within the party for some change [on asylum policy], and that is what I have promised them, and that is what I will do\".\n\n\"I've been clear to people that I may or may not be successful with that, but we are going to work through priorities, and some of those can be achieved,\" Kearney said.\n\n\"I think getting people off Manus and Nauru needs to be a priority, and hopefully if Labor is elected that is something we can actually deliver on.\"\n\n\"With respect to the rest of the policy ... it will be an issue for national conference. I'm yet to really find my way in my new role as a Labor candidate at the national conference. I'm working through that at the moment. But I certainly want to support people who are like minded.\"\n\nAsked to express her position on offshore detention, Kearney said she was now a member of the federal Labor caucus, \"but I ask people to look at my activism in the past to see my views\".\n\n\"I understand I can't change Labor policy right now, but all I can say really is that I will be arguing for a humane policy at conference,\" she said.\n\nKearney prevailed in a hard fought byelection contest against the Greens candidate Alex Bhathal last Saturday, winning a positive two party-preferred swing of over 3%.\n\nThe Greens pressed Labor on asylum throughout the campaign, particularly in the closing stages. Labor left wingers are positioning again to make asylum policy a significant issue at the party's national conference mid-year, which presents a vexed management and political challenge for the Labor leader, Bill Shorten.\n\nEnding offshore processing would help Labor fend off Greens candidates in the inner cities, but it is less helpful in major-party tussles in marginal seats in the outer suburbs.\n\nKearney said she was aware that for some constituents she was \"on notice\".\n\n\"There is a whole constituency who voted Green for a long time, that, for whatever reason saw in me someone they wanted to vote for,\" the new Labor MP said. \"They will be on watch I'm sure and it will be up to me to prove that I am worthy.\n\n\"I think it will be a lot about what I do in the seat and how I bed down what I do in Batman working closely with the people there.\"\n\nShe said while some swinging voters were supporting her provisionally, there were other constituents just pleased to see Labor hold the seat. \"There is the group of people who I think were Labor people at heart, and for whatever reason haven't been able to vote Labor in the last little while, I think they are pleased ... I think they are happy to be voting Labor again.\n\n\"Some people are going to watch me, and some people are going to support me.\"\n\nBefore the byelection, Kearney told voters at a town hall meeting in the electorate that Labor's new policy axing cash dividend imputation credits - a putative shift which has sparked a backlash from seniors groups and the self managed super funds industry - was \"good policy\", but she told retirees at the event there was still time for the ALP to assess its effects.\n\nAsked whether she still held that view, Kearney said Labor would always look after pensioners, and added: \"I'm hopeful there will be announcements closer to a federal election for pensioners. I think there will be announcements that support pensioners and retirees.\"\n\nAsked whether she had any ambition to be on the Labor front bench given her seniority in the trade union movement Kearney said she wouldn't turn down an offer from Bill Shorten, \"but certainly not in the first 12 months\".\n\n\"There is going to be an election within a year. I have to really bed down my credentials as the member for Batman with the people of Batman. That's what I'm going to be focussing on.\n\n\"The way I'm going to tackle Batman is you have to talk to people about things that make a real difference for them. The universal issues were the issues that make a difference in people's lives.\n\n\"Yes there was Adani, yes there are issues around asylum seekers and that is very important, but at the end of the day people wanted to know their kids had a decent school, that they'd be able to get a decent job - and if we as mainstream parties don't start dealing with those issues people won't vote for us.\n\n\"Those are the things I'm going to be focusing on.\"\n\nKearney said she was \"a little bit nervous\" of her relocation to Canberra for parliament next week but she was getting support from colleagues across the board. \"I'm looking forward to next week. I think I'm going to enjoy it.\n\n\"I can adapt pretty quickly and I'll take it as it comes.\"",

He had denied the charges.\n\nHe faces life in prison without parole when he is sentenced on April 18.\n\nSome in New York City's Muslim community called the attack on the two Bangladeshi immigrants a hate crime, but prosecutors said the killer's motive remained unclear.\n\nAfaf Nasher, the executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, released a statement on behalf of the victims' families expressing gratitude for the conviction.\n\n\"Maulana and Thara came to this country in search of a better life, instead they found Mr. Morel's hatred,\" the statement said. \"Nothing can ever replace what Mr Morel took from us, but this verdict helps show that this city will never accept this sort of heartbreaking violence.\"\n\nProsecutors said Morel approached 55-year-old Akonjee and 64-year-old Uddin from behind as they left the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid mosque and shot them both in the head. The victims were rushed to a hospital, where they died.\n\nMorel was arrested the following day after police connected him to a hit-and-run crash near the shooting scene.\n\nProsecutors said the police ballistics lab linked a .38-caliber revolver recovered from Morel's basement to the shootings.",

                "title": "Jennie Briscoe-Hough: We have to give up on the idea of 'what will I get out of it?'",
                "body": "Everyone who comes into the Foundery Cafe on the main street of Port Kembla in New South Wales stops to say hello to Jennifer Briscoe-Hough. She's so involved in every aspect of the hardscrabble community's life, she might as well be its unofficial mayor.\n\nBut politics hold no appeal for her. She's too frank to be a public official and not remotely interested in power. Having once considered and then rejected the idea of running for council, she acknowledges that \"I operate best outside the system.\"\n\nShe prefers to give people the means to make their lives better for themselves and then move on to the next project. Her sense of satisfaction comes from seeing ideas take hold so that they become part of the cultural fabric of the neighbourhood where she lives.\n\nSo far, these have included setting up markets; launching Tender, a not-for-profit funeral home; establishing Culture Bank, a crowdfunded bank that gives out money for artistic endeavours and recently helped to turn a local disused service station into a live music venue.\n\nHer full-time role is general manager of the Port Kembla Community Centre, so she knows the locals well, many of whom bear the brunt of long-term unemployment and disadvantage. Port Kembla people are used to doing it tough, and Briscoe-Hough has made it her mission to give them resilience, agency and dignity.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is that much of what she initiates is also her idea. She spots gaps and goes about filling them. Instinctive rather than strategic, she attributes her sense of purpose to \"not being formally educated. I don't know what I can't do.\"\n\nGrowing up surrounded by the warm, chemical fug of her mother's home hairdressing salon where women gathered not only to get their hair done but to share stories, is where Briscoe-Hough's course was set. \"My mother would have them in their curlers, waiting for their hair to dry, and they'd do the housework for her - everything from the vacuuming to sewing and cooking. The atmosphere was one of sharing, laughter and joy.\"\n\nBriscoe's own infectious enthusiasm along with her fearlessness and ability to step up means she gets things done, even if they aren't always her things. \"If you work in this way, which is very consultative, and organic, you have to accept that you won't always get your own way. For example in establishing Culture Bank to put more arts into people's lives, I would probably fund the edgier, more extreme things that others don't want to back, but I have to accept the will of the majority.\"\n\nFrustrated by long-term grumbling about insufficient culture in the northern Illawarra region, Briscoe-Hough called a public meeting in 2013. After some discussion, she and business partner Lara Seresin came up with an idea that engaged the whole community.\n\nFive years on, Wollongong Culture Bank is a micro-financing initiative in which members pay a modest annual subscription of $120. The funds they raise are then redistributed to artists through a simple grant application system. The system is kept lean, with no red tape and minimal admin.\n\nTo date, with only one very part-time staffer, and relying on word-of-mouth, Culture Bank has 100 members in the area who have raised more than $30,000 in one year which has gone towards local performances, exhibitions and events. There's also been seeding money for the Wollongong Emerging Writers Festival, gigs, film screenings and even a series of specially written poems performed on the local bus network.\n\n\"Whenever we've got about $5,000 in the kitty, we do a call out for applications,\" says Briscoe-Hough. Decisions about who gets Culture Bank funding are made at members' dinners where conversation can get heated before a final vote. Briscoe-Hough loves supporting wild cards and giving them a chance to experiment, no matter how rough and ready their material: ''I don't care about the results, really, I care about the process and taking a chance on someone. I want Culture Bank to show that if you have a dream and you need a bit of money to make it happen, you can. We are too hung up on success and polish. I'm more about just having a go.\"\n\nOne of the unexpected hurdles she faced was the battle to include the word 'bank' in the name of the organisation, which required months of to-ing and fro-ing before final approval was granted by ASIC. But Briscoe-Hough is a fighter. \"I'm naturally rebellious and have no fear of authority,\" she says. \"When I was three, I told my mum 'It's a free world and I'll do what I like.' I was very naughty as a child. When I ran away from home, I took the keys so they could not come looking for me.\"\n\nMany members do not attend the cultural events they have helped support. \"Pure altruism is not attached to outcome,\" says Briscoe-Hough. \"It's not about glory or kudos. It's about the pleasure and satisfaction of giving without expecting something back. We have to give up on the idea of 'What will I get out of it? which turns everything into a commodity.\n\n\"Culture is not a product. I think when you give, you have to do so unconditionally, because the moment you impose terms on a gift, that's known as Indian giving; it diminishes its value and onward energy. Altruism is not a transaction, it's an exchange. It's quieter, more under-the-radar, less showy than a lot of philanthropy.\"\n\nLast year, Briscoe-Hough's boldest venture, the not-for-profit funeral service Tender, held 120 funerals from Wollongong to Sydney and beyond. Recently she secured a $60,000 grant from Create NSW for the funeral home to enable a couple of local artists - a singer/songwriter and a textile artist - to collaborate with grieving families in creating personalised ceremonies for non-traditional funerals.\n\nHer latest project is The Servo, the disused service station transformed into a no-frills bar showcasing live music talent and cabaret, which she initiated together with a group of 12 investor mates.\n\nDespite being in a near-perpetual state of exhaustion, Briscoe-Hough seems to make time for everyone but is stumped when asked about the role ego plays in her drive. \"I don't know,\" she says, momentarily nonplussed. \"I must have one. I think my Achilles heel is that I don't like anyone who feels they are special, I get upset about issues of justice and fairness. We are all special and we are all ordinary.\"",

                "title": "Jesse Lingard strikes as experimental England defeat Netherlands",
                "body": "It is 49 years since England last won in Amsterdam, with Alf Ramsey the manager, Colin Bell scoring the 84th-minute winner and Emlyn Hughes winning his first England cap, so Gareth Southgate and his players are entitled to feel rather pleased with themselves about this result and perhaps it would be slightly impertinent to point out we saw here why this is regarded as the worst Dutch side for many years.\n\nA win against them might not mean what it used to - and the stadium was barely half-full by the final whistle - but England can still reflect on a satisfying evening. Jesse Lingard scored the decisive goal, just before the hour, and they should also have been awarded a penalty in the second half. Jordan Pickford did enough to justify his selection as England's new first-choice goalkeeper and, when the Netherlands can look this poor, it is difficult to be too critical of Southgate's team.\n\nUltimately, though, it is also fair to say that Italy should provide a more realistic gauge of England's World Cup preparations when the two sides meet at Wembley on Tuesday and, even in victory, there are still legitimate questions about the team's structure and planning.\n\nSouthgate started with three players who usually operate as right-backs for their clubs, but without one actually playing as a right-back. Danny Rose's selection in the left wing-back role confirmed Southgate had abandoned his policy of not picking players who were out of favour at their clubs and it would be intriguing to know what Harry Maguire, James Tarkowski and Alfie Mawson made of Kyle Walker being asked to experiment as a centre-half.\n\nAs it happened, Maguire came on in the 10th minute because of an early injury for Joe Gomez, who plays right-back for Liverpool but started here on the left of England's back three. Confused? England should be glad this was a poor Dutch team because the lack of clear strategy can seem bizarre, particularly when there are only three games now - or 270 minutes - to finalise their plans.\n\nA more confident Dutch team would surely have done more to test England. Instead, it did not need long to realise why the World Cup will be taking place without the Oranje. The reputation of Dutch football is for passing the ball with elegance and penetration.\n\nThis side did neither and the tempo was so slow it was difficult at times to remember that this was their first match with a new manager and, in theory, the opportunity to make a favourable impression on Ronald Koeman.\n\nEngland were no better in the first half and it must have been particularly disappointing for Southgate that his wing-backs looked so subdued for long spells. For this system to work, it is heavily reliant on the wide players breaking forward with speed and purpose. Rose occupied some advanced positions but his overall performance was in line with a difficult season for him at Spurs.\n\nIt has been a long time since Rose was on his best form while, on the other side, Kieran Trippier, deputising for Walker on the right, did not do a great deal to disprove the theory that England's best player for that role was being used as a centre-half.\n\nEqually, England had chosen obliging opponents and, six minutes into the second half, they were entitled to feel aggrieved not to have been awarded a penalty. Marcus Rashford's speed caught out Matthijs de Ligt and the goalkeeper, Jeroen Zoet, should not have come haring off his line. Rashford was ahead of them both but the Spanish referee, Jesús Gil Manzano, was some way back and decided to give De Ligt the benefit of the doubt for the sliding tackle that brought down England's striker.\n\nEngland's only noteworthy chance of the first half had come just after the half-hour mark when Jordan Henderson headed Trippier's free-kick wide. After the interval, however, they started to pass the ball with greater purpose and when they took the lead, in the 58th minute, it was in the midst of their most productive spell of the match.\n\nLingard started the move, spreading the ball to Rose on the left. Stefan de Vrij's attempt to clear the cross was poor and the ball rolled invitingly to Lingard, 20 yards out, with the time and space to pick his spot. His low shot was aimed to Zoet's right and, though the goalkeeper did get his hand to the ball, he could not prevent it ending up in the bottom corner.\n\nThere was still plenty of time for the Dutch to conjure up an equaliser but they could not create a single clear chance and the vast expanses of empty seats at the final whistle told their own story. By that stage, a good proportion of England's fans had also left. It was not a thriller, or even close.",

                "title": "Going plastics-free is as easy as calico bags and reusable coffee cups",
                "body": "It's almost everywhere you look - and it's undeniably destroying our planet.\n\nOver the past half a century, plastic has infiltrated modern life to such an extent that our oceans may have more of the stuff than fish by 2050.\n\nOnce hailed as an innovation, it's now clear that plastic is very bad news. Non-renewable fossil fuels are needed for production, belching out greenhouse gases in the process. Once tossed - often after mere minutes of use - plastic then takes hundreds of years to break down, emitting toxic methane gas as it gradually breaks into smaller and smaller pieces. The end point is too often our waterways and an estimated one million seabirds and 100,000 mammals are killed every year by marine rubbish, much of it plastics.\n\nRecycling helps, but a far more powerful solution is reducing and even eliminating single-use plastics altogether. That's actually easier than one might think - read on for a life with less plastic.\n\nSay no to single-use plastics\n\nRefuse to use plastic bags, for a start. Australians go through 13 million new bags each day and around 50m of them end up in landfill each year - enough to cover Melbourne's CBD, according to Clean Up Australia.\n\nBe cautious with so-called \"green bags\" though; those commonly sold at Coles and Woolworths are made of polypropylene, a type of plastic. Instead, opt for calico, canvas, jute or hessian. Or join the Boomerang Bags movement, from Queensland's Burleigh Heads, which encourages volunteers to make fabric bags from recycled materials.\n\nSkip other single-use plastics too, such as coffee cups, takeaway containers, water bottles and straws - even the Queen last month banned the latter two across her royal estates.\n\nA little pre-purchase prep makes saying no easier. Online stores including Brisbane's Biome and Sydney's Onya stock reusable alternatives, such as stainless steel water bottles, reusable coffee cups, bamboo toothbrushes, mesh produce bags and material food covers. Consider buying in bulk - The Source Bulk Foods has stores around the country and is Australia's biggest bulk food retailer.\n\n\"A reusable coffee cup only needs to be used 15 times to break even on its life cycle, including cleaning. Every use after that is a bonus for the planet,\" says Biome founder Tracey Bailey. \"The cumulative use of reusable products makes it easy for individuals to have a long-term environmental impact. Within 12 months, the Biome community saved the waste of over 6m single-use plastic items.\"\n\nIf plastics can't be avoided, look to recycle as much as possible. Soft, scrunchable plastics, for example, are too often turfed, but can actually be collected at home then dropped at REDcycle bins in major supermarkets.\n\nAvoid microplastics and reduce microfibre shedding\n\nSome of the most environmentally damaging plastics can barely be seen by the human eye, yet are used daily. Microbeads are tiny plastic pellets used in cosmetics and household products, such as exfoliating face scrubs, whitening toothpastes and deep-cleaning washing powders. Flushed down the drain, microbeads are too small to be captured by wastewater treatment plant filters and end up in our waterways. According to the Australian Marine Conservation Society, marine wildlife that mistake microbeads for fish eggs often end up starving to death.\n\nThe Australian government has ordered a voluntary phase-out of microbeads by mid-2018, but many believe an outright ban is needed. Consumers can sign a Surfrider Foundation petition calling for a ban, and consult the Australian Good Scrub Guide or Beat the Microbead app for help to choose microbead-free products.\n\nMicrofibres shed by synthetic clothing during washing is a growing concern. Synthetic fabrics such as polyester and nylon shed thousands of these tiny plastic particles with each wash, which end up polluting our rivers and oceans. Guppy Friend filter bags, developed in Berlin, are an emerging solution. Washing less, using front-loading machines and opting for natural fabrics and fibres wherever possible also helps.\n\nHelp reduce the impact of plastics already littering our environment\n\nA whopping 269,000 tonnes of rubbish is now estimated to be floating in our oceans - weighing more than 1,300 blue whales combined - and about 80% of it comes from land, according to the Australian Marine Conservation Society. The Pacific ocean is already besieged by more plastic than plankton.\n\nTo turn that around, humans can't just reduce our current consumption; we must also clean up the mess already created. Sydney-based non-profit Take 3 has inspired thousands to pick up three pieces of rubbish each when leaving the beach or waterways. Clean Up Australia Day, held annually each March, last year attracted 590,350 volunteers, who collected an estimated 15,500 ute loads of rubbish.\n\nPerth surfers Andrew Turton and Pete Ceglinski have created the floating Seabin rubbish bin for marinas and ports, which moves with the tide, collecting about 1.5kg of floating rubbish each day. Dutch inventor Boyan Slat went further, inventing The Ocean Cleanup passive drifting systems - due to launch this year - which he believes will clean up half the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within just five years.\n\nConsider a world free of plastic altogether\n\nDespite how thoroughly plastic permeates modern life, it is possible to largely avoid it - with some effort. In Melbourne, Erin Rhoads has lived a \"zero waste\" existence since June 2014; her entire trash output since fits inside one old coffee jar. (Other notables on similar paths include Gippsland's Tammy Logan, Adelaide's Niki Wallace and Perth-based Lindsay Miles.)\n\n\"We have the power to dictate how things are packaged and presented to us by participating in everyday activism through our purchases,\" Rhoads says. \"The more businesses see and hear us saying no to plastics, the more likely we will see changes that will lay the foundation to a cleaner, safer and healthier planet.\"\n\nWhile going fully plastic-free remains a pipe dream for most, Rhoads advocates small shifts that build into big lifestyle changes. On her blog, The Rogue Ginger, Rhoads outlines five easy first steps, and encourages consumers to embrace Plastic-Free Tuesday or Plastic-Free July (which began in Perth).\n\n\"Going plastic-free helps us take responsibility for our actions, while reminding us that most of the plastic we use today is not necessary at all,\" Rhoads says. \"We should focus on preserving our earth's resources for something other than a single-use plastic fork.\"\n\nAdditional research and reporting by Nicole Lutze",

                "title": "Marco Ureña keeps up Scotland's miserable record against Costa Rica",
                "body": "If this was Alex McLeish's attempt to dispel the sense of indifference that had come with his underwhelming appointment as Scotland manager last month, then not all went to plan. His was the archetypal international football hiring, and this was the archetypal international friendly, with not much to rouse the smattering of fans inside Hampden beyond the novel sight of a few new faces in the dark blue shirt.\n\nOf course, Costa Rica are off to the World Cup this summer, and so this fixture at least had some tangible purpose for them as they go through their final preparations before heading to Russia. But for Scotland this was about kick-starting a new cycle which, they hope, will lead them to a major tournament not far down the line.\n\nMcLeish's experimental lineup included places for the Aberdeen centre-back Scott McKenna, while Kevin McDonald partnered the newly Scottish Scott McTominay in midfield. The enigmatic but unproven Oli McBurnie led the line, providing a source of curiosity for those who had not seen a professional footballer play with socks around his ankles since the 1970s.\n\nWith so many making their debuts it was little wonder that Scotland looked disjointed from the start, falling behind after only 14 minutes when Bryan Oviedo's pulled-back cross from the left was guided home by Marcos Ureña. Callum Paterson threatened a reply moments later, but saw his glancing header from a Matt Ritchie cross flash just past the far post.\n\nThe decision to play a back three, with Paterson and Andrew Robertson as the wing-backs, was designed to allow Scotland to go down the outside of the opposition, but there was little sign of that until Robertson drilled a low ball into the box after 34 minutes. While at Liverpool Robertson so frequently finds Roberto Firmino or Mohamed Salah on the end of his deliveries, there was nobody in dark blue to turn home this one.\n\nWith José Mourinho watching McTominay from the stands, the Manchester United midfielder struggled to get a grip of the game, getting caught out by the bounce of a ball at the start of the second half, allowing Costa Rica to break forward in numbers. Bryan Ruiz appeared to have been forced wide enough, but easily beat Robertson to cut inside at the byline and ping a strike off the Scotland crossbar from a tight angle.\n\nThere was some nice passing from Scotland in the middle of the pitch, but all too rarely did it lead to anything in the final third. Tom Cairney is one of the many talents many believe Gordon Strachan should have been called up to the Scotland squad long ago, but the Fulham attacker did little to justify that claim here. Ritchie was handy from set pieces, but he still does not have the kind of influence on this Scotland team that he enjoys at Newcastle.\n\nWith just under an hour played, Cairney and McTominay were withdrawn for Stuart Armstrong and Callum McGregor, with the Celtic pair immediately injecting some life into a stagnant affair. While there has been much excitement north of the border over McTominay's rise at Old Trafford, he is not one to dominate a match, doing well enough on his international debut but not shining. He will grow into his surroundings in Scotland over time, just as he has in Manchester.\n\nMcGregor nearly created the equaliser on the 65 minute mark, bursting through midfield before threading a pass for Ritchie, who had peeled away from his marker. But the Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas was equal to the shot from 16 yards. Scotland forged another opening soon after, with Robertson getting down the left to fizz a ball across the face of goal. McBurnie failed to make the connection.\n\nScotland travel to Budapest next week to take on Hungary, perhaps explaining why McLeish decided against making the plethora of second half substitutions that often come with these sort of games. The likes of Ryan Christie, Barry Douglas, Jason Cummings and Jack Hendry may be granted their chance to impress there, as the new manager tests all options before the start of Euro 2020 qualification and the Nations League later this year.\n\nMcBurnie was replaced by Matt Phillips with just over 10 minutes left, having put in a lot of effort as the lone frontman but failing to provide a much-needed cutting edge. Phillips was deployed in an unfamiliar centre-forward role, hinting once again at McLeish's experimental mindset. The late introduction of the midfielder John McGinn for the central defender Charlie Mulgrew also showed that this game was being used as a try-out. A typical friendly with the typical footnote that the result didn't matter all that much.",

                "body": "Brazil's World Cup preparations gathered pace as they cruised past Russia 3-0 in Moscow. Miranda, Philippe Coutinho and Paulinho netted during a 13-minute second-half goal rush at the Luzhniki Stadium on Friday.\n\nIt was the ideal warm-up for the five-time World Cup winners against this summer's tournament hosts. Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus also continued his recovery from a knee injury as he played 65 minutes before being replaced by Liverpool's Roberto Firmino.\n\nRussia open the World Cup against Saudi Arabia on June 14 and will need better finishing than they mustered in the first half here. Roman Zobnin volleyed woefully wide when well placed and Aleksey Miranchuk then blew what was arguably a better chance nine minutes before the break when he skied over from six yards.\n\nRussia were made to pay for their profligacy in the second half as Brazil upped the tempo. Paulinho was the first to fire a warning when he was denied by Igor Akinfeev after Willian's pass three minutes after the break.\n\nAkinfeev then produced a superb save when Willian's effort deflected off Aleksandr Samedov and the goalkeeper turned the ball over with his head. His resistance was broken when he parried Thiago Silva's header from the resulting short corner to Miranda who converted from close range.\n\nPaulinho should have made it 2-0 when he missed his kick in front of goal after good work from Coutinho to allow Akinfeev to save. But Coutinho did double Brazil's lead after 65 minutes when he scored from the spot after his Barcelona team-mate Paulinho had been brought down by Aleksandr Golovkin.\n\nPaulinho then made it 3-0 three minutes later, heading in Willian's hanging cross. Miranchuk almost grabbed a consolation after Dani Alves cleared the ball off the line late on but failed to finish.",

The one that went on to develop 115mph winds, felling 15 million trees across the UK, including six of the seven iconic oaks of Sevenoaks? Thankfully storms like this are rare, but a new study reveals that we're likely to see more of them as the planet warms.\n\nThe Great Storm was both a \"weather bomb\" and a \"sting jet\". Weather bombs are classified as storms where the air pressure drops by more than 24 millibars within 24 hours, whilst sting jets are blasts of air that accelerate as they plummet, generating powerful surface winds and localised gusts.\n\nOscar Martinez-Alvarado from the University of Reading, and colleagues used a climate model to simulate extreme storms both now and by 2100. Their results, published in Environmental Research Letters, show that if greenhouse gases continue to rise then the chances of North Atlantic storms becoming weather bombs with sting jets more than doubles. \"We think that larger atmospheric moisture content is the reason behind the increase,\" writes Martinez Alvarado in the Department of Meteorology blog. \"Increased numbers of storms would wreak havoc on people's lives and leave Britain facing a spiralling clean-up bill.\"",

                "title": "The government's marine park plans are diabolical for ocean protection | Jessica Meeuwig",
                "body": "It is tempting to accept a poor outcome rather than nothing, but the proposed plans are neither evidence-based nor balanced\n\nOn 20 March, the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, released the management plans for Australian Marine Parks \"for all Australians\", indicating that these plans demonstrate a \"balanced and scientific evidence-based approach to ocean protection\".\n\nThe management plans are neither balanced nor evidence-based, a position that was supported by over 1,400 Australian and international marine researchers in response to the draft plans, released last year for public consultation.\n\nSince 2012, 36% of Australia's ocean territory has been within marine parks. However, the devil is in the detail and what is meant by a \"park\". The management plans just released in response to former prime minister Tony Abbott's decision to suspend the 2012 plans now give us the detail, and it is diabolical for ocean protection.\n\nScience-based? The government has ignored decades of marine research and evidence by choosing to place much of the marine park area into various forms of partial-protection zoning rather than green zones which afford full protection. Peer-reviewed science repeatedly demonstrates that partial protection does not generate the benefits of full protection, as any sex-ed teacher worth their salt(water) would agree. By turning to partial protection, we reduce biodiversity outcomes, while fishery and tourism benefits; we weaken resilience to climate change and increase management costs.\n\nA particularly insidious form of partial protection is that of \"habitat protection zones\" whereby only activities that affect the seabed are excluded. It sounds good but is really #fakescience. Such zoning ignores the important biological links between animals in the water column and the seabed. It allows commercial fishing activities within the marine parks that have already been assessed as incompatible with conservation in the government's own risk reports. Indeed, such zoning creates the opportunity for industrial scale fishing within our marine parks by vessels such as the imported Dutch super trawler, the Geelong Star, that so many Australians rejected.\n\nBalance? The pub test on balance would be failed. 97% of all Australian waters within 100 km of the coast remains open to recreational fishing. The Coral Sea and Australia's north-west are two of the world's last true tropical marine wildernesses, yet the plans fully protect less than 25% of the Coral Sea and less than 5% of the north-west. Ecologically significant parks of the south-west region such as Geographe and Western Kangaroo Island have 1.5-5% of their area afforded protection, leaving over 95% open to extractive activities. Many parks have no green zones at all.\n\nSuch a meagre offering of ocean protection by a nation that prides itself on its ocean leadership comes at a time when global marine trends are worrying. Internationally, fish landings have been declining since 1996. Ecologically and economically important species such as tunas and sharks have experienced declines of between 60 and 95% in their abundance over the last ~50 years. Even in Australia, with its relatively strong fisheries management, we have experienced sharp declines in commercially and recreationally important species that have led fisheries agencies to drastically reduce landings.\n\nFully protected marine parks, combined with strong fisheries management, can support ocean wildlife in its recovery from overexploitation and build resilience so these species can better navigate the challenges of a warming ocean and habitat modification. Green zones are the engine room of fisheries production, as demonstrated by both research and the many commercial and recreational fishers that target the boundaries of green zones where spillover occurs. Australia's oceans contribute some $25 billion per year to our blue economy as non-market ecosystem services. Yet these services are at risk as we further industrialise our oceans.\n\nThese new plans, unless they are disallowed in parliament, will stand for 10 years. It is tempting to accept a poor outcome rather than nothing, and look forward to improving it over time. But time is flying for our oceans as our industrial footprint grows exponentially and pressing issues of food security grow. These plans will do little for oceans and our blue economy.\n\nIt is time to build on the many lessons learned since 2012 when the outer boundaries of 44 new marine parks were established, and to create a set of management plans that are indeed evidence-based and balanced.\n\nFrydenberg suggests these are marine parks for \"all\" Australians. He has however overlooked our young Australians who will inherit the outcomes of our risky experiment on our oceans.\n\n* Professor Jessica Meeuwig is director of Marine Futures Lab, University of Western Australia and founding member of Ocean Science Council of Australia",

                "title": "The 'best' outcome? How the marine park plans divided scientists and conservationists",
                "body": "For those in Australia's marine science and conservation community, a dream of having a network of marine parks around the continent has been 20 years in the making.\n\nThe story is one of heartbreak, near misses and painful compromise and, in the view of some, a false dichotomy of sacrifice between science and economic and political interests.\n\nNow Australia may be about to reach a historic milestone in marine conservation - just as it was in 2013 - with a set of plans before parliament for a network of 44 marine parks that are at the whim of politicians.\n\nSome, like the Labor party, major conservation groups and many scientists, see the plans as scientifically compromised to the point where they can't support them.\n\nOthers say even though environment minister Josh Frydenberg's long-awaited plans will not give Australia's oceans the protection they need, the prospect of more delay and uncertainty is difficult to vote for.\n\n\"This is not an ecologically representative marine reserve system - and that is unambiguously true,\" says world leading conservation management expert Prof Hugh Possingham of the University of Queensland.\n\n\"But I have been waiting for 20 years to do this on the sea. If throwing them out means we have to wait another 20 years ... well, I just think it's time.\"\n\nLabor has moved to block the plans in parliament, but will need the support of some crossbench senators and the Greens who, right now, are undecided.\n\nWhat's not in doubt is that over that 20 years, the threats to the oceans have multiplied. Pressures are mounting from acidification, pollution, plastics, overfishing, coastal development, global warming and rising demands for fish from growing global populations.\n\nBut how did Australia get here?\n\nUnder prime minister John Howard, Australia agreed to begin building a network of marine reserves in 1998.\n\nMichelle Grady, now head of ocean conservation work at Pew Charitable Trusts in Australia, had already been lobbying hard for about four years at that time. \"That was the dawn of a new era for marine conservation - an approach that was scientific and systemic. Nobody thought then, that it would come to this.\"\n\nThe first set of marine parks were declared in the south-east region around Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia in 2007, but six more years passed before the rules for what could happen inside those parks - the so-called management plans - took effect.\n\nBut according to WWF's head of oceans Richard Leck, another high-watermark for ocean conservation came in 2004. The Howard government drastically increased the \"no take\" areas of the Great Barrier Reef marine park where fishing would be banned.\n\n\"That was a difficult campaign,\" says Leck. \"When the reef was first declared a World Heritage area, it had about 4.5% as sanctuaries where you couldn't fish or do any extractive activities. By the end of the campaign, the Howard government declared more than one third of the reef as sanctuary.\"\n\nIn 2016 when Great Barrier Reef researchers compared \"no take\" green zones to areas that are open to fishing, they have found universal benefits.\n\nUsing 20 years of data, they found corals inside the protected areas were more resilient to disease, bleaching, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and they recovered quicker from storm damage. Researchers have also found, not surprisingly, that \"no take\" zones increase the numbers of fish.\n\nBut since 2004, Leck says there has been a \"trail of missed opportunities\" and the country has gone from \"global leader to laggard\" on marine conservation.\n\n\"Today, we have a government that's not following the leadership of the conservative Howard government of the time. We are ignoring the best available science and the community sentiment.\"\n\nThings again looked promising in November 2012 and marine conservation took another leap forward, when Labor environment ministers Peter Garrett and then Tony Burke flagged plans for 44 new marine parks circumnavigating the continent.\n\nBurke told Guardian Australia: \"In 2012, everything was in place and the opposition moved to disallow them then, but that failed. But then the Abbott government came in.\"\n\nTony Abbott's Coalition swept to power in 2013 and stuck to a promise to suspend Labor's marine management plans - the rules for what can happen on and in the water - and ordered a review.\n\nBurke insists his government had followed \"every process required of the EPBC Act\" but \"all that meant nothing as far as the Liberals were concerned.\"\n\nUniversity of Queensland Prof Bob Beeton, with 40 years researching marine management, chaired Abbott's scientific review panel that took three times longer than the government had anticipated to finish its work.\n\nSpeaking of the new plans, the now retired Beeton says they are imperfect but a starting point: \"The bottom line is that at this moment in time, there is no protection of this enormous area. It would be tragic if this politics of vengeance was to rob Australia of a substantial marine parks system and one that's better than anything that has got to the starting line in the past.\n\n\"This sets the process in motion. It would be a tragedy if these new plans were disallowed. I believe it's the best outcome you can get.\"\n\nThe conclusion that this is the \"best outcome you can get\" is clearly highly contentious.\n\nProf Colin Buxton, a fisheries scientist at the University of Tasmania, was a fellow co-chair of the Abbott government's review. He believes the new plans are a step in the right direction.\n\n\"It's a negotiated outcome - it's not an outcome that a group of scientists would have landed with or a group of fishermen would have landed with or a group of conservationists would have landed with. It's a compromise. It's a network designed by committee and it's time to get on with it.\"\n\nThe review was finished and handed to then environment minister Greg Hunt in December 2015, but it was not until September 2016 that the new minister, Josh Frydenberg, made the review public.\n\nConservation groups and scientists were critical of the rezoning the review had suggested.\n\nThe Ocean Science Council of Australia (OSCA) - a network of leading marine researchers and scientists - said it was a \"significant step backwards\" from Labor's plans, and were \"inconsistent with the Australian government's commitment to evidence-based marine management.\"\n\nIn July 2017, the government released a new set of \"draft plans\" that shocked many in the marine science and conservation movement.\n\nMany areas once coloured green for \"no take\" were now yellow - a category known as \"habitat protection zone\" which allows fishing and other activities, but does not allow any interference with the sea floor.\n\nMarine scientists regard this as only \"partial protection\" - something akin to insuring only the floorboards of your house while ignoring all the contents, including the roof.\n\n\"We were very disappointed - actually, we were shocked,\" remembers Michelle Grady.\n\nShe says the critics in the scientific community got \"louder and louder\" as the zoning got \"weaker and weaker\".\n\n\"The management plans were a dramatic departure from their own independent science review,\" she says.\n\n\"They were proposing to strip about 50% from the higher-levels of protection across the network - that's an area that would represent about half of Australia's national parks on land. It was unexpected, particularly given the wide consultation up to that point.\"\n\nProf David Booth, director of the Centre for Environmental Sustainability at University of Technology Sydney, says when those draft plans were released, they were \"another slap in the face for evidence-based science.\"\n\n\"It was mind blowing. We were very angry,\" says Booth.\n\nAll up, analysis from a coalition of conservation groups says about 35 million hectares of green zones have been lost from Labor's original plans to those now before parliament.\n\nPeter Cochrane, another member the Abbott Government commissioned expert scientific review panel, admits that after the draft management plans were released in 2017, there were \"some areas of significant difference\" from the panel's recommendations.\n\nHe said the largest areas of departures from what had been recommended and what was proposed was in the Coral Sea.\n\n\"Clearly you don't have to be Einstein to work out that we were not engaged in a political negotiation in terms of what the stakeholders might have been arguing through the political process.\n\n\"My understanding is that [after the review was submitted] the politics came to bear and that produced the result we saw in the draft plans.\"\n\n\"We thought we had done the best job in terms of the science and the balance of interests. There certainly was a reduction [in areas of higher protection] from what we had recommended and to that extent that departure was inconsistent with what we recommended.\"\n\n\"This process is hard everywhere in the world because of long-standing economic interests in the ocean,\" he says. \"Any change is difficult. No other country to my knowledge has attempted such an ambitions and representative approach.\"\n\nProf Jessica Meeuwig, director of the Marine Futures Lab at the University of Western Australia and an OSCA member, agrees the plans presented by the Labor government in 2012 were \"marginal\".\n\nBut, she says, there was an acceptance among scientists that they were good enough as a starting point from which to push for improvements later.\n\nBut after seeing the plans tabled before parliament this week, Meeuwig is far less equivocal. She believes the new plans should be disallowed.\n\n\"In 2012 we sort of accepted that while they were marginal, there was room to improve them. These plans are so bad that this is no longer the case. The idea that this is the best we can do is rubbish - in 2012, all the stakeholders were on board.\"\n\nMeeuwig argues there is a further risk to accepting the Turnbull government's plans. Once the plans are in place, she says there will be a major effort from researchers to look at the impact of the \"no take\" green zones on the biodiversity in those areas.\n\nBut because those green zones have been cut and fragmented, there is a danger that scientific reviews could conclude the green zones were ineffective when they were essentially compromised.\n\n\"What we'll have then, is an argument that green zones don't work when of course the science shows they do,\" she says.\n\nPossingham warns against throwing the baby out with the bathwater. He points out that Australia has signed up to the United Nations Convention on biological diversity, which carried a commitment that marine areas are \"conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas.\"\n\nHe says in his view neither the current plans, nor Labor's 2012 plans, were a \"representative system\".\n\n\"There are many entire ecosystem types with no protection at all\" he says, adding there was a tendency to designate areas of higher protection \"in areas not under threat\" and so they achieved nothing.\n\n\"The science is solid on this, but nothing has changed.\" He says \"no take zones\" have been shown to have more support to sustainable fishing than simply protecting the ocean floor. \"But we have waited a long time for this system.\"\n\nBurke concludes: \"Every environmental protection is hostage to a future rogue action from a government. This is the nature of a democracy.\"\n\nAnd this, in many ways, could be the insurance policy Australia's oceans need as the current plans sit pregnant in parliament.\n\nIn reality, a future government could choose to revisit them and it could decide, instead, to \"go rogue\" on the increasing threats to Australia's unique and beautiful ocean.",

                "body": "Fates turned on mere metres when the bushfire ripped through the New South Wales town of Tathra.\n\nThe raining embers, carried and fanned by raging winds, were indiscriminate in their destruction. Some started spot fires and brought homes down while leaving adjacent properties wholly untouched.\n\nWhen the sun rose over the seaside village the next morning, it revealed an eerie scene. On one street there was scarcely a blade of grass out of place. But walk around the corner, and there was nothing but devastation. Collapsed roofs, scorched car shells, blackened brick, and twisted metal.\n\nFor the Green family, the duality could not be more stark. The Greens own two caravans within metres of each other in a motor village on Tathra's northern end, near the Bega River.\n\nOne, owned by Jess Green and her partner Paul Eivers, was razed to the ground. The other, her parents', escaped without so much as smoke damage.\n\nEivers watched the fire on television from Canberra on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe pair have since seen images, broadcast by the ABC, which they believe may show their caravan on fire. \"It's just insane how the fire would pick and choose stuff,\" Eivers said. \"Where it would go, and which one it was going to take.\"\n\nEivers is quick to put their loss in perspective. Far more was lost by others in Tathra, he says. But among their caravan's incinerated possessions was something irreplaceable - a painting by his then 18-month-old old son. \"It would be nothing to anybody else, but for me it was special,\" Eivers said.\n\nThe fire descended with frightening speed\n\nTathra residents - initially kept out of the town due asbestos fears, unstable structures, and live power lines - began trickling back in from Tuesday night. They face the daunting prospect of rebuilding their sleepy village.\n\nFor some, it's a process that could take 18 months, according to the recovery coordinator, Euan Ferguson.\n\nAt final count, 65 houses were destroyed, 48 were damaged, 810 were saved or untouched, and 35 caravans and cabins were lost. Even firefighters agree it was a small miracle no one was seriously hurt or killed.\n\nResidents of the small town, population around1,600, had limited options to escape. The two main routes out were across the Bega River to the north or inland towards Bega.\n\nThe fire descended with frightening speed, crossing the Bega River about 4pm, and tearing through bushland towards the coast. The Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said the fire was directed towards Tathra only by a sudden wind gust. It was otherwise expected to miss the town.\n\nThe conditions were described as a \"perfect storm\" - hot temperatures, dry fuel loads, and high winds. The front was preceded by what Fitzsimmons described as \"raining embers\".\n\n\"It ran so quickly, it went seven or eight kilometres in just a couple of hours,\" Fitzsimmons said. \"Not only did you have the main fire front, but you had these ember storms; the village of Tathra was raining embers. So you'll find as you drive around in some streets, there are homes that have been burnt and destroyed, and yet everything around it - the vegetation the lawns, the gardens - aren't even touched.\"\n\nHow did it start?\n\nAs rebuilding begins, questions are being asked about the cause and handling of the fire. Two inquiries will investigate the Tathra bushfire: one headed by former police chief Mick Keelty, and another to be held in the coroner's court.\n\nQuestions have already been posed: how well did the state's two firefighting services respond to triple-0 calls and send resources? Could more fuel reduction in the bushland around Tathra have been done?Did lax maintenance of the electricity network contribute?\n\nThe RFS says the fire likely started along power lines on Reedy Swamp Road, prompting the Electrical Trades Union in NSW to criticise Essential Energy, the responsible government-owned corporation.\n\nCrucially, questions remain about the serious failures in warnings and alerts to residents.\n\nText-based warnings to many residents either failed completely or were late enough to be redundant. The early loss of power prevented landline and radio alerts being effective.\n\nTathra, a notorious mobile black spot, is yet to receive infrastructure upgrades, despite being identified as a \"priority location\" for $60m of spending under the commonwealth's mobile black spot program.\n\nThe opposition regional communications spokesman, Stephen Jones, said the black spot program has been tarred by politically motivated decision-making and said areas prone to natural disasters should move to the top of the queue.\n\nProblems with the phone-based alert system are not new. The same system is used in most states and territories, and in 2011, it comprehensively failed during a toxic fire in the northern suburbs of Canberra. The alerts were supposed to go to 86,801 home phones, and 83,774 mobiles. About 80% of those home calls were never made, and 32% of the texts were not sent, because the system was so slow it would have taken seven hours to reach everyone.\n\n'Dysfunctional and dangerous' fire rescue services\n\nThe Tathra fire has also prompted an ugly brawl involving the state's two fire services: Fire and Rescue NSW and the RFS.\n\nIn the early stages of the fire, the RFS knocked back two offers of help from nearby urban firefighters. The decision prompted much angst from the Fire Brigade Employees Union, which represents Fire and Rescue members. The union's state secretary, Leighton Drury, made the explosive allegation that the refusal had caused more properties to be lost in Tathra.\n\n\"The competition between the state's two fire services is dysfunctional and dangerous,\" Drury said. \"In this case, it has contributed to the loss of scores of homes that may have been saved had FRNSW urban crews been in Tathra. It has to stop.\"\n\nThe allegation won him few friends. The RFS rejected the allegation as \"disgusting\", saying the pumper on offer was completely unsuitable for fighting the fire, which was at that stage burning in remote, mountainous terrain.\n\nResidents are similarly unimpressed with criticism of the response of firefighters.\n\nGary Rodely is a Tathra-based oyster farmer, and owns Tathra Oysters, a local business that is busy preparing for the Royal Easter Show. Rodely said the town was completely behind the efforts of firefighters. He's displaying messages on his business trailer, which read: \"Thank you to all our brave fire fighters. Forever grateful.\"\n\n\"The feeling here in the town is that we're all very, very grateful to the fireys for what they have done,\" Rodely told Guardian Australia. \"Anybody who was here on the ground knew what a perfect fire storm this was. People were brave enough to stay and battle it. There's certainly no ill feeling in the town,\" he said.\n\nThe emergency services minister, Troy Grant, described the union's allegations as \"bastardry\", while the former NSW RFS commissioner, Phil Koperberg, rejected any allegations of a turf war between the two services.\n\n\"There's certainly a turf war between the union and the rest of the universe in terms of logic,\" Koperberg told the ABC on Thursday. \"I don't think we should underplay the cooperation which exists between the two organisations, because it's to a very high order.\"\n\nAffected residents were bussed in to the town on Tuesday and taken on a grim procession through the bushfire-ravaged village.\n\nMany others, including Rodely, are still working up the nerve to go back. \"I've got to steel myself to do it, that's all,\" he told Guardian Australia. \"When it comes time for me to drive around the town, it's going to be a harrowing experience.\n\n\"We're a tourist town so I suppose the message that everyone is keen to get out, especially with Easter coming up, is that the town's open for business, and back to normal. We need people to not cancel their holidays, we need people to come.'\n\nThe beach is open, as are some accommodation providers.",

                "body": "The anguish on Michael Harris's face said it all.\n\nThe British-born roofer broke down this week when he appeared as a witness at the banking royal commission.\n\nIn between deep breaths, Harris told commissioner Kenneth Hayne how he had amassed a $35,000 credit card debt with the Commonwealth Bank, and how his attempts to get the bank to stop offering him credit limit increases proved futile.\n\nIn 2016, he had told a CBA staff member that he had a gambling addiction, and said he had pleaded with the bank to stop offering him more credit, but the offers had kept coming and his debt kept ballooning.\n\n\"I explained I'm a gambler, I have a gambling problem, they can clearly see that I've got a gambling problem because of the transactions I've been making, and I don't understand why they keep offering me more money,\" he said.\n\nHe then began to cry as he re-lived the experience.\n\nIt was a poignant moment for the royal commission. It came near the end of a fortnight of hearings in which Australia's major banks admitted to appalling behaviour in recent years.\n\nThe commission heard evidence of National Australia Bank staff being involved in an alleged bribery ring involving multiple bank branches, forged documents, fake payslips and Medicare cards, with bribes being paid in cash stuffed in envelopes, as NAB staff responded to an incentive program to sign up new customers for home loans.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank admitted mortgage holders were more likely to run into financial trouble when they secured their loans from a mortgage broker, and that the commissions it paid to its mortgage brokers often incentivised them to sell risky mortgages to customers, but it didn't want to stop the practice until other banks stopped too.\n\nANZ admitted it did nothing to verify the general living expenses of customers who had been sent to the bank from a mortgage broker, complaining it would be too complex, time consuming, and costly to comb over every individual's bank statements.\n\nAnd Westpac Bank was criticised for being the \"most resistant\" to Australia's banking laws, and the least willing to cooperate with the regulator's attempts to enforce responsible lending practices.\n\nThe commission has heard how hundreds of thousands of Australians have been affected by the banks' poor behaviour in the last few years alone, with hundreds of millions of dollars being paid back in remuneration.\n\nNAB and ANZ were chastised for withholding important documents from the commission.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, when counsel assisting Rowen Orr began her summary of the past fortnight's evidence, she said CBA had just handed the commission another batch of new documents which should have been handed in weeks ago.\n\n\"We have had limited time to review this additional material, however we observe that the material refers to, for example, at least 41 significant events of which seven involve responsible lending issues relating to home and personal loans, credit cards, and overdraft facilities,\" Orr said.\n\n\"Remediation totalling $5.326m has been paid to customers in respect of these events, but remediation for at least two of the events is yet to be quantified.\"\n\nAnalysts from UBS published a research note on Friday, warning that given there had been only two weeks of hearings, the prospect for Australia's banks was not good.\n\n\"The banking royal commission has presented evidence of: fraud, bribery, failure to verify customer income, not assessing expenses, false documentation, failure of internal controls, failure to report misconduct to Asic, and systemic problems,\" the UBS note read.\n\n\"So far the royal commission has been presented with substantial evidence based on a number of case studies into banking misconduct.\"\n\nThe UBS analysts said as a consequence of the royal commission, Australia's banks might have to tighten further their lending practices, and that this might lead to general \"credit tightening\" or a \"credit crunch\" in the economy, depending on how things played out.\n\nOrr closed the fortnight with this assessment:\n\n\"Commissioner, over the last two weeks, the commission has received evidence of misconduct and conduct falling below community standards and expectations by a number of financial services entities.\n\n\"The misconduct and conduct ... has occurred in respect of the consumer credit products that we identified in our opening address: home loans, car loans, credit cards and overdraft facilities.\n\n\"It has also occurred in the selling of insurance with credit products and through a variety of account administration and processing errors made by financial services entities in connection with credit products, such as home loans.\"\n\nShe then called on the commission to find misconduct charges and breaches of national credit and corporation law against the NAB, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, and Aussie Home Loans.\n\nHayne said round two of the hearings will begin on 16 April.\n\nwith AAP",

                "title": "Australia's fierce immigration debate is about to get louder",
                "body": "How many and whom? Australia is - again - seized by a debate about migration to this country, its size, shape and character.\n\n\"Immigration is a defining feature of Australia's economic and social life,\" the productivity commission argued in a 2016 report that found, on current projections, the country's population would reach 40 million by the middle of the century.\n\nFrom the post-war creation of an immigration department and the public catch-cry of \"populate or perish\", successive waves of migrants, from different parts of the world, have shaped the country's character, and influenced its development.\n\nBut Australia's broader migration program has been revolutionised over a generation, and with little consultative public debate.\n\nAustralia does not have an explicit population policy or minister - it did briefly between 2010 and 2013 but the annual migration intake is set by government as part of the budget.\n\n\"Australia's immigration policy is its de facto population policy,\" the productivity commission says.\n\nSince the prime ministership of John Howard, immigration experts argue, successive governments of both stripes have altered, almost beyond recognition from its post-war origins, the size, emphases, and nature of Australia's migration program.\n\nIn Guardian analysis of migration data from the beginning of Howard's premiership in 1996, several key trends emerge:\n\nA massive increase in Australia's annual permanent migration intake - from 85,000 in 1996 to 208,000 last year. The emergence of India and China as the largest sources - by far - of migrants. The movement away from family migration to skilled migration targeting national workforce needs. In 1996, family migration was about two-thirds of the program, and skilled one-third. Those ratios are now reversed. A huge increase in temporary migration to Australia - through short-term work visas (the soon-to-be-replaced 457) and international students. The rise of \"two-step migration\", where those on short-term visas (usually 457 or student visas) gain permanent residency. The emergence of migration, rather than natural increase (i.e. births) as the primary driver of population increase.\n\nPublicly, the debate about migration rarely remains within the narrow confines of the number or origin of new people seeking to come to Australia to live.\n\nRather it spills, with increasing vituperativeness, into all areas of public debate: to arguments about road congestion and house prices, to the availability of resources such as land and water, to social debates about integration, religion, and English as Australia's primary spoken language.\n\nMigration is not just about those who arrive, but runs to national character: who is an Australian and who will become one.\n\nThe migration of the past 20 years has shaped the nature of today's Australia. And today's migration will create the Australia of the next generation.\n\nThe number of humanitarian migrants (mainly refugees being resettled) has remained fairly static since 1996, with a jump in 2012 and a trend upwards since 2015.\n\nOver two decades, India and China have emerged as, by far, the largest countries of origin for permanent migrants. The number from India has grown from 3000 migrants in 1996 to more than 40,000 by 2013. Three countries, India, China, and the United Kingdom, provide the majority of migrants to Australia.\n\nSince 1996, the balance of permanent migration has moved from family towards skilled. This has come as successive Australian governments sought to tie migration more closely to the needs of the labour market.\n\nTemporary migration to Australia has risen sharply over the past two decades, largely through two channels - international students and temporary work visas (457). The number of international students has more than trebled since 1996, from about 113,000 a year, to more than 340,000.\n\nNatural increase - babies being born - is no longer the primary driver for Australia's population increase. Twenty years ago, the split was broadly 60% babies, 40% arriving migrants in increasing Australia's population. Today, the inverse is true. The number of babies being born has increased, roughly in line with the rise in population, but against a hugely higher level of migration, its proportion has shrunk.\n\nThe University of Technology Sydney professor Jock Collins has studied Australia's migration trends for four decades. He told the Guardian that while Australia was indisputably a country of migration - 28% of Australia's population was born overseas; of OECD nations only Luxembourg and Switzerland have higher proportions - migration has always been a matter of fierce public debate.\n\n\"There has always been an immigration debate, it's been a major feature of our nation - it's always been controversial.\"\n\nThe profound changes to the size and shape of Australia's migration program, began under the Howard government as he ramped up migration - permanent and temporary - in part as a response to the mining boom and a thriving economy. The trend has continued, both a result of and a factor in, Australia's continuing economic prosperity.\n\nPreviously, Collins argues, debates about migration have been closely linked to economic downturns. Recessions in the early 80s, and then again in the start of the 90s, sparked widespread questioning of the size and nature of Australia's immigration program.\n\n\"Now, economically, we are in this long-running boom, the argument is more about the social and environmental impact, instead of 'they're taking our jobs', it's about congestion and overcrowding, infrastructure and housing prices,\" he says.\n\nTemporary migration has changed the nature of Australia's migration program, with an increasing number of migrants now coming to Australia on a temporary visa and, via \"two-steps\" or more, moving towards permanent residency.\n\n\"That is the big story of the last two decades of Australian immigration, the massive increase in temporary migration,\" Collins says.\n\n\"From 1947, the emphasis was settler-migration, bringing in new people to build the nation. But now, temporary migration far outweighs permanent: 700,000 or so temporary visas compared to 200,000 on permanent visas. And this has occurred without much debate or concern, it's only been with the Fair Work commission investigation into the exploitation of international students and working holiday visa holders, or the problems with 457 visas, that we are having this debate around temporary migrants.\"\n\nDebate, not demonisation\n\nCollins believes a debate about Australia's migration program - how large it is, which migrants are prioritised and why - is a legitimate public policy discussion.\n\n\"But I think the thing about the current debate, it becomes disturbing when you attack a particular ethnic group - 'Chinese immigrants are destroying the housing market', or talk about so-called 'African gangs'.\n\n\"I think you can have a reasoned debate about population size and accompanying issues, if you don't attach that to a particular group. If it's about 'the Chinese' or 'African gangs', then it becomes emotive and not evidence-based and develops a momentum of itself.\"\n\nHe says the debate Australia hasn't yet had is around where immigrants move to. Australia is one of the most urbanised countries on earth, and the vast majority of immigrants settle in cities, overwhelming Melbourne and Sydney.\n\n\"But one thing I've found that's interesting: there is a massive appetite in the bush for refugees and also for migration more broadly.\n\n\"I studied attitudes towards new immigrants to rural and regional, expecting to see some evidence of, to put it crudely, 'redneck Australia'. But I found the opposite, the warmth of the welcome was overwhelming, towards both permanent migrants and humanitarian entrants.\n\n\"I think this can be a 'win-win' situation if it is well managed. Australia can maintain its large migration levels, even increase its humanitarian program, but you can diffuse the urban congestion and address the house price issue, as well as addressing population decline and economic stagnation in rural and regional areas.\"",

                "title": "As a citizen of Melbourne, don't I have the right to question immigration? | Gay Alcorn",
                "body": "I'm a citizen of Melbourne. That's all. Not an economist, nor a politician, a property developer, a demographer. Just a resident with an affection for the city, with all its flaws and idiosyncrasies.\n\nAs a citizen, nobody has been able to explain to me clearly why Melbourne, and Australia for that matter, should be absorbing so many new people every year, at a rate far higher than the OECD average, faster than other developed nations, with no feasible plan to cope with it.\n\nThe epicentre of what former New South Wales premier Bob Carr calls Australia's \"weird experiment\" is Melbourne, my town. Melbourne is on the brink of being a city of 5 million and is growing at record rates (Victoria grew 2.3% in the year to June 2017, way above the national average of 1.6%, itself exceptionally high by developed nation standards).\n\nDear old Melbourne added a quarter of its population in just 10 years to 2016. At this rate - and projecting population growth is a wobbly science - it will be home to nearly 8 million by mid-century, overtaking Sydney as the country's largest city.\n\nThe impact of this growth is the single most important issue in this town (and no doubt in Sydney, too, and to a lesser extent in Brisbane and Perth). As a lowly if curious citizen, the refusal of any major political party, let alone business groups, for whom the more people the better, to question the pace of growth, even to explain it, is astonishing.\n\nI read report after report which assume with scant elaboration that \"there is no alternative\" to record population growth. The result is a rumbling backlash, and a justifiable one.\n\nAt least this debate is now being held, when for too long it was stuck in our debilitating culture wars, with many progressives wary that questioning immigration rates would give succour to racists.\n\nWe can ignore the Pauline Hansons who want to stop Muslims coming here. We can ignore, too, those elements of Tony Abbott's argument that one reason for easing immigration is because in Melbourne, \"ethnic gangs (are) testing the resolve of police.\" That's a dog-whistle.\n\nBut we can no longer ignore the tougher questions: the majority of our population growth is due to immigration, particularly in the past decade. Around three quarters of immigrants settle in big cities, where the jobs are.\n\nThose cities, particularly Melbourne and Sydney, are not coping and this circular argument that all we need is better infrastructure and planning and all will be well is arguing backwards. Can we answer first why we want record population growth, and then discuss infrastructure?\n\nThe truth is that successive governments, state and federal, have not improved public transport and housing affordability and facilities for the booming outer suburbs anywhere near the rate that is needed for the current population, let alone for the hapless people who arrive each week.\n\nEven with the will - and if the public were willing to pay for it - few state governments could cope with this level of growth. Some of Melbourne's boom is because people are moving here from interstate - we can't control that. Governments have little control over how many babies we have. But we can control immigration, which, absent a population policy, is our de facto population policy.\n\nThe case for easing immigration is compelling. Even if it's just for a few years, from an annual permanent immigration intake of around 200,000 to 100,000, to catch up. Even if it's just so we can take a breath and think about how big this country should be without having it decided for us by default.\n\nLet me offer two examples from the world's most liveable city, a wry joke if you live here. We are stuck in traffic, long lines of fumes and angry horns, for weeks of our lives. The state government is spending huge amounts on infrastructure, including Victoria's biggest-ever public transport project, the Metro Tunnel, an $11bn underground rail project that will add five new stations and ease bottlenecks. When will it open? Around 2025.\n\nWill our congestion get better? No way. The prediction is that in two decades, half of all car trips in Melbourne at peak times will be congested, up from a third now. And, according to Infrastructure Victoria, that's taking into consideration the planned road and rail upgrades.\n\nLet's take schools. Daniel Andrews' government a few days ago announced that it would spend nearly $240m to buy land for another 14 schools in suburbs with exploding population.\n\nEducation minister James Merlino boasted that 10 new schools opened last year, 11 would open this year and nine next year. That's great. But the Grattan Institute a couple of years ago estimated that Victoria would need 220 news schools within a decade. The school where Merlino chose to make his announcement, the John Henry Primary School in exploding Pakenham, is at capacity and is taking no new enrolments. It opened just last year.\n\nBusinesses and property developers want more and more people because they want bigger markets and more consumers. Most economists seem to like it because they argue it's great for the economy although, as a more sceptical Ross Gittins pointed out, the productivity commission has found its net impacts to be \"negligible\".\n\nAnd it is true that our migrant intake is skewed towards skilled migrants, with a smaller proportion of family reunions, plus this year, 18,750 people on humanitarian visas. There is nothing wrong with our system. The debate is about the sheer numbers, and whether that is serving us well now.\n\nWhat is immigration for? Who is it for? The most curious argument in favour of large population growth is that, somehow, Australians - those here for generations and those recently settled - owe it to the rest of the world to populate quickly. Fairfax's economics correspondent Peter Martin wrote that \"the rest of the world has granted us a licence to use this continent on the implicit understanding that we populate it.\"\n\nReally? Says who? Fellow Fairfax columnist Jessica Irvine wrote that we need to weigh up the \"needs of Australians versus foreigners\" in the immigration debate and she had \"never placed the hopes and dreams of Australians so far above those of foreigners that their needs become unimportant\".\n\nThat's bewildering. Apart from our humanitarian intake - which is a duty for an affluent country like ours - the primary purpose or immigration is to benefit people who already live here, or at least not to worsen their quality of life. The Productivity Commission made that clear, concluding in a 2016 report that it had \"taken the overarching policy objective of immigration to be maximising the wellbeing of existing Australian citizens and permanent residents\".\n\nWe have benefited enormously from immigration. We are a land of immigrants. We will, and should, keep growing and much of that growth will be newcomers settling here. That doesn't mean we shouldn't pause a tad now. Just for a bit. Just so mug citizens like me can ask a few questions about the city I love.\n\nGay Alcorn is a Guardian Australia columnist",

                "body": "The Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has been charged with drug trafficking in a heroin smuggling case that has shocked Greece.\n\nLate on Friday, the Greek public prosecutor Eirini Tziva accused the shipowner businessman of what were described as \"very serious charges\" following a three-year investigation into the Noor 1, a tanker intercepted in the port of Piraeus carrying 2.1 tonnes of heroin in 2014.\n\nMarinakis, 50, was also charged with financing an illegal operation. Three of his close associates were named with him on the charge sheet.\n\nThe judicial inquiry had followed the money, focusing on bank transfers that had raised suspicion. Court sources were quoted as saying that several money transfers had been linked to the impounded vessel and probably used to finance it.\n\nMarinakis, who owns the Greek champions Olympiakos, was not available for comment. The football club's website did not mention the charges, widely derided as a set-up by fans.\n\nThis is not the businessman's first brush with the law. In 2015 he was acquitted of complicity in a match-fixing network whose web extended across seven countries. In that case charges were brought after Uefa detected a pattern of irregular betting patterns in the countries. The magnate, who bought Nottingham Forest 10 months ago in a £50 million takeover, attributed those charges to \"jealous\" critics bent on blighting his Greek team's winning streak. \"Of course I cannot stop our opponents talking or bad-mouthing,\" he said.",

                "body": "A low-profile former regional governor has been sworn in as Peru's president after his predecessor became the latest of the country's leaders to resign amid corruption scandals and public repudiation.\n\nMartín Vizcarra promised to fight corruption \"head on\" before he was sworn in on Friday, hours after congress voted overwhelmingly to accept the resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.\n\nKuczynski, known as PPK, abruptly tendered his resignation on Wednesday after became clear he would not survive a second attempt to impeach him over a new corruption scandal.\n\nThe 79-year-old said he had been the victim of malicious campaign by the dominant political opposition and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLess than two years into a five-year term, Kuczynski is the first sitting president in Latin America to be forced out over ties to the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which has been at the centre of the continent's biggest corruption scandal.\n\nIt has tainted nearly all of Peru's main political players of the last two decades.\n\nKuczysnki is accused of repeatedly lying about decade-old business ties to the Brazilian firm. He narrowly escaped impeachment for \"permanent moral unfitness\" December after apparently striking a backroom deal with Kenji Fujimori, a dissident from the majority opposition party led by his sister Keiko.\n\nThree days later, Kuczynski pardoned the Fujimoris' father Alberto, the former president who was jailed in 2009 for authorising death squads, overseeing rampant corruption and vote-rigging.\n\nBut the move failed to appease Keiko Fujimori, whose party released the secretly filmed videos this week which showed Kuczynski's allies attempting to buy votes from opposition lawmakers to save him from impeachment.\n\n\"It was a gigantic error,\" Martin Tanaka, a political scientist at the Institute of Peruvian Studies, told the Guardian. \"It did nothing to improve his relationship with the Fujimoristas and earned him the hatred and emnity of the anti-Fujimoristas who had supported him throughout the previous attempt to oust him.\"\n\nAmong those former allies, the leader of the leftist Nuevo Peru party Veronika Mendoza, who called for PPK to be ousted and new elections to renew Peru's corruption-ridden system.\n\n\"Our traditional political class has plundered our state,\" she told supporters on Wednesday. \"PPK is not a victim, he's going because he's corrupt and immoral.\"\n\nIt was an embarrassing end to a presidency which began with high hopes that the Oxford and Princeton-educated technocrat could modernise Peru and fight graft.\n\nBut for many Peruvians, some of whom protested in downtown Lima on Thursday night, PPK represented the corrupt political class. Amid clashes with police, protesters chanted to \"get rid of them all\".\n\nVizcarra, the incoming president, faces many challenges - not least his own low profile: an opinion poll earlier this month showed 81% of Peruvians didn't recognise his name.",

                "body": "Rory McIlroy cited fatigue associated with last weekend's long-awaited success at the Arnold Palmer Invitational after his WGC Match Play involvement ended at the group stage. McIlroy's 5&3 loss to the inspired Brian Harman was to prove the Northern Irishman's last competitive outing until the Masters.\n\nMcIlroy had displayed traces of tiredness earlier in the week at Austin Country Club. Such a feeling was perhaps inevitable; the 28-year-old's eye-catching triumph at Bay Hill on Sunday was his first in 18 months. Still, a McIlroy win over Harman would have set up a playoff to reach the last 16. Harman's lead of 3up at the turn was to prove insurmountable to McIlroy, who will head to Augusta next midweek to continue with Masters preparations.\n\n\"Especially after what happened last week, that takes it out of you being in contention, and all that mental energy,\" McIlroy said. \"So I wish I was hanging around for the weekend but I'll rest up and get a little bit of work in before going to Augusta.\n\n\"Bay Hill was tiring. Going from winning on Sunday to travelling on Monday, getting an early practice on Tuesday to play on Wednesday, I didn't have a lot of time to sort of recharge the batteries.\n\n\"I feel like my game is in good shape. I got off to a bit of a scrappy start today. I was two under on the back nine and trying to press but Brian just played really, really well.\n\n\"Obviously it's a couple of days extra at home, that I wasn't planning on. I'll just chill out, rest up a little bit, recharge the batteries, get into the gym. Sort of have a good week training and a good practice week and just get myself ready for Augusta.\"\n\nMcIlroy said he is \"excited\" about his latest tilt at completing a career grand slam. He and his caddie, Harry Diamond, will take to the Masters venue in the company of club members on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nHarman was understandably delighted with progress to the last 16, as heavily influenced by a superb putting display. The left-hander began tournament week as the world No 22. \"Rory did not play his best golf today and I played extremely well,\" Harman said. \"I'm proud of the way I came out. Rory is an intimidating guy. He hits it a mile.\"\n\nThe same applies to Bubba Watson, who has served notice of his Masters intentions by emerging from his group. Watson, a two-times Augusta winner, halved with Julian Suri on Friday having been two down with as many holes to play. Watson will face Harman on Saturday morning.\n\nPhil Mickelson saw off Rafa Cabrera-Bello by a hole but, like McIlroy, was to suffer an early exit. Mickelson will play in next week's Houston Open before chasing what would be a fourth Green Jacket.\n\n\"It feels good to come back and win these last two matches, even though I'm not advancing,\" Mickelson said. \"It goes back to the first day. You need to be ready to play from day one here, because the opportunity to be eliminated is there.\n\n\"I'm going to go up and see Augusta before and spend a couple of days there. And I'm looking forward to this next two weeks' stretch. I would have liked to move on here, though.\"",

                "title": "Bert van Marwijk's debut ends in defeat as Norway thrash Australia",
                "body": "The reign of new Australia coach Bert van Marwijk got off to a stuttering start in Oslo, the Socceroos battered 4-1 by a bullish Norway, sunk thanks to striker Ola Kamara's hat-trick.\n\nSlow moving, often cumbersome in passing and unable to dominate possession, it was not what van Marwijk will have wanted in his first game since taking over from Ange Postecoglou.\n\nBut as he told the Guardian this week the Dutchman is not a magician, and after just two training sessions with his troops it is illogical to expect him to have worked miracles, even against a side ranked 20 places below them.\n\nHowever, few would have expected quite an embarrassment like this. The 65-year-old has three more friendlies and a 30-day Turkey training camp to shape his new team, with the 2018 World Cup in Russia racing towards them. On the evidence from the Ullevaal Stadion he will need every minute and maybe a few more to get exactly what he wants.\n\nVan Marwijk handed attackers Dimi Petratos and Andrew Nabbout, so dynamic in the A-League this season, their debuts and used Aaron Mooy in a screening role alongside skipper Mile Jedinak. As expected he employed the 4-2-3-1 formation that he favoured so often with both Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands.\n\nIt was a quiet start for both teams with few attacking opportunities, the first coming to Fredrik Midtsjø in the seventh minute when he blasted his shot over the Australian goal.\n\nIt was a sign of things to come as the hosts settled quicker and fashioned their first real chance, for Bjørn Maars Johnsen after a sloppy Bailey Wright pass.\n\nIt took 19 minutes for the Socceroos to register an effort on goal - and that was all they needed - as Jackson Irvine powerfully headed home against the run of play from Mooy's corner to put Australia 1-0 up.\n\nBut Kamara should have equalized four minutes later, had the LA Galaxy forward had not drifted offside. Norway enjoyed more of the ball in the opposing half but poor technique often let them down. The Socceroos still remained very susceptible to quick long balls in behind the defence - a hallmark of the Postecoglou era.\n\nOn 30 minutes Tore Reginiussen headed wide from a corner, but a goal was coming for the dominant Norwegians. Five minutes later Mohamed Elyounoussi skipped past a few defenders on the left and classily set up Kamara to tie it up.\n\nIt was much deserved for the European outfit, who were far more comfortable on the bumpypitch than their Antipodean opponents. Norway were unlucky not to take the lead soon after, as again the Basel winger Elyounoussi continued to torment the Aussie back four.\n\nThe score stayed at 1-1 as half-time dawned and the temperature dropped below zero. Australia then started the second half disastrously, falling immediately behind to a simple set-piece.\n\nRosenborg'sReginiussen outjumped Irvine from a straightforward free kick to make it 2-1. In a bid to reorganise his dire defence, van Marwijk took off Wright and brought on debutant Aleksandar Susnjar in the 53rd minute, with Mark Milligan moving to right back.\n\nThe change didn't have desired effect as soon Norway struck again. A badpass from Mat Ryan gifted Kamara a chance for his second, and the MLS-based man was in no mood to waste it.\n\nMassimo Luongo, Tomi Juric and Tom Rogic were brought into action, replacing Mile Jedinak, Nabbout and Irvine, to try and spark the Socceroos into action. Australia's urgency on the ball improved but it was not enough.\n\nRobbie Kruse and Nikita Rukavytsya were also introduced in the dying stages to add some attacking bite, however there was only slight improvement.\n\nIn injury time Kamara rubbed further salt in the Socceroos' wounds, finding space to bend the ball around Ryan and notch his third goal of the evening.\n\nOffering little in attack and disorganized in defence, van Marwijk's maiden match as Australia boss ended in a disappointing defeat. With Colombia next up for the Socceroos in four day's time, not to mention world-class opposition in Russia awaiting, the Dutchman's honeymoon period will quickly vanish.",

                "title": "Greens fixating on Batman leakers miss the real lesson of byelection loss | Katharine Murphy",
                "body": "While the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has worked frantically this week to stitch together an against-the-odds deal to deliver Australia's biggest businesses a tax cut, backed by a trailing chorus of corporate captains on a charm offensive (hi Pauline) - the Greens have been coming to terms with their loss in Melbourne last weekend.\n\nThe first resort from the Greens leadership, in public at least, has been to blame the party's internal divisions for the Batman byelection defeat.\n\nRichard Di Natale opened the batting on Monday by calling for the expulsion of members responsible for leaks against the candidate, Alex Bhathal.\n\nThe Victorian Greens co-convenors, Rose Read and Colin Jacobs, issued a statement noting the campaign had been \"marred by the actions of a person or persons who ... [leaked] confidential information regarding an internal dispute in order to damage the campaign. It is an attack on the very mission of the Greens. It can have no place in our party.\"\n\nThe Batman campaign was certainly marred by leaks, and by personality conflicts, which hampered the party's ground operations.\n\nBut if you are inhabitant of the real world, not a stressed-out occupant of the political hothouse, Di Natale's swingeing public response to the skulduggery looked brittle and over the top.\n\nIf you take a moment to stand in his shoes, the reaction becomes more comprehensible. Obviously there will be a lot of angry true believers to console, party activists and volunteers who spent their weekends door knocking and phone canvassing for a lost cause.\n\nThere's another point that may not be obvious if you've had no exposure to the Greens internal culture. From the vantage point of Di Natale, the culture of the Victorian Greens has been largely collaborative, unlike the riven and punishing party culture that exists north of the border in New South Wales.\n\nIn the mind of the leader, sending a strong public message that Victoria needed to avoid succumbing to the NSW disease was an important and necessary component of the Batman wash-up.\n\nWanting Victoria to avoid the roiling mess of NSW is doubtless a worthy objective. The problem with it, though, is the dissent has already begun, and if you want to chase down the thought criminals, that is a course of action that carries its own consequences.\n\nYou can identify the leakers, perhaps, if they've been naive enough not to cover their tracks, but even if you find people to purge - if your crack investigative team unearths the People's Front of Judea - that process will inevitably open questions, such as how did the internal disaffection get so bad in the country's largest Greens branch that activists were motivated to sabotage their own campaign?\n\nThere's also the problem that your leakers have already made it abundantly clear that going to the media is an accepted part of the toolkit. Hmm. Let's think about this. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nThe other problem with fixating on the leakers is the risk of missing the real lesson.\n\nLet's be blunt. The Greens didn't lose in Batman because colleagues were nasty to Bhathal, although obviously that didn't help.\n\nAnyone watching the Greens at the moment can see a party that doesn't really know where to position itself. It's hard for people to buy what you are selling if you don't quite know what that is.\n\nLet's consider the challenges, one by one. First problem. Labor in the current period of opposition federally has tilted left. That shift has a crowding-out effect.\n\nSecond problem. Di Natale's early disposition as party leader - which was about growing his political movement by positioning the Greens as a serious player capable of doing legislative deals on their merits - wasn't universally loved. Unfortunately for the leader, there is still a strong faction within the Greens that believes politics is about protest and pragmatism is to be avoided at all costs.\n\nThird problem. The decline in the major party vote is generating fragmentation across the spectrum. There are \"anyone but the major parties\" popup political insurgencies proliferating across the country. Even if the party was 100% clear about its mission, the crowded political market place makes it harder for the Greens to be heard. Their collective response to date from the Canberra crew has been to shout louder, and pick fights in the parliamentary chambers with all the subtlety of a bunch of internet trolls. Not that encouraging, frankly.\n\nProblem three leads us to problem four. What are the Greens about nationally in 2018? That's something for the party to determine, self-evidently, but the NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge expressed some views immediately after Batman. \"In recent years we've seen how campaigns without an effective social justice agenda have failed to excite the public. In Tasmania, for example, Greens support at a state level has halved from 21.6% in 2010 to 10.3% in 2018.\n\n\"In comparison the Queensland Greens in the recent state election made a deliberate shift to campaign on economic issues and the environment, and they scored the highest Green state election vote that Queensland has ever seen plus their first MP. We can hold true to our environmental record and principles and also prioritise fixing a system that is causing dangerous social and economic inequality and fuelling climate change and environmental devastation.\"\n\nWhile it would be deeply silly to conclude that Labor has cracked the code of how to hold out Greens insurgencies in the inner-city, ipso facto, the Greens have hit a representative ceiling in the lower house - Batman demonstrates that the ALP is watching, learning and adapting.\n\nLabor cleared a significant barrier for soft-left swinging voters in Batman by choosing Ged Kearney, a candidate they could actually vote for - someone who wasn't Martin Ferguson, a leftwinger who did deals with the right, or the right's defence-obsessed David Feeney.\n\nLabor picked up many of the local issues Bhathal had campaigned on in the 2016 federal election, when she almost grabbed the seat, and Kearney launched an empathy offensive on the ground, sending a clear message the ALP was listening.\n\nIf you want to listen in retrospectively on just one focus group - a lively conversation between a group of progressive voters in Melbourne trying to make up their minds about who to back - have a look at the Facebook page of the Melbourne writer Tony Wilson.\n\nThe thread that follows contains interesting exchanges as locals debate whether the best means of advancing progressive causes would be another Green in the House of Representatives, or a motivated representative in the Labor caucus - if only on a trial basis.\n\nOne participant in the thread says: \"Never been so conflicted in my life as I have at the last two by-elections! I can't believe I'm also leaning towards Ged after 20 years of green voting ... same reasons as you Tony.\n\n\"How can Labor ever change their appalling stand on refugees and the environmental issues if the same old dicks keep getting voted in. Ged is an excellent candidate and would fight hard from within. But the greens have the policies I support. What a dilemma!!! To send a message or to try and actually change the party? I think I have to go red. Particularly since it's only for a year or so ... test drive red?\"\n\nSo while the Greens have a significant task ahead to reposition in light of changing circumstances and to develop some genuine cut-through, the conversation in Wilson's Facebook thread also underscores the fact that the new Labor member for Batman is absolutely on notice from the swinging voters in the south of her constituency.\n\nAfter all, it's one thing to win a campaign. It's another thing entirely to deliver on the expectations you have raised.",

Wherever you are on life's timeline, I think most of us can agree that being a teenager is complicated. There are new emotions to navigate and new pressures and expectations are seemingly thrust upon us.\n\nThroughout the ages, teenagers seem to have universally attracted the disapproval of adults. As a teenager, it can feel like nobody understands what you're going through. But can science now tell us something new about what's going on in our minds - and brains - during this crucial period of life?\n\nTo explore this, Hannah Devlin speaks to neuroscientist Prof Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, who has been investigating this subject for more than a decade, as laid out in her new book, Inventing Ourselves. She takes us through how science is helping understand behaviour in our teenage years.",

                "title": "Rise of digital politics: why UK parties spend big on Facebook",
                "body": "Online advertising is an effective way to get messages across, but the strategy must be smart\n\nFigures released this week by the Electoral Commission are the simplest way to demonstrate the growing influence of Facebook on British politics. Political parties nationally spent about £1.3m on Facebook during the 2015 general election campaign; two years later the figure soared to £3.2m.\n\nIn each election it was the Conservatives that spent the most, with decidedly mixed results. For David Cameron's successful re-election in 2017, the party spent £1.2m; that rose to £2.1m in 2017, but it was far less help to Theresa May.\n\nSam Jeffers, the co-founder of Who Targets Me, a body that tries to monitor political Facebook advertising, says the difference stems from the fact that the Conservatives had a better overall strategy in 2015. \"In 2015 they targeted Lib Dem seats in the south-west; in 2017 they targeted Labour seats in London boroughs, spending money on seats they thought they would win but didn't,\" he says.\n\nNevertheless, the Conservative success was so striking in 2015 that every other political party and campaign group felt it had to follow suit.\n\nThe idea of marketing on Facebook was brought to the UK by the US political consultant Jim Messina, the campaign manager for Barack Obama in 2012, who Tory officials like to say boasted he had \"1,000 pieces of data on every voter in the UK\".\n\nIt was a big change on the traditional model of supplementing canvass returns with broad demographic data supplied by Experian's Mosaic, which divides people into groups such as \"metro high flyers\", \"classic grandparents\" and \"disconnected youth\" - the kind of data used by all the main parties to help deliver targeted mailshots.\n\nThe idea rapidly took hold - and was arguably tailor-made for the EU referendum in 2016. One of the reasons why the Conservatives made heavy use of Facebook marketing was because its canvassing operation is far weaker than Labour's, forcing it to try to identify potential voters using technology.\n\nThe temporary campaigns on both sides of the EU referendum debate had no voting history or canvass data they could rely on, making media and marketing messages even more crucial. Vote Leave, the Boris Johnson-fronted campaign, spent 40% of its total budget, or £2.7m, on the services of AggregateIQ, a little-known digital marketing firm based in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nOn Friday, in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica affair, Dominic Cummings, the campaign director for Vote Leave, downplayed the role of digital marketing in a lengthy blogpost: \"It is hard to change people's minds. We are evolved creatures. If we were all dopey dupes we wouldn't be here, our ancestors would have all been killed.\"\n\nCummings blamed Arron Banks from the Leave.EU campaign, whose operation had a brief association with Cambridge Analytica at the end of 2015. Banks has said that Cambridge Analytica did no work for his group, partly because its offer was contingent on Leave.EU winning the designation to be the official leave campaign and so gaining official access to the UK electoral database, which did not happen.\n\nBut at the time, Cummings said Banks spread \"bullshit about building a 'digital army'\" among \"a powerful network of MPs, donors, peers and assorted 'campaigners'\", who in turn argued Banks should be allowed to control the digital aspects of Vote Leave's campaign.\n\nLabour, too, wanted to revamp its own campaigning. The party was badly bruised by the 2015 loss, and with Jeremy Corbyn it had a 2017 candidate that supporters were eager to back online. The party revamped its Contact Creator software to allow it to target named voters identified by its canvassing via Facebook - and encouraged constituency candidates to do so locally as well.\n\nThe party spent £577,000 nationally on Facebook for the 2017 election, according to Electoral Commission figures, while its candidates in seats spent up to £1,000 each. But the party's agents say that although they would definitely spend on Facebook in the future, they could not be sure how effective their Facebook efforts were. \"Some young people brought it up on the doorstep,\" one experienced agent says. \"But all the data we could see is how many people clicked on our ads.\"\n\nThe spending continues unabated. The Conservative party in the London borough of Wandsworth has released a short video aimed at residents in the run-up to May's local elections, arguing that Wandsworth council, run by the party, \"has the lowest average council tax in the country\". A video encouraging people to join the leftwing organisation Momentum begins by singling out the Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, saying he is \"terrified of our unseat campaign\" because he only has a majority of 2,500.\n\nTom Baldwin, a former communications director of the Labour party under Ed Miliband, who is writing a book on media and politics called Ctrl Alt Del, summarises the role of digital marketing in the last two elections as follows: \"In 2015, Labour lost for all sorts of reasons: voter perceptions of Ed Miliband, views on economic competence, Scotland. But also the Tories understood it was possible to reach people very effectively at very low cost through Facebook. By 2017, Labour had caught up.\n\n\"They spent big on Facebook themselves while having a candidate and a campaign that people were willing to share content from across social media like never before in a UK election. It wasn't the only reason why Theresa May did so badly - she was a bad candidate, running a bad campaign - but it made a difference.\"",

                "title": "Bombs away: John Bolton's most hawkish views on Iran, Iraq and North Korea",
                "body": "Fifteen years ago to the week, the US began its invasion and occupation of Iraq. Among the war's many architects and cheerleaders was John Bolton, at the time a senior adviser to George W Bush on issues of arms control and international security. And while many early invasion supporters have, in the clear view of hindsight, conceded that the decade-plus long odyssey was at least misguided, Bolton has reached no such conclusion.\n\nEven in the war-happy neoconservative Bush administration, Bolton stood out - a hawk among hawks - and his post-Bush career as a public commentator certainly didn't see those leanings tempered. He has advocated, to various degrees, pre-emptive strikes and wars against North Korea and Iran, and overall an aggressive military interventionist programme around the world, coupled with staunch anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\nLate Thursday, Bolton, who is scheduled to takeover for HR McMaster as Trump's national security advisor on 9 April, said on Fox News that all those pronouncements were behind him as he prepares for his new role in the White House.\n\n\"During my career, I have written I don't know how many articles and op-eds and opinion pieces. I have given I can't count the number of speeches, I have countless interviews ... in the past 11 years. They're all out there in the public record. I have never been shy about what my views are,\" Bolton said, adding later, \"Frankly, what I have said in private now is behind me.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"The important thing is what the president says and the advice I give him.\"\n\nStill, here are some of Bolton's most aggressive published views in recent memory which may offer window into exactly what kind of advice he may be about to give to Trump.\n\nDon't talk to North Korea\n\nIn August, when defense secretary Jim Mattis and former secretary of state Rex Tillerson co-published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal outlining their philosophy on North Korea, Bolton said he was \"appalled\" by the tack.\n\n\"Time is not a neutral factor here. Time is an asset for the proliferator,\" he said on Fox News. \"More negotiation with North Korea? I think they'd say bring it on. More time to increase the size and scope of their ballistic missile and nuclear capabilities.\n\n\"The object of our peaceful pressure campaign is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,' Tillerson and Mattis had written. \"Diplomacy is our preferred means of changing North Korea's course of action.\"\n\nPreemptive strike on North Korea\n\nIn a seeming retread of Dick Cheney's infamous insistence that we not wait until the \"smoking gun\" is a \"mushroom cloud\" with respect to Iraq, Bolton argued in the Wall Street Journal in February that a lack of intelligence about North Korea's missile program could justify a military first strike.\n\n\"The threat is imminent, and the case against pre-emption rests on the misinterpretation of a standard that derives from prenuclear, pre-ballistic-missile times,\" he wrote. \"Given the gaps in US intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute. That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation. It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current 'necessity' posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first.\"\n\nPreemptive strike on Iran\n\nIn a 2015 op-ed in the New York Times headlined To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran, Bolton wrote: \"The inescapable conclusion is that Iran will not negotiate away its nuclear program. Nor will sanctions block its building a broad and deep weapons infrastructure...\n\n\"An attack need not destroy all of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, but by breaking key links in the nuclear-fuel cycle, it could set back its program by three to five years. The United States could do a thorough job of destruction...\n\n\"Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.\"\n\nThe piece was published about three months before Barack Obama's secretary of state John Kerry helped successfully negotiate a non-proliferation deal that saw Iran agree to a 98% reduction in its enriched uranium stockpile and a 15-year pause in the development of key weapons infrastructure. That deal is now in peril under Trump.\n\nNo humanitarian obligation to accept Syrian Refugees\n\n\"We have no obligation to bring them into this country,\" Bolton told Fox News' host Jeanine Pirro in 2015 as millions were fleeing the ongoing civil war. Bolton added that in his estimation the US can refuse to allow Syrian refugees entry \"without in any way violating our humanitarian obligations\".\n\nThe only mistake made in Iraq was leaving Iraq\n\nIn the Daily Telegraph in 2016, Bolton wrote that: \"Iraq today suffers not from the 2003 invasion, but from the 2011 withdrawal of all US combat forces. What strengthened Iran's hand in Iraq was not the absence of Saddam [Hussein], but the absence of coalition troops with a writ to crush efforts by the ayatollahs to support and arm Shi'ite militias. When US forces left, the last possibility of Iraq succeeding as a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional state left with them. Don't blame Tony Blair and George W Bush for that failure. Blame their successors.\"\n\nTerrorism is a war not a crime\n\nIn the wake of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris Bolton opined for Fox News that \"This is not a matter for the criminal law, as many American political and academic leaders, including the President [Obama], have insisted... This is a war...\n\n\"The mechanism of response must be to destroy the source of the threat, not prosecute it, not contain it, not hope that we will 'ultimately' destroy it. 'Ultimately' is too far away.\n\n\"Knee-jerk, uninformed and often wildly inaccurate criticisms of programs (such as several authorized in the wake of 9/11 in the Patriot Act) have created a widespread misimpression in the American public about what exactly our intelligence agencies have been doing and whether there was a 'threat' to civil liberties. Now is the time to correct these misimpressions, and to rebut the unfounded criticisms.\"\n\nNobody tell Bolton's new boss, who has dabbled in \"deep-state\" conspiracy thinking throughout his administration.",

It accused him of showing an \"aggressive and insulting attitude\".\n\nSampson was being investigated over his conduct at August's match when he was fired by the Football Association. His dismissal was unrelated and was over \"clear evidence of inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour\" regarding relations with a female player in a previous job. Uefa banned him the following day.\n\nA Uefa report said Sampson had first been verbally abusive to the venue director just before the 60th minute of England's defeat, telling her: \"You better sit down, you little shit.\"\n\nAfter the game Sampson was said to have told the referee liaison officer, Fijke Hoogendijk, outside the referees' changing room: \"You're a fucking disgrace, it's a fucking shame.\"\n\nAccording to Uefa report, he then picked up a metal pillar, raised it aggressively and threw it hard against the floor. \"Fijke was concerned he was going to strike her,\" Uefa said, adding that she felt \"intimidated and offended by his actions\".\n\nSampson is then said to have shut the door to the corridor, saying: \"I'm going to close the fucking door in your fucking face.\"\n\nSampson has denied saying that. The FA accepted that he used inappropriate language during and after the match and that he picked up a metal pole. But it disputed the wording of his language towards Hoogendijk and an assertion that he lifted pole aggressively above his head.\n\nThe FA, Uefa reported, said that Sampson had used the pole \"in order to close the door between the tunnel and the corridor leading to the England player's [sic] changing room\".\n\nSampson unreservedly apologised for the inappropriate language he used during and after the game.",

UCU will consult its branches and members on ending industrial action,\" UUK said in a statement.\n\n\"This would be very good news for our students, who want strike action to stop to prevent further disruption to their studies.\"\n\nUCU's plans are for a further 14 days of strike action until the end of the summer term, which is likely to create difficulties in awarding final exams and could result in some undergraduates being unable to complete their courses.\n\nThe expert panel of actuaries and academics will be able to reopen the controversial valuation of the scheme that led to the long-running strike action.\n\n\"If, in the light of that, contributions or benefits need to be adjusted in either direction, both parties are committed to agree to recommend ... measures aimed at stabilising the fund to provide a guaranteed pension broadly comparable with current arrangements,\" the letter from UUK states.\n\nUCU says members could lose £10,000 each year of their retirement under the proposals, while UUK has previously claimed that substantial reforms were necessary because of changes required by the pensions regulator.\n\nThe latest UUK letter concedes that the presumption for any settlement should be in favour of defined benefits pensions, offering fixed payments after retirement.\n\n\"The work of the group will reflect the clear wish of staff to have a guaranteed pension comparable with current provision whilst meeting the affordability challenges for all parties, within the current regulatory framework,\" the UUK letter states.",

                "body": "Vladimir Uglev, developer of Soviet-era chemical weapons, contradicts Russian denials at existence of novichok nerve agents\n\nA developer of Soviet-era nerve agents related to the one used against former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia has told the Guardian that a similar poison was used in the murder of a Russian businessman in the 1990s.\n\nThe remarks by Vladimir Uglev, a Soviet chemical weapons scientist, contradict official Russian denials that the country had any chemical weapons program tied to the name novichok, with the formal codename foliant.\n\n\"If you're asking who made the substances that poisoned the Skripals, his name and his country, it's possible it was made by my hands,\" Uglev wrote to the Guardian. \"But we're unlikely to find out about that, at least according to the information I have at the moment.\"\n\nUglev is one of three Russian scientists to confirm the existence of the top secret chemical weapons program since the Salisbury attack. His remarks were sent to a handful of journalists on Friday, and he answered follow up questions for the Guardian.\n\nUglev on Friday said he had been questioned by police immediately after the grisly 1995 murders of banker Ivan Kivelidi and his secretary in an apparent poisoning, and recognised a nerve agent synthesised by his own working group at a closed state laboratory near the Volga river.\n\n\"Immediately after Kivelidi's telephone was analysed, the investigator in my case asked me a number of questions as the substance was synthesised in our group,\" Uglev wrote to journalists. He first went public on Wednesday.\n\nCourt documents first reported by Reuters and later published by the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta said that a member of Uglev's lab, Leonid Rink, had been jailed briefly after admitting to selling a small amount of a deadly nerve agent developed under Russia's so-called foliant program.\n\nThat program has become famous in the west in recent days as novichok, identified by British authorities as the Soviet-era nerve agent used in Salisbury earlier this month.\n\nThe likely sale of the nerve agent to a criminal group in the 1990s will raise questions about Theresa May's assurances that only a state could have ordered the attack on Skripal.\n\nBut nerve agents typically deteriorate quickly. And a binary, which increases shelf life by storing the future nerve agent in two stable precursors, was never achieved at his laboratory, Uglev said.\n\nNevertheless, he speculated it could remain potent for some time. \"If properly stored, I imagine it could poison someone even 50 years later,\" he wrote.\n\nUglev worked in the State Scientific Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology in the city of Shikhany, Saratov region, from 1972 until 1993. He said he handled foliant nerve agents for the last time in 1990. They were not on the list of chemical weapons submitted by Russia as part of the Chemical Weapons Convention signed in 1993.\n\nIn follow-up remarks to the Guardian, Uglev said he knew of three people who had died as a result of accidents while developing novichok: a scientist named Andrei Zheleznyakov and \"two officers who held tests on our testing range\".\n\nAsked by the Guardian about what the chances are that British investigators might be able to tie the novichok to a specific country or lab, he said \"probably close to zero\".\n\n\"They have the footprint of the substance in Salisbury ... but no data about the substance (its fingerprint) in the database, so how can they say where it is from,\" he wrote.\n\nThat could change, he added, if they are able to gather earlier samples from Soviet and Russian labs. Russian police, he noted, were able to identify him quickly after the death of Kivelidi, the businessman, in 1995.\n\nThe poisons he helped develop in the 1970s and 1980s were especially lethal, he added.\n\n\"If any of these four substances\" were used to poison the Skripals, he wrote, referring to several chemicals he helped developed, then \"their chances are nil\".\n\n\"But medicine doesn't stay in one place, and perhaps in the last 30 years, during which I've been out of the system, something has changed for the better.\"",

                "body": "Staff at the army's foundation college were accused of 50 cases of assaulting or mistreating teenage recruits between 2014 and 2017, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nAllegations made by 16 and 17-year-old soldiers or their parents and guardians about staff at the Army Foundation College (AFC) in Harrogate, north Yorkshire, included assault, battery and ill-treatment.\n\nThe revelations follow the collapse of court proceedings earlier this week against 16 AFC Harrogate instructors who had been accused of abusing recruits.\n\nDuring the proceedings, junior soldiers claimed they were slapped or punched, spat at, verbally abused and ordered to eat manure during a battle camp exercise in June 2014.\n\nThe case was thrown out, with a judge heavily criticising the way the Royal Military Police (RMP) had investigated the allegations and the time it took to get the case to court.\n\nNow data obtained by the charity Child Soldiers International, which campaigns for the minimum age for soldiers to be raised, puts the focus back on the college, where almost all junior soldiers undergo training.\n\nA freedom of information request revealed that between January 2014 and August 2017, there were 50 cases of alleged violent behaviour.\n\nThere is no detail about what happened to the staff and it is possible some may have been among those involved in the case thrown out this week. The MoD said it could not say how many individuals were involved because of confidentiality issues.\n\nSeparately, data obtained by the MP Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, shows that in the past decade, there have been about 50 investigations conducted by the RMP into staff at the college - approximately half of them relating to assault or ill-treatment. In around 15 cases, the allegations were proven.\n\nRachel Taylor, the director of programmes at Child Soldiers International, said: \"It is unimaginable that a sixth-form boarding school could receive 50 formal complaints of violent behaviour by members of staff in the course of three years, and not be shut down or at least subjected to serious external scrutiny.\n\n\"It takes enormous courage for a teenager to speak out against a superior officer in an intimidating environment where being perceived as weak or disloyal can be grounds for immediate dismissal and there are likely to be many more such incidents which went unrecorded.\n\n\"These figures show there is either a serious and ongoing problem of abuse, or simply that these adolescents are routinely so unprepared for the reality of army life that they believe they are being assaulted when they are actually undergoing routine training.\n\n\"This naivety is unsurprising when you recall that none of these recruits are old enough to watch a graphic war film or play Call of Duty on the Xbox. Whatever the reason is for this staggering number of complaints, it is clear that the army is a wholly unsuitable environment for adolescents and the MoD must raise the minimum enlistment age to 18 as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nSaville Roberts added: \"The UK government needs to join the international community and raise the age of recruitment so that minors are no longer entering the armed forces.\"\n\nReem Abu-Hayyeh, a peace and security campaigner at the public health charity Medact, said: \"It is clear that the military does not sufficiently safeguard the wellbeing and health of minors. The UK government should join the majority of the world and stop recruiting under-18s to the armed forces.\"\n\nAn army spokesperson said: \"We care about our soldiers above all else and do everything we can to ensure they live and train in a safe and secure environment. All allegations of mistreatment are treated very seriously and we encourage any allegation of unacceptable behaviour to be raised. If individuals are found guilty of mistreatment appropriate disciplinary action taken will be taken.\"",

                "body": "The shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith, has been sacked by Jeremy Corbyn after advocating a public referendum over the final Brexit deal.\n\nSmith, who challenged Corbyn for the party leadership in 2016, wrote an article in the Guardian urging his party to reopen the question of whether Brexit was the right thing for Britain.\n\nSources close to the Labour leader said Smith was not a team player and had repeatedly breached shadow cabinet collective responsibility on Brexit, by advocating single market membership.\n\nIn the article for the Guardian on Friday, Smith said his party could only \"serve democracy\" by recommending a poll on the Brexit deal. \"Labour needs to do more than just back a soft Brexit or guarantee a soft border in Ireland,\" he said.\n\n\"Given that it is increasingly obvious that the promises which the Brexiters made to the voters, especially but not only their pledge of an additional £350m a week for the NHS, are never going to be honoured, we have the right to ask if Brexit remains the right choice for the country. And to ask, too, that the country has a vote on whether to accept the terms and true costs of that choice once they are clear,\" he wrote.\n\nHe will be replaced by Tony Lloyd, the shadow housing minister, who returned to parliament in 2017 after an unsuccessful attempt to become Labour's mayoral candidate for Manchester.\n\nCorbyn said: \"Tony is a highly experienced former government minister who is committed to ensuring that peace in Northern Ireland is maintained and helping to steer the devolution deal back on track.\"\n\nDemanding a second referendum was the most distinctive policy position on which Smith fought his leadership bid. He was convincingly defeated by Corbyn, but his views may chime with the party's pro-remain base. When polled, members are strongly in favour of remaining in the single market and the customs union - and many would like to see Brexit stopped.\n\nCorbyn has repeatedly insisted it is not Labour's policy to offer voters a chance to consider the final Brexit deal at the ballot box - though he argues that Theresa May would have little choice but to call a general election if she lost the key vote in parliament on the agreement.\n\nSmith said remaining in both the customs union and the single market were the only way of preventing what he warns would be the \"hardest ever\" border in Ireland.\n\nHe said: \"The damage a disorderly and ill-thought-out Brexit could do in Ireland is enormous. We are often told Brexit threatens to 'reimpose' a so-called hard border on the island of Ireland, but that understates the problem because the economic border that a hard Brexit would create on Ireland would be the hardest ever.\"",

                "body": "The ballad of the Netherlands and England lopes along to a strange rhythm. All of the early matches were friendlies. The only game before the war was settled by Fred Worrall of Portsmouth in 1935. After it, Chelsea's Tommy Lawton went goal crazy at Leeds Road in 1946, scoring four times in an 8-2 rout at Huddersfield Town's old ground. Another notable game featured Johan Cruyff teasing the English in 1977, the 2-0 final score no reflection on the gulf in quality between the sides.\n\nCue a sudden burst of (mainly) memorable competitive action. Marco van Basten knocked England out of Euro 88; there was a goalless borefest at Italia 90; Ronald Koeman ensured England didn't reach USA 94; England got some revenge with that 4-1 thrashing at Euro 96.\n\nBut since then, it's been all friendlies again. Seven of them since 2001, and England haven't won a single one. They've lost the last two, both at Wembley, 3-2 and 2-1. Time for some payback at the Johan Cruijff ArenA, where they last played in 2009, coming back from two down to draw, Jermain Defoe the hero?\n\nEngland are six matches unbeaten, since going down 3-2 in France back in June. That run has taken in fixtures against Germany and Brazil, two of the favourites for the World Cup in the summer, so Gareth Southgate's men will be in good cheer. The Netherlands meanwhile are also on a run of their own: a five-match winning streak, put together since they too were downed by France, 4-0 last August. It wasn't enough to qualify them for Russia, the early damage to their World Cup hopes too great, but a good run is a good run is a good run. Something's got to give this evening, then.\n\nEngland will hope for a result that'll put them in good cheer for the World Cup. The Netherlands meanwhile are playing the long game ahead of some hot Nations League action with Germany and France in the autumn. It could be a fascinating evening's play. It could be a damp squib too, but let's look on the bright side: it's on!\n\nKick off: 8.45pm in Amsterdam, 7.45pm back in Blighty.",

                "body": "It is not exactly the most exciting household purchase: we buy one on average every 12 years, they cost hundreds of pounds - if not thousands - and they hardly enhance the look of your home.\n\nBut new businesses like Eve Sleep, Simba and Casper, which look and act like tech firms, are using massive marketing budgets to make the rather dull business of buying a new mattress seem like fun and promote the idea of a \"bed in a box\" that is delivered to your front door like a pizza.\n\nWhile several traditional bed firms, including Feather & Black and Warren Evans, have gone bust in recent months the new sellers have waded into the bed business and stolen a 5% slice of the annual market, up from zero four years ago. There are predictions that could reach 20% in the next three years.\n\nAnother major player, Bensons for Beds, is struggling for survival amid financial difficulties at its parent company Steinhoff.\n\n\"We believe it is a game changing shift,\" says Jas Bagniewski, co-founder and chief executive of British start-up Eve, where sales are rising by more than 100% a year in the UK.\n\n\"We have a better priced and more engaging aspirational brand, a much better customer offer and you can get it delivered next day. If you look at the more traditional brands you can see they are struggling.\"\n\nThe three new firms all boast about the science behind their products, but they are basically just foam and/or springs like any other.\n\nThe key innovation is that they squash their mattresses flat, roll them, pop them in a box and deliver them within a week or even next day - all at a price often lower than available for a similar mattress on the high street.\n\nIt is a very long way from the more traditional trip to a bed specialist or department store and the embarrassing business of trying them out in public and then waiting weeks for manufacture and delivery.\n\nThe new mattress firms offer a three month sale or return if they prove too hard or too soft for a good night's sleep. About 12% of Eve's mattresses are returned, down from 17% a year ago.\n\nAnyone worried that they might be buying a new mattress that someone else has previously slept on for weeks before deciding it was not for them can rest easy: those sent back are re-covered and then sold as secondhand through third party sites such as eBay.\n\nAll three of the firms started in 2014. Casper is a privately owned US firm which has already expanded to countries including the UK, Austria and Switzerland. It shares investors with tech firms like Twitter and Snapchat.\n\nSimba and Eve are UK firms, with Simba being backed by Richard Reed, an entrepreneur who has already made one fortune as a co-founder of Innocent drinks and Richard Goldstein of the family that founded Superdrug.\n\nEve's investors include Channel 4 and star City investor Neil Woodford.\n\nEve, which sold 32,000 mattresses last year, floated on the London AIM market last year and the company, though loss-making, is now valued at around £150m.\n\nPatrick O'Brien an analyst at City research group GlobalData reckons the new way of buying means online will account for 20% of sales by 2021.\n\nHe reckons Bensons for Beds is particularly vulnerable to the new competition, because deliveries take too long, are too expensive and the store chain has failed to develop its own online alternative.\n\nBut most of the traditional players are not taking the new competition lying down.\n\nJohn Lewis is now selling Simba on its website, while at the cheaper end of the market Argos is offering a same day delivery service and market leader Ikea's shoppers can carry their new mattress away the same day.\n\nBed specialist Dreams has created its own bed in a box under a trendy new brand Hyde & Sleep and the company's chief executive Mike Logue says sales soared 256% last year. \"We need to be in that space and to have that offer,\" he said.\n\nHe reckons all the money piling into marketing mattresses will persuade Brits to replace their sleeping set-up more often than the current 12 years and could boost the market overall.\n\nHe also thinks the new mattress sellers will struggle to make a profit \"When [online specialists] spend that amount of marketing money, they are going to sell some products. The job is to try and make some money out of selling them. We are break even at best - and we are making it ourselves.\n\nEve for instance, revealed a £19m loss last year, up from £11m the year before - mainly because it spent nearly half the value of its £28m in sales on marketing.\n\nThat would be enough to give many investors sleepless nights - but so far they are not sending their mattresses back.",

Her time at Greenham was peppered with arrests, the last when she was 78 for criminal damage, and she had several sojourns in Holloway prison.\n\nBorn in Brechin, Angus, Peggy was the eighth of nine children of Elizabeth (nee Duncan) and Joseph Mitchell. Her father had been a tailor but did not return to work after being gassed during first world war service. After leaving Bank Street school, Brechin, Peggy earned 10 shillings (50p) a week at the local weavers, almost all of which went to her mother for board.\n\nIn the 1930s she spent a brief period in London as a domestic servant at the home of the editor of Punch magazine, but then returned to Brechin and became increasingly politically active. In 1936, having heard the general secretary of the Communist party of Great Britain, Harry Pollitt, speak in Lesmahagow, near Lanark, she joined the Young Communist League and remained with the party for the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1941, during the second world war, she met Jack Walford, a machinist at a \"shadow\" aircraft factory run by Coventry Gauge & Tool in Brechin. Both were committed trade unionists and they married in 1942. Jack was called up in 1943 and did not leave the forces until 1950. In 1953, they and their young family settled in Coventry.\n\nPeggy's political interests led to two memorable family holidays. In 1969, Peggy, Jack and four children squashed into a Hillman Minx estate, with a co-driver, and drove to Kiev in the Soviet Union. As man landed on the moon, they were in Timișoara, Romania, their young twins listening to events on a transistor radio. The following year they travelled to Moscow, this time slightly less cramped, in a caravanette.\n\nIn 1986 Peggy's campaigning again took her to Moscow, where she was arrested and deported for unfurling an anti-nuclear banner in Gorky Park. She also travelled to Libya for a peace conference in 1990.\n\nPeggy left Greenham for a few months in 1989 when Jack died, and in the late 90s her arthritis sometimes brought her home for longer periods, but she was always determined to return.\n\nIn her later years her daily copy of the Morning Star newspaper was always read avidly and debated with gusto. It was awaiting collection when she died in hospital after a short illness.\n\nTwo sons, Ian and Trevor, predeceased Peggy. She is survived by her daughter, June, and son, Brian, six grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.",

                "body": "My father, Jaginder Singh Brar, who has died aged 79, was a founder member of the Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara, the Sikh temple in Southall, London, and went on to use his experience to lead the establishment of a thriving Sikh community in Reading.\n\nAs one of six founding trustees, he rallied the few dozen Sikhs in Reading in the early 1970s to buy a spiritual home. They needed £26,000 to buy the property. Trustees used their homes as security to borrow £12,000. The rest came from a two-year fundraising mission led by my father.\n\nAt the time, Sikhs in the UK were campaigning against a ruling forcing Sikh men to wear a helmet while riding motorcycles. The fight led to the Motorcycle Crash Helmets (Religious Exemption) Act 1976. On his fundraising trips, Jaginder would recite poems in support of the campaign - including one that ran \"This is the turban that fought the last two world wars without the helmet; no one cared back then, so why now?\"\n\nHe was born in Ipoh, Malaysia, one of six children of Naranjan Kaur and Dalbara Singh, who was in the British military police. When Jaginder was nine his father retired and the family went to live in India. Between the ages of nine and 17 he studied, farmed the land and was a skilful kabaddi player. At 17, with a one-way ticket and his father's blessing, he went back to Malaysia. There he learned to read and write English, and to drive cars and trucks, and had various jobs, including chauffeur at the Burmese embassy.\n\nIn 1962 Jaginder returned to India and married Surjit Kaur, a seamstress. It was an arranged marriage: their fathers had been in the military police in Malaysia together. Later that year, with opportunities few and far between in India for Sikhs, he moved to the UK, living in Southall. He was a lorry driver working on the M4, which was being built at the time.\n\nAfter two years he moved to Reading, where a friend ran a bakery, and my mother came over to join him; she went on to work as a volunteer at the Gurdwara. They would often welcome families new to the country to stay in their home for days, weeks or even years.\n\nFrom 1976 Jaginder worked as a driver and loader for British Airways; he took early retirement in 1992, but walked into another job at Cater-Air within weeks. He left there after five years and then worked on the rail-air buses between Reading and Heathrow, then finally bought a black cab and worked until 2003.\n\nHe particularly enjoyed travelling and cooking.\n\nMy mother died in 2006. Dad is survived by three daughters, Baljit, Rajwant and Sarbjit, by two sons, Randhir and me, by seven grandsons, and by a brother and a sister.",

                "body": "Jeremy Corbyn was embroiled in a fresh antisemitism row on Friday after conceding he was wrong to support a graffiti artist whose \"offensive\" work was scrubbed off a wall in London's East End.\n\nIn a Facebook post in 2012, Corbyn offered his backing to Los Angeles-based street artist Mear One, whose mural, featuring several known antisemitic tropes, was due to be removed after complaints.\n\nMear One said: \"Tomorrow they want to buff my mural Freedom of Expression. London Calling, Public art.\"\n\nCorbyn replied: \"Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.\"\n\n\"In 2012, Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on the grounds of freedom of speech. However, the mural was offensive, used antisemitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed,\" said a statement released by the Labour party on Friday.\n\nThe mural, which was subsequently scrubbed off, pictured several apparently Jewish bankers playing a game of Monopoly, with their tabletop resting on the bowed naked backs of several workers.\n\nLabour MP Luciana Berger raised the issue with Corbyn's office - and tweeted on Friday afternoon that she was not satisfied with the statement issued by the Labour press office.\n\nCorbyn has been accused of failing to crack down on a series of cases of antisemitism in recent months.\n\nHe recently admitted being a member of a closed Facebook group called Palestine Live, in which a number of antisemitic posts appeared - though he did not join in the conversations, and left the group in 2015.\n\nWhen the existence of the group was revealed earlier this month, Corbyn told reporters: \"Had I seen it, of course, I would have challenged it straight away, but I actually don't spend all my time reading social media.\n\n\"I have never trawled through the whole group. I have never read all the messages on it. I have removed myself from it. Obviously, any antisemitic comment is wrong. Any antisemitism in any form is wrong.\"\n\nSome Labour MPs have also expressed concerns about the case of Ken Livingstone, who remains suspended over a series of controversial remarks.\n\nAt prime minister's questions on Wednesday, Theresa May sought to capitalise on the issue in the run-up to May's local elections.\n\n\"The message is clear: if you believe in good local services, want to see more homes built and want to tackle antisemitism, there is no place for you in the Labour party,\" May said.\n\nSome of Corbyn's allies, including Derby North MP Chris Williamson, have suggested that the issue of antisemitism is being \"weaponised\" by those critical of Corbyn's leadership.",

                "title": "Elon Musk nods to #DeleteFacebook effort as Tesla and SpaceX pages vanish",
                "body": "Elon Musk appeared to join the #DeleteFacebook movement on Friday, taking down official pages for two of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, after he learned - apparently for the first time - that the pages existed.\n\nThe billionaire chief executiveengaged in some light-hearted Twitter trolling on Friday morning, responding to WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton's tweet urging people to delete the social network with the query, \"What's Facebook?\"\n\nWhen a Twitter user brought up the fact that SpaceX has a profile on the massive social media platform and asked whether he would put his money where his mouth was, Musk responded: \"I didn't realize there was one. Will do.\"\n\nMusk also said that he had \"literally never seen it even once\", presumably breaking the heart of the social media staffer whose job it was to create and manage the page in the first place.\n\nMinutes later, both the Facebook pages of both Tesla and SpaceX had been deactivated.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson declined to comment on the motivation.\n\nFacebook has faced an onslaught of criticism from elected officials, former employees, the press and its own users in the wake of the Observer's reporting that personal information about 50 million US Facebook users was harvested largely without users' knowledge or consent and then improperly given to the political consultancy company Cambridge Analytica.\n\nBut Musk has long had a touchy relationship with Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn 2016, Zuckerberg was a touch less than gracious about the accidental explosion of a SpaceX rocket carrying a satellite intended for use on his Internet.org project. \"I'm deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX's launch failure destroyed our satellite,\" he wrote at the time.\n\nMusk also addressed that brouhaha, responding to a reporter's tweet about the incident: \"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance.\"\n\nThe rival billionaires have also traded barbs over artificial intelligence. Musk has long pushed for regulation of AI, warning that the technology poses a \"fundamental risk to the existence of civilization\".\n\nIn July 2017, Zuckerberg addressed Musk's views in a Facebook Live broadcast, stating that focusing on \"doomsday scenarios\" was \"really negative\" and \"pretty irresponsible\".\n\nMusk shot back in a tweet, saying: \"I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.\"\n\nStill, Musk's commitment to deleting Facebook does not appear to extend to Instagram, the photo sharing service owned by Facebook where the billionaire frequently shares selfies and snapshots of his travels, cars, and rockets.\n\nAsked about his continued use of Instagram, Musk tweeted: \"It's borderline. FB influence is slowing creeping in.\"",

                "title": "Neil Gaiman on Coraline the terrifying opera: 'Being brave means being scared'",
                "body": "The writer's gripping tale of a young girl trapped in a button-eyed world has been turned into a macabre opera. Did they tone down the horror? Our writer meets composer Mark-Anthony Turnage as she goes backstage\n\n'Fairytales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\" This is how Neil Gaiman prefaced Coraline, his 2002 novel for children, attributing the quote to GK Chesterton. But, in characteristic Gaiman style, he has since admitted he largely made it up in a hurried paraphrase of something Chesterton once wrote that is less catchy.\n\nNever mind, the sentiment stands. Coraline has been turned into an opera by composer Mark-Anthony Turnage, with a libretto by Rory Mullarkey, and the dragon-beater with us in the rehearsal room today is soprano Robyn Allegra Parton, who is wearing yellow wellies and an expression of exasperation at the shortcomings of her mother, a look any parent will recognise. Parton is one of two singers sharing the title role; the part is too gruelling to sing twice in one day.\n\nThe action takes place in parallel worlds: the flat in which Coraline lives with her too-busy parents, and an eerily similar one next door, accessed via a previously unnoticed door. Sitting in on the rehearsal, I watch as Parton crawls through the door into the Other Flat - only to find Kitty Whately, the singer playing her mother. But now Whately is the Other Mother, smiling relentlessly, ready to offer Coraline \"whatever you want in the whole wide world!\" And she is now wearing something akin to goggles: her eyes are covered with large black buttons sewn with fierce red thread. How Whateley can see through them is anyone's guess.\n\nThe button eyes are a macabre touch that places Gaiman's story firmly in the Grimms' Fairy Tales tradition. And there's more than a touch of Hansel and Gretel in Coraline's themes of parental abandonment, an initially appealing but evil mother figure, and a brave child who conquers her fears to win the day. \"I'd wanted to write a story for my daughters,\" says Gaiman in the introduction to the 10th-anniversary edition, \"that told them something I wished I'd known when I was a boy: that being brave doesn't mean you aren't scared. Being brave means you are scared, really scared, badly scared, and you do the right thing anyway.\"\n\nGaiman's book verges on classic status and Henry Selick's 2009 stop-motion animated film brought this tale of a lonely but resourceful 11-year-old to an even wider audience. But its familiarity is a blessing and a curse. The sense of ownership people feel towards a favourite story means they will come to the show with fixed ideas. Couple that with the fact that adapting a book for the stage always involves cutting and condensing, and you risk infuriating what should be your biggest fans.\n\nGaiman, however, is relaxed. \"Everything changes when you move from medium to medium,\" he emails from South Africa, where he is working on a screen version of Good Omens, the 1990 novel he co-wrote with Terry Pratchett. \"Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes you sigh, sometimes you urged it to happen.\"\n\nTurnage and Mullarkey have omitted the aloof, sardonic cat who is a sounding board for Coraline's thoughts and eventually helps her rescue her real parents from the clutches of the Other Mother. \"This is the sort of thing people get very hung up about,\" says Turnage. \"But the cat has been replaced by the orchestra, really. You have to take a lot out, but you put it back in different ways. \"\n\nIt is a point echoed by Mary Bevan, the soprano sharing the role with Parton. \"In the film, the action happens around Coraline. In the opera, she sings about it. So it's not as if you're just seeing a replay of the film. That would be boring.\"\n\nThe world Coraline enters through the mysterious door is uncannily like her own, except for the button eyes - but its music isn't the same. Not exactly. \"The material repeats,\" says Turnage, \"but it's slightly stranger - more sickly, a little more yucky. There are quite a few waltzes. They're a bit more distorted and odd, not very pleasant. It's more clean and straightforward in the real house, with her real mum and dad.\"\n\nThis is Turnage's first full-length chamber opera since he made his name as an angry young composer with Greek 30 years ago. Coraline has an orchestra of only 15 players, a departure from what has become his full-orchestral comfort zone - but, as he explains, \"the point is that should be practical\" - it's a piece designed to travel.\n\nMoreover, this is his first time writing for a family audience - the opera is being advertised as suitable for anybody eight or older. Is it any easier producing work for children? \"It's harder,\" says Gaiman, \"and you need to be more aware of what you're doing. Adults are more forgiving and more willing to put up with being bored than children are.\"\n\nThat doesn't have to mean compromise though. Turnage is scathing about the idea of pitching it at the kid who's got the shortest attention span. \"Nonsense!\" They all agree: what is really needed is not simplicity, or brevity, but directness of communication (although, at 90 minutes, Coraline is reasonably concise).\n\nThe performances won't have surtitles, , but director Aletta Collins is confident that the words and meaning will come across. \"You do it as if it were Mozart or Janáček - you go for the clarity.\" Translations of the libretto are already being made for when her staging travels to co-producing theatres in Sweden, Germany and France.\n\nWhile Coraline is a children's story, it's a gloriously terrifying one, even - or perhaps especially - for adult readers. Have the opera's creators felt the need to dilute any of its creepiest aspects? Absolutely not, says Turnage. \"There is a school of thought that says you should protect children from scary stories. I think that's ridiculous. It's what growing up is all about.\"\n\nIn any case, this is an opera with a message - and the scary stuff is absolutely necessary, because the message has to do with conquering fear itself. Bevan says the ending gives her goosebumps, while Collins talks about it like a woman on a mission. \"Especially now, when there's so much talk about what the future for our young women is, to be working on a piece that ends with a young woman saying, 'I can open any door, I'm not scared any more, I'm ready' - that is thrilling.\"\n\nBut Coraline is not only for girls, she stresses. \"It is about young people keeping their chin up, navigating their way to the next part of their life. This is a piece that celebrates that, encourages that, and absolutely confirms it's possible.\"\n\n* Coraline is at the Barbican, London, 29 March-7 April. Box office: 020-7304 4000.",

But many companies are holding back on reporting their gender pay gap until the last minute.\n\nRachel Reeves, the chair of the BEIS select committee, said: \"Transparency on gender pay is only the beginning. We need to examine why these pay gaps persist, why within the same sector there may be companies with wildly differing pay-gaps, and what remedies are needed to tackle them.\"\n\nShe said excessive executive pay was \"at root an issue of fairness\". She said the committee would also look at whether the new reporting scheme was properly capturing the salaries of staff, and what steps companies were taking to address the pay gap.\n\n\"Pay awards for top bosses which vastly outstrip worker pay and which owe little to building genuine long-term value in a company are impossible to justify and damage the social contract between business and the public. Unjustified executive pay awards are the most corrosive influence on public trust in business and businesses must face up to their responsibilities and tackle this problem. If businesses don't step up on executive pay, government will need to step in.\"\n\nCompanies which do not report by midnight on 4 April will face sanctions administered by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Ultimately, they could face an unlimited fine.",

                "body": "Housing secretary approved 700-home development in Ilford which has 50% affordable housing policy\n\nThe housing secretary, Sajid Javid, is facing a legal challenge after he approved a 700-home housing scheme by the supermarket chain Sainsbury's, which includes just 4% affordable housing.\n\nThe 29-storey development in Ilford, east London, will be built in a borough that has a stated policy that 50% of all new homes should be affordable. It estimates it needs an extra 15,000 affordable homes in the next 15 years, but Javid backed a scheme with just 27 affordable homes. The rest are expected to be sold for about £400,000 for a two bedroom flat.\n\nThe London mayor, Sadiq Khan, branded the approval \"outrageous \" and said 4% was a \"disgraceful\" contribution. Labour's shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said it was \"a clear case of ministers backing private developer profit over the homes that local people need\".\n\nA local residents group Ilford Noise is now preparing to request a judicial review of the decision after Javid accepted Sainsbury's claim that the scheme would not be viable with any more affordable units. Javid's report concluded: \"There is no good reason to dispute the agreed conclusions of the financial experts.\"\n\nThe decision came just weeks after Javid gave a speech insisting it is \"totally unacceptable\" for developers to claim they cannot afford to meet affordable housing promises.\n\nHe said: \"It cheats communities of much-needed housing and infrastructure and gives new development a bad name.\"\n\nBut in this case, where Sainsbury's never promised more than 4%, he has allowed the developer to hugely undershoot the local target.\n\nAcross England, the number of affordable homes delivered by the so-called section 106 agreements with developers halved from 32,000 in 2008-09 to 16,000 in 2015-16, according to analysis by Oxford Brookes University.\n\n\"If we can't build affordable housing in outer London where can we build it?\" said Meenakshi Sharma, a co-founder of Ilford Noise, which has branded the amount of affordable housing in the Sainsbury's scheme \"ridiculous and insulting\". \"It is the poorest people who are getting the shortest end of the stick.\"\n\nSharma said the government had prioritised meeting total housing targets rather than seeking to meet the chronic shortage of affordable homes. Javid's decision notice points out that the Sainsbury's development would represent 60% of one year's target for the whole of the borough.\n\nThe London Borough of Redbridge, which had originally rejected the scheme before switching to support, branded the ruling good news for residents who \"are set to benefit from more affordable housing\". It suggested that a clause which states that \"if viability were to improve, the affordable housing offer would improve proportionately\" and could lead to more cheaper homes than the 4%.\n\nBut Khan said: \"The government's decision shows just how out of touch they are with the needs of Londoners. Ministers are merely paying lip service to tackling the housing crisis as evidenced in this outrageous decision. Both City Hall and the local council recognised the amount of affordable housing on offer was simply unacceptable - and government decisions like this are not in the best interests of the capital.\"\n\nA Sainsbury's spokesperson said: \"We're pleased with the outcome of the appeal as our plans will support Ilford's regeneration by driving growth, creating new jobs and providing a broad mix of housing for the community.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government is yet to comment.",

                "body": "Toby Young has stepped down from his government-funded job as head of a charity supporting new free schools, blaming the pressure of media attention.\n\nThe journalist's decision to leave the New Schools Network follows the controversy that erupted earlier this year when Young was appointed a director of the universities regulator, which catapulted his lurid comments on women and eugenics into the public spotlight.\n\nYoung's resignation as chief executive of the NSN - for which he was paid £90,000 a year according to the charity's accounts - came after the Guardian revealed the Department for Education's reluctance to renew the charity's grant while Young remained at its helm.\n\nIn spite of its reservations, the DfE is expected to renew the grant to the NSN, previously worth around £3m, after no other applicants responded to the department's tender last month, leaving it with little choice.\n\nIn a statement posted on its website on Friday, the NSN said: \"The trustees of New Schools Network announced that Toby Young has resigned.\n\n\"Toby has concluded that the media attention his continuing presence at the helm of NSN is attracting has become a distraction from the vital work it is doing and, for that reason, he has decided to step down.\"\n\nThe trustees said it would announce a replacement \"in due course,\" and concluded: \"The trustees are grateful for Toby's work during his time here and wish him well in his future endeavours.\"\n\nThe NSN did not respond to the Guardian's inquiries about the DfE grant or Young's status on Thursday.\n\nA DfE spokesperson said: \"The role of director is entirely a matter for New Schools Network's trustees.\"\n\nLayla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: \"In the light of the blatant cronyism we saw over Toby Young's appointment to the board of the Office for Students, it was clear any money linked to the NSN needed to be properly scrutinised. I'm glad he has recognised his position has become toxic to the organisation.\"\n\nIn his statement, Young paid tribute to the NSN's staff. \"NSN is a wonderful charity and it has been a great honour to serve as its director,\" he said.\n\nThe move is Young's third resignation since the new year, the first being his ill-fated appointment as a non-executive director of the Office for Students, the new higher education regulator.\n\nThe initial reaction centred on his past record of lewd comments about women, including their breasts. The controversy later widened to include controversial statements from his years as a provocative columnist for the Spectator and other publications.\n\nYoung also resigned as a director of the Fulbright Commission that oversees student scholarships between British and US universities.\n\nBut Young had hoped to hang on to his role at the NSN, a subject close to his heart after he successfully co-founded one of the first free schools in England, the West London Free School, in 2011.\n\nA former colleague of Young's said: \"Ultimately, the relationship between free schools and Toby was too close to be healthy.\n\n\"He was, certainly in his own view, Mr Free School. It is undoubtedly true that the programme achieved more with him behind it in the early days. Yet go forward eight years and it is also true that his presence is doing more harm than good to the wider free school movement.\"\n\nThe NSN was intended to help guide local groups and parents through the DfE's application process for opening free schools. But, in recent years, as the government's enthusiasm waned, the majority of free school applications have come from existing multi-academy trusts which did not need the NSN's help.\n\nMeanwhile, the drive for local groups has faltered, with some at the DfE blaming Young and his predecessor, Nick Timothy, who was also a former aide to Theresa May, for failing to appeal to parents eager to open free schools.\n\nIt is understood that the DfE is making cuts to the NSN's grant to reflect the lower demand for its services, and will reduce funding for its Academy Ambassadors programme which had struggled to recruit qualified trustees to serve on the boards of multi-academy trusts.",

                "body": "Social media gave the powerless a weapon but it was wrenched away by firms such as Facebook and Cambridge Analytica\n\nI blame the T-shirts. The casual wear favoured by those founding wunderkinds of tech - Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Sergey Brin, Larry Page and the rest - lulled us into a false sense of security. Even after they'd begun making serious money, too many of us took the aversion to a collar and tie to mean the likes of Facebook or Google were not really scary capitalist behemoths, but retained the spirit of the upstart startup: quirky, plucky and driven chiefly by a desire to do cool stuff with computers. They certainly saw themselves that way, Google charmingly distilling its mission statement into three words: \"Don't be evil.\" It's amazing how long an initial image of laidback informality can endure: for decades, Britons struggled to see Virgin as a corporate giant because Richard Branson had long hair and a goatee.\n\nIn truth, it wasn't just the look. The apparent idealism of the enterprise also encouraged consumers to give the tech Goliaths the benefit of the doubt. In its infancy, the internet was hailed as a harbinger of equality and liberty. The new gospel held that \"information wants to be free\" - free from censorship and free of charge. A new techno-utopia seemed at hand. Or as Zuckerberg defined his company's purpose: \"Facebook gives people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.\"\n\nThose words leave a bitter taste now, after Carole Cadwalladr's ground-shaking revelation that Cambridge Analytica had helped itself to the Facebook data of 50 million users. But it was not so long ago that the internet, and specifically social media, were seen as forces that might transform the world for good, harming the powerful and strengthening the weak.\n\nA crucial example is provided in War in 140 Characters, an insightful, richly reported book by David Patrikarakos. A correspondent who has covered several recent conflicts, he was struck by the emergence of what he calls Homo digitalis, the lone individual who, armed with nothing more than a smartphone, is able to shape global perceptions of the battle fought around them. He shows how a 16-year-old Gazan, Farah Baker, used a Twitter account to give real-time reports on the daily bombardments that came in the summer of 2014, steadily building up a vast international audience and leaving the mighty Israel Defence Forces playing catch-up. In the age of social media, he writes, even the most powerful \"states can win the physical battle on the ground but lose the political war\".\n\nThere are countless examples, from the Egyptian teenagers who used Facebook to rally protesters to Tahrir Square, eventually toppling the Mubarak regime, to the British blogger who methodically proved Russia had supplied the weapon that brought down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, leaving Moscow's denials in tatters. The asymmetry in each case was vast - and yet the weaker party won.\n\nThanks to social media, the internet had apparently decentralised power. In the old days, information was passed down from the mountain top - by a government, say, or a news organisation - to the crowd below. Now the crowd could speak to each other and to the world. At least one aspect of the techno-utopians' early hopes seemed to have materialised.\n\nAnd it's that hope that Cambridge Analytica has shattered. For what we now understand is that those at the top, the political parties or governments that could afford it, have been engaged in a radical act of recentralising power. They saw the way social media was working, empowering individuals and networks of individuals, and they decided to grab those same weapons for themselves.\n\nYou can see why they were tempted, for our digital footprint is extraordinarily revealing. Witness the model built by researchers at Stanford and Cambridge that, simply by looking at your Facebook \"likes\", can assess your personality with a startling degree of accuracy. It takes just 10 \"likes\" for the computer to know you better than your work colleagues. Give the machine 150 likes and it can predict you more accurately than your parents or siblings. Give it 300 and it knows you better than your spouse. No wonder the Trump campaign and so many others were ready to hand over big money to Cambridge Analytica. This week I met Hossein Derakhshan, a true Homo digitalis once known as Iran's \"blogfather\", whose activities earned him six years in prison. \"Predictability is control,\" he told me, recalling the hold his jailers had over him. Once you can predict someone's actions and reactions, you can control them.\n\nWhich is why the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook revelations are so significant. They represent an attempt to reverse the internet's previous upending of power, to restore the traditional imbalance between the ruled and their rulers. What Cambridge Analytica promised its clients was a return to the old form of media distribution, with those at the top sending their message to the crowd below. Except this time, that message would be disguised as if it were the organic word of the crowd itself, spread virally from one person to another, with no traces or fingerprints left by those at the top. As a Cambridge Analytica executive said, unwittingly caught on film: \"We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow ... it's unattributable, untrackable.\"\n\nThe hypocrisy is obvious. Here was the supposedly populist movement of Trump taking a tool that once empowered ordinary people and handing it back to the politicians, allowing them to manipulate voters and exploit their fears. Patrikarakos is not surprised. Digitally speaking, the 21st century \"belongs to the illiberals\", he says. The technology is available to anyone, but it's Moscow that dares fund a troll factory, the Internet Research Agency in St Petersburg, pumping out lies and hate. London or Washington would not make so egregious a move, either because they'd regard it as a violation of their democratic norms or because they'd fear exposure, depending on your degree of cynicism. But the Kremlin bows to no such constraint.\n\nThis week's revelations are not exactly a loss of innocence: many shed their turn-of-the-century illusions about the internet years ago. And there will be more disenchantment to come. It can't be only political campaigners who used the likes of Cambridge Analytica to pickpocket our personal data; surely we'll learn soon of the major corporations that similarly played on our online hopes and fears to sell us stuff. But we don't have to have the full picture to know that we have to act. It could be regulation; it could be anti-trust legislation to break up those tech giants that act as virtual monopolies. I like Derakhshan's idea of obliging Facebook and others to open up a marketplace of algorithms: if you don't like the current social media preference for popularity (retweets) and novelty (\"latest\"), you should be free to choose a different algorithm that acts on different values.\n\nThis is not - yet - a lost cause. There are success stories, with the collectively curated Wikipedia perhaps the best example. But it will mean discarding our 00s-era naivete. The tech companies are greedy corporations that need to be tamed - even if the boss came to work on a skateboard and is still wearing a damn T-shirt.\n\n* Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

                "body": "Journalists are grateful for the reach the internet gives us, but those who harvest data must take responsibility for the risks this brings\n\nWe are at a crunch point between truth and lies, and Facebook is right at the centre. This week we - the Observer and Guardian, Channel 4 News and the New York Times - have thrown our all at exposing the dark arts facilitated by Facebook's waywardness and its neglect of the security of those who love and live it, its users.\n\nFacebook's users are voters across the world. What we revealed was the extent to which a London-based company, Cambridge Analytica, had used data to target them and affect elections. Trading in fear, it sought in the US to erode Democratic voters' faith in their own candidate, with the \"crooked Hillary\" viral effort that depicted her as a wanted criminal.\n\nIt took old media to rumble Cambridge Analytica. Carole Cadwalladr of the Observer, which shared the story with Channel 4 and the New York Times, worked with her source Chris Wylie for a year. on all this Channel 4 News spent four months investigating the way Cambridge Analytica was doing business. This was toil that Facebook had a moral imperative to do for itself. Facebook had a duty to protect its users' profiles from theft, and to detect and track down any entities attempting to use them.\n\nFacebook knew two years ago that user profiles had been lifted, but did nothing. Even after our revelations, it took Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg four days to respond. Facebook is probably the biggest commercial entity in history to have penetrated the brain cells of so vast a number of human beings. Yet it is a law unto itself in terms of both regulation and tax. The world wide web's inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, said on Channel 4 News the other night, that \"the genie is out of the bottle\". He doubted it could ever be got back in. There surely has to be a cost to any individual or organisation that sets out to harvest humankind's desire for connectivity, community and friendship, without safeguarding the mechanisms by which they do it.\n\nCambridge Analytica's activities have exposed the threat to democracy that Facebook's omissions have facilitated. Zuckerberg owes us more than a squirt of soundbites on CNN. He should do an in-depth interview with one of the organisations trying to investigate what is going on in the new digital world. At the same time, civil institutions in countries across the world need to do far more to regulate what entities such as Facebook are doing. Here in the UK, the idea that the information commissioner has just 10 frontline officers to fight the regulatory and security battles to come is close to absurd. Governments, like citizens, are out of their depth. Democracies have a super-human job to do to preserve the glories of the internet while preserving us from the abuse, filth and criminality that we now know is all too easy to conjure through it.\n\nAs a journalist, I am grateful every waking day for what I am able to do thanks to the internet. But I loathe the idea that a company such as Cambridge Analytica has the capacity to work out whether I am susceptible to covert messaging that will affect the way I vote. Facebook has enabled us to secure literally billions of viewings of the news clips we post on our site. But in doing so we provide material around which it can sell advertising. Channel 4 News gets no revenue for this. Most readers of the Guardian and the New York Times read online. We all depended on terrestrial advertising to support what we do. That source of funding is evaporating. We have been arguing fiercely with Facebook, and Google, that they owe us a fairer share. Serious news, which Zuckerberg says he believes in to counter the fake news that thrives on his platform, costs serious money.\n\nUnless the tech giants start to take notice, there is a real danger that next time there might be no \"old media\" left to call them out. Don't get me wrong. We all want to cooperate with Facebook in forging a new media world, and still have a chance to get this right. We must do so if we are to restrict the criminal use of private data for perverted ends, and instead garner our collective resources to render Earth safer and better. Come on, Mr Zuckerberg. Give us some interviews and let's thrash this out on old and new media alike!\n\n* Jon Snow is a presenter on Channel 4 News",

                "body": "Shares fare better in Europe than Asia after China's response to US tariffs less dramatic than feared\n\nGlobal stock markets have been rattled again by fears of a trade war between the world's two largest economics after China retaliated to Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on up to $60bn (£42.4bn) worth of Chinese products.\n\nHours after Trump announced the proposed import duties - which are expected to cover sectors such as robotics, hi-tech trains and aerospace - China said it had prepared retaliatory tariffs on about $3bn worth of US imports. Beijing urged Washington to negotiate a settlement as soon as possible.\n\nA statement from the Chinese commerce ministry said: \"China doesn't hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one. China hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.\"\n\nThe Chinese response sent shares in Asia tumbling on Friday, following Thursday's 723 point plunge on the Dow in New York. The Nikkei 225 in Toyko closed 4.51% lower on Friday, while shares in Hong Kong fell 2.45%, the CSI300 in Shanghai lost 2.86% and the Kospi in Seoul was down 3.37%.\n\nBut shares in Europe fared better, recovering from their worst levels after what analysts said was so far a less dramatic response from China than had been feared.\n\nGeoffrey Yu, the head of the UK investment office of UBS Wealth Management, said: \"We see China's retaliatory tariffs as relatively measured. Beijing is sending a clear signal that it would like to bolster its reputation as a defender of free trade and to avoid antagonising the situation further.\n\n\"This week's tariff announcements are likely to cause disruption in the short-term but looking ahead, with both sides hinting that conversations are ongoing behind the scenes, we view this as the beginning of a long process towards an eventual resolution.\"\n\nJasper Lawler, the head of research at London Capital Group, said: \"$3bn is a splash in the ocean of US-China trade. If your glass is half-full, China's measured response opens the door to negotiations. If you glass is half-empty, it opens the door to escalation.\"\n\nThe FTSE 100 ended Friday down 0.44% at 6921.94 after falling to 6876, with the recovery helped by EU leaders approving a Brexit transition deal. Germany's Dax lost 1.77% and France's Cac closed 1.39% lower.\n\nOn Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 0.35% by the time European markets closed.\n\nThe latest US sanctions on China are in addition to the 25% and 10% tariffs on steel and aluminium announced by Trump earlier this month. With regard to the steel and aluminium tariffs, the US president has given the EU, along with Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, a temporary exemption until 1 May, while talks continue.\n\nBut despite this concession, Trump was accused of \"putting a gun\" to the EU's head as Brussels called on the US administration to make it the exemption permanent. The pause is being viewed in Brussels as an attempt by the White House to pile on the pressure and extract trade concessions on EU goods exported to the US.\n\nCharles Michel, the Belgian prime minister, said: \"I have the impression that the US leader wants to negotiate with the European Union by putting a gun to our head. That's a strange way to negotiate with an ally.\"\n\nIn response to the US tariffs on China, the Chinese foreign ministry suggested soybeans, aeroplanes, cars and cotton could be targeted.\n\nWine, apples and ethanol could also be in the firing line, which would hit agricultural areas where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe Chinese government could also target US technology companies that manufacture products in China, such as Apple, in the hope those firms would pressure Washington to back down, said Victor Shih, a professor of political economy at University of California, San Diego.",

Those profiles were processed by the notorious Cambridge Analytica, and seemingly by its parent company, SCL. We have now filed a claim in the British courts on behalf of a US citizen, David Carroll, to seek full disclosure of the data held by Cambridge Analytica and SCL. This will be the first case against these companies and will shed further light on what they were doing.\n\nOur clients are seeking to understand the extent of the data held about them without their knowledge or consent, and to know whether that data was subsequently manipulated, and if so, in what way and for what purpose. They also hope to discover the breadth of information needed to make sophisticated predictions about political beliefs - a revelation that will be of wide interest, not just to our clients.\n\nThe case will also determine something more fundamental: the boundaries of permissible use of personal political data. And in turn, our clients will seek to ensure that such sensitive personal information is in future better protected. While it is increasingly accepted in the digital age that individuals enter into a bargain with their data in using the internet, the true costs of this exchange are only now becoming clear.\n\nIn the context of revelations about what appears to be the untrammelled use of data in political campaigns, our clients' case will set the first train of accountability in motion. This case - and the movement behind it - is about more than just holding companies like Cambridge Analytica and SCL to account. It seeks to demonstrate the importance of data rights, and how steps can be taken to control the use of our own information. For too long, those rights have been ignored in the name of innovation. . This is a critical time in ensuring that individuals have a say in how their online worlds are governed.\n\nIt is now apparent that some information is too precious, too personal, to be left without personal control. After the claim was issued the Observer, the New York Times and Channel 4 News ran stories that have shown that our clients' concerns may be well placed.\n\nThe whistleblower Christopher Wiley has revealed that Cambridge Analytica retained huge data sets on individuals, including data alleged to have been harvested from Facebook. Cambridge Analytica's own advertising claims that it possesses a unique set of 5,000 individual data points on each adult in America. That data was said to have been used to influence the US electorate through \"psychographic\" algorithms. Cambridge Analytica boasted that this algorithm had carried Donald Trump to victory.\n\nThe ultimate parent company of Cambridge Analytica, SCL, openly states that it has \"conducted behavioural change programmes in over 60 countries\". It also claims to conduct \"military influence campaigns\" using \"alternative narratives and credible perspectives\". The suggestion is that these companies could create a political consensus by influencing behaviour.\n\nAlgorithms and machine-learning software are the new \"weapons\" of political change. The internet is now full of algorithms that can analyse and predict human behaviour, even when information is incomplete. This has been achieved through the development of opaque software that, in the words of the Artificial Intelligence expert François Chollet, determines \"which articles we read, who we keep in touch with, whose opinions we read, whose feedback we get\".\n\nThose who control algorithms have great power. In particular, decisions on what is promoted to the top of a newsfeed can have tremendous influence. The feeds people are shown on social media sites are highly personal. What you see in your feed is algorithmically tailored to your identity and your interaction history with the site. This is a potent tool for targeting individuals, exemplified by the revelations concerning Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe idea that these platforms could evolve to affect politics goes against the idea of \"apolitical\" technology cherished by those in Silicon Valley. Indeed, it is only belatedly, and after the 2016 US presidential election, that the tech giants have revealed the extent of the manipulation of their use. Facebook initially labelled it \"crazy\" that its platform could have any influence on the election. It eventually confirmed that it was able to identify 80,000 posts on its platform that it believes were linked to Russia, which were viewed by up to 126 million people during the campaign.\n\nThe recent revelations about the extent to which Facebook data was seemingly abused by private companies has served to aggravate these concerns. The internet giants have been too slow to react when data breaches have been brought to their attention. The latest events should at least be an awakening for these companies to put data rights at the forefront of their platforms.\n\nWhile regulatory and legislative developments such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may enhance individual protection over data, they represent an evolution in personal rights rather than a revolution. The revolution will come only when people can access and take control over their data and assert their rights to privacy, as our clients have done in their case against Cambridge Analytica and SCL.\n\nAs our lives increasingly translate into electronic media and data, the question of who controls our data and what rights we have over it is not just for regulators or to be to technology companies. It is becoming as fundamental to us as any other human right.\n\n* Ravi Naik is a solicitor and partner at Irvine Thanvi Natas Solicitors, where he heads the public law department",

The procedure is allowed only if the life of the foetus is at risk, there is a grave threat to the health of the mother, or the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.\n\nAn attempt to ban all abortions in 2016 sparked mass nationwide protests by women dressed in black, forcing the government to abandon the plan.\n\nThe latest proposed legislation would allow procedures in cases where the mother's life is at risk or the pregnancy resulted from a crime, but would ban abortions of foetuses with congenital disorders, including Down's syndrome.\n\nIn Warsaw, protesters gathered at the seat of the influential Roman Catholic bishops, who are urging the further tightening of the law. They marched to the parliament building and later moved on to the headquarters of the ruling Law and Justice party.\n\nA protest of hundreds of people in Wrocław included a sign that said \"I will not give birth to a dead baby\".\n\nThe Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Nils Muižnieks, and UN experts are urging the Polish parliament to reject the bill.",

                "body": "The Labour MP Dan Jarvis has won a vote to become the party's candidate for the new role of Sheffield city region mayor, but has yet to decide whether he will step down from parliament to seek election to the role.\n\nThe Barnsley Central MP won 58% of the members' ballot against the other candidate, Ben Curran, a councillor and cabinet member on Sheffield city council.\n\nJarvis had planned to take no salary if elected as the mayor and stay on as an MP, arguing that the mayoralty as currently set out has very few powers. He had hoped to use his role in Westminster to argue for this to change.\n\nUnlike similar posts in Manchester and the west Midlands, the Sheffield city region job currently has no devolution or funding deal, amid regional disputes over how such a system should work.\n\nHowever, Labour's NEC ruled on Tuesday that Jarvis would need to quit parliament if he won the mayoralty, a last-minute decision characterised by some as an attempt by the pro-Jeremy Corbyn ruling body to push out an MP who is not close to the party leader.\n\nIf Jarvis does decide to quit as an MP, it will open up a safe Labour seat for would-be replacements. At the last general election, Jarvis won a majority of more than 15,000, up from 12,000 in 2015. Jarvis took the seat in a by-election in 2011.\n\nIn a tweeted statement, Jarvis thanked Labour members for selecting him. \"I am proud to have been chosen, grateful for the opportunity to serve, and pleased to have been part of such a comradely contest,\" he said.\n\nJarvis said the new mayor would \"need to work with both local and national government to negotiate the best possible deal for the city of south Yorkshire. Only then will the mayor be able to end the status quo of how decisions are made and how public services are delivered; and use both devolution and cooperative principles to offer a more radical and effective way of serving the public.\"\n\nThe statement did not say whether Jarvis would quit as an MP if he won the mayoralty. The Labour candidate will be a very strong favourite to win the post - Labour hold two-thirds of the seats on Sheffield council, and are even more dominant in surrounding areas.\n\nOne possibility could be that Jarvis decides to challenge the NEC's decision. It is understood the MP and his team have not had a chance to see the full ruling, and will not make any decision on what to do until next week at the earliest.",

                "title": "Pineapples set to topple avocados with Britons wanting more",
                "body": "For a while avocados had it all their own way as Britons smashed them on toast and whizzed them up for smoothies but there is a new pretender to the fruit crown - 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the pineapple.\n\nSupermarkets say demand for the tropical fruit is at an all time high after a dramatic reappraisal by shoppers who increasingly view it as as an ingredient for curries, barbecues and cocktails as well as fruit salads.\n\nSuch is the fervour, the pineapple has overtaken the avocado as the UK's fastest growing fruit, according to supermarket giant Tesco, with sales surging nearly 15% last year.\n\n\"Pineapples have become the fruit taste of the moment and could soon rival the avocado as a once niche fruit suddenly gaining mainstream popularity,\" said Tesco's fresh pineapple buyer Morgan Jaquemet. \"In the last few years we have seen demand jump because of the fruit's rising popularity as a versatile and healthy food.\"\n\nThe rise of the avocado - sales in Tesco still increased by nearly 10% last year - was fuelled by social media as trendy restaurants created Instagram-worthy brunch dishes and its reputation as a superfood won it a place in numerous fad diets. The interest in health is reflected in fruit sales which rose more than 5% to £5.6bn in the year to end of February, according to the grocery market experts Kantar Worldpanel.\n\nCustoms data shows the UK imported more than 168,000 tonnes of pineapples in 2017 compared with 148,000 tonnes in 2016, an increase of almost 14%. The vast majority came from Costa Rica which has more than trebled its production of the fruit over the last 15 years, leading to concerns about environmental degradation as well as the pay rates of plantation workers.\n\n\"There has been a big increase in fresh pineapple exports into Europe,\" said Neil Murray, head of processed commodities at Agribusiness Intelligence. \"People like it and a lot of it is coming from Costa Rica, but production is probably peaking there now, as they are getting worried about the amount of land under pineapple.\"\n\nBritons still have a way to go if pineapple sales are to overtake the avocado. Britons munched their way through £175m worth of avocados in the last 12 months compared with spending about £44m on pineapples.\n\nTesco said pineapple flavours were popular across the board with demand for juice up by more than a fifth and sales of tinned pineapple chunks up 5% (80g of tinned or fresh pineapple counts as one of your five a day). The controversial Hawaiian pizza is also staging a comeback, Tesco said, and whether down to laziness or fears of avocado hand-style injuries, sales of ready chopped pineapple \"fingers\" were up 30%.\n\nThe national hankering for pineapple has probably been fuelled by subliminal cues picked up on social media and the high street. The motif was one of the hottest trends of last summer, plastered on everything from kitsch T-shirts to pool inflatables, cushions and knick knacks.\n\nIn the Georgian era, pineapples were a status symbol which could be hired from \"pineapple merchants\" to dress a house for a party. By Christmas 2017 that trend had come full circle with entire pages on Pinterest devoted to pineapples that had been adorned with fairy lights and were being used as alternative Christmas trees.",

                "body": "Seamer Morne Morkel claimed his 300th career wicket as South Africa edged ahead in the third Test on Friday when they reduced Australia to 245 for nine at the close on the second day, still 66 runs behind their hosts' first innings score at Newlands.\n\nTim Paine (33) and Josh Hazlewood (1) will resume on the third morning, seeking to reduce the deficit further on a wicket with bounce and some seam movement, and in the knowledge that Australia will have to bat last in a series that is poised at 1-1.\n\nMorkel (4-87) reached his landmark 20 minutes before tea when Shaun Marsh (26) slashed at a wide delivery and was comfortably caught by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, a poor stroke from the left-hander.\n\nThe tall fast bowler, who has announced he will retire from all forms of international cricket after this series, had earlier removed Usman Khawaja (5) and claimed the key wicket of Australia captain Steve Smith (5). Khawaja was caught at fine leg by Kagiso Rabada attempting a hook, while Smith played at a rising delivery well-outside his off-stump and edged to Dean Elgar in the gully.\n\nIt continued a poor run of scores for Smith, who is averaging just 27 from five innings in the series, and he looked out of sorts having been roughed up by some fierce fast bowling from Rabada before lunch. Vernon Philander (2-26) struck either side of the tea break to remove innings top-scorer Cameron Bancroft (77), who was trapped leg before wicket, and Mitchell March (5), caught by De Kock.\n\nAustralia sunk deeper into the mire when Rabada (3-81) returned to claim the wickets of Pat Cummins (4) and Mitchell Starc (2), both caught by AB de Villiers at third slip. But Nathan Lyon (47) led a rally as he frustrated the home side with his highest score in tests, adding 66 for the ninth wicket with Paine before he skied a Morkel delivery and was well caught by Elgar.\n\nElgar earlier carried his bat for the third time in his test career as he finished 141 not out when South Africa were bowled out for 311 on the second morning.\n\nHis efforts helped the home side add 45 runs to their overnight score of 266-8. Elgar and Rabada (22) took their ninth wicket partnership to exactly 50 before the latter edged a Lyon (2-43) delivery to Smith at slip.\n\nFour balls later, the spinner repeated the dismissal as Morkel (4) was caught by Smith, a fifth catch of the innings for the Australian to equal the most ever in test history, one of 11 outfield players to achieve the feat.",

                "body": "New York entrepreneur has big plans to turn his office rental business into a provider of homes, leisure and education\n\nAdam Neumann isn't satisfied with changing the way 210,000 people work and turning himself into a paper multi-billionaire in the process. Neumann, the 38-year-old co-founder and chief executive of shared office provider WeWork, wants to house, teach, train and party with the \"WeGeneration\".\n\nIn less than eight years Neumann, a dyslexic who could not read until he was seven, has turned an idea for a single \"eco-friendly co-working space\" in Brooklyn into a $20bn (£14bn) company which runs 230 shared office spaces in 71 cities .\n\nThe company, which is marketed with the tagline \"Do What You Love\" and offers its \"members\" free artisan coffee, grapefruit-infused water and a choice of craft beers, has risen to become London's biggest office occupier.\n\nWeWork has taken space in 21 office buildings in the capital, including eight floors of a block in Moorgate with space for more than 3,000 workers, two buildings in the heart of Soho and an outpost in London Fields which it describes as the \"epicentre of East London's creative hotbed\".\n\nThe company, which was founded by Neumann and his friend Miguel McKelvey in 2010, occupies more than 2.5m sq ft of space in London according to research by Savills, the property consultant. It has opened an office in Manchester and has plans for another in the city, and it is also scouting for locations in Birmingham, Edinburgh and other UK cities.\n\nWeWork owns a small fraction of its estate, instead renting space from traditional landlords which it breaks into smaller offices and communal shared desks. In spite of having very few physical assets WeWork has attracted investment from Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Japan's SoftBank, which invested $4.4bn last year, valuing WeWork at $20bn.\n\nMasayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank and Japan's richest man, said his investment would be \"cheap\" if WeWork continues its exponential growth, adding the firm could be \"worth a few hundred billion dollars\". The investment valued Neumann's remaining stake in the privately held company at about $2.5bn.\n\nWeWorkwill open another 13 locations in London by the end of 2018, including the whole of an office block opposite the Bank of England. For £650 a month, WeWork tenants will be granted access to their desks in One Poultry via the building's grand staircase which is inspired by the Scala Regia steps entrance to the Vatican.\n\nProviding a fun and inspiring place to work is just the first step for Neumann, who told a conference of city mayors recently that the influx of people into cities and rising cost of living meant they \"have to reinvent how people live\". \"As mayors, as leaders, as CEOs it is our responsibility to set the trend of the future,\" he said.\n\nNeumann, an Israeli who grew up partly on a kibbutz, claims that each new WeWork office will create 1,000 jobs a year. \"And we won't just bring you jobs, we'll bring a place to live, we'll bring education and this is important we'll bring corporate America,\" he said.\n\nWeWork began as a place for the \"cool kids\" tech and creative entrepreneurs to bat about ideas over the communal foosball table and pints from the free beer kegs, but today big businesses, including HSBC, Microsoft and InBev, the brewing giant, occupy more than 25% of its space.\n\nIt is not just about work. WeWork is poised to launch its communal living concept WeLive in London. The company opened the first of its \"dorm for adults\" concept in a 200-apartment building in Manhattan's financial district in 2016, and expanded to the concept to Crystal City, a suburb of Washington DC.\n\nWeWork executives, who are ditching the \"Work\" from the company's name and increasingly refer to the firm as just \"We\", say the WeLive concept is built upon \"a fundamental belief that we are only as good as the people we surround ourselves with\".\n\nWeWork also takes care of its members' fitness and relaxation. The company opened its first gym and spa in New York last year, and expects to rollout the Rise By We concept to other locations.\n\nThe company has also bought a stake in Wavegarden, which makes indoor wavepools, sparking speculation that the next WeWork perk might be lunchtime surfing lessons.\n\nThere are also parties and events, which are organised by WeWork's community managers. The company says it works with tenants to put on bespoke activities. WeWork's members in Paddington, west London, were this week offered the opportunity to take part in guided meditation, a \"boxbiz\" boxing workshop or a candlelight yoga class. If none of that appealed there was also a \"jar and fern terrarium workshop\" on Thursday lunchtime.\n\nThe biggest party of the year is WeWork Summer Camp, which the company says \"is just what it sounds like: a chance for grown-ups of all ages to sleep in tents, share meals in a dining hall, and take part in events from archery to zip lining\".\n\nAt the first camp, Neumann hosted 300 employees and customers in upstate New York. Last summer the company flew 2,000 staff to the UK for the latest edition of the party held at Eridge Park, a country estate in East Sussex which was once a deer hunting ground favoured by Henry VIII. Florence + the Machine headlined the show, which cost WeWork members £395 each to attend.\n\nNext on the WeWork agenda is education. This month the company opened a London arm of its coding academy Flatiron School, and pledged £1m in scholarships for women and other groups underrepresented in technology jobs.\n\nNeumann's wife, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, (a cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow), reckons the company has got to start teaching much earlier and is opening a $36,000-a-year kindergarten called WeGrow.\n\nRebekah, WeWork's chief brand officer and a mother of five with no training in education, says on her website that her \"superpower\" is \"intuition\". \"Rebekah is committed to creating a conscious, educational community that fosters growth in children's minds, bodies, and souls, unleashing endless happiness, global citizenship, and every child's superpowers,\" her profile says.\n\nAdam, who runs or skateboards to the company's headquarters in Chelsea, Manhattan, said moving into education was a natural extension of the company's mission to help people Do What You Love. \"If you really want to change the world, change kids when they're two,\" he said.",
