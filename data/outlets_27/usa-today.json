                "body": "MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Weather washed out qualifying for NASCAR's first stop this season at a short track and Martin Truex Jr. will start Sunday from the pole at Martinsville Speedway.\n\nThere was no qualifying session because of a wintry mix that moved through the Virginia area and halted the Truck Series race after just 23 laps Saturday. NASCAR postponed the Truck Race and set the Cup field by owner's points.\n\nThe Truck Race is now scheduled to resume after Sunday's Cup event.\n\nTruex is the defending Cup Series champion and is coming off his first victory of the season last week in California. He led both of Saturday's practice sessions, which NASCAR was lucky to get in before the weather disrupted its first two-day \"enhanced weekend\" of the year.\n\nNASCAR is trying a new attack in certain markets in which cars are only on track for two days instead of three, it saves teams money and gives the drivers time to do fan events.\n\nNASCAR was hopeful the weather would clear and both Cup and Trucks can be completed on Sunday. Next weekend is the first scheduled break for the Cup Series since the season began in early February at Daytona.\n\nBrad Keselowski is the defending race winner and Jimmie Johnson, who has opened this season in a slump, leads all active drivers with nine victories at Martinsville. When asked how he can get a 10th victory at Martinsville, Johnson quipped: \"I think survive the snowstorm and see what happens with the weather.\"\n\nMuch has been made about the slump for the seven-time champion, who is in a 28-race winless streak dating back to last June. One driver who didn't have much sympathy for Johnson's plight was Keselowski. \"It's hard to feel bad for a guy who has won 83 races. There are a lot worse problems going on in the world,\" Keselowski said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://racing.ap.org/\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                "title": "How Dawn Staley helped A'ja Wilson overcome dyslexia",
                "body": "In her four years playing for South Carolina, star forward A'ja Wilson has accomplished a lot - including the Gamecocks' first national championship in the 2017 NCAA tournament when she was named the Most Outstanding Player - and much of it has been thanks to coach Dawn Staley.\n\nAs No. 2 seed South Carolina looks to defend its title - the Gamecocks beat No. 11 seed Buffalo on Saturday to advance to the Elite Eight - Wilson opened up about her childhood struggles with dyslexia. In an essay titled, Brute Strength, for The Players' Tribune, Wilson explained how growing up, she hated reading out loud and questioned if she was \"stupid\".\n\nShe said she pushed for success on the court in high school so \"no one was thinking about whether or not I was having trouble reading.\" But when she arrived at South Carolina, \"everything changed\" during her sophomore year when Staley made her read scripture ahead of games in the locker room.\n\nVia The Players' Tribune:\n\nI don't know what exactly made everything different after that, but reading like that in front of the team, and being pushed by Coach Staley to do something that she knew made me uncomfortable ... I'm serious when I say that everything changed after that reading started.\n\nIt was definitely humiliating at first, but I kept at it. Just straight brute force, every time she asked. I don't know if she thought it would help, or if it would make me play better, or what. But after a while, it really would make me feel better. It was like I could suddenly talk with people about this secret that had been eating at me for years. Soon I was able to be more of myself, weaknesses and everything. It's a huge weight off your shoulders when you don't have to hide things about yourself.\n\nWilson wrote she suspects she'd be a different person if not for Staley pushing her to read in front of her teammates.\n\nThanking Staley for her support and help on and off the court, Wilson added:\n\nEven today, dyslexia is something that I still struggle with. In the huddle during a game, when we're drawing up a play, I'll have to lock in and focus as hard as I can, because it can get difficult to keep the information in order. It's something that will always be there in the back of my mind. My only real options are to shy away from it, or, you know ... brute force the problem.\n\nOver the years, Coach Staley has become like my second mom. And she has helped me with so much on the basketball court that I don't think I ever directly told her how important she has been in helping me deal with the things that aren't related to basketball. Especially with dyslexia.\n\nAfter beating Buffalo, South Carolina advanced to the Elite Eight and will face powerhouse No. 1 seed UConn on Monday (7 p.m. ET, ESPN).\n\nRead Wilson's full essay over at The Players' Tribune.\n\nMORE:\n\nWendy's released a surprisingly solid rap mixtape and ravaged McDonald's\n\nJohnny Manziel salutes Colin Kaepernick, speaks out on 'comparisons'\n\nCharles Barkley wants to hang out with Sister Jean if Loyola advances to Final Four\n\nESPN's Zach Lowe says Kevin Love gives the Cavs an 'unstoppable' lineup",

                "title": "National League East capsules",
                "body": "Capsules of National League East teams, listed in order of finish last year:\n\n___\n\nWashington Nationals\n\n2017: 97-65, first place, lost to Cubs in NLDS.\n\nManager: Dave Martinez (first season).\n\nHe's Here: 1B-OF Matt Adams, C Miguel Montero, RHP Jeremy Hellickson, RHP Joaquin Benoit, INF Matt Reynolds.\n\nHe's Outta Here: Manager Dusty Baker, LF Jayson Werth, 1B-LF Adam Lind, C Jose Lobaton, RHP Matt Albers.\n\nProjected Lineup: SS Trea Turner (.284, 11 HRs, 45 RBIs, 46 SBs in 98 games), LF Adam Eaton (.297, 2, 13 in 23 games), RF Bryce Harper (.319, 29, 87), 3B Anthony Rendon (.301, 25, 100, 41 2Bs), 2B Daniel Murphy (.322, 23, 93, 43 2Bs; expected to begin season on DL recovering from knee surgery), 1B Ryan Zimmerman (.303, 36, 108, 33 2Bs), CF Michael A. Taylor (.271, 19, 53), C Matt Wieters (.225, 10, 52).\n\nRotation: RH Max Scherzer (16-6, 2.51 ERA, NL-high 268 Ks, 200 2/3 IP, 3rd Cy Young Award), RH Stephen Strasburg (15-4, 2.52, 204 Ks), LH Gio Gonzalez (15-9, 2.96, 79 walks), RH Tanner Roark (13-11, 4.67), RH A.J. Cole (3-5, 3.81 in 11 appearances) or RH Jeremy Hellickson (8-11, 5.43 with Phillies and Orioles).\n\nKey Relievers: LH Sean Doolittle (2-0, 2.81, 24/26 saves with Athletics and Nationals), RH Ryan Madson (5-4, 1.83, 2 saves with Athletics and Nationals), RH Brandon Kintzler (4-3, 3.03, 29/35 saves with Twins and Nationals), LH Sammy Solis (1-0, 5.88, 1 save), RH Shawn Kelley (3-2, 7.27, 4 saves), RH Joaquin Benoit (1-6, 4.65, 2 saves with Phillies and Pirates).\n\nHot Spots: Fifth Starter and Catcher. The Nationals have as good a 1-2 combination at the front of their rotation as anyone in the big leagues, with Scherzer and Strasburg. Their 3-4 slots aren't too shabby, either, with Gonzalez and Roark. But the big question is, who will be the fifth starter -- the inexperienced Cole or late free-agent pickup Hellickson? The only other spot with some real doubts is catcher, where Wieters is coming off a terrible year at the plate.\n\nOutlook: This might very well be the end of an era at Nationals Park, with Harper eligible to leave as a free agent after the season and GM Mike Rizzo's contract set to expire, too. The team has won four NL East titles in the past six years but has zero playoff series wins to show for it. That's why yet another manager (Baker) lost his job, and yet another rookie skipper has been brought in (will Martinez have more success than Matt Williams?). Rizzo has made no secret of the need to start making postseason inroads -- a World Series is the stated goal, and that's certainly not an outrageous aim, given all the talent he's assembled. The lineup remains almost exactly the same, although Werth is gone after playing out his seven-year contract, and the rotation and bullpen are also nearly identical to the way they looked at the end of 2017.\n\n___\n\nMiami Marlins\n\n2017: 77-85, second place.\n\nManager: Don Mattingly (third season).\n\nHe's Here: INF Starlin Castro, CF Lewis Brinson, OF Cameron Maybin, 1B Garrett Cooper, RHP Jacob Turner, OF-1B Scott Van Slyke, RHP Jumbo Diaz, RHP Sandy Alcantara.\n\nHe's Outta Here: RF Giancarlo Stanton, LF Marcell Ozuna, CF Christian Yelich, 2B Dee Gordon, RHP Tom Koehler, OF Ichiro Suzuki, RHP Dustin McGowan, C A.J. Ellis.\n\nProjected Lineup: RF Cameron Maybin (.228, 10 HRs, 35 RBIs, 33 SBs with Angels and Astros), CF Lewis Brinson (.106, 2, 3 in 21 games with Brewers), 2B Starlin Castro (.300, 16, 63 in 112 games with Yankees), 1B Justin Bour (.289, 25, 83, .902 OPS in 108 games), C J.T. Realmuto (.278, 17, 65), LF Derek Dietrich (.249, 13, 53), 3B Brian Anderson (.262, 0, 8 in 25 games), SS Miguel Rojas (.290, 1, 26 in 90 games).\n\nRotation: RH Jose Urena (14-7, 3.82 ERA), RH Dan Straily (10-9, 4.26, 170 Ks), RH Odrisamer Despaigne (2-3, 4.01), RH Jacob Turner (2-3, 5.08 with Nationals), LH Justin Nicolino (2-3, 5.06).\n\nKey Relievers: RH Brad Ziegler (1-4, 4.79, 10/15 saves), RH Kyle Barraclough (6-2, 3.00, 1 save), RH Drew Steckenrider (1-1, 2.34, 54 Ks in 34 2/3 IP), RH Junichi Tazawa (3-5, 5.69), RH Nick Wittgren (3-1, 4.68).\n\nHot Spot: Starting Rotation. Urena had a breakout season in 2017, and Straily tied for the NL lead with 33 starts, but they're the only established starters. The other three spots will likely be a revolving door occupied by a mix of prospects and journeymen, and the results could be ugly. One potential bright spot is the 22-year-old Alcantara, who had a 4.32 ERA in eight games for the Cardinals last year. He'll begin the season in the minors but might join the Marlins before summer.\n\nOutlook: New CEO Derek Jeter is accustomed to winning, and that is about to change. He traded away half of last year's starting lineup, including the NL MVP in Stanton, which means the Marlins are rebuilding yet again. Even with an entirely new outfield, the offense could be decent. But Castro and Realmuto are potential trade bait and might be gone before August, and the season will almost surely end Sept. 30, leaving the Marlins out of the playoffs for the 15th year in a row. This season is really all about developing prospects acquired in those offseason trades, and if youngsters such as Brinson and Alcantara perform well, 2018 will be considered a successful start for the Jeter regime.\n\n___\n\nAtlanta Braves\n\n2017: 72-90, third place.\n\nManager: Brian Snitker (third season).\n\nHe's Here: RHP Brandon McCarthy, RHP Anibal Sanchez, LHP Scott Kazmir, INF Charlie Culberson, OF Preston Tucker, OF Ronald Acuna, 3B Austin Riley, OF Jeff Decker, 2B Christian Colon, RHP Shane Carle.\n\nHe's Outta Here: OF Matt Kemp, RHP R.A. Dickey, 3B Adonis Garcia, 1B Matt Adams, INF Jace Peterson, RHP Jason Motte.\n\nProjected Lineup: CF Ender Inciarte (.304, 11 HRs, 57 RBIs, 22 SBs, Gold Glove), 2B Ozzie Albies (.286, 6, 28, 8 SBs in 57 games), 1B Freddie Freeman (.307, 28, 71 in 117 games), C Tyler Flowers (.281, 12, 49) or Kurt Suzuki (.283, 19, 50), RF Nick Markakis (.275, 8, 76), LF Ronald Acuna (.325, 21, 82, 44 SBs with 3 minor league teams) or Lane Adams (.275, 5, 20, 10 SBs), 3B Johan Camargo (.273, 14, 65) or Charlie Culberson (.154, 0, 1 in 15 games with Dodgers), SS Dansby Swanson (.232, 6, 51).\n\nRotation: RH Julio Teheran (11-13, 4.49 ERA), RH Mike Foltynewicz (10-13, 4.79), RH Brandon McCarthy (6-4, 3.98 in 19 games with Dodgers), LH Sean Newcomb (4-9, 4.32 in 19 games), RH Anibal Sanchez (3-7, 6.41 with Tigers), LH Scott Kazmir (10-6, 4.56 with Dodgers in 2016) or LH Luiz Gohara (1-3, 4.91 in 5 games).\n\nKey Relievers: RH Arodys Vizcaino (5-3, 2.83, 14/17 saves, 64 Ks in 57 1/3 IP), RH Jose Ramirez (2-3, 3.19), LH A.J. Minter (0-1, 3.00, 26 Ks, 15 IP in 16 games), RH Dan Winkler (1-1, 2.51 in 16 games), LH Sam Freeman (2-0, 2.55 in 58 games).\n\nHot Spot: Third Base. Camargo was the probable starter before an oblique injury left his status uncertain for the beginning of the season. Culberson, expected to play a utility role, or Rio Ruiz would be next in line. Austin Riley, a 2015 first-round pick who has not yet reached Triple-A, might be a year or two away. Camargo, who shared time with Swanson at shortstop last year, could be more than a stopgap if he can provide some of the power the Braves need at a corner infield spot.\n\nOutlook: Teheran, Foltynewicz and Newcomb have provided reasons this spring to believe they can improve their 2017 numbers. The progress of Newcomb, one of the team's many touted pitching prospects, became especially important when Gohara sustained a groin injury that will keep him from being ready for the start of the season. For a change, the spring spotlight was on a position player; Acuna was hitting .432 with four homers, 11 RBIs and four steals when he was sent to minor league camp. The move involving the 20-year-old top prospect was expected. It was made to maintain an extra full season of contractual control down the road, but Acuna likely will be recalled in April and immediately start in left field. He could provide a needed power bat to help Freeman in the middle of the lineup. The Braves likely are still at least a year away from contending in the NL East, but improved starting pitching could push them closer to .500 this year.\n\n___\n\nNew York Mets\n\n2017: 70-92, fourth place.\n\nManager: Mickey Callaway (first season).\n\nHe's Here: 3B Todd Frazier, RF Jay Bruce, LHP Jason Vargas, 1B Adrian Gonzalez, RHP Anthony Swarzak, LHP Matt Purke, C Jose Lobaton.\n\nHe's Outta Here: Manager Terry Collins, LHP Josh Smoker, LHP Josh Edgin, RHP Chasen Bradford, OF Norichika Aoki, RHP Erik Goeddel, RHP Tyler Pill, LHP Tommy Milone, OF Travis Taijeron.\n\nProjected Lineup: CF Michael Conforto (.279, 27, 68, .384 OBP, .939 OPS in 109 games) or Brandon Nimmo (.260, 5, 21, .379 OBP, .797 OPS in 69 games) or Juan Lagares (.250, 3, 15, .296 OBP, .661 OPS in 94 games), 2B Asdrubal Cabrera (.280, 14 HRs, 59 RBIs, .351 OBP), LF Yoenis Cespedes (.292, 17, 42, .892 OPS in 81 games), RF Jay Bruce (.252, 36, 101 with Mets and Indians), 3B Todd Frazier (.213, 27, 76, .344 OBP with White Sox and Yankees), 1B Adrian Gonzalez (.242, 3, 30, .642 OPS in 71 games with Dodgers), C Travis d'Arnaud (.244, 16, 57, .293 OBP in 112 games) or Kevin Plawecki (.260, 3, 13, .364 OBP in 37 games), SS Amed Rosario (.248, 4, 10, 49 Ks, 3 BBs, .271 OBP, .665 OPS in 46 games).\n\nRotation: RH Noah Syndergaard (1-2, 2.97 ERA, limited to 30 1/3 innings by lat injury), RH Jacob deGrom (15-10, 3.53, 239 Ks, 201 1/3 IP), LH Steven Matz (2-7, 6.08 in 13 starts), RH Matt Harvey (5-7, 6.70, 110 hits, 21 HRs, 67 Ks, 47 BBs in 92 2/3 IP), RH Seth Lugo (7-5, 4.71, 101 1/3 IP in 19 games, 18 starts), LH Jason Vargas (18-11, 4.16, 179 2/3 IP in 32 starts with Royals; expected to begin season on DL).\n\nKey Relievers: RH Jeurys Familia (2-2, 4.38, 6 saves in 26 games), RH AJ Ramos (2-4, 3.99, 27 saves with Marlins and Mets), RH Anthony Swarzak (6-4, 2.33, 91 Ks, 22 BBs, 58 hits, 77 1/3 IP in 70 games with White Sox and Brewers), LH Jerry Blevins (6-0, 2.94, 1 save, 69 Ks, 24 BBs, 49 IP in 75 games), RH Paul Sewald (0-6, 4.55, 69 Ks, 21 BBs, 65 1/3 IP in 57 games), RH Robert Gsellman (8-7, 5.19, 119 2/3 IP in 25 games, 22 starts), RH Jacob Rhame (1-1, 9.00 in 9 games).\n\nHot Spot: First Base. The 35-year-old Gonzalez, a five-time All-Star weakened by a bad back last season, was signed at a bargain price to provide competition and short-term insurance for Dominic Smith, a top prospect who struggled in his initial taste of the majors last year. Smith, 22, slimmed down in the offseason but was disciplined early in camp for arriving late one day. Then he strained a quad, keeping him out of the lineup for most of spring training, so it seems unlikely he'll make the opening day roster. Gonzalez, meanwhile, batted .182 with one extra-base hit and 11 strikeouts in his first 44 Grapefruit League at-bats before connecting for a home run. Wilmer Flores can play first against left-handers, but vs. righties the Mets either need Gonzalez to find the Fountain of Youth or Smith to live up to his first-round hype.\n\nOutlook: Callaway had great success with Cleveland's arms and the injury-plagued Mets are counting on his methods, along with new pitching coach Dave Eiland, to keep their talented but fragile rotation intact. New York also overhauled its medical department, hoping to keep star players on the field. Syndergaard and deGrom make for an imposing 1-2 punch. So if Harvey and Matz can finally stay healthy and approach their initial big league form, the pitching staff could be terrific again after unraveling last year with a 5.01 ERA that ranked 28th in the majors. Vargas was signed to eat innings but will miss some time at the beginning of the season following surgery for a broken right (non-pitching) hand. Conforto, an All-Star last season, was initially targeting a May 1 return from surgery for a dislocated left shoulder but appeared to be ahead of schedule. His status is critical to a lineup that lacks speed and a natural leadoff hitter. Nimmo made strides last season and is a potential candidate for that role if he platoons early with Lagares to fill Conforto's spot in center. After the Mets spent nearly $90 million to plug holes in free agency, it still might be a stretch to envision them seriously challenging star-studded Washington for NL East supremacy. But with better health in a soft division, they could certainly rejoin the wild-card hunt.\n\n___\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n\n2017: 66-96, fifth place.\n\nManager: Gabe Kapler (first season).\n\nHe's Here: RHP Jake Arrieta, 1B Carlos Santana, RHP Pat Neshek, RHP Tommy Hunter.\n\nHe's Outta Here: Manager Pete Mackanin, SS Freddy Galvis, INF Andres Blanco, OF Daniel Nava, OF Hyun Soo Kim, RHP Clay Buchholz, 1B Tommy Joseph.\n\nProjected Lineup: 2B Cesar Hernandez (.294, 9 HRs, 34 RBIs, 15 SBs), 1B Carlos Santana (.259, 23, 79 with Indians), RF Nick Williams (.288, 12, 55) or Aaron Altherr (.272, 19, 65), LF Rhys Hoskins (.259, 18, 48), CF Odubel Herrera (.281, 14, 56), C Jorge Alfaro (.318, 5, 14), 3B Maikel Franco (.230, 24, 76), SS J.P. Crawford (.214, 0, 6 in 23 games).\n\nRotation: RH Aaron Nola (12-11, 3.54 ERA, 184 Ks), RH Jake Arrieta (14-10, 3.53, 163 Ks with Cubs), RH Vince Velasquez (2-7, 5.13 in 15 starts), RH Nick Pivetta (8-10, 6.02), RH Zach Eflin (1-5, 6.16) or RH Ben Lively (4-7, 4.26).\n\nKey Relievers: RH Hector Neris (4-5, 3.01, 26/29 saves), RH Pat Neshek (5-3, 1.59, 1 save with Phillies and Rockies), RH Tommy Hunter (3-5, 2.61, 1 save with Rays), LH Adam Morgan (3-3, 4.12), RH Luis Garcia (2-5, 2.65).\n\nHot Spot: Starting Rotation. There are a lot of question marks beyond Nola, who emerged as a reliable starter in 2017. Arrieta, the former Cubs ace, had a rough first half in 2017 but finished strong. Yet he was a free agent until mid-March. He's getting paid big bucks to be a No. 1 guy again. Jerad Eickhoff will begin the season on the DL and Velasquez is coming off a disappointing year after showing promise in 2016. Pivetta has upside but needs more maturity. The team has plenty of depth at Triple-A, including several pitchers who have big league experience, in case any of the starters falter or get hurt.\n\nOutlook: The decision to sign Arrieta signals the rebuild is over. The Phillies added Santana, Neshek and Hunter to a talented young roster in hopes of being competitive. A month into spring training, they added Arrieta because management thinks it's time to contend now. The lineup has the potential to be dynamic if the young hitters continue to emerge and Santana does what he did in Cleveland. The bullpen should be formidable with Hunter-Neshek-Neris at the back end. If Arrieta regains his old form, Nola lives up to his promise and a couple other starters take steps forward, the Phillies can not only end their five-year run of losing seasons but maybe even make a surprise push for a postseason berth.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Celtics say point guard Kyrie Irving will miss three to six weeks after surgery on his left knee.\n\nIrving had a \"minimally invasive\" procedure to remove a wire that had been placed in his knee during surgery to repair his broken kneecap from the 2015 NBA finals. The team said Saturday that Irving's kneecap is fully healed and structurally sound, but the tension wire was irritating his tendon.\n\nThe Celtics have the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. The playoffs begin April 14 -- three weeks away. The longer estimate for his return means Irving would not be able to come back until the second round.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "The nine-year stretch of rising stock prices won't last forever. So now's a good time for investors to bear-proof their 401(k)s before the next financial storm. USA TODAY\n\nA number of new studies indicate millennials are generally doing a great job stashing money for the future. But some of those studies also show that they're wary about investing those savings in the stock market.\n\nMore:Having too much fun? Don't let friends derail your finances\n\nThis could hurt them in the long run. Investing in the stock market is a powerful way to grow your money for your long-term goals -- more on that below. But first, the good news.\n\nAlthough organizations vary in how they define the millennial generation, it broadly encompasses those born in the 1980s and 1990s. Looking at several studies paints a picture of their general habits:\n\nNow the bad news:\n\nIt's no surprise that investors who came of age during the 2008-09 financial crisis would hesitate to embrace the stock market -- the S&P 500 lost about 57% of its value between October 2007 and March 2009, when the oldest millennials were in their late 20s.\n\nThe problem is, some millennials may be putting their retirement security at risk by shying away from stocks now. Consider that the S&P 500 averaged a 7.92% return from January 2007 through December 2017, adjusted for inflation and with dividends reinvested -- and that time period includes the financial crisis. By comparison, the average annual return for money market bank accounts hasn't topped 0.3% in the past eight years.\n\nOf course, it's difficult to generalize across a generation that includes about 71 million people (that figure is according to Pew Research Center, which defines millennials as those born from 1981 to 1996). Plenty of millennials are making smart financial decisions, says Meir Statman, professor of finance at Santa Clara University and author of \"Finance for Normal People.\"\n\n\"On the one hand, you have really great awareness on the part of millennials of the need to save for retirement,\" Statman says. But, he adds, many people \"are still scarred by the financial crisis.\"\n\nFor people nervous about investing, the key is to put the stock market risk in perspective, Statman says.\n\n\"The risk of the stock market is not the biggest risk in life,\" Statman says. Every time you make a decision -- whether it's your career choice, whom you're going to marry, where you're going to live -- that decision entails risk, he says. Maybe your chosen profession will become obsolete, or you'll choose a partner who isn't right for you.\n\n\"Taking risk is not a luxury; it's a necessity,\" Statman says. \"If you look at risk in the overall context of life, you see that we take risk not because we like risk, but because we have aspirations. Aspirations are the engine, the driver of the train, and risk is really one of the cars of the train.\"\n\nOthers agree that millennials shouldn't necessarily run from stock-market risk. \"Millennials have to be smart about risk. But they also have to be comfortable with the idea of some risk, at least in the short-term,\" says Jason Kirsch, a certified financial planner, founder of investment advisory Grow, and author of \"The Millennial Advantage: How Millennials Can (and Must) Be the Next Great Generation of Investors.\"\n\nFor those ready to try investing, there are easy ways to get started. Some simple retirement portfolios you can build on your own. And there are robo-advisors who do the work of investment choice and management for you, for a relatively modest fee.

                "body": "Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee during Friday night's game against Atlanta, an MRI revealed on Saturday.\n\nAccording to a person with knowledge of the situation, the two-time MVP will be re-evaluated in three weeks and could return for the start of the playoffs in mid-April. The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because the diagnosis had not yet been announced.\n\nYet the Warriors (54-18) preached caution on that front in the immediate aftermath of the diagnosis, as this injury is more significant than the one that threatened their championship hopes nearly two years ago. On April 27, 2016, when the Warriors were playing Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets with a 2-1 series lead, Curry suffered a Grade 1 MCL sprain of the right knee that ultimately cost him just four playoff games (and 15 days).\n\nThere was always a question of whether he returned to full health during that postseason, with the Warriors blowing that 3-1 Finals lead against Cleveland while Curry played some of his most inconsistent basketball down the stretch. In that sense, it appears entirely possible that Curry -- who had just returned from a six game absence due to a right ankle injury -- will have to play through the postseason at less than full strength.\n\nKevin Durant's situation from last season might ultimately prove more applicable as it pertains to Curry's latest setback. Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain on Feb. 28 in a game against the Washington Wizards and didn't return until April 8 (missing 19 games in the process). In the end, he was healthy enough to earn Finals MVP honors as they downed the Cavs in five games.\n\n2018 NBA mock draft 1.0 Fullscreen Flip through the gallery to see first edition of USA TODAY Sports' 2018 NBA mock draft.

                "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Napheesa Collier had 16 points and 11 rebounds to help top-seed UConn beat Duke 72-59 on Saturday and advance to the Elite Eight for the 13th consecutive season.\n\nUConn (35-0) will face defending national champion South Carolina on Monday night in trying to reach an 11th straight Final Four.\n\nThe Huskies scored the first seven points of the game beginning with a banked-in 3-pointer from Kia Nurse and they were off and running.\n\nDuke had only given up an average of 49 points in its first two games of the tournament. UConn had that by the end of the third quarter, much to the delight of the partisan crowd of 10,658 that took in the Albany Regional.\n\nFifth-seed Duke (24-9) was only down seven early in the second quarter when the Blue Devils went cold from the field, going scoreless over the next 5½ minutes. UConn extended its advantage to 30-16.\n\nThe Blue Devils cut their deficit to 12, but UConn scored the final eight points of the half, including a pullup by Gabby Williams just before the halftime buzzer to give UConn a 40-20 lead.\n\nDuke closed its gap to 44-31 midway through the third quarter, but didn't score for the rest of the period and UConn rebuilt the 20-point advantage.\n\nThe game also featured Huskies center Azura Stevens going against her former team. She transferred to UConn after her sophomore season. Stevens had eight points and 12 rebounds.\n\nKatie Lou Samuelson and Williams each had 15 points for the Huskies.\n\nDuke was led by sophomore Leaonna Odom, who has been dominant in the tournament, averaging 20.5 points and 6.5 rebounds while shooting 60 percent from the field in wins over Belmont and Georgia. She had 22 on Saturday.\n\nThe loss ended the stellar careers of Duke guards Rebecca Greenwell and Lexie Brown. The pair came into the game averaging a combined 33.9 points this season which was third best among Power Five schools. They only had 16 combined against UConn.\n\nDYNAMIC DUO: Nurse and Williams moved into a tie for fourth on the all-time NCAA win list, improving to 147-2 in their stellar careers at UConn. If the Huskies win the national championship the pair will finish at 150-2, the third-most wins all-time in NCAA history. It would also be the second-best winning percentage for a senior class, trailing only UConn's Saniya Chong, who graduated last year with a 152-2 mark.\n\nTIP-INS: UConn had won the past eight meetings in the series before the two teams stopped playing after the 2014 season. ... Duke coach Joanne P. McCallie is 1-11 all-time against UConn with the lone win coming in 2004 when she was the head coach of Michigan State. ... Brown added to her single-season school record for steals with six against UConn. She finished the season with 121, seven more than former record holder Alana Beard. ... UConn was 8 for 16 from the free-throw line.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nUConn beat South Carolina by 25 points on Feb. 1. The second-seeded Gamecocks advanced to the regional final with a 79-63 win over 11th-seeded Buffalo.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Some of the best drivers in the sport's history - among them Bill Elliott, Bobby Allison and Matt Kenseth - own no victories at Martinsville.\n\nBrad Keselowski no longer is on that list.

I made some mistakes and caught some bad breaks, and that's just kind of part of how this race track plays out sometimes.\n\n\"I think each weekend was probably a little different as to why it didn't come together, but we kept the faith that if we kept running up front and in that position it eventually would, and it did.\"\n\nOnce a driver and team figure out the intricacies of the track, that knowledge generally carries over from race to race, Keselowski said.\n\nBreakthrough: Brad Keselowski scores first Cup win at Martinsville\n\nMoving ahead: Elliott, Hamlin put Martinsville wreck in past, look forward\n\nBad Brad: Keselowski wins wreck-fest at Talladega to advance in playoffs\n\nHembree: How snow caused epic havoc at NASCAR race 25 years ago\n\n\"The thing about Martinsville is it's a track that is fairly consistent,\" he said. \"There are some variables with, of course, the weather and the tires, but once you can hit the basics of it I think you can kind of stay pretty close on the target.\"\n\nEven with a good car, though, Martinsville is a challenge because racing is usually a contact sport here. Keselowski was involved in the frantic bumping and banging that occurred in last fall's race.\n\n\"I just think it's part of the ebbs and flows of racing,\" he said. \"In some ways it makes it exciting and unpredictable, and other ways it's entirely frustrating and you just kind of have to live with it and roll with it.\n\n\"In racing, you can control your own move, but you can't control the moves of everyone else around you, and at any time that can ruin your day, so with respect to that there is certainly a little bit more of an out-of-your-own-control factor fate, whatever you want to call it, in motorsports that makes it somewhat compelling at times and also completely frustrating as a competitor at others.\"\n\nThe career of Brad Keselowski Fullscreen Brad Keselowski, who was born Feb. 12, 1984 in in Rochester Hills, Mich., began his NASCAR career as the driver of the No. 29 Ford F-150 for the family-owned K-Automotive Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nBoston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving had a tension wire removed from his left knee during a procedure on Saturday, and he will resume basketball activities in 3-6 weeks, the team said in a statement.\n\nThat means Irving could miss the start of the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nThe Celtics just about have the No. 2 seed locked up. They are six games ahead of Cleveland and 4 1/2 games behind first-place Toronto.\n\nThe wire was inserted in the knee during the surgical repair of a fractured patella sustained during the 2015 NBA Finals, according to the Celtics.\n\nThe team also had good news, too: the removal of the wire should alleviate the soreness, and the patella has healed completely. The Celtics said Irving's knee is 100% structurally sound.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter.",

                "body": "JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Pitcher Dan Straily will begin the season on the disabled list, the latest setback for the depleted Miami Marlins.\n\nStraily was originally set to start the second game of the season, next weekend at home against the Cubs. But the right-hander exited Monday's minor league game early because of forearm tightness after throwing 60 pitches, and an MRI revealed inflammation.\n\n\"There could be nothing in there right now, no inflammation there right now, but if you wait the 10-day period, you are going to be assured that there's nothing in there,\" Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.\n\nOnce Straily begins throwing again, he will once again have to build arm strength, making it unlikely Straily will appear in a major league game before the middle of April.\n\n\"There would be a buildup process,\" Mattingly said.\n\nInjuries incurred both before the start of spring and during Grapefruit League play could force nearly half of Miami's projected starting lineup to begin the season on rehab assignments in the minors.\n\nCatcher J.T. Realmuto also continues to rebound slowly from a lower back contusion suffered on March 11 while diving into second base on a pickoff attempt. For the third consecutive day Realmuto played catch on a back field at the Roger Dean Stadium complex.\n\n\"I think he's feeling better, but I think obviously him throwing the third day in a row, not progressing past that, is an indication that it's not going as fast as we'd like,\" Mattingly said.\n\nA veteran of three full seasons, Realmuto hit .278 with 17 homers for the Marlins last year, but hasn't swung a bat since the injury.\n\n\"If he's swinging it, he's swinging it on his own somewhere that we don't know about,\" Mattingly said.\n\nThe entire left side of the Marlins infield also remains in flux. Starting shortstop J.T. Riddle is still working his way back from last season's shoulder surgery. Miami intended to get Riddle into his first Grapefruit League game earlier this week, but scratched him when shoulder soreness resurfaced.\n\nStarting third baseman Martin Prado, who will begin the season on the DL, was scheduled to run at full speed in a straight line on Saturday as he continues to rehab his surgically repaired knee. He's yet change directions while running full speed.\n\n\"Martin has not got to bases yet but we did cross the curve where we hit the snag last time,\" Mattingly said.\n\nIn one piece of good news for the Marlins, starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen was scheduled to face live hitters in a bullpen session on Sunday. Should all go well, Chen could begin building arm strength in preparation for a return to the majors.\n\nMiami signed Chen to a five-year, $80 million contract prior to the 2016 season, but has made only 27 starts since then. He's been slowed by a partially torn UCL since last season.\n\nThe Marlins host the University of Miami on Tuesday before opening the season against Chicago on Thursday.\n\n\"There will be some guys staying around here and continuing things around here,\" Mattingly said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The right-hander, who has made only 17 major league starts over the last three years, gave up 22 hits and compiled an 8.10 ERA in 10 Grapefruit League innings.\n\nWheeler will start the season with Triple-A Las Vegas. Seth Lugo is likely to open as the No. 5 starter for the Mets while newcomer Jason Vargas recovers from surgery for a broken bone in his right (non-pitching) hand.\n\nA highly touted prospect, Wheeler pitched pretty well for New York from 2013-14. He missed the next two seasons following Tommy John surgery and finally returned last year, going 3-7 with a 5.21 ERA in 86 1/3 innings. He lost his last five decisions and didn't pitch after July 22 because of a stress reaction in his right arm.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "CLOSE\n\nSportsPulse: The Yankees and Red Sox look loaded heading into the season, but who will come out on top? USA TODAY Sports\n\nFORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Boston Red Sox ace Chris Sale says he expects to be fine to start on opening day after being hit by a line drive in his final spring training tuneup.\n\nSale was struck on the left hip Saturday by a liner off the bat of Houston's J.D. Davis in the first inning.\n\nSale immediately went to the ground, but walked off the field under his own power. The Red Sox called the injury a bruise.\n\nThe left-hander later said he was OK and expected to pitch Thursday when the AL East champions open at Tampa Bay. Chris Archer was set to start for the Rays -- on Friday, he was hit by a grounder in the forearm of his pitching arm and had to leave a minor league game.\n\nSale led the majors with 308 strikeouts last season, going 17-8 with a 2.90 ERA in his first year with Boston.\n\nSale's injury came a day after San Francisco ace Madison Bumgarner sustained a broken hand on his pitching hand when he was hit by a line drive. He is expected to miss at least a month.\n\nThe Red Sox already were looking at starting out with a depleted rotation. Manager Alex Cora announced hours earlier that pitchers Drew Pomeranz and Eduardo Rodriguez will begin the season on the disabled list. Knuckleballer Steven Wright has accepted a 15-game suspension under Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy.\n\nMORE MLB:\n\nBumgarner's injury closes the book on Giants' windowCorrea thrives as superstar, national heroBest shots from spring training Fullscreen March 23: Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner, center, is looked over by manager Bruce Bochy, right, and a trainer after getting hit by a comebacker.

                "title": "UCLA to face Mississippi State for spot in Final Four",
                "body": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- After UCLA advanced to the second weekend of the women's NCAA Tournament, Cori Close checked her phone for messages.\n\nOne of them was from Nan Wooden, the daughter of the Bruins' iconic men's coach.\n\n\"Daddy would have liked watching this team,\" Nan said, \"and daddy would have been proud of you.\"\n\nClose nearly choked up recalling the message, shortly after her third-seeded Bruins went a step further by beating No. 2 seed Texas to reach the Elite Eight. And just imagine how John Wooden would have felt if they can reach their first Final Four with a victory over Mississippi State.\n\nThe Bruins play the top-seeded Bulldogs in the regional final on Sunday night.\n\n\"Coach Wooden mentored me for 15 years,\" Close said. \"Forget me as a coach, my life has been deeply affected by him and his influence and his time. That's really humbling.\"\n\nThe task ahead of her team is hardly easy.\n\nThe Bulldogs (35-1) set a school record for wins in a season when they romped past fourth-seeded North Carolina State on Friday night. They return most of the stars that led them to the national title game last season, including 6-foot-7 standout Teaira McCowan.\n\nTheir only loss all season came to powerhouse South Carolina in the SEC Tournament.\n\n\"Mississippi State is a great team,\" said the Bruins' star, Jordin Canada. \"We know it's going to be a battle. But I think it comes down to us and what we need to do to execute our game plan, and stay together as a team and do what makes us great -- playing to our strengths.\n\n\"I think,\" she said, \"that's what it's going to take for Sunday.\"\n\nThe Bulldogs certainly played to their strengths against the Wolfpack, lobbing the ball inside to McCowan for easy baskets. She wound up with 24 points on perfect shooting, both from the field and the foul line, and pulled down 15 rebounds in a performance that will long be remembered in Starkvegas.\n\nShe was matter-of-fact about her night, too.\n\n\"A lot of teams say I wear on them,\" she said, \"so at the beginning of the game teams are giddy and going, and the end of the game is when I always get 'em. Either way, it's a lose-lose.\"\n\nWell, it has been for just about everybody this season. But the Bruins believe they have what it takes to stop the Bulldogs' push for back-to-back Final Fours.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nMORE MCCOWAN: Mississippi State's center has been close to perfection this season, going 12 of 13 from the field in a win over rival Ole Miss. But her 11-for-11 night in the regional semifinals matched the record for NCAA Tournament perfection set by Terry Carmichael of Saint Joseph's in a 1985 first-round game against, oddly enough, North Carolina State.\n\nMCCOWAN ISN'T ALONE: Victoria Vivians had 14 points and Morgan William had 13 in the win over the Wolfpack, helping give the Bulldogs four double-digit scorers. That kind of balance is hard to beat.\n\nLONG TIME COMING: Close and her counterpart, Vic Schaefer, have something in common in that both coaches spent years as assistants before getting head coaching jobs. Close spent nearly two decades on the bench at UCLA and UC Santa Barbara, her alma mater, while Schaefer coached for years under Gary Blair at Texas A&M.\n\n\"Myself, Cori, Vic, our journey has been similar in that we were long-time assistants for iconic coaches, really,\" said Texas coach Karen Aston, who learned under the Longhorns' Jody Conradt and Baylor coach Kim Mulkey, among others. \"We've kind of grown up in the profession together.\"\n\nTHE OTHER TITLE: While the Bruins are still seeking their first Final Four in the NCAA Tournament era, they do have a national title on their resume. That was won in 1978, during the AIWA years.\n\nFAMILIAR FOES: UCLA and Mississippi State have never played in women's basketball, but they do have some familiarity. The teams played a closed scrimmage prior to last season.\n\n\"In this tournament, you can't afford to have a bad day. You can't miss a hedge on a ball screen, go under on a shooter,\" Schaefer said.\n\n\"Our kids are dialed in. They have been all year.

She knew eight of the victims, and said she's out here in their honor. \"I'm so happy that everyone is supporting us and everyone wants a change,\" she said.\n\nThe rally, which began at noon, featured the familiar voices of many Douglas students. Their words echoed through city streets as they, one by one, took turns speaking in front of a mic on the main stage.\n\n\"Welcome to the revolution,\" said Cameron Kasky, who was the first student speaker.\n\nThe crowd roared in applause.\n\n\"My generation has spent our entire lives seeing mass shooting after mass shooting,\" he said.\n\nAnd that needs to end now, he added.\n\nKasky advised everyone to start a conversation and become educated in order to make a change on gun control.\n\nThe students from Florida arrived to Washington D.C. by bus and plane just in time to stand as one.\n\nBrothers Juan and Santiago Munera were tired, but determined as they walked on Pennsylvania Avenue toward the main stage.\n\nThey arrived to the nation's capital by bus two hours before the rally.\n\nIt was a long 23 hours, but sophomore Juan Munera, 17, said it was worth the trip.\n\n\"Before the shooting we didn't think we could make a difference as teens,\" Juan Munera said.\n\nBut his mindset changed following the shooting and seeing his Douglas peers support one another and demand stricter gun control laws from the government.\n\nNow we're trying to change gun laws,\" he said.\n\nThe brothers were both in the freshman building where shots were fired. Juan Munera said speaking up about the experience has helped them cope.\n\nJunior Emily Silver, 17, arrived to D.C. on Friday and proudly wore a maroon shirt that read \"MSDstrong\" as she made her way through the crowds Saturday.\n\n\"It's overwhelming, but I'm excited to see everyone here from Parkland and everyone in the country coming together,\" she said.\n\nHer mom Ivy Silver and stepdad Ben Ditsch walked alongside her as they pushed through crowds to meet other Parkland families closer to the stage.\n\nDitsch said he's never been more proud of his stepdaughter and her classmates.\n\n\"If you try to argue with this generation, you won't win,\" he said.",

If the Ramblers do advance, Charles Barkley would like to hang out with the 98-year-old team chaplain.\n\nBarkley's fellow NBA on TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson suggested if Loyola wins, Chuck and Sister Jean should take a stroll down San Antonio's famous river walk.\n\nTo which Barkley said:\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Ernie. If Loyola gets to the Final Four, me and Sister Jean will go down that dirty creek. It's not a river. There's no such thing as the San Antonio River. It's a dirty creek.\"\n\nAfter Barkley was chastised for criticizing a major attraction of the city they're about to be in for the tournament's final games, Kenny Smith chimed in to point out the obvious flaw in Barkley's plans.\n\nSmith said:\n\n\"Sister Jean has not accepted that date. She has not said yes to that, so he is asking for a date he has not gotten yet.\"\n\nBarkley continued to praise Sister Jean's charisma, sportsmanship and basketball analysis, but he also took a hilarious shot at Smith and Shaquille O'Neal.\n\n\"I'm used to Kenny and Shaq not having a clue, but Sister Jean was so eloquent.\"\n\nIf Loyola tops Kansas State and gets to the Final Four, Chuck and Sister Jean spending time together is something basketball fans everywhere would love to see happen.\n\nMORE:\n\nWendy's released a surprisingly solid rap mixtape and ravaged McDonald's\n\nESPN's Zach Lowe says Kevin Love gives the Cavs an 'unstoppable' lineup\n\nJohnny Manziel salutes Colin Kaepernick, speaks out on 'comparisons'\n\nMarshall Henderson waited two years to get his revenge on Erin Andrews",

Especially because they are point guards who create so much for their teammates, if one of these teams win the national title it will have so much to do with the lead guards. Brunson was particularly impressive in the Wildcats' victory, finishing with 27 points and willing his team to victory with his playmaking.",

                "title": "With rookie manager, Mets ready to roll out prized pitchers",
                "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- From the start of spring training in Florida, their lockers were lined up all in a row at one end of the rectangular clubhouse.\n\nLeft to right: Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom, Steven Matz, Zack Wheeler.\n\nThe dream rotation for the New York Mets -- if only their health would cooperate.\n\nMore than a month later, with opening day in sight, those five prized pitchers were still feeling good and the Mets finally had a chance to roll out that entire quintet together for the very first time.\n\nWheeler, however, failed to do his part. After compiling an 8.10 ERA and giving up 22 hits in 10 Grapefruit League innings, he was optioned to minor league camp Saturday and will begin the season at Triple-A Las Vegas.\n\nSeth Lugo is likely to open as the team's No. 5 starter.\n\nStill, four out of five ain't bad -- and Lugo has chops, too. So after hiring rookie manager Mickey Callaway and spending nearly $90 million to fill holes in free agency, New York (with fingers crossed) is counting on its homegrown power arms to lead the way this season.\n\n\"The potential speaks for itself,\" new reliever Anthony Swarzak said. \"It's incredible, the stuff that's in that rotation. It's second to none, I think.\"\n\nHarvey, Matz and Wheeler struggled on the mound last year during their latest injury-stunted seasons, so they must rediscover the nasty stuff that looked so promising when they first arrived in the majors.\n\nAt the top of the rotation, Syndergaard and deGrom make for a terrific tandem that offers more certainty.\n\nSyndergaard is back from a torn lat muscle that limited the hardest-throwing starter in the majors to 30 1/3 innings last season, while deGrom is coming off 15 wins and a 3.53 ERA with 239 strikeouts in 201 1/3 innings.\n\n\"All of us are All-Star capable,\" Wheeler said last month.\n\nTo solidify a fragile group, general manager Sandy Alderson signed veteran lefty Jason Vargas, an 18-game winner with Kansas City in 2017. Vargas got hit by a line drive in spring training and had surgery for a broken bone in his right hand. He'll miss some time at the beginning of the season.\n\nOn offense, slugger Yoenis Cespedes returns after playing only 81 games last season because of leg injuries. All-Star outfielder Michael Conforto, who initially targeted a May 1 return from surgery for a dislocated left shoulder, had already played center in a Grapefruit League game and appeared way ahead of schedule.\n\nRight fielder Jay Bruce was brought back as a free agent after the Mets traded him to Cleveland last August. He joins newcomers Todd Frazier and Adrian Gonzalez in a plodding lineup that boasts power.\n\n\"This has been our theme with the Mets: If we can be healthy, we can do some damage,\" lefty reliever Jerry Blevins said.\n\nEarly in camp, Callaway boldly proclaimed that if his club fails to \"do something special,\" the blame should fall on him.\n\n\"I think Sandy and the brass have done a great job getting this team to where we should be. Now it's our time to take care of the rest,\" Frazier said.\n\nThings to know about the Mets heading into their opener Thursday at home against St. Louis:\n\n___\n\nHERE'S THE PITCH: Decimated by injuries, New York's talented staff fell apart last year and finished with a 5.01 ERA that ranked 28th in the majors. After making consecutive playoff appearances, including their run to the 2015 World Series, the Mets traded away veterans during the summer and tumbled to 70-92. The 42-year-old Callaway, a highly successful pitching coach in Cleveland, replaced Terry Collins, 68, the longest-tenured manager in Mets history. The team also overhauled its medical department and brought in new pitching instructor Dave Eiland, who held that job for World Series champions in 2009 (New York Yankees) and 2015 (Kansas City).\n\nTHE CAPTAIN AND THE QUARTERBACK: Mets captain and longtime third baseman David Wright is still trying to return from back and shoulder problems that have sidelined him since May 2016. After yet another medical setback, he hopes to begin baseball workouts in May, but his future is uncertain. Early in spring training, Alderson said he thought Tim Tebow would make it to the majors one day. The former NFL quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy winner was reassigned to minor league camp after going 1 for 18 (.056) with 11 strikeouts in seven big league exhibition games. The 30-year-old outfielder also was hampered by a left ankle sprain. He'll likely start the season at Double-A or a level lower.\n\nBEST CASE: The starters pile up strikeouts, the sluggers pound home runs and most of them remain healthy as New York earns a wild card and maybe even pushes Washington for first place in the NL East.\n\nWORST CASE: Injuries wreak havoc again, age takes a major toll and the back of the rotation is a mess as the Mets finish under .500 for the second straight season.\n\n___\n\nAP freelance writer Bill Whitehead in Port St. Lucie, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "PHOENIX (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers have optioned Junior Guerra, their opening day starter a year ago, to Triple-A Colorado Springs.\n\nGuerra has made five spring starts and is scheduled to pitch Sunday's Cactus League finale against the Chicago White Sox. The 33-year-old right-hander, who had a groin injury in the opener at Cincinnati last year, was hampered all season and finished with a 5.12 ERA in 70 1-3 innings. He has a 3.15 ERA in 20 spring innings.\n\nManager Craig Counsell said that pitcher Yovani Gallardo also has been told he will not make the team. Gallardo, 32, came up with Milwaukee in 2007 and spent eight years with the Brewers, starting the 2014 opener. He was 5-10 with a 5.72 ERA for Seattle last year.\n\nChase Anderson goes on opening day on Thursday against the Padres, and Zach Davies was already scheduled to start the Brewers' home opener April 2 against St. Louis.\n\nCounsell said that Jhoulys Chacin and lefty Brent Suter will start the final two games of the opening series in San Diego. The fifth starter will be Brandon Woodruff, but he will work out of the bullpen in San Diego, Counsell said.\n\nCounsell said Woodruff will start in the home series against the Chicago Cubs, who follow the Cardinals to Miller Park.\n\nOutfielders Keon Broxton and Brett Phillips also have been optioned to the minors.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nUSA TODAY Sports dissects the four Elite Eight games of the NCAA tournament and picks which teams will reach the Final Four in San Antonio.\n\nLoyola-Chicago vs. Kansas State (Saturday -- 6:09 p.m. ET, TBS): Both teams excel in the halfcourt but play unbelievably different. Whereas the Wildcats are built to win rock fights, the Ramblers are all about efficiency and possessions in which all five players touch the ball. Unless KSU's Barry Brown goes on an absolute tear, expect Loyola-Chicago's Cinderella run to continue into the Final Four. The Ramblers top-5 defense and wide-array of offensive options will make this the first game they don't have to win at the last second. ► Expert Final Four pick: Loyola-Chicago.\n\nKANSAS STATE-LOYOLA: Not about five-star recruits\n\nEPIC UNDERDOG CLASH: Two underrated teams go head-to-head\n\nMichigan vs. Florida State (Saturday -- 8:49 p.m. ET, TBS): The Wolverines' offense came to life in a dominant Sweet 16 game against Texas A&M, and it will have to stay alive against the Junkyard Dog Defense of Florida State. The Seminoles took Xavier's Trevon Bluiett out of the game in their second-round upset before limiting Gonzaga to 60 points earlier this week. Michigan's key cogs, namely Mo Wagner, have to play well, but look for coach John Beilein's defense to be the story of this game. ► Expert Final Four pick: Michigan.\n\nELITE EIGHT BREAKDOWN: Why each team will win on Saturday\n\nVillanova vs. Texas Tech (Sunday -- 2:20 p.m. ET, CBS): The Wildcats draw another defensively-weaponized Big 12 foe in the Red Raiders after fending off West Virginia's pressing style of play. But where TTU is a step ahead might be on the ability to lock down the perimeter, which just so happens to be where Jalen Brunson and his hot-shooting teammates thrive. Brunson vs. Texas Tech's Keenan Evans will be a must-watch individual matchups between lightning rod point guards. Ultimately, as we saw against WVU, 'Nova has too many catalysts poised to step up. ► Expert Final Four pick: Villanova.\n\nTITLE SWAGGER: No. 1s Kansas, Villanova both show net-cutting ability\n\nELITE STATUS: Kansas climbs back toward peak level\n\nDuke vs. Kansas (Sunday -- 5:05 p.m. ET, CBS): The No. 1 team and No. 2 team in the NCAA tournament's toughest Region figures to be a Final Four-type game before either of these teams get to San Antonio. The Jayhawks will need to shoot the lights out to avoid losing in a third consecutive Elite Eight. And big man Udoka Azubuike will have to hold his own against Duke's athletic bigs, especially All-American Marvin Bagley III. This is a game where Coach K's 2-3 zone might come unhinged if Big 12 player of the year Devonte' Graham and Co. are making their threes. Duke's Trevon Duval and Grayson Allen will have their hands full with marksmen Graham, Malik Newman and Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk. ► Expert Final Four pick: Kansas.\n\nMARCH SADNESS: THE AGONY OF DEFEAT IN THE NCAAS\n\nMarch Sadness: Agony of defeat in the 2018 NCAA tournament Fullscreen A dejected David Skara reacts after Clemson lost to Kansas.

                "body": "HATTIESBURG, Miss. -- Wallaby enthusiasm is reaching a peak in Hattiesburg, Miss., as Jeff the missing wallaby has been on the lam for nearly two weeks.\n\nPeople all over town are looking for the Australian macropod -- carrying bananas and bread with them 24-7 in case they chance upon the elusive 3-foot, brown, furry creature.\n\nLance Sanderford, a local store owner, has offered a $200 reward for Jeff and taken to the skies to try to find him.\n\nSanderford and two of his friends recently manned powered-paragliders -- paragliders powered by lightweight, aluminum Italian motors -- and scanned the area, where Jeff was last spotted.\n\n\"We've got some good wind coming up -- meaning no wind -- we can concentrate on flying and get low and look for stuff,\" he said. \"We scoured and scoured, but all I saw were dogs, ducks, dust and a couple of horses. No Jeff.\"\n\nJeff escaped March 14 from his home in the Acadia Oaks subdivision of Hattiesburg. There have been a couple of sightings around Lake Serene -- and one doe mistaken for a wallaby -- but so far, Jeff has evaded capture.\n\nSanderford said he has a thing for animals, and Jeff grabbed a hold of his heart.\n\n\"I saw that little sucker in his T-shirt and he's so cute,\" he said. \"I have a sense of community, and I want to help out where I can.\"\n\nMore: Businesses offer rewards for the return of Jeff the wallaby\n\nSanderford printed up wanted posters of Jeff and posted one on his Facebook page. More than 5,000 people responded, asking for information about the missing wallaby.\n\nVan Arnold, assistant director for media relations at the University of Southern Mississippi, also has Jeff on the mind.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about finding this little feller,\" he said. \"I have a soft spot for animals. I want him returned.\"\n\nArnold was musing about Jeff one day when it was raining and musical genius struck. He penned a plaintive song about the wallaby to the tune of Elvis Presley's Kentucky Rain:\n\n\"Seven lonely days and a dozen yards ago, they looked up one night and Jeff was gone ...\n\n\"Don't know why he'd run -- what he's running to or from -- all I know is we need to bring Jeff home...\"\n\nArnold posted a video of himself fervently singing the song on his Facebook page, and it went viral. It's gotten nearly 20,000 views.\n\n\"I had no idea (the song) was going to be this interesting to folks,\" Arnold said. \"But (Jeff) has become such a big thing in Hattiesburg.\n\n\"It's such an unusual animal -- not everybody has a pet wallaby. It being an exotic animal, plus he's so cute! Everybody's interested in this lost animal.\"\n\nAnd now people who are looking for Jeff can dress the part. The Burg has created a \"Where's Jeff?\" T-shirt, featuring a drawing of Jeff.\n\nBut that's not the only commercial contribution.\n\nAt least two other Pine Belt businesses have offered rewards to whomever can bring Jeff home. Parris Jewelers is offering a $250 gift certificate, and Magnolia Grille in Columbia is offering dinner for two.\n\nBut what if Jeff doesn't want to be found? Maybe he's enjoying his new life of freedom.\n\n\"Wallabies have those natural instincts,\" said Stephen Taylor, animal care manager with the Hattiesburg Zoo. \"They know what to do to survive. They know exactly what to do.\"\n\nTaylor thinks Jeff is probably just fine -- as long as a car or predator doesn't get him. Based on his experience with the zoo's four wallabies, he figures Jeff is probably getting plenty to eat.\n\n\"They're big grazers,\" he said. \"They'll eat lots of grasses -- leaves off trees.\n\n\"They're very resourceful. They come from an environment where there is a scarcity of resources. They'll even eat bark off trees.\"\n\nTaylor also said Jeff is probably doing OK with the Hattiesburg weather.\n\n\"They are very tough,\" he said. \"They can be (in environments) as low as the 20s and they can handle extreme temperatures as far as heat goes.\n\n\"They may look small and cute, but they're hardy fellows.\"\n\nBut Taylor said good luck catching Jeff.\n\n\"They're extremely fast,\" he said. \"Our guys will go scooting well over 20 miles per hour.\n\n\"If a human were attempting to run down a wallaby, it would take some kind of miracle for that to happen.\"\n\nJeff's owner, Logan Whitehead, said he has been searching for Jeff before he goes to work every morning and after he gets home from work every day until the sun goes down.\n\n\"That's my child,\" said Whitehead, who got Jeff from a private breeder.\n\nHe believes the wallaby, who is about 2 years old, is likely still in the Lamar County area.\n\n\"I don't think he's going to die or is in any danger,\" he said. \"He's just exploring and doing his thing.\"\n\nIf you see Jeff the wallaby, do not approach him. Place a slice of bread or banana on the ground and let him approach to investigate. He will be easier to capture.\n\nHandle Jeff with care. His arms are small and fragile, owner Logan Whitehead said.\n\nWhitehead encourages anyone who spots Jeff to contact him or Hub City Humane Society immediately and to keep their eyes on the wallaby.\n\nContact Hub City Humane Society at 601-596-2206 or Whitehead at 601-297-8052.",

                "title": "Madison Bumgarner's injury officially closes the book on Giants' window",
                "body": "CLOSE\n\nSportsPulse: The Dodgers have won their division five years in a row. Are they a lock to do it again? USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe window is now shut.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants kept trying to extend their stretch of glory this decade, kept hoping the horses that carried them to three World Series championships since 2010 had at least one more run left in them.\n\nIt seemed like a longshot pursuit, and they certainly took a counterintuitive approach by adding veterans to an aging team when the rest of baseball is going decidedly younger. But the notion of extracting a playoff berth out of an accomplished group of players in their early 30s was at least intriguing.\n\nUntil Friday. When staff ace Madison Bumgarner broke a bone in his pitching hand upon getting hit by a line drive in his final start of the spring, the Giants' fate for the season was essentially sealed.\n\nBarring a major surprise, the Giants won't make a fifth consecutive even-year postseason appearance. The core group responsible for bringing multiple championship parades to San Francisco figures to be disbanded.\n\nThat's how consequential Bumgarner's injury was. He was the one player the Giants could not afford to lose for an extended period, perhaps even more indispensable than Buster Posey.\n\nThis is what the All-Star catcher said during Bumgarner's nearly three-month-long absence last season due to a sprained left shoulder and bruised ribs sustained in a dirt-bike accident:\n\n\"It's hard to put a number on the value of an ace like him and what he brings. Obviously there's those days he's out there, but also the psychological aspect of it that other teams know, 'Hey, we don't have to face Bumgarner.' I think that plays into the equation as well.''\n\nMORE MLB:\n\nCorrea is Astros' superstar, Puerto Rico's heroOzuna becomes Cardinals' catalyst\n\nNot to minimize Posey's impact. He does exceptional work behind the plate and remains an accomplished hitter. But San Francisco has an experienced backup in Nick Hundley, and the offense has been reinforced enough that it should improve on last year's feeble output with or without Posey.\n\nThe rotation, on the other hand, already looked shaky before Bumgarner's unlucky break. Johnny Cueto, initially penciled in to follow him in the rotation, is coming off an injury-shortened season in which he yielded a 4.52 ERA. The fourth and fifth spots were to be manned by Ty Blach and Christ Stratton, who have combined for one full season in the majors and will have to move up.\n\nTo compound matters, No. 3 starter Jeff Samardzija will miss about a month with a pectoral muscle strain.\n\nThat means left-hander Derek Holland, in camp on a minor-league contract, likely will get a rotation spot. The other one may go to one of two rookies, Tyler Beede and Andrew Suarez, and neither one enjoyed a stellar spring. Beede put up a 10.80 ERA, Suarez a 7.62 mark.\n\nA rotation that ranked eighth in the NL last season with a 4.58 ERA has gotten appreciably worse. And a bullpen that will be counted on to pick up the starters is depending on two key figures, closer Mark Melancon and lefty Will Smith, who are coming back from arm surgery.\n\nIt's not a recipe for success.\n\nAlthough Bumgarner estimated he would be out 4-6 weeks, chances are it will be closer to two months.\n\nBy the time he returns, the Giants may be buried below the Los Angeles Dodgers, Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies in the powerful NL West.\n\nThe Giants were off to a 6-10 start last season when Bumgarner got hurt on April 20. They went 29-46 in his absence on the way to a 64-98 record, the second-worst mark in the San Francisco era. They are 94-140 since the 2016 All-Star break, the majors' worst record.\n\nIf they're playing at that level in July, the dismantling of their roster will begin. New outfielder Andrew McCutchen, a free agent after the season, may be the first to go. Brandon Belt and Brandon Crawford could follow him out the door. Cueto may draw interest, depending on how he's performing. The same goes for Hunter Pence. Second baseman Joe Panik will have suitors as well.\n\nEven Bumgarner, if healthy and pitching up to his usual standards, could be put on the trade block if the Giants decide to go for the full tear-down. The player they seem most unlikely to move is Posey, the face of the franchise.\n\nRegardless, the club was facing some major changes come 2019. Bumgarner's injury has accelerated that clock.\n\nBest shots from spring training Fullscreen March 23: Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner, center, is looked over by manager Bruce Bochy, right, and a trainer after getting hit by a comebacker.

It's so crowded and scary,\" she said. \"I don't wanna have to do them anymore.\"\n\nBetsy Christenson said she brought her daughters to the anti-gun violence rally, which was created after the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, Fla., to show them \"so many people care about their safety.\"\n\nStanding in the middle of the massive, energized crowd, she said she and other parents aren't going to stand for violence anymore.\n\n\"I get that this march might not lead to immediate change, but these kids will all be able to vote soon,\" Betsy Christenson said. \"If (lawmakers) don't see how important of an issue this is to all of us, they will soon.\"\n\nAbby Andrews and Caroline Larzelere of Columbus, Ohio, both 13, came to the anti-gun rally in Washington to finally have a say -- even if they are just in middle school. They tried to walk out of their class at Weaver Middle School on National Walkout Day on March 14 but said they were told by their principal that the walkout was just for high-schoolers.\n\nThe Parkland rampage shook them up. \"I am scared to go to school now,\" Larzelere said.\n\nMore: March for our Lives rallies happening in every U.S. state: 'We're here and coming to make a change'\n\nMore: 'You know what I like? Not getting shot': These are the signs from today's rallies\n\nMembers of another generation that took to the streets in decades past also came out to the D.C. rally on Saturday.\n\nLee Gurel, 91, says he protested during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and saw Martin Luther King give his I Have a Dream speech.\n\nHe said he couldn't sit back on his couch watching this movement on television. He wanted to help change things for his great-grandchildren.\n\n\"Even if this rally and this effort doesn't lead to change today or next week or next month, it will,\" he said. \"I've seen what impact something like this can do.\"\n\nTeachers were also front and center.\n\nJoyce Hylton, a retired high school teacher. said she's watched gun violence continue to rip apart the country for years and \"couldn't just stand back anymore and wait for someone\" to push for changes.\n\n\"The thing that gets me is that when Sandy Hook happened, those kids were in first grade -- they were babies. And I thought change was going to happen then. It saddens me that nothing happened after that,\" said Gloria Cooperblue, a teacher at Baltimore County Public School.\n\n\"This happens every day in Baltimore. I lost my first student the first day of this year,\" said Cookie Colbert, a teacher at Frederick Douglas High School in Maryland.",

                "body": "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Former Vice President Joe Biden said he skipped the March for Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C., to share his thoughts in his home state of Delaware.\n\n\"Folks, too many people are dying,\" Biden said Saturday in Wilmington at a local rally. \"Too many children are being hurt.\n\nIn a city where more kids are shot than anywhere else in the nation, people of all generations gathered to say they have had enough.\n\nYou're forcing people to look squarely in the eye what they don't want to face,\" he said. Biden's sentiments underscored the action of today's rallies across the USA.\n\nPolice cars blocked off the streets here on Saturday morning as hundreds joined the local March for Our Lives protest, shouting \"Balance, not bullets!\" and \"No more silence! End gun violence!\"\n\nMelinda Penn, who joined families and students for the event, said she and her husband, Bob, were on the University of Texas at Austin campus in 1966 when former Marine Charles Whitman climbed the tower and opened fire.\n\n\"It was so horrible,\" Penn said. \"We had never heard of such a thing happening. It's horrible that we're here 50 years later -- 50 years is too long for this to be going on.\"\n\nThe Penns along with about 400 others marched from Howard High School of Technology to Rodney Square, rallying for school safety and stricter gun laws.\n\n\"I wish with all my heart I didn't have to be here today,\" said Dickinson High School senior Sofia Rose. \"We will not allow this problem to go unaddressed any longer. Congress's inaction is no longer acceptable. I'm too angry for that.\"\n\nAfter her speech, which criticized the easy access to high-powered firearms, arming teachers and adults' dismissal of student protesters because of their age, Rose applauded local efforts to introduce local gun laws in Delaware.\n\n\"Our representatives are doing an amazing job,\" she said, citing a recently introduced assault weapons ban and the Beau Biden Gun Violence Protection Act. \"I wouldn't say I'm happy, because the tragedy that encouraged this movement is so horrible, but I am so proud to be here.\"\n\nAbout 100 miles away, another group of Delaware students joined more than 500,000 teens and adults in Washington, D.C., for the student-led gun control rally created and organized by survivors of the Feb. 14 shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla.\n\nLocal sister marches protesting gun violence and speaking up for school safety also were held in Rehoboth Beach, Lewes and Bethany Beach.\n\n\"It bothers me and it scares me,\" said 12-year-old Rosalie Geist.\n\nSpeaking up for that new generation is what Howard High senior Kayla Davis took to the stage on Saturday. For her, she said, the movement is about focusing on who is causing the violence.\n\n\"We need to grab the younger generation's attention and engage them,\" she said. \"They're the future.\"",

                "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Alexis Jennings scored 20 points, A'ja Wilson added 20 points and 13 rebounds, and South Carolina beat Buffalo 79-63 on Saturday to keep alive its quest to defend its title.\n\nSecond-seeded South Carolina (29-6), whose only losses this year have come against ranked teams, will face the winner of the other Sweet 16 matchup in the Albany Region between top-seeded and unbeaten UConn and Duke, who played later Saturday.\n\nUpstart Buffalo (29-6), just the third Mid-American Conference school to reach the Sweet 16, was among the final four teams to earn an at-large berth. It was the program's second tournament appearance after a first-round exit two years ago.\n\nThe Gamecocks, who have won six straight, defeated North Carolina A&T and Virginia by double digits in the first two rounds, holding both to under 60 points as they stayed on track to make a third Final Four in four seasons. But those performances had flaws -- 19 turnovers in one -- that coach Dawn Staley focused on correcting. They didn't on Saturday -- South Carolina had 26 turnovers -- but in the end it didn't matter.\n\nCierra Dillard led Buffalo with 29 points, the only player in double figures.\n\nThe Gamecocks led 55-48 entering the fourth quarter, and the Bulls stayed with them, closing to 60-54 on Dillard's driving layup off the glass with 6:38 left. But Buffalo missed three straight shots and a fast-break layup by Doniyah Cliney gave South Carolina a 10-point lead with just over 5 minutes to go.\n\nBuffalo is a senior-dominated team and has players from around the globe -- four from Australia, a couple of Canadians, one from Nigeria -- as well as Buffalo-area locals. That melting pot of sorts had created a close-knit group and they helped contribute to the madness of March that has seen 11th seeds wreak havoc on brackets. The 11th-seeded Bulls had already vanquished sixth-seeded South Florida (102-79) and third-seeded Florida State (86-65) -- on the Seminoles home court, no less.\n\nBuffalo coach Felisha Legette-Jack, who nearly quit coaching after being fired by Indiana, had said her Bulls were \"too silly and quirky to be afraid\" and their late-season rush proved it. The Bulls had lost only once in 13 games, the lone setback coming against Central Michigan in the MAC Tournament two weeks ago. That was one of two setbacks to CMU, which won the MAC title and also reached the Sweet 16.\n\nThe Bulls quickly proved they belonged on the big stage, forging a 7-0 run early against the Gamecocks. Dillard's 3 from the left wing gave Buffalo a 10-6 lead midway through the first quarter. South Carolina missed three layups and committed eight turnovers in the period but only trailed 17-16 at the end of the period despite taking six fewer shots than the Bulls.\n\nAs they often did during the season, the Bulls attacked repeatedly from beyond the arc and stayed close until the waning minutes before halftime.\n\nA three-point play by freshman LeLe Grissett began a 12-2 run by the Gamecocks as they continued to attack relentlessly inside. A 3 from left wing by Tyasha Harris and a layup by Jennings gave South Carolina a 40-28 lead.\n\nAfter a layup by Dillard gave Buffalo a one-point lead with 5:50 left in the first half, the Bulls missed five times and committed a turnover before Stephanie Reid hit her only basket of the opening two periods -- a 3 with 6.4 seconds left.\n\nAND THEN THERE WAS ONE\n\nStaley and Legette-Jack were the last two African American coaches in the tournament, which started with 10.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nBuffalo: Legette-Jack made her sixth season at the helm of the Bulls one to remember. The program made its first trip to the Sweet 16. Only one 11 seed has ever advanced to a regional final, Gonzaga in 2011 with a seven-point win over Louisville. The Bulls lose three senior starters who were instrumental in setting a school record for victories. They also went 12-0 at home and, and posted 21 victories decided by at least 10 points, a high bar to match.\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks move on to the Elite Eight but their penchant for mistakes will have to be fixed to have a chance to reach the Final Four.\n\nKEY STAT\n\nSouth Carolina outrebounded Buffalo 48-21.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouth Carolina will play either UConn or Duke in the regional final on Monday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "NEW YORK -- His nose was round and bright red, his face as white as a sheet. His mouth was surrounded by an exaggerated smear of red makeup and his arched eyebrows hung ridiculously high on his forehead.\n\nSuch was the daily uniform of Bozo the Clown, who entertained kids for decades when TV was in its infancy. It's also a uniform that for many now seems grotesque and sinister.\n\nThe death of longtime Bozo performer Frank Avruch this week triggered both feelings - warm memories from some and a shiver of fear from others who associate clowns more with the film \"It.\"\n\nWhich begs the question: When exactly did clowns go from birthday-party goofy to downright sinister? Well, hold onto your really big shoes -- experts are divided.\n\nDavid Carlyon, author, playwright and a former clown with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in the 1970s, argues that the fear of clowns -- known officially as coulrophobia -- is a relatively new phenomenon, born from the counter-culture 1960s and emerging as a popular force in the 1980s.\n\n\"There is no ancient fear of clowns,\" he said. \"It wasn't like there was this panic rippling through Madison Square Garden as I walked up through the seats. Not at all.\"\n\nCarlyon said clowns were considered sweet and funny for two centuries until an inevitable backlash that included Stephen King's hit novel It, the film Poltergeist, Heath Ledger's white-faced maniac Joker, the misanthrope Krusty the Clown from The Simpsons, the shock band Insane Clown Posse and Homey D. Clown from In Living Color.\n\n\"Anything that gets that much glorification and is sentimentalized within an inch of its life invites someone to snark at it,\" said Carlyon, who recently discovered the cover of a National Lampoon from 1979 with a girl cowering in fear of a malevolent clown.\n\n\"There's nothing in any available evidence that kids were afraid of clowns in the '40s, the '50s, the '60s, the '70s,\" he said. \"Who said that about Red Skelton?\"\n\nNot so fast, argues Benjamin Radford, an author and editor at Skeptical Inquirer magazine who literally wrote the book on the subject, 2016's Bad Clowns. Not to throw a pie in anyone's face, but he argues that evil clowns have always been among us.\n\n\"It's a mistake to ask when clowns turned bad because historically they were never really good. They've always had this deeply ambiguous character,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes they're good; sometimes they're bad. Sometimes they're making you laugh. Other times, they're laughing at your expense.\"\n\nRadford traces bad clowns all the way to ancient Greece and connects them to court jesters and the Harlequin figure. He notes that Punch, an evil puppet who frequently smacks his partner Judy with a stick, made his first appearance in London in the 1500s. \"You have this mass-murdering, baby-killing clown that's beloved by Britons everywhere of all ages,\" he said.\n\nClowns in America had their roots in circuses and they were at first meant to amuse adults, but clowning history took a detour in the 1950s and '60s when the squeaky-clean Bozo and Ronald McDonald became the \"quintessentially American default clowns\" for kids, Radford said.\n\nThe more sinister clown waited patiently for his day to shine. \"Stephen King didn't invent the evil clown. That was long before his time. But what he did was turn the coin over, if you will,\" Radford said.\n\nEven if there's debate on the issue, Radford paid homage to Avruch, the first nationally syndicated incarnation of the iconic Bozo. Without virtuous clowns like him to lay the foundation, the bad ones make no sense.\n\n\"The fact is that we need both bad and good clowns because without the good clowns like Bozo, there's no contrast, there's no tension to make the evil or scary clowns entertaining or interesting,\" Radford said.",

USA TODAY Sports\n\nMARTINSVILLE, Va. - They were defining moments in NASCAR's 2017 Cup Series playoffs.\n\nDenny Hamlin crashed into Chase Elliott at Martinsville Speedway in October. Elliott responded by bumping Hamlin into the wall at Phoenix a few weeks later.\n\nIt followed the time-honored NASCAR theme: He wrecked me, so I wrecked him.\n\nAs a result, neither driver got a shot at the Cup championship.\n\nThis weekend the Cup Series returns to the scene of the original incident, and it's fair to say that neither driver has fully recovered emotionally from the fireworks of the closing months of last season.\n\nIt's unlikely they'll be going to the Easter egg hunt together.\n\nElliott said Saturday he frames last fall's Martinsville race not around the trouble with Hamlin - they engaged in some animated discussion immediately after the crash - but on how well his car was running before it was mangled. Elliott was leading and nearing his first Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series victory with a few laps to go when the crash occurred.\n\n\"I try to make myself think about the characteristics and things that our car was doing that made us good,\" Elliott said, \"and just try to run laps in my head and try to have ... I remember a lot of that night. When your cars are good a lot of times I feel like you remember certain things about them, and you just try to think back on the small things that were making the difference, that were allowing us to have the performance we had.\"\n\nHamlin said he made a mistake hitting Elliott's car.\n\n\"It was a mistake on my part, and I've moved on from it,\" Hamlin said. \"We both have.

                "body": "Defending Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton and his Mercedes team clearly haven't missed a beat since Hamilton won his fourth title last season. Ahead of the F1 season opener - the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday - the 33-year-old claimed his seventh career pole at the Melbourne track and put up the fastest lap ever there at 1 minute 21.164 seconds.\n\nBut it also became clear that his rivalry with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel is also still going strong.\n\nEarlier in qualifying, Vettel actually broke the fastest lap record, turning out a time of 1 minute 21.944 seconds. But then Hamilton took over with a dominating lap of his own.\n\nAt their post-qualifying press conference, Hamilton explained that he wasn't doing anything differently in the earlier qualifying rounds compared with his record-breaking lap. And that led to this funny but awkward exchange between him and Vettel.\n\nHamilton: I can assure you we don't have a party mode. I use the same mode from Q2 to end of Q3. So there was no extra button, there was no extra mode that I engaged in.\n\nVettel: What were you doing before then?\n\nHamilton: I was waiting to put a good lap in - plus, wipe the smile off your face.\"\n\nThis exchange is really all in good fun. But later in the press conference, Hamilton and Vettel were asked to address their rivalry and Hamilton's little jab about his qualifying lap.\n\nAll of this took place while Vettel's Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen was sitting up there too.\n\nHere's the full exchange from the press conference transcript, via Motorsport.com:\n\nVettel: I think he said it so quick the first time I didn't get it, so now I got it, thanks for repeating it. I think what goes around comes around. At the end of the day that's why we're here, we want to have fun. If that's what he enjoys, obviously on Saturdays he's doing pretty well.\n\nHamilton: It was a joke.\n\nVettel: I know but... He's free to have a party tonight and then hopefully Kimi and myself will have a party tomorrow.\n\nHamilton: Kimi parties all the time so...\n\nRaikkonen didn't seem to notice he was dragged into Hamilton and Vettel's banter.\n\nMORE:\n\nWendy's released a surprisingly solid rap mixtape and ravaged McDonald's\n\nESPN's Zach Lowe says Kevin Love gives the Cavs an 'unstoppable' lineup\n\nBracket Madness: Vote for the best Marvel Cinematic Universe character in the Elite 8\n\nMarshall Henderson waited two years to get his revenge on Erin Andrews",

                "title": "Jimmie Johnson mired in career worst 28-race losing streak",
                "body": "Jimmie Johnson's start to the NASCAR season is not worthy of a seven-time champion.\n\nHow bad is it? He has just one top-10 finish in five races and goes to Martinsville Speedway mired in a career-worst 28-race losing streak.\n\nBut Johnson can take heart in this: He has nine victories at Martinsville, most among active drivers, and despite his slump must be considered a favorite for Sunday's race at the Virginia short track.\n\nHe laughed Saturday at the reminder of his losing streak, which dates to Dover, Delaware, last June, and pointed out he did indeed win three Cup races in 2018.\n\nIf fans of Johnson's No. 48 team are freaking out -- especially since Lowe's, the only primary sponsor he's had in the Cup, is leaving at the end of the season -- Johnson is not. The reality is the most consistent and successful driver of his generation is the veteran during a Hendrick Motorsports reorganization and Chevrolet's launch of an on-track Camaro.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff going on and it's going to take time to work out the kinks.\n\n\"At the end of last year, there were layers of high frustration and some embarrassment that we just couldn't get things going in the right direction,\" Johnson said Saturday. \"This year, we've improved every week and have seen great strides. I'm very optimistic that success is out there in front of us and around the corner.\n\n\"But, through it all, I live in the moment and understand where I am and where our team is and what we're doing as a company. I know the journey that we're on. I know what's happening internally to build a better product and to better use our resources to build a better think tank. There's a journey of growth going on right now at the company.\"\n\nHendrick's lineup was overhauled because of retirements by Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr., and Kasey Kahne was released from his contract at the end of last season. The team is now Johnson, Chase Elliott, Alex Bowman and William Byron. Johnson is the only active Cup winner in the lineup.\n\nThrough five races this season, Johnson sits 18th in the standings. He was involved in crashes during all of his races at Daytona, and it took until last week in his home state of California for Johnson to put a big number on the board: ninth at Fontana.\n\n\"I'm not losing sleep over it,\" he said. \"I know I'm going to win races. I know this team is going to win races. I know we're going to compete for a championship.\"\n\nJohnson isn't getting much sympathy, even within his own company.\n\n\"I would like to have his slump,\" Elliott said. \"You don't forget how to drive. You don't change your driving habits. The guy is still one of, if not the greatest driver to ever come through NASCAR. I would probably say the best ever without question.\n\n\"I can assure you if the man has a car that is capable to run well and to run inside the top five and lead laps and dominate races, he is probably going to be doing that.\"\n\nJohnson wondered if attention to his losing streak is because he's a victim of his own success. He has 83 career Cup victories and his seven titles tie him with Richard Petty and the late Dale Earnhardt. His streak of five consecutive championships has never been done before in NASCAR.\n\n\"I think people often take for granted how competitive pro sports are and how competitive this garage area is,\" Johnson said. \"Although we've been able to do some pretty amazing things that have never been done before, I think it's unfair to believe that it can last forever. What we did to win five in a row was pretty darn special.\n\n\"I do hold myself to a very high level of expectation ... (but) there are some unfair expectations put on people and on teams and on individuals, and I think people often forget how difficult it is to compete at a pro level.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://racing.ap.org/\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Financial secrets: Here's why couples fight over money",
                "body": "According to a study by a United Nations initiative called the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the U.S. has now dropped in the world happiness ranking. It now holds the 18th spot. Buzz60\n\nCouples are not always honest with each other when it comes to money. In fact, when you look at the secrets people keep from their partners, ones related to finances are near the top of the list, according to a new survey from CreditLoan.com\n\nWhile \"Things done in a past relationship\" tops the list for women (23.9%) and men (24.3%) it was followed for both genders by \"Wasteful or unaffordable purchases\" at 22.1% for women and 16.5% for men. When you add in other financial indiscretions partners in a couple keep from each other including \"Debt\" and \"Bank accounts\" over 40% of both men and women have money secrets they keep from their partners.\n\n\"It's important to note that for some, this grand fudging of numbers doesn't necessarily stop with an overpriced scarf or shiny new Xbox console,\" wrote CreditLoan founder Daniel Wesley in the report. \"Undisclosed debts are often shrouded in fear or shame, but coming clean about poor credit scores, squirreled-away inheritances, and even gambling or shopping addictions can be an opportunity to improve communication.\"\n\nIf you're going to get married, or even plan a long-term relationship, it's important to come clean about your finances. That means confessing the embarrassing, disclosing debt, and generally putting your cards on the table. It's also a good idea to go over your financial goals and make sure that they are in line.\n\nPeople often have very different ideas when it comes to wasteful spending, according to the CreditLoan report. For example, men are much more likely to waste over $500 on a collectible or hobby item, according to their partners, while women are guilty of spending about the same on wasteful home decor, according to their significant other.\n\nNo matter which way you slice it, men and women spend and save differently. \"What looks like an essential purchase to one person could be a complete waste of money in someone else's eyes,\" wrote Wesley.\n\nThat's why couples need to not only talk about money but set a budget. This should include some money for each partner for discretionary spending as well as an agreement about what dollar amount triggers having to check with the other person. It's also important to discuss what each partner considers essential and to address any concerns either member of the couple has.\n\nThis is not a one-off discussion. it's something that needs to be revisited regularly as your financial situation changes. For example, to a young couple just getting started financially, a modest lunch out may be an indulgence where an older, better-off couple may not even consider a pricey steak dinner as requiring partner consent.\n\nMore:Learn this trick and you'll spend less\n\nMore:Women are more than twice as likely as men to struggle with student debt\n\nMore:Financial fail: 20% of working Americans aren't saving at all\n\nKeeping financial secrets can ruin a relationship. If you have secret accounts or debts your partner does not know about, any honesty in other financial areas or budgeting plans won't matter.\n\n\"Arguments about money is by far the top predictor of divorce,\" Sonya Britt, a researcher at the University of Kansas said in the K-State News. \"It's not children, sex, in-laws or anything else. It's money -- for both men and women.\"\n\nThe reason for that is at least in part because really any two people don't see money in the same way. Your essential purchase may seem frivolous to your significant other and the only way to stop that from becoming an issue is to talk early and often.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

In technical terms, her cause of death was \"mixed substance toxicity.\"\n\nOther evidence of neglect was visible. Starliper's body had \"discoloration\" around the mouth, both eyes and cheeks, police said in court documents. Initial interviews with Higgins and Bennett failed to reveal the cause of these marks, police said.\n\nInterviews with family, friends and neighbors revealed an outline of abuse and neglect on Starliper for at least six months, police said. Friends and family described seeing \"mysterious\" bruises and large marks on Starliper. Police also found evidence that Higgins and Bennett had communicated about physically abusing the girl and another child, according to court documents.\n\nMore: California couple faces new child abuse charges in torture case\n\nMore: She overdosed, so they packed her in ice. 'Your friends almost killed you'\n\nMore: Daughter who injected father with heroin guilty of manslaughter\n\nAsked at a press conference Thursday how the girl got the drugs in her system, a state police spokesperson would not say. What time Starliper is believed to have died was also not revealed.\n\nMethampthetamine, often known as just \"meth,\" is a stimulant drug that usually comes in the form of white powder, according to drugabuse.gov. It can be used by injecting it, smoking it or snorting it.\n\nThe same website states that bupronephrine is a medication used to treat opioid addiction, and is the main component of the prescription drugs Subutex, to which Bennett was prescribed, and Suboxone, which Higgins had a prescription for.\n\nHiggins told state police where she and Bennett kept the drugs in their home. She kept her meth in a bag on the top shelf of a closet, where the kids could not get it, and kept her Suboxone locked in a safe, according to court documents. She said Bennett kept his Subutex on the stand next to the bed. Bennett later told police he kept his meth on him, and he would use it as he could. Police also found three pipes with burnt residue during a search of the home, and concluded they belonged to Bennett.\n\nHiggins said she and Bennett had injected meth on Jan. 4 and Jan. 5, court documents state.\n\nThey allegedly bought the meth they used on both days from Rodney Mower, 43, of Fayetteville, Pa.\n\nWhen police caught up with him for an interview, Mower admitted to coming to the pair's apartment and giving meth to them, court documents state. He also described how the couple did the drug.\n\nHiggins and Bennett used their bedroom to prepare and inject the meth, court documents state. Mower told police they would place a \"baby gate\" across the door to keep Starliper and another child out of the room. But the children stayed close and could have watched, as they would hang on the gate just a few feet away as their mother and Bennett did the meth, police said.\n\nMower is also charged in the case, with death by drug delivery. Police determined he had been at the apartment at about 5 p.m. Jan. 5 and that he was the only one the pair had bought drugs from that day.\n\n\"It was a known fact that as soon as Higgins and Bennett had meth, they used it,\" police wrote in court documents.\n\nPolice also determined that no one other than Higgins, Bennett and Mower came to or left them home over the time period of Starliper's death.\n\nThree days after finding Starliper dead, Higgins had a \"mental breakdown,\" police said. She went to her mother's house and admitted that she and Bennett had been using meth. Higgins handed over a bag with several needles and a spoon with white residue.\n\nMore: Feds work with drugmakers to boost research into non-opioid painkillers, treatments\n\nMore: Congress prepares to take on opioid crisis amid evidence the epidemic is growing worse\n\nLater that month, on Jan. 25, Higgins cleaned out her vehicle at her mother's house and threw away a bag containing several needles with white residue, cotton, spoons with white residue and white powder, court documents state. The bag was given to state police.\n\nHiggins, Bennett and Mower each have a preliminary hearing scheduled for April 3. They have all been denied bail and are in Franklin County Jail.\n\nIn addition to third-degree murder, Higgins and Bennett are both charged with involuntary manslaughter, drug delivery resulting in death and two counts of child endangerment, all felonies, and one misdemeanor count of possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\nFranklin County District Attorney Matt Fogal commented on the incident, saying \"the death of this sweet, innocent little girl is the most heartbreaking example of the danger the overdose epidemic has brought to our community and region. We will avenge her, and will not rest or tire in working to prevent this from happening to others.\"",

                "body": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Yankees outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury will start the regular season on the disabled list because of an oblique injury that sidelined him three weeks.\n\nEllsbury, who resumed playing Thursday, will remain at the Yankees' spring training complex when the team leaves Florida on Sunday for its final spring training game Monday at Atlanta.\n\n\"Get him 40, 50 at-bats,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Saturday.\n\nThe Yankees open the regular season Thursday at Toronto.\n\nEllsbury is projected as a backup outfielder after losing the starting center field job to Aaron Hicks last season.\n\nEllsbury, 34, is guaranteed $21,142,857 in each of the next three seasons as part of a $153 million, seven-year contract that includes a $21 million team option for 2021 with a $5 million buyout.\n\nBrett Gardner is the starting left fielder, and Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge will rotate between right field and designated hitter. Stanton also could get time in left when Gardner is rested, especially against left-handed pitchers.\n\nEllsbury hit .264 with seven homers and 39 RBIs in 112 games last season. He was sidelined from May 24 until June 26 after sustaining a concussion against the outfield wall while making a spectacular catch to rob Kansas City's Alcides Escobar.\n\nAlso, third baseman Brandon Drury, hit on the left elbow by a pitch Friday, will take batting practice Sunday and has no doubts about being ready for opening day. X-rays on the elbow were negative.\n\n\"I was excited to get that news,\" Drury said. \"I couldn't squeeze my hand at the time, it was just numb. I've been hit there before, so I've had that feeling before. So, I had that hope it was going to be good. Anytime you can't squeeze your hand or have that feeling, it's not good but it's better now.\"\n\nDrury plans to start wearing an elbow guard.\n\nNotes: LHP Jordan Montgomery, who will start the home opener April 2 against Tampa Bay, will make his final spring training outing Tuesday in a minor league game. ... The Yankees optioned RHP Domingo German to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. German and RHP Luis Cessa will be starters in the minors. ... Cashman said RHP Jonathan Holder made the team as the 13th pitcher. ...

(AP) -- St. Louis closer Luke Gregerson will begin the season on the disabled list with a hamstring strain, manager Mike Matheny said on Saturday.\n\nGregerson injured the hamstring during conditioning drills. He hasn't pitched in a Grapefruit League game since Tuesday, when he struck out two in an inning. There is no announced timetable for his return.\n\nThe Cardinals signed Gregerson during the offseason to be their closer. He saved 31 games for Houston in 2015 and 15 more the following season.\n\nEarlier this spring, Gregerson missed time because of oblique tightness. Matheny said he didn't believe the two issues were related.\n\nWithout Gregerson, Matheny intends to select his closer on a game-by-game basis based on matchups. Righties Dominic Leone and Bud Norris, along with lefty Tyler Lyons, figure to be in the mix.\n\nMORE MLB:\n\nIchiro can't get rid of David Phelps\n\nMets send Wheeler to minors\n\nCorrea is superstar, national hero\n\nBest shots from spring training Fullscreen March 23: Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner, center, is looked over by manager Bruce Bochy, right, and a trainer after getting hit by a comebacker.

I was even frozen in the front. I am really happy I made it to the finish line.\"\n\nValverde's Movistar teammate, Nairo Quintana, stayed third overall, 26 seconds behind.\n\nSunday's seventh stage is a 155-kilometer (96-mile) ride in Barcelona.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Clemson's NCAA run carries burden of higher expectations",
                "body": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Clemson exceeded all expectations with its run to the Sweet 16. The Tigers won't have the luxury of surprise next year.\n\nClemson was voted 13th in the 15-team Atlantic Coast Conference last October with many wondering if this would be the last of coach Brad Brownell. He was entering his eighth season running the team, with just one NCAA appearance -- in 2011.\n\nInstead, the Tigers rolled to a 25-10 record, including a startling 31-point victory over Southeastern Conference champion Auburn in the round of 32. The run for fifth-seeded Clemson ended Friday night with an 80-76 loss to top-seeded Kansas in the Midwest Regional.\n\n\"It's just been an unbelievable pleasure to coach these guys,\" Brownell said after the defeat. \"They've been tremendous all season.\"\n\nClemson tied a team record for season wins and won 11 ACC games in a season for the first time. The Tigers won't fly under the radar next year. The bulk of this year's group is back -- leading scorer Marquise Reed, point guard Shelton Mitchell and forward Elijah Thomas, all double-digit scorers.\n\nClemson will say goodbye to two seniors in shooter Gabe DeVoe and forward Donte Grantham, whose leadership Brownell often credited for holding the Tigers together when things got rough.\n\nGrantham was averaging 14 points a game when he tore knee ligaments late in a win over Notre Dame in January and missed the last 16 games. But Grantham, his knee in a brace, was on the bench each game, urging his teammates.\n\nDeVoe, who entered Clemson four seasons ago with a high-school reputation as a big-time scorer, finally lived up to that his senior year. He closed his career with 31 points against the Jayhawks, the most points for a Clemson player in an NCAA game.\n\nAlso gone is one-year Michigan grad transfer Mark Donnal, who provided critical depth on a tem lacking height.\n\nNext year, Reed and Mitchell should give the Tigers one of the ACC's strongest, most experienced backcourts.\n\nReed, a Robert Morris transfer, looked comfortable in his second season with the Tigers and became the team's go-to player. Mitchell, who transferred from Vanderbilt, also looked very much at home. He was Clemson's leader at the foul line, often thwarting comebacks with his 85 percent shooting.\n\nThomas, the 6-foot-9 Texas A&M transfer, still has problems with early fouls and being assertive under the basket. Still, he posted nine of his 11 career double-doubles this season and will look to take another step forward this fall.\n\nThe most promising breakout player next season might be 6-7 Aamir Simms, who averaged 15 minutes this season and has combined the power to slash to the basket with good instincts and touch on his shot.\n\nClemson was in the running for No. 2 national recruit Zion Williamson, a likely one-and-done forward picked Duke. The Tigers are expected to add a notable recruit in 6-11 Trey Jamison of Hoover, Alabama.\n\nAnd there will be no doubt about Brownell. He and athletic director Dan Radakovich will work out an extension past his current deal that runs through 2021. Radakovich wants Brownell back and the 49-year-old coach wants to return.\n\nBrownell was told last year that progress had to be made, especially with Clemson's recent, $63.5 million renovation of Littlejohn Coliseum that debuted before the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"I knew I needed to win this year,\" Brownell said. \"That's OK. This is high-level basketball.\"\n\nA level the Tigers reached this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "DES MOINES -- Kevin Sharp, the father in the Creston, Iowa, family that was found dead in a Mexico condominium where they were staying while on vacation, was known as \"The Sharpshooter\" on the stock car racing scene.\n\nSharp competed in events at Adams County Speedway in Corning, Iowa. Cliff Baldwin, who has been with the racetrack for 30 years, has known Kevin and the Sharps his entire life. They shared a passion for University of Iowa and Kansas City Chiefs football.\n\n\"He was a great personal friend,\" Baldwin told the Des Moines Register on Friday. \"It's hard to talk about. The more I think about him and the family, the harder it is.\n\n\"Creston is close-knit like all small towns in Iowa. He's a big part of that community there.\"\n\nBob Harris has been the public-address announcer at Adams County Speedway for the last 17 years. He called \"The Sharpshooter\" -- or \"Double Duece,\" as he chuckled -- a \"guy who gave back.\"\n\n\"Not only to the community, but to his family and the sport he loved,\" Harris said.\n\nBaldwin called his longtime pal and racing comrade \"a great competitor\" who was well-liked by his peers.\n\n\"He raced in our stock car class, and that class is highly competitive,\" Baldwin said. \"Twelve to 15 guys could win any given night. It's fun to watch those guys.\"\n\nLast September, at the Northland Oil Stock Car championship at Adams County Speedway, the Creston News Advertiser reported that Sharp earned his second win of the 2017 season.\n\n\"Sharp dominated the feature to collect the $500 payday while the rest of the field put on an exciting battle,\" the newspaper said.\n\nSharp's eight career wins ranks 22nd all-time in Adams County Speedway's stock car division, Harris said, and he was track titlist in 2015.\n\nThe Sharps celebrated victories and defeats the same, Harris said: \"A cold beverage waiting for ya at the end of the night.\"\n\n\"He was truly a champion on both sides of the fence at the speedway,\" he added, holding back tears. \"Whenever we needed an interview or a promotional deal, he was always right there to promote the sport.\n\n\"We could always count on Kevin Sharp.\"\n\nSharp's cars always had a theme. His No. 2 emulated professional driver Brad Keselowski, and he marketed his car to things that were important to him, like breast cancer awareness and Hawkeye football.\n\nSharp also volunteered on the speedway's board for many years, Harris said, before stepping down recently to spend more time with his family.\n\n\"He was a true family man,\" Harris said.\n\nThe racetrack originally hoped to start the 2018 season next Saturday, \"but it's going to be hard now,\" Baldwin said.\n\n\"It's going to be a heavy heart all season.\"\n\nSharp, 41, his wife, Amy Marie Sharp, 38, and their kids, Sterling Wayne Sharp, 12, and Adrianna Marie Sharp, 7, were found dead this week in a Mexico condominium, according to Creston police.\n\nAutopsies are being performed in Mexico, and results are pending, according to police.\n\nAt 12:02 a.m. Friday, the Sharps' family members went to Creston police to report their relatives missing.\n\nOne relative, Ashli Peterson, posted on her Facebook page late Thursday that the Sharps left the United States for Tulum, Mexico, on March 15. They were supposed to return from their trip on Wednesday from Cancun, Mexico, and arrive in St. Louis, where the family would travel to Danville, Illinois, for a college basketball game Thursday.\n\nThe family filed a missing persons report through the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, Peterson wrote. Additionally, they pinged cellphones that showed the Sharps were still in Mexico \"with no movement on their phones,\" she wrote.\n\nNovedades Quintana Roo, a Cancun-based news outlet, reported that employees had entered the room after noticing an odor. Inside, they found the bodies of the Sharp family.\n\nTheir stay at the hotel was scheduled from March 14 to March 21, according to the news outlet.",

While a disastrous short program at the Olympics kept Chen from medaling, the 18-year-old skater won the short program in Italy, giving him an advantage that he fully leveraged.\n\nAstonishingly, Chen was the only skater in the last group not to fall, with the chaotic programs by his rivals reflecting a long skating season which started back in September, and the pressure of turning around quickly for a major international championship.\n\nTeammate Vincent Zhou fell three times in the final skate, tumbling to 14th place after a strong short program had put him within striking distance of the podium.

                "title": "Investing advice: Maligned stock pickers catch up to index funds in 2017. Can it last?",
                "body": "NEW YORK -- Last year was a terrific one for nearly every stock investor as markets kept soaring higher. It was even better for one group that's among the most maligned on Wall Street.\n\nMutual fund managers who pick stocks have fallen out of favor after years of underperforming funds that passively track a benchmark, such as the S&P 500 index. Investors showed their displeasure by yanking hundreds of billions of dollars from actively managed funds.\n\nLast year, the stock pickers turned things around. Forty-three percent of U.S. stock fund managers beat their average index-fund peer in 2017, according to Morningstar, compared with a dismal 26% success rate the year before. While the market's gains were strong and steady, stocks moved less like a herd, creating the opportunity for higher rewards for managers able to pick the right stocks.\n\nMore: You can earn 155 times more interest just by using a different kind of savings account\n\nThis year, volatility has returned to the markets, including the first drop of 10% for the S&P 500 in roughly two years. As stocks sold off in February, most active managers delivered a steadying hand to their investors, with milder losses than index funds, by avoiding some of the hardest-hit areas. That fits with history: Actively-managed funds have tended to hold up better than index funds during down markets, which can be particularly valuable if it prevents investors from selling stocks at the bottom.\n\nStill, the long-term data show that most active managers aren't able to match the returns of index funds, which have the big advantage of charging lower fees. In the end, experts say, the clearest lesson from the data may be that finding a fund with low expenses should be the first task for investors. After that, consider whether you want an index fund or a manager who's trying to beat the market.\n\nThe calm ride higher for stocks was shattered in February when worries about higher inflation sent the S&P 500 to a loss of 10% in just nine days. Through the tumult, nearly 60% of all actively managed U.S. stock funds offered better returns than index funds, according to Morningstar.\n\nActive managers say they do better in these kinds of markets because they're not forced to buy whichever stocks are in the index at whatever proportions the index says -- no matter how overvalued or unattractive analysts say they have become. That means they can avoid some of the worst areas of the market during downturns.\n\nDuring last decade's housing bubble, for example, financial stocks accounted for a fifth of S&P 500 index funds, more than any other sector. Those stocks were crushed by the financial crisis, and Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and other hallowed Wall Street names collapsed or were sold at fire-sale prices. The aftermath of the financial crisis was the last time the majority of actively managed U.S. stock funds was able to beat index funds over a three-year period, according to Morningstar.\n\nNot only that, managers say they're benefiting in particular now because stocks are moving to their own rhythms more often, rather than climbing and falling all together.\n\n\"It's nice to see some volatility and the opportunity for individual stock selection,\" said Lamar Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co. \"When one of our stocks works, which is happening as of late, it makes a big difference, and investors are actually rewarding them instead of moving the entire market instead.\"\n\nThe biggest stock investment in his Villere Balanced and Villere Equity funds, for example, is Axon Enterprise, the maker of Taser stun guns. It's up 46 percent in 2018, versus less than 2 percent for the S&P 500, as of Wednesday's close. \"We've been having a lot of fun,\" Villere said.\n\nOver the long term, up markets tend to last longer than down markets. Plus, the stock-picking managers who manage to beat the market in one downturn don't always do so in the next one, according to Morningstar. That's part of the reason why the majority of actively managed funds have failed to keep up with index funds over the long term.\n\nOver the last 20 years, a span that includes not only the Great Recession but also the collapse of the dot-com bubble, only 13% of managers in the largest category of mutual funds have beaten index funds.\n\nIn some areas of the market, active managers do have had a better track record.\n\nOver the last decade, 44% of all intermediate-term bond funds have beaten their average index-fund peer. Narrow the field down to the funds with the lowest expenses, and the success rate jumps to 64%. In recent years, the majority of emerging-market stock fund managers have also been beating index-fund peers.\n\nRegardless, the best way for investors to improve their odds of success is to focus on the funds with the lowest expenses, said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. Funds that charge high expenses have to perform that much better than low-fee funds in order to deliver similar returns.\n\n\"If there's one clear signal that comes through, it's that probably the only reliable way to boost your odds of picking a winner in a crop of active managers is to narrow your search to those who are charging the lowest fees in a given category,\" Johnson said.",

                "title": "Ex-NFL lineman Evan Mathis selling prized Mickey Mantle card",
                "body": "After retiring from the NFL a little more than a year ago, Evan Mathis decided to move closer to where he grew up in Alabama.\n\nAnd to get the kind of house he and his wife wanted, Mathis needed to free up some money. And that meant the avid sports card collector would have to part with his prized possession: a 1952 Mickey Mantle baseball card.\n\n\"Just that image of the young Mickey Mantle, over the years it's been a centerpiece of the hobby,\" Mathis told The Associated Press by phone. \"I guess it's kind of like the Mona Lisa of the sports card world.\"\n\nIssued as part of its first set of baseball cards by Topps, the Mantle card is the marquee piece of a card-only spring collection by Heritage Auctions. It is one of six versions of the card to have been rated a Mint 9 by PSA, one of the leading sports memorabilia authenticators, with three others having earned a Mint 10 rating.\n\nThe card has been estimated by Heritage to be valued at $3.5 million. For comparison, the highest price paid for a card at auction was $3.12 million two years ago for a 1909 Honus Wagner card.\n\n\"It's what I consider the new face of card collecting,\" said Chris Ivy, Heritage's director of sports auctions. \"For decades it's been the (Wagner card). For post-war (World War II) cards and the baby-boomer generation and beyond, it really does come down to this '52 Topps rookie Mickey Mantle card, which has kind of moved from just sports collecting to more of Americana.\"\n\nIvy attributes the high value of the card Mathis is selling due to its centering, strong corners and print quality -- a rare combination, considering \"quality control wasn't the top issue\" for Topps in the 1950s.\n\n\"The fact that this one came out of the factory in strong condition, survived for many decades in that same condition, didn't get put in spokes or thrown away by mom is pretty miraculous,\" Ivy added.\n\nBidding for items in the collection, which also includes cards from the 19th century, ends April 20.\n\nMathis was a third-round pick by Carolina in the 2005 NFL draft. He retired in January 2017 after 12 seasons as an offensive guard with the Panthers, Miami, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Denver and Arizona. He was on the Broncos team that won Super Bowl 50.\n\nHe got into card collecting as a kid growing up a fan of Bo Jackson in Birmingham, Alabama, in the late 1980s. Jackson, who had attended high school in nearby McCalla before starring in football and baseball at Auburn, was a two-sport professional for the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders and baseball's Kansas City Royals. Mathis, about 6 years old then, started going to the store to buy packs of cards to get as many of Jackson as he could.\n\nBy his recollection, Mathis got away from the hobby around the time he was in middle school before picking it up again years later when his own NFL career was progressing and he could afford some of the cards he couldn't earlier. He was drawn to the 1952 Mantle card and bought several versions of the card inferior to the one he currently owns, and his best was a Mint 8 until about two years ago. That's when a collector friend sent him a photo of his Mint 9 to show it off, and Mathis knew he had to have it.\n\nMathis said he traded the \"vast majority\" of his collection and agreed to a payment plan for rest of the value to get the card. Now, he's moving with his wife, Katelynn, and their two daughters from Arizona to Tennessee to be close to family, and needed to free up some money.\n\n\"I don't think I'll have any regrets because I'll have a nice house to show for it instead of the card,\" he said.\n\nLooking to expand the pool of potential buyers, Mathis is willing to accept cryptocurrency such as bitcoin as payment.\n\n\"A lot of new money was created in crypto,\" Mathis said. \"There's a lot of people that might have some newfound riches that they might want to diversify with, and I just kind of wanted to spread the target market out a little bit and give those guys a chance to jump in.\"\n\nWhile Mathis is selling the card he owns now, he hasn't given up on the thought of acquiring one of the Mint 10 versions one day.\n\n\"It's not within my grasp at the moment,\" he said. \"It's something to work for.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Vin Cherwoo at www.twitter.com/VinCherwooAP\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "Ankle injuries threatened to derail Steph Curry's career early on, but he recovered to become one of the league's leading superstars and a two-time MVP.\n\nAfter playing only 26 games during the 2011-12 season, Curry has made at least 78 starts in each of his last five seasons. When he's been healthy this year, Curry has been as sensational as ever - but his 2017-18 campaign has been defined by a scary string of injuries that could potentially end the Warriors' run to a fourth consecutive NBA Finals.\n\nEarly in a game against the Sixers, Curry tried to run around a Ben Simmons screen but collided with Simmons' knee. He scored 22 points in a victory, but missed the Warriors' next game with a thigh contusion.\n\nCurry jammed his hand while going for a steal in a game against the Pelicans. After that game, he suffered from serious swelling.\n\nVia clutchpoints:\n\n\"It just blew up overnight,\" Curry said of the swelling in his finger, noting it's gone down a bit, but it's still painful. \"Hopefully by tomorrow the swelling will be gone and I'll be able to deal with the pain and just play.\"\n\nCurry missed one game, but returned and played with a wrap on his finger.\n\nAP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu\n\nCurry turned his ankle badly with just over a minute to play in New Orleans, suffering a sprain that ruled him out for the next 11 games.\n\nCurry returned to lead the Warriors to a five-game winning streak and averaged 35.2 points per game in that span, but he slipped during a shootaround and suffered another sprain to his right ankle. Curry missed the Warriors' next two games.\n\nVia the Mercury News:\n\n\"'I was just doing my normal shooting routine, and just stepped on the floor and twisted my ankle,' Curry said.\"\n\nDuring a game against the Hawks, Curry left the ground to contest a shot near the rim and landed on the foot of teammate Zaza Pachulia. Curry remained in the game for a while and was effective, but left in the second half.\n\nSix days later, Curry rolled his right ankle minutes into a game against San Antonio after his layup was blocked. The Warriors initially planned to bring Curry along on their next road trip, but changed plans and had him rest at home, instead. He missed a total of six games, and the Warriors went 2-4 over that stretch.\n\nCurry scored 29 points in 25 minutes in his first game back, but he left the game hobbling in the third quarter after teammate JaVale McGee landed on his leg. Curry will undergo an MRI to assess the severity of the sprain, but he could be out for the rest of the regular season.\n\nMORE:\n\nBracket Madness: Vote for the best Marvel Cinematic Universe character in the Elite 8\n\nWendy's released a surprisingly solid rap mixtape and ravaged McDonald's\n\nTwitter roasts Duke for slapping floor while running zone defense\n\nESPN's Zach Lowe says Kevin Love gives the Cavs an 'unstoppable' lineup",

                "title": "Carlos Correa thrives as Astros superstar, Puerto Rican national hero",
                "body": "CLOSE\n\nSportsPulse: The Houston Astros looked primed to repeat as World Series champs. Recent history suggests otherwise. USA TODAY Sports\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - In explaining his decision to skip the Houston Astros' trip to the White House nearly two weeks ago, All-Star shortstop Carlos Correa emphasized he was not making a political statement.\n\nIt was a statement nonetheless.\n\nCorrea opted to spend the day sending supplies to his native Puerto Rico, which continues to struggle in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria six months after the powerful storm tore through the island from east to west.\n\nIn carefully chosen words, Correa later thanked Donald Trump for all the help the federal government supplied to Houston, which was also devastated in September by Hurricane Harvey, and \"some of the help that he's provided to Puerto Rico.''\n\nConsidering the Trump administration response to the disaster in Puerto Rico, and his comments about its residents, were widely criticized both in the island and mainland, Correa struck a delicate balance. He was appreciative while still highlighting that his home country of 3.3 million American citizens continues to endure a humanitarian crisis and needs further aid.\n\nOZUNA: Meet the Cardinals' new franchise player\n\nICHIRO: Mariner can't get rid of David Phelps\n\nMaintaining such an equilibrium required rare skills for a 23-year-old, one tugged by the needs at home but also mindful of his national profile as an spokesman for brands like Adidas.\n\nAnd yet, Correa has increasingly displayed them in embracing his responsibilities as one of Puerto Rico's most prominent figures. Correa, Francisco Lindor and Javier Baez have emerged as the leaders of a young wave of Puerto Rican standouts, all three bilingual and articulate.\n\nAs the only one to combine a World Series title with All-Star status, Correa has the highest profile. Asked how tough a call it was to stay in Florida or join his teammates in Washington, Correa said:\n\n\"It was a difficult decision because it's an invitation to the White House to meet the president of the United States. As I've said before, it's an honor to be invited to such a historic place. But I also had my people in Puerto Rico who are in need and suffering and dying because they don't have food on the table, so I decided to go that way.''\n\nCorrea said he learned several lessons from the venerable Carlos Beltran, who retired after earning his first championship ring with the Astros last fall, about representing their homeland in a dignified manner. It might be no coincidence that Beltran also chose to pass on the White House visit after earlier expressing his disappointment with the federal relief efforts.\n\nBut as a player with MVP potential and most of his career ahead of him, Correa will have to set his own path. He makes his living representing a city in a conservative state and was aware there would be some backlash for declining the trip to the White House.\n\n\"I knew the Trump supporters would be all over me, but once I provided my explanation for not going and they realized it wasn't political, I felt they would understand,'' said Correa, adding the social media feedback he got was mostly positive. \"When it's not about politics but about human lives dying and being in need, people understand.''\n\nHis teammates certainly did. Correa addressed them when they returned from Washington and explained his rationale.\n\nPitcher Dallas Keuchel, who wishes those celebratory visits had not become so politicized, said Correa didn't have to do that.\n\n\"It was an off-day and nobody had to go,'' Keuchel said. \"I commend him for keeping his home country on his mind and helping them out. Whether you went or not didn't really matter. He could have been sleeping in for all I know. That doesn't bother me one bit.''\n\nCorrea and Beltran, who donated $1 million, were among numerous Puerto Rican players who launched campaigns to aid their countrymen after Maria, which left them disconnected from their relatives for several days just as the Astros were heading to the playoffs.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, an eight-time All-Star and the island's most decorated player in the wake of Beltran's retirement, helped raise funds and personally delivered provisions around the northern town where he grew up.\n\nCorrea focused his efforts in his southern hometown of Santa Isabel and its surroundings, where he has a team of 30 volunteers reaching out to communities that still lack bare necessities. He said sometimes he receives videos of thankful beneficiaries in tears, which he finds deeply touching.\n\nThe instinct to help those in need is almost ingrained in Puerto Rican players, who grow up hearing about Roberto Clemente's generous spirit. The Hall of Fame outfielder died in a plane crash on New Year's Eve 1972 while taking supplies to earthquake-ravaged Nicaragua.\n\nStill, manager A.J. Hinch said he has been impressed to see such a young player take on that role.\n\n\"One of the things we've known more and more about Carlos as he's gotten more exposure is how philanthropic he is and how much he cares about kids, how much he cares about his community back in Puerto Rico,'' Hinch said. \"The way he gives his time, the way he gives his money, the way he brings attention to all the topics that are important to him, it's a rare breed.''\n\nAnd Hinch expresses no concern over those endeavors taking away from Correa's baseball duties.\n\nLast season he was on an MVP pace, with a .320 batting average, 20 homers and 67 RBI through July 17, when he sustained a thumb injury that sidelined him for a month and a half. Correa still finished tied for second on the team in home runs (24) and third in RBI (84).\n\nIn the postseason, while still getting frequent reports of the hardships his friends and relatives were experiencing back home, he batted .288 and homered five times - including twice in the World Series - as the Astros claimed the first championship in their 55-year history.\n\nTopping off the greatest night of his life, after the Game 7 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, Correa proposed to his girlfriend, Daniella Rodriguez, in front of a national TV audience. She broke down in tears and said yes.\n\nIf anybody wondered about Correa's willingness to step onto a big stage, that should answer any questions.\n\n\"Carlos Correa is already a big Puerto Rican figure who everybody follows,'' said Molina, who's more the reticent type. \"He's got great potential and he has shown a lot, being a winner, the way he has played, the way he represents us. Right now, Carlitos, (Francisco) Lindor and Javy Baez project a great image for Puerto Rico. I'm really happy for each of them.''\n\nWorld Series champion Astros visit the White House Fullscreen President Donald Trump speaks at a ceremony honoring the World Series champion Houston Astros.

                "title": "C ya! Mets' David Wright is baseball's lone captain in 2018",
                "body": "MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Anthony Rizzo is a three-time All-Star and the 2017 winner of the Roberto Clemente Award, baseball's biggest honor for sportsmanship and community involvement. Jon Lester is a three-time World Series champion, and Jason Heyward organized the most important meeting in franchise history.\n\nPlenty of leaders with the Chicago Cubs. No captain.\n\nOne of the most revered titles in sports is hanging by a thread in baseball, which treats its history with hallowed tones in almost every case, but doesn't seem the slightest bit concerned about the absence of the iconic C on the front of its uniforms. New York Mets third baseman David Wright is the majors' only captain on the eve of the season, and it's unclear if he will ever play again.\n\n\"Leadership is a taken role and people want to follow you just based on how you are, how you treat them, how well you listen, how well you interact daily, how much you really are into them as opposed to yourself,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, \"and that becomes obvious. Leadership is taken, man. It's hard to just place that out there.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old Wright was named the fourth captain in Mets history in 2013, joining Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter and John Franco. He made the last of his seven NL All-Star teams that same year before he was hampered by a series of injuries. He hasn't appeared in a major league game since 2016.\n\nWright declared right away that he wouldn't wear the C on the front of his jersey, so that special touch has been missing from baseball for a couple years.\n\n\"I'm not sure if there's a benefit to having a title and I've never been one to like come in here and say you have to listen to me because I'm the captain,\" Wright said. \"I would hope that if I have something to say that somebody would listen to me because of, you know, because of what I've hopefully displayed in the clubhouse and be considered kind of a leader in here.\"\n\nBut Wright made no attempt to hide the significance of the title to him.\n\n\"I'll say it again, that to this day it's probably the biggest honor away from the field of my career,\" he said.\n\nA variety of factors have contributed to the decline of captains. Many of the captains across sports spend most of their careers with a single team, but that has become a rarity in baseball. There also are no real responsibilities for the title.\n\nHockey captains serve as the team's liaison to the officials. NFL captains participate in the pregame coin toss. NBA captains also have specific responsibilities, but baseball barely mentions the word in its rulebook.\n\n\"There's no, like, formal meeting,\" Washington ace Max Scherzer said. \"It's not like football where you go out there and shake the other team's hands and you need captains to go do that. Baseball doesn't have that. So maybe that's why you don't see it. There's no coin toss.\"\n\nBut the list of baseball captains still includes some of the biggest names in the history of the sport. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Thurman Munson and Derek Jeter are on the list of 11 Yankees captains. Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider with the Dodgers. Jimmie Foxx and Carl Yastrzemski for the Boston Red Sox. Willie Stargell, Barry Larkin and other Hall of Famers.\n\nJeter thought he did something wrong when then-Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called to make him captain in 2003.\n\n\"The boss, Mr. Steinbrenner usually only called if you were in trouble during the season,\" Jeter said. \"He called me, we were in Cincinnati, and said he wanted to name me the captain. It was a welcome phone call.\"\n\nThe list of baseball captains underscores not only the special players to hold the title, but also the unique situations that led to their leadership position.\n\nRizzo, Lester and Heyward, who got the Cubs together during a key moment in Game 7 of their World Series win in 2016, could each serve as captain. But identifying one leader in Chicago's clubhouse at the possible expense of its other respected veterans likely would hurt the team more than help it. There are similar situations in several other clubhouses across the sport.\n\n\"Having a team captain could conceivably in some ways change the relationship between the manager and the coaches and the rest of the team,\" Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said.\n\n\"So, again, it's all about the people. It's not that it's a good idea or a bad idea, it's all about the people. It's not just the guy you're considering for that position but also everybody around him, your own players, the manager, the coaching staff. You really have to think of it in those terms.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick and AP Sports Writer Steven Wine contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "6 tricks to kick credit card debt quicker",
                "body": "For Kumiko Ehrmantraut, paying off credit card debt was a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nIt took roughly two years to pay off the final $7,500 she owed in credit card debt, estimates Ehrmantraut, founder of The Budget Mom, a personal finance blog. But she was able to do it in part because she got serious about a certain pastime: running.\n\n\"I'm a long-distance runner, and running is free,\" she says. \"So instead of shopping on Saturdays -- which I would usually do, I'd go to the mall specifically looking for clothes -- I would go on a two-hour run.\" The money she saved by not shopping helped her pay off debt faster.\n\nFor folks paying off debt, Ehrmantraut's approach -- that is, replacing an expensive hobby with an inexpensive one -- is a brilliant psychological sleight of hand. It also highlights an important point: Paying off credit card debt is hard work, but it doesn't have to feel tedious. These tricks can help you tackle your debt with less effort.\n\nTo bring your balance down faster, initiate a balance transfer, in which you move your debt to a credit card with an introductory 0% APR period. This can help your debt disappear faster, even if you keep making the same payments each month, because you're not racking up interest during the promotional period.\n\nFor Ehrmantraut, of Spokane, Wash., moving her balances to cards with lower interest rates helped her get rid of her debt. You might be able to qualify for one of these offers if you have good credit.\n\nSaving money is easiest when you don't have to think about it, Ehrmantraut found. That's why she began automating it while paying off debt.\n\n\"Every paycheck, I'd have $50 automatically moved from my checking account to my savings account,\" Ehrmantraut says. \"And as soon as that account hit $300, I'd make a credit card payment.\" In addition to these extra payments, she also paid double the minimum payment every cycle.\n\nMore:People with massive student debt hope President Trump will let them declare bankruptcy\n\nMore:How Federal Reserve rate hike will affect mortgages, auto loans, credit cards\n\nYour debt payoff goals might be big and ambitious, but sometimes it pays to start small.\n\n\"Setting goals to pay off small accounts and celebrating those successes can help you go a long way in paying off your debt,\" says Jim Triggs, senior vice president of counseling at Money Management International. MMI is a nonprofit credit counseling agency that offers services for folks dealing with debt and other financial questions.\n\nThis strategy, dubbed the debt snowball method by personal finance guru Dave Ramsey, might not seem like the most mathematically sound approach. No matter their size, your highest-interest debts will likely be the costliest. But paying off debts from smallest to largest might give you the momentum you need to keep going.\n\nFor Carrie Smith Nicholson of Denver, a change in diet made it easier to save money and pay down debt. After going through a divorce, she paid down $14,000 in 14 months by working three jobs and aggressively cutting costs. Of all the changes she made, not buying red meat at the grocery store was a relatively painless one.\n\n\"It was a little bit challenging, but it wasn't too bad,\" Nicholson says, noting that red meat is typically more expensive than chicken, fish and vegetarian options. \"I'm automatically drawn to more of a chicken- and fish-based diet anyway.\"\n\nNicholson's experience with debt wasn't a one-and-done success story. Eventually, after quitting her full-time job to pursue self-employment, she racked up credit card debt again -- and paid it off, again. Establishing some sustainable money-saving habits have helped her stay out of debt.\n\nFor instance, Nicholson, now remarried, has begun making credit card payments more frequently. This helps her keep an eye on her expenses and avoid overspending.\n\n\"Instead of waiting once a month to pay that big bill, we found out it works better to pay it once a week,\" she says. While making these payments, Nicholson and her husband also take time to review their weekly spending and budget.\n\nExpecting a big tax refund, a cash gift for your birthday or a performance bonus at work? Try pretending that you're not.\n\n\"If your primary goal is to pay down debt, and you're getting a tax refund, ignore it as far as spending it on anything frivolous this year, and just apply it to your debt,\" says Triggs. Spending on credit card payments can feel painful, but diverting \"found\" money like tax refunds to your debt can lessen the sting and help you reach your goals faster.\n\nThis article was written by NerdWallet and was originally published by Forbes.\n\nMore From NerdWallet",

                "title": "Tyson chicken plant rejected in one town, welcomed in another",
                "body": "HUMBOLDT, Tenn. - Not every town wants a chicken plant.\n\nIn Tonganoxie, Kan., residents showed their distaste for a Tyson Foods chicken plant last year by posting \"No Tyson in Tongie\" signs in yards and mailing pictures of dead chickens to a county official. Among their concerns were water pollution, odor, infrastructure costs and animal cruelty.\n\nWhen local officials, in response, revoked hundreds of millions of dollars to support the Tyson project, Tyson advanced its plans for a $300 million plant in Humboldt, a West Tennessee town located in Gibson County.\n\nGibson County Economic Development Director Kingsley Brock said he and other local officials were aware of the Kansas pushback and vetted Arkansas-based Tyson accordingly. Once they decided to pursue the chicken plant and its 1,500 jobs, they assured the Tyson officials their community was unlikely to follow Tonganoxie's path.\n\n\"You are not going to get that same reaction in Humboldt,\" Brock said. \"We are going to want the jobs and need the jobs.\"\n\nHumboldt faces a different economic reality than Tonganoxie, where per capita income is 70% higher and the city's population has grown nearly 7% since 2010. In Humboldt, an 8,000-person community, the population is declining and just half of the working-age residents participate in the labor force.\n\nArea farmers welcome the chance to expand their crop base while residents emphasize the need for full-time job opportunities. Despite the opposition the company received in Kansas, Tennessee officials praise Tyson as the long-needed catalyst that could ignite the county's economy.\n\n\"It's tremendous,\" Brock said. \"It's going to trickle all over the place.\"\n\nBrock said developers are looking at creating apartments, new restaurants are expected, along with new retail, and there is potential for another hotel.\n\n\"You can't overstate what that is going to do for our local economy,\" Gibson County Mayor Tom Witherspoon said of Tyson. \"That helps everybody from car salesmen to cake bakers to shoe salesmen and everybody in between... That is going to be a tide that lifts all ships.\"\n\nDriving through Gibson County in a black pickup truck, Witherspoon points to the empty plants that dot the community he was raised in. There's the Kellwood Company that manufactured clothes, where his mother and father once worked,Emerson Motor, Brown Shoe, Plastech -- each employed hundreds of people before they shut down.\n\nIn 2011, the Goodyear Tire & Rubber plant where 1,900 people worked in nearby Obion County closed, a major blow for the region. The next year, American Ordnance moved operations away from the Milan Army Ammunition Plant, laying off 600 workers.\n\n\"It was just one piece of bad news after another, to the point where that's what you came to expect,\" Witherspoon said. \"As a community, we got used to the fact that somebody else was going to get the big project.\"\n\nFormer factory supervisors turned to any job they could find, hanging sheet rock or mowing yards, stitching together part-time work and forgoing benefits, Witherspoon said. The unemployment rate has narrowed since the Great Recession from more than 15% to 3.8%, but Witherspoon said that number masks the shift to underemployment that weighs on the community.\n\nGovernment officials tried to pitch companies on a 500-acre corn field, owned by Gibson County since 1998, but there was no access road to take them through the site. Power lines ran through the property, meaning immediate costs and a longer timeline for any company willing to move there.\n\n\"It is hard to take a Japanese businessman to a corn field and say, 'Can you imagine your plant being here?' It is a tough sell,\" Witherspoon said. \"We didn't have a way to really show the park the way it needed to be shown.\"\n\nWhen rural Tennessee counties were often overlooked for company relocations or expansions, state economic officials decided to try a new strategy: Make the site ready for development before it was chosen. That meant investing in water, sewer, fiber optics and more, depending on the site's needs, Brock said.\n\nTyson said it was drawn to the available workforce in Gibson County, proximity to grain and available infrastructure. Plant workers, with wages ranging from $13 to $20, plus benefits, will produce fresh tray pack chicken for retail customers. Many management and administrative jobs also will be offered.\n\nAs part of the deal, Tyson has been awarded $18 million in incentives through the state's FastTrack grants that will go towards additional infrastructure, and the county has offered a tax abatement deal estimated to total $16 million over the next 20 years.\n\nThe Tyson deal will boost both the manufacturing and agricultural sector, providing farmers with an additional income stream, both through chicken and grain demand, Witherspoon said. The company plans to contract with nearly 80 farmers.\n\n\"We have a lot of small and younger farmers,\" Witherspoon said. \"Being able to add or grow operations to their business models will allow them to stay on the farm full-time, instead of having to go to town for a job.\"\n\nTodd Littleton, a third-generation farmer in Gibson County and chairman of the Gibson Farm Bureau, is considering raising chickens for Tyson and would build two chicken houses on his farm to hold them. He grows corn, wheat and soybeans on 1,500 acres in Kenton, Tenn.\n\nIn Tonganoxie, a town of about 5,000 people, one of the biggest complaints about the Tyson project was the infrastructure that would be needed to accommodate both the plant and what was expected to be an influx of new residents taking jobs there. Roads would need upgrades to support the heavy trucks, the sewer system would need to be extended and schools could be overwhelmed, residents said. The county had planned to issue $500 million in industrial bond revenue to support the facility, along with $7 million for utilities and another $1 million for sewer lines.\n\nResidents also objected to perceived secrecy surrounding the project prior to the announcement and raised concerns about smells associated with chicken farms, possible exposure to ammonia and the potential for water pollution. The debate came to a head at a crowded town hall meeting in September, drawing about 2,000 people, according to media reports.\n\n\"The infrastructure of Tonganoxie would be changed forever from the small, quiet town it is,\" said Tonganoxie resident and freight conductor Brady Brown. He said he also took issue with Tyson's track record on water pollution.\n\nTyson, which produces beef, chicken and pork, released more than 20 million pounds of toxic chemicals into U.S. waterways in 2014, more than any other agricultural company, according to a 2016 report from Environment America Research & Policy Center.\n\nTyson spokesman Worth Sparkman disputed the report as inaccurate and misleading. Water from plants is returned to streams after it is treated by government-regulated systems and most farmers raising animals are required to follow nutrient management plans, he said.\n\nIn 2003, chicken manure contaminated drinking water sources in Tulsa, Okla., spurring a $7.5 million settlement from Tyson and other chicken companies. That same year, the company pleaded guilty to 20 felony violations of the Clean Water Act at a chicken plant in Missouri for illegally discharging untreated wastewater into a river tributary. The company paid $7.5 million in fines.\n\nTyson was among chicken companies sued in 2005 for polluting the Illinois River with chicken waste. In 2015, the company settled a case in Missouri for chemical releases that killed more than 100,000 fish in a Missouri creek.\n\nIn the three most recent years reported, Tyson exceeded wastewater permits 319 times and had 37 reportable chemical spills, according to Tyson's sustainability report.\n\n\"Water is a precious natural resource and we take the protection of that resource very seriously,\" Sparkman said. \"Unfortunately, in a company with 122,000 employees, accidents sometimes happen. When they do, we do everything within our power to make the situation right, which in some cases includes stream bank restoration projects and collaboration with regional conservation groups.\"\n\nTyson has also been sued for worker safety issues. In June 2017, two Tyson workers were injured by ammonia at a plant in Hutchinson, Kansas. In 2013, Tyson paid nearly $4 million related to eight anhydrous ammonia-related incidents in a five-year period, including a fatality, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nTyson has since launched a project in nine plants to improve workplace safety practices and in 2016, the company reduced its incident rate by nearly 20 percent, Sparkman said.\n\n\"Of course, our aspiration is for zero workplace injuries and we've taken strides in recent years to address key safety issues,\" Sparkman said.\n\nWitherspoon said local officials brought up these issues with Tyson leaders from the onset of discussions. With Obion County's Tyson plant just 45 miles away, Witherspoon said he reached out to the county mayor, who reassured him that Tyson was an ideal corporate citizen.\n\n\"They have been a blessing to Obion County and surrounding counties with their employment,\" Obion County Mayor Benny McGuire said. \"They are probably the most community-minded industry that you could have in your county.\"",

                "body": "The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, and many restaurant and retail workers continue to protest to more than double it to $15 per hour. However, if successful, they could hasten the end of their jobs as companies switch to automation to save money.\n\nIf employees used that energy to do a little bit of searching instead, they would find there are plenty of jobs that not only pay well above the minimum wage, but some even pay more than $15 per hour. Here are 20 retailers and restaurant chains that pay at least $10 per hour.\n\nALSO READ: 6 Big Minimum Wage Increases in 2018\n\nThe upscale fast-casual burger joint Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) has long been a proponent of paying its workers above the minimum wage. While it has come at a cost to profits for the restaurant and led it to raise prices on its hamburgers as a result, job data website Glassdoor says the average team member at Shake Shack makes $10.89 per hour, and in some locations like its New York City restaurants, the starting pay is $12.50 per hour, or $0.50 more than the city's mandated minimum wage.\n\nSome 90% of Costco (Nasdaq: COST) employees are hourly wage workers, but the big box warehouse retailer has always paid its employees well above the minimum wage. Currently, the average pay is $22.50 per hour, a dramatically higher level than most other employers. It's able to pay up because it caters to a more well-to-do clientele who has an average annual income of $85,000.\n\nOne of the benefits of President Trump's tax reform package is that many employers are passing the gains they're realizing from the law change onto their employees. Pharmacy chain CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) is one of those that said it will use some of that extra cash to raise the starting hourly pay of workers to $11 per hour, a 22% increase from the $9 per hour it currently pays. It also raised its paid parental leave policy to four weeks at 100% compensation for all new parents while promising not to increase health insurance premiums for its workers for the coming year.\n\nRetail king Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is another company that is using the tax reform law as a reason to raise the starting pay at its stores to $11 per hour, with an eye towards raising it to $15 by 2020. But that fails to recognize that although the retailer, which is often excoriated by unions for its worker pay, already pays its part-time employees $10.58 per hour on average while the average hourly pay for full-time workers is $13.38. While that may seem a lot less compared with Costco, the retail giant is orders of magnitude larger than its rival, and its customers skew towards the low- to middle-income level.\n\nALSO READ: With Another Wage Hike, Walmart Doubles Down on An Effective Strategy\n\nTarget (NYSE: TGT) also boosted its starting pay to $11 per hour, and like Walmart, says that it will be raising it to $15 per hour by the end of 2020. But unlike its retail rival and CVS, Target actually announced the move last September and applied it even to the seasonal workers it was hiring for the holiday shopping season. It recently announced it would be raising the starting pay to $12 this spring. Yet the retailer has always tried to pay more than the competition, and its average wage rate before the pay hike was $10.14 per hour.\n\nFour years ago Gap (NYSE: GPS) surprised the retail world by announcing it was raising the minimum hourly wage for all of its sales associates to $10. According to job listing site Indeed.com, the average hourly pay for employees of Gap starts at $11.01 per hour for a customer service representative, noting that 71% of the retailer's employees think they're fairly paid.\n\nIt was, of course, Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) that sent the retail world reeling as it made price and convenience synonymous with its experience. Despite it being an online platform, it's still run by people behind the scenes and the average hourly wage of one of its warehouse workers is $12.42 per hour, and it says it typically pays 30% more than traditional retail jobs, telling USA TODAY, \"We've offered competitive wages since our company was founded in 1995.\"\n\nPrior to its acquisition by Amazon, organic grocer Whole Foods Market reveled in its image as an exemplary workplace where no executive was allowed to earn more than 19 times the salary of the average worker's salary. That was about the ratio back in the 1950s according to Bloomberg News; today it's 300 times. However, Whole Foods employees remain very well paid, with wages ranging between $11.70 per hour and $17.91 per hour, and the average settling at $14.48, according to PayScale, an employee compensation website.\n\nALSO READ: The Only 7 States With at Least a $10-per-Hour Minimum Wage\n\nLike Shake Shack, another fast-casual hamburger restaurant that pays its employees well is In-n-Out, which USA TODAY pegs at $13 per hour. What's more remarkable is that employees can work their way up the job ladder and become store managers and earn $160,000 a year, all without a college degree. Indeed.com says hourly pay ranges from approximately $11.14 per hour for a server to $17.55 per hour for third key manager.\n\nAldi might be a deep discount supermarket chain, but as it aggressively spreads its footprint across the country, it is finding it advantageous to pay up for workers. Aldi employees start at $12.25 per hour, and have a chance to earn an additional $4.75 per hour when they're performing managerial duties. The supermarket chain is looking to invest $3.4 billion to expand its U.S. store base to 2,500 by 2022, which would make it the third-largest supermarket chain behind Walmart and Kroger.\n\nAldi's pay scale would help explain why Trader Joe's also pays its employees well. Likely unbeknownst to many, the supermarket chain is owned by the same company that owns Aldi. PayScale says hourly wage rates at Trader Joe's range from an average of $11.08 to $23.68 an hour, with Indeed.com putting the position of a simple pallet jack operator at $10.20 per hour. Like Aldi, it's able to pay these higher rates because it relies primarily on private label goods rather than brand names for many, if not most of the items it sells in its stores.\n\nMany people might look on McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) as a simple fast-food restaurant, serving billions of hamburgers every year, but not only has it raised the quality of the food it offers as well as caring about the animals that go into preparing a meal, but it is taking care of its employees too. The burger palace was one of the first fast-food chains to commit to raising hourly wages and announced back in 2015 it would be increasing starting pay to $10 per hour at its company-owned restaurants. Various job listing sites today, though, show average hourly rates below that threshold, and that's likely because most McDonald's employees work at one of its tens of thousands of franchised restaurants, which are not required to follow the lead of headquarters. Still Indeed.com shows the average crew member earning $9.47 per hour, which is closing in on that threshold.\n\nALSO READ: Will a $15 Federal Minimum Wage Really Help Low-Income Workers?\n\nFast-fashion leader H&M Hennes & Mauritz (Nasdaqoth: HNNMY) turned the apparel world around by popularizing low-cost clothes that were on-trend with designs taken from the runways and put onto store racks within a matter of weeks. While it hasn't blazed quite the same trail in employee wages, H&M has typically paid above the retail industry's averages, with full-time employees earning $12.03 per hour and part-time workers earning $10.29 per hour. Indeed.com says the average is about $11.28 per hour.\n\nHome improvement big box store Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) has said in the past that its pay rates for hourly employees are typically higher than the marketplace, which helps it avoid the wage pressures others might feel. According to PayScale, that rate is around $11.38 per hour for the typical sales associate. While the Trump tax reform plan didn't induce the DIY chain to raise wages, it did allow them to give employees a $1,000 bonus along with new benefits like parental leave.\n\nLike its rival, Home Depot (NYSE: HD)also didn't raise the hourly wage rate for employees after tax reform was signed into law, but did give them bonuses up to $1,000 based on length of service with the company. Glassdoor puts the average pay rate at Big Orange at a similar range as Lowe's, with cashiers earning around $10 per hour and sales associates earning $11 per hour.\n\nIf there's one thing upscale department store chain Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) is known for its customer service. It is the gold standard to which almost every other retailer strives to imitate. It also does well by its employees, paying them on average $14.96 per hour. Of course, the chain is struggling with sales like many in the industry, and the Nordstrom family is trying to take the chain private to deal with the issue out of the glare of the public spotlight, which, if ultimately successful, likely won't change how it deals with its employees or the public.\n\nALSO READ: 4 Things You Didn't Know About the Minimum Wage\n\nThere was a time when electronics superstore Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) was seen as the next casualty of Amazon.com, as people used Best Buy's stores to test out equipment before turning around and buying the items online. It introduced a risky strategy to match online pricing and managed to not only forestall bankruptcy, but to successfully rise in competitive standing. It's also become the third largest appliance retailer in the process, behind Lowe's and Home Depot, after leapfrogging over Sears Holdings. Yet for all its difficulties, it pays its employees well above the minimum wage, with the average rate being $11.38 per hour.\n\nJust because Big Lots (NYSE: BIG) deals with closeout items doesn't mean it pays discounted wages to its employees. It might not be at the high-end of the scale, but the retailer's $11.17 per hour rate makes it competitive with other retailers, and also puts it ahead of other deep-discount retailers like Dollar Tree and Dollar General, which pay somewhat less than $10 per hour, albeit still above the minimum wage threshold.\n\nYou're not just pouring a cup of coffee at Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX), you're creating a unique beverage with every order, and the leading coffeehouse is paying $10 an hour on average, according to Glassdoor, for the opportunity to get people going. With over 16,800 stores in the Americas, Starbucks has hundreds of thousands of employees, making them one of the most significant jobs providers in the country.\n\nApple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is the most valuable company, closing in on a trillion-dollar valuation, and has one of the most recognizable brands in the world. That sort of preeminent position almost necessitates that it pays its employees well, which it does. According to PayScale, customer service advisors earn $16.97 per hour, though a technical service specialist can see that rise to $17.90 per hour. An Apple Genius, however, can earn more than $20 per hour.\n\nALSO READ: What Living on an $11 Minimum Wage Looks Like\n\nThe fact remains many minimum wage jobs aren't worth paying $10 per hour, let alone the $15 many activists demand. The positions that garner the $7.25 rate are low-skill jobs that are meant for entry-level workers, not a means for sustaining a family. Minimum wage jobs were intended for workers just starting out and were designed to teach the skills necessary to climb the ladder to higher paying positions.\n\nMany retailers and restaurants are already operating at razor-thin profit margins and arbitrarily doubling the minimum wage will be devastating to them and their employees. And pay alone isn't the only thing workers look for in a job; benefits also rank highly. Fortunately for those willing to invest time in looking, there are plenty of companies that pay above the minimum wage, sometimes even well above it.",

                "body": "Columbia University professor Sharyn O'Halloran, an expert in political economy and international trade and finance, says the China tariffs announced by the Trump administration on Thursday may come at costly price for the U.S. (March 22) AP\n\nCasualties in a trade war fought with tariffs are not measured in lives, but rather the financial fallout that ensues when nations duke it out over economic matters.\n\nA trade war occurs when countries try to protect their own economies and domestic businesses by charging trading partners a tax, or tariff, on imported goods. The toll -- or fallout -- of such a fight is reflected in weaker economic numbers, such as slower GDP growth, fewer sales of airplanes, wine and other goods, and shrinking profits for companies.\n\nThe economic negatives of a trade fight often cause stock-price declines of innocent companies caught up in the spat, a market reaction that could put pressure on your 401(k) balance.\n\nSo with fears of a trade war on the rise after President Trump on Thursday proposed tariffs on about $60 billion of Chinese-made goods -- and Beijing responding with a threat to impose $3 billion worth of tariffs on U.S. fruit, wine and other goods -- here's a list of U.S.-based investments that are vulnerable and under pressure.\n\nWhen trade friction and tariffs are high, they make goods crossing borders more expensive, which crimps sales and curtails economic activity. And that's bad news for big U.S. companies that sell a lot of stuff to overseas buyers and get a sizable chunk of their revenues abroad.\n\n\"U.S. companies with high exports seem most exposed,\" Tobias Levkovich, Citi's chief U.S. equity strategist, noted in a published Q&A with the bank's clients. That list includes aircraft manufacturers, defense stocks and capital goods makers.\n\nBoeing (BA), for example, has been cited as the poster child for the type of stock that could be hard hit by a trade war. Not only did the plane maker get more than half of its sales last year from foreign markets, according to Morgan Stanley, it also gets about 11% of its annual revenues from China. Back in November it struck a deal to sell a state-run Chinese company 30 planes valued at $37 billion. Boeing's shares are down 10% since Trump first announced his 25% tariff on imported steel and 11.4% levy aluminum on Feb. 28.\n\nMore: Economic protectionism: Why a trade war could dent your 401(k) plan\n\nMore: In a trade war between U.S. and trading partners, small stocks may fare best\n\nMore: Dow tumbles more than 700 points as trade war fears intensify\n\nOther multinational companies at risk in a broader trade conflict are Caterpillar (CAT), which sells iconic yellow-colored earth moving machines and John Deere (DE), a farm equipment maker. Caterpillar is down nearly 7% in March, while Deere has declined 8%.\n\nThe more a company relies on China for profits, the more its stock is at risk. In the event that the \"protectionist push\" from the U.S. and other nations gains more momentum, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson recommends selling stocks with \"high revenue exposure to China.\"\n\nThe Wall Street firm created a list of U.S. companies that get 10% to 30% of their sales from China. Expeditors International, the transportation company that moves goods across the world via air or sea, for example, gets 30% of its revenue from China. Its shares have tumbled 6.3% since Trump first announced tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nSimilarly, shares of Apple, which gets more than 22% of its revenues from China and sells millions of iPhone to Chinese shoppers each quarter, have fallen more than 7%. Shares of luxury goods maker Tiffany, which Morgan Stanley says gets nearly 15% of its sales from China, are down 5%.\n\nAt the industry level, information technology companies had the highest overall foreign exposure at 56% last year, followed by materials (47%), which includes aluminum and chemical companies, and industrial companies (39%), such as aircraft makers and transportation companies.\n\nKeep alert for foreign nations slapping tariffs on well-known companies, as those stocks are likely to suffer from the stigma of being singled out and the likely hit to sales.\n\nA good example is Harley Davidson, the iconic maker of the motorcycles. After the U.S. announced tariffs on steel and aluminum, the European Union threatened to retaliate with tariffs of their own on Harley-Davidson and other All-American goods like bourbon and blue jeans. Since then, shares of the motorcycle maker have fallen more than 8%.\n\nSo what kinds of investments might hold up better if the protectionist trend continues?\n\nThose that rely less on making money outside the U.S., such as small-company stocks, says Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at investment firm FTSE Russell.\n\nInvestors should also consider so-called \"defensive\" stocks, or those whose fortunes are less tied to economic growth and which are more domestically focused, such as telecom, insurance and telecom companies, according to Citi research.",

                "body": "The number one thing people are doing with their tax refund. Elizabeth Keatinge has more. Buzz60\n\nWith the tax filing deadline rapidly approaching, a large chunk of Americans will no doubt spend the next few weeks crunching numbers and digging up documents in an effort to be on time. But unfortunately, a good 20% of workers are gearing up to make a potentially huge mistake: filing their tax returns on paper.\n\nThat's the latest from Twine & John Hancock, which also found that 53% of filers complete their returns without outside help. But while there's nothing wrong with tackling a tax return solo, filing on paper can be a recipe for disaster. Here's why.\n\nSometimes, even the simplest calculation can somehow get computed incorrectly in your head. If this happens to you, and you submit a return with a glaring error, the IRS might choose to either audit your return or reject it outright. That's why you're better off filing electronically. The error rate for paper returns is estimated at 21%, whereas it's less than 1% for returns filed electronically -- so if you want to lower your chances of messing up, stay away from paper.\n\nThe vast majority of tax filers wind up getting a refund each year. If you're one of them, then filing on paper could mean waiting even longer for that cash. The IRS typically issues refunds for electronically filed returns within three weeks of receipt, but with paper returns, that window expands to six to eight weeks. Now imagine you're staring at a credit card bill you can't pay off in the absence of your upcoming refund. Wouldn't you rather not accrue an extra three to five weeks' worth of interest charges?\n\nFurthermore, when you file electronically, you can check on your refund status within 24 hours. File on paper, and you'll wait weeks just to see when your refund will be issued.\n\nMore:Guess how many Americans expect to be audited this year\n\nMore:https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/budget-and-spending/2018/03/21/comparing-income-taxes-how-much-you-really-need-earn-take-home-100-000/443398002/\n\nThough using electronic software to file your taxes isn't the same thing as hiring a professional, these programs are designed to offer key guidance along the way, which can come in handy if you're a new filer or are iffy on certain rules. For example, most are equipped to spot audit red flags, thereby helping you avoid them. Many programs will also steer you toward lucrative tax credits and deductions you might otherwise miss out on.\n\nWhen you file on paper, however, none of that happens. This means that if you're claiming a disproportionally large deduction and don't recognize that yourself, your return might land on the IRS audit list. Similarly, if you're not knowledgeable about the various tax credits out there, you'll risk paying the IRS more than necessary. And that's the last thing you want.\n\nThough there's something to be said about going it old school and filing your taxes on paper, you're better off submitting an electronic return and resting easy knowing you've lowered your chances of making a mistake, delaying your refund, and missing out on tax-savings opportunities. Besides, when you file electronically, you don't have to stand in long post office lines or worry about your taxes getting lost in the mail -- and that's reason enough to avoid paper.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

                "body": "Protect your Facebook information from third-part apps in just a few steps. Jefferson Graham reports on #Talking Tech.\n\nHere's a suggested item for your weekend to-do list: review what apps have access to your Facebook data, then start deleting.\n\nMore specifically, take a close look at apps that let developers glom onto your personal information and then potentially share, or re-sell, that information to others.\n\nTo recap: this week's tech headlines have been all about Facebook and the crisis for the social network. The social network revealed that consultancy Cambridge Analytica had used vast amounts of data from Facebook to build profiles of American voters to help Donald Trump's campaign. Cambridge got the data via a researcher who created one of those seemingly harmless personality quiz apps that asked users to answer questions about their digital lives.\n\nFacebook says it has stricter controls than it used to, and will now take a good, hard look at all its app developers to weed out abuses. You can take that at face value and either believe them, or be highly skeptical. (I'm in the latter camp.)\n\nWhile you wait for Facebook to (hopefully) change, you can take action. Get rid of as many apps as you can now. (Check out our Talking Tech video here.)\n\nUnfortunately, Facebook makes this really hard to do. More on that in a second.\n\nMany Facebook users don't realize how often they've clicked a button to grant app developers access to their lives, ages and likes in exchange for the luxury of not having to register with e-mail addresses or other personal information. They grant sign-on access via Facebook with one click, and in turn, those app developers can get personal data.\n\nThe takeaway: It's smarter to register for access with the app itself, instead of using the Facebook sign-in.\n\nIn the meantime, check your Facebook setting to see how many apps have been granted access. I did this week, expecting the list to be around 100 or so. (I'm a tech reporter -- check out apps all the time.) Instead, it nearly topped 400. Four hundred! From the ones that I actually use and like, like Airbnb, Booking.com and Gas Buddy to apps that have been dead for years, like Path, Phanfare and Revision 3.\n\nTo delete the apps, click the checkmark next to the question mark at the top right of the News Feed, select Settings, then Apps on the left-side menu, and then Apps, Websites and Plug-ins.\n\nFrom there, take a look at who you've granted access to, and start deleting those apps you don's use.\n\nHere's where you'll see just how difficult Facebook makes it. There is no Select All button, or even a way to select multiple apps at once. You'll have to delete each one, one by one, And each time, Facebook will say: \"This will remove the app from your account, your bookmarks and the list of apps you use .\" And then this kicker, that the app \"may still have the data you shared with them.\" For information about removing this data, contact the developer, Facebook advises.\n\nFacebook's messaging is the same for all apps, and you have to endure it with every delete.\n\n\"It's easier to get rid of a car that's a lemon and return it to the dealer than it is to get rid of Facebook apps,\" says Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst with Kaleido Insights. \"This is the Facebook business model. We are the inventory, and they're not going to let us just walk away.\"\n\nBut you can. It will just take some time. But it's worth it.\n\nAn Arizona woman was struck and killed by a self-driving Uber test car. Police said Uber wasn't at fault, as the pedestrian crossed outside of a crosswalk, but the message is clear: with self-driving cars being tested in urban areas like Phoenix and Toronto, be careful being a pedestrian.\n\nDropbox began selling shares on Wall Street, but you know what -- its terms for consumers are not so great. It offers 2 gigabytes of free storage space, compared to 15 gigabytes free from Google Drive. The cloud-storage service hopes to make a mint on Wall Street with its new IPO. But consumers looking to strike the best deal for online storage should look elsewhere, as we pointed out. Dropbox has the least liberal terms among the big five, which include Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple.\n\nYouTube said it would ban videos with guns. The Google-owned video network is tightening its restrictions for content about guns and now forbids videos about the selling and making of firearms, ammunition and accessories.\n\nBest Buy said it would stop selling phones made by Huawei, the Chinese smartphone giant. It has seen its ambitions to break into the U.S. market curbed by U.S. concerns about Chinese espionage. Lawmakers in the United States have placed Huawei and another Chinese manufacturer, ZTE, in the crosshairs over their reputed ties to the Chinese intelligence and military establishment. Both companies have denied any such complicity.\n\nThank Netflix for giving Phil Rosenthal the greatest job ever.

                "body": "The sun is shining, the birds are chirping and you have five stacks of winter clothes to put away.\n\nTuesday marked the first official day of spring, which means it's also time to dust off those cleaning supplies. Spring cleaning isn't always fun, but we have five TV shows and movies that may inspire you to go the extra mile as you spruce things up.\n\nOh, Monica Geller. For 10 seasons on the classic sitcom, Courteney Cox's high-strung chef kept Apt. 20 squeaky clean, for better or worse. Friends is the perfect show to binge-watch while you're doing something else, because you've probably seen every episode before, so it doesn't matter if you miss a joke or two while vacuuming. And the episode where Monica admits she has a messy closet will make you feel better about your own habits.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\nIf you are looking for a crime procedural to binge while you work, the story of Mr. Monk, who has obsessive compulsive disorder and is germaphobic, is the best choice. In addition to being an addictive and really enjoyable murder-of-the-week drama, the Tony Shalhoub-starring series is hilarious and has plenty of cleaning inspiration, even if he is a little over-the-top.\n\nStream it on Amazon.\n\nHoarders is one of those reality shows that makes you feel a little better about some of your own bad habits, and maybe motivates you to make a change. The stories of the people who have extreme hoarding tendencies are both enthralling and tragic, and the A&E series has a can't-look-away-from-it quality that will keep you watching all day.\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nIf you're looking to take a break from cleaning with a quick movie, we recommend this underrated 2008 gem starring Emily Blunt and Amy Adams. The actresses star as sisters who are down on their luck, and so they start a crime scene clean-up business. It's a weird concept that somehow works, and the movie is as sweet and heartfelt as its sunny title.\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nIf Mrs. Doubtfire can do it, so can you. The Robin Williams classic is heartwarming family fun, and can help even the messiest and laziest among us get off the couch and pick up a sponge. Anything is possible.",

                "title": "Packing advice from a 365-days-a-year traveler",
                "body": "Well, I'm not a fashion writer, but I do know what kind of clothes travel well. And you'll want to heed my travel packing tips.\n\nWhy? I'm on the road 365 days a year for a project called Away is Home, a family travel blog (our motto: \"Adventure runs in the family\"). We spend a month here, a month there, and we live out of a suitcase.\n\nLike most kids, mine are particular about their attire. Very particular. With two boys (13 and 15) and a girl (11), it's a never-ending struggle to balance form with function. That's a polite way of putting it, actually. It's pretty much a catfight.\n\nFiguring this out starts with knowing what not to wear. And from there, it gets a little complicated. But stay with me; I'll get you through it.\n\nWhat not to pack\n\nHere are a few lessons learned the hard way. Avoid packing the following items:\n\nDenim\n\n100% cotton shirts\n\nCotton underpants\n\nHeavy fleece\n\nDress shirts that require ironing\n\nBlazers or formal wear that wrinkles easily\n\nNow, if you're just going somewhere for a weekend and need to look good, feel free to skip my list of verboten items. But if you're on the road for a little longer, you might want to scroll up and read that list again. Nothing bulks up your luggage like a pair of your favorite jeans. Also, if you're out for longer than a week and start doing laundry, and don't get cottons or denim completely dry, things start to head south very quickly. The smell!\n\nThink small\n\nYou'll want to squeeze everything into your carry-on bag with ease, and I'm not even talking about flying, my friends. Unless you rent an SUV, your trunk space will be limited. Plus, you'll have to share it with your other passengers, not to mention a large stuffed animal or two. I'm not making that up. When we stayed at the El Dorado in Reno, my daughter won a very large stuffed bear, and it joined us for part of the journey. Let's just say I took care of Mr. Big Bear, eventually.\n\nI've tested a lot of pants, but I'm partial to Prana's Zion Stretch line, which rolls up into a small space. It's also wrinkle resistant, quick drying, water-repellent and holds up incredibly well to the rigors of travel. I visited Prana's main store in Boulder, Colo., last week and found out that if something goes wrong, they'll either repair or replace any pair of pants you buy, which is Nordstrom-level customer service.\n\nSo far, my oldest son and I are wearing Prana pants exclusively. My middle son, Iden, is in Wrangler slacks made from a similar stretch fabric. Only my daughter is still in cotton pants, but it's a yoga pant made from a fabric blend we bought at Target.\n\nThe touch, the feel ... oh, never mind\n\nIn case you haven't picked up on it yet: Anything made from 100% cotton is the enemy. That's especially true of underwear and T-shirts. If you're traveling through the Southeast in the summer, you'll definitely want to heed my advice. No cotton!\n\nSan Antonio will be forever known as the Cotton Apocalypse in my family. I'm not sure if it was my jeans, which I never should have brought on my trip, or the kids' cotton shirts, but something really started to smell bad in that triple-digit summer heat. I'm surprised they let us past the front desk at the Hotel Emma. Fortunately, I found a laundromat. Unfortunately, it didn't do much good. The smell stayed with us until we got to the desert, where mildew has no real chance of survival.\n\nFor shirts, I also highly recommend switching to a synthetic blend. My favorite is Tasc's bamboo shirts, which are super comfortable and don't pick up any of the funky smells that cotton tends to absorb. The company is, appropriately enough, based in New Orleans, one of the most humid places on earth. Over the last few months, we've slowly shifted to their organic cotton-bamboo-Lycra blend shirts, and we've never looked back. I travel with three Carrollton Performance Crew shirts, and they're versatile enough for almost any occasion, plus they fold into a tiny space.\n\nFor underwear, I have a strong favorite. Ex Officio's line of undergarments, which are synthetic, breathable and so light, you'll almost think you forgot to pack your underpants. (Don't worry, you didn't.)\n\nDon't wrinkle\n\nAnd how about those formal occasions? When we're out on the road, they are few and far between, but they do happen. Such was the case when I had to make a speech at a big travel agency conference in San Diego last summer. We were staying at a nice Sheraton, and although irons and dry cleaning service were available, who has the time for that with three kids running around? Also, I had to practice my speech, because offending more than a thousand travel agents at a time is hard work.\n\nFortunately, I had a Gramercy Blazer from Bluffworks, which, try as I might, would not wrinkle. It looked freshly pressed when I was up on stage delivering my sermon, and although no one liked what I had to say, at least I looked presentable.\n\nSo, to recap: If you're traveling a lot, consider downsizing, going with a synthetic blend and picking stretchy, wrinkle-free products. You'll look good and perhaps more importantly; you'll smell good. And that can take you a long way, especially if you're traveling with kids.\n\nWhat are your best packing tips? Have you made the switch to synthetic fibers, or are you all-natural when you're on the road?",

                "body": "The GOP is condemning students for demanding new gun laws after the Parkland shooting. They'll regret that when these teens become voters and leaders.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, whose formal education ended when he was 10, became a printer's apprentice for his brother when was 12. When his brother wouldn't let him write for the newspaper he founded, 15-year-old Benjamin wrote anyway, using the pseudonym Silence Dogood and pretending to be a middle-aged widow.\n\nJoan of Arc, the daughter of farmers Jacques and Isabelle d'Arc of Domremy, France, was 17 when she led the French victory at Orleans during the Hundred Years' War between France and England.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr., the son of a minister, passed the entrance exam to enter Morehouse College when he was 15. The summer before his senior year, he entered the ministry. He was 18 years old.\n\nMore: Students are right on gun control, and Republicans are dangerously wrong: Dianne Feinstein\n\nMore: After Parkland shooting, reject 'nothing can be done,' look for new solutions: John Walsh\n\nWhy should the Republican Party care about these instances in history, found easily on various websites and biographical tracts? Because some of its members have spent the better part of the last month dismissing the righteous anger of teenagers who either lost classmates or are part of a nation of teens mourning the loss of their classmates.\n\nSome conservatives have done more than dismiss: They have attacked these hardworking students who are standing up and demanding changes in gun laws.\n\nThose misguided political lemmings are calling these young people pawns, tools, puppets for liberals whose pleas for change they have ignored for decades.\n\nBut here's the thing:\n\nThese young people appear to be on a mission. The shooting in Parkland, Fla., on Valentine's Day was a too-familiar tale of a young, troubled loner entering school halls and killing youths before they have had a chance to make their mark in the world.\n\nThese young people are making a mark for the fallen. They are speaking for those whose voices were stolen in that moment, first by a shooter and then by pawns of the National Rifle Association who now mock them.\n\nThey are not naive, not all of them. They know that the Democratic Party, which has been in a coma since November 2016, is latching onto their anger to use it for their own elections. But they also know that only one of two current political parties is trying to change gun laws. And they aren't seeing Democrats calling them names. Yet.\n\nMore: Foster Friess: We can stop school shootings. I'll match your donations up to $2.5 million.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAnd here's what the GOP is missing most. As it continues its attempts to diminish these young people, as they attempt to make a mockery of their revolution, they have forgotten the most important rule of the digital age and rampant social media.\n\nYou can no longer be anonymous.\n\nYou cannot lob vicious word bombs at 17-year-olds and expect to get away with it.\n\nWhat you GOP leaders and lobbyists are not thinking clearly about is this: Those young people are voters and future voters and future leaders.",

                "title": "'She sheds' are like a man cave -- but prettier",
                "body": "The 34-year-old interior decorator from Owasso, Okla., tried to run her Cotton Stem design business and blog from the home she shares with her husband and four young daughters, ages 1 to 7 years old. Finding a calm corner anywhere was pure fantasy.\n\n\"My kids are so many and so close together, and so little still, that there's no completing a thought from A to Z inside the confines of our home,\" Kern says. \"No phone calls can happen without chaos.\"\n\nLuckily, peace and quiet were only steps from her back door. With the help of her husband and her father-in-law, Kern transformed an 80 square-foot potting shed, which had red brick outside but greasy lawnmowers inside, into a charming \"she shed\" -- a cozy hideaway built for one.\n\nThe shed now resembles a pint-size farmhouse cottage, appointed with rustic shiplap walls and vintage and French country accents. Three paned windows and a single-lite door fill the place with sun, while a small desk and tufted armchair provide both a workspace and sometimes, a comfy spot for a much-needed nap.\n\n\"It's really only big enough for one person to come out here -- just me, which is kind of exactly why I like it being small,\" Kern says.\n\nWomen everywhere long for a private space where they can work uninterrupted, a haven where they can write, paint, practice yoga, read and yes, nap, says Gill Heriz, author of two books documenting the she-shed trend in Europe and the U.S.\n\n\"The separation from the domestic space is really important,\" notes Heriz, whose \"A Woman's Shed: Spaces for women to create, write, make, grow, think, and escape\" was published in 2014 and \"A Woman's Huts and Hideaways: More than 40 She Sheds and Other Retreats\" was released in 2016. \"That idea of going to work, walking out of the house, leaving that behind and going to do whatever it is that you do in your shed. Private space that is theirs and theirs alone is really, really important for lots of women.\"\n\nIf you have an outdoor area, then there's a shed to match your style and budget, says Erika Kotite, whose second book on women's hideaways, \"She Shed Style,\" is slated for release in the fall. In North Carolina, blogger Mary McCachern designed her 10 x 16-foot shed on Lake Norman to look like one she spied on a magazine cover. She salvaged doors and shutters, and added a porch, window boxes and distinctive leaded-glass windows to create an inspirational haven for potting and puttering.\n\n\"It's really not about having all the bells and whistles,\" McCachern says of her small space. \"It's really just about having a place to be and create.\"\n\nIn rural Oregon, Tymmera Whitnah built an 8 x 8-foot, all-glass meditation room out of 30 separate doors and windows she had collected and rescued over the years. The tiny house rests on 5-foot-high log stilts, inspired by spirit houses Whitnah saw in Bali.\n\nSo whether the look you crave is sleek modern, vintage bungalow or eclectic bohemian, any shed style can be achieved economically by using an existing building or salvaged materials, says Kotite, whose own 6 x 6-foot shed is a traditional cottage with a pitched roof.\n\nLowe's, Home Depot and other hardware chains sell basic prefabricated sheds for as little as $1,000, while companies that specialize in customized versions, such as Modern Shed, offer French doors, skylights or additional windows that can push costs up to $18,000. A dream shed built from scratch can cost tens of thousands.\n\nKeep in mind that although your shed is miniature, it shouldn't be slapped together or constructed simply, like a children's playhouse.\n\n\"It's a grown-up woman's studio,\" Kotite says. \"It's a building, and you want it to last a long time so you want it to be built right.\"",

                "body": "ST. NAZAIRE, France -- Eager for a look inside the largest cruise ship ever built? USA TODAY this week is getting early access to Royal Caribbean's much-awaited, 228,081-ton Symphony of the Seas in advance of its maiden voyage, and we're posting our first photos of the vessel in the carousel above and at our Twitter page and Facebook page.\n\nAs can be seen in the photos, Symphony boasts dozens of eateries, bars and showrooms as well as an array of deck-top amusements including a multi-deck water slide area, surfing pools and rock climbing walls.\n\nDesigned for vacationers who love big, bustling mega-resorts, Symphony is built on the same platform as Royal Caribbean's giant Harmony of the Seas, the current size leader in the cruise world. But it eclipses its sibling by more than 1,000 tons and offers several new features.\n\nRELATED: Symphony isn't just bigger; it's faster, too | Royal Caribbean shows off new features of Symphony of the Seas | Preview the hottest new ships of 2018\n\nAmong differences, Symphony has more cabins than Harmony including a first-of-its-kind, two-deck-high family suite with a slide between floors. It also has a revamped Boardwalk amusement area, a new laser tag attraction and a new-for-Royal Caribbean seafood restaurant.\n\nSymphony will sail with a crew of 2,200, meaning that on busy weeks it could be home to nearly 9,000 people.\n\nSymphony has been under construction since early 2015 at the giant STX France shipyard in St. Nazaire, France -- the same shipyard that built Harmony.

                "title": "March for Our Lives: School shooting debate needs to go beyond guns",
                "body": "After Parkland and Great Mills, we must help kids with support beyond the classroom. When we \"March for Our Lives\", we must remember to think beyond guns.\n\nAttending funerals of gunned-down children and colleagues should not have to be part of an educator's job. But in too many communities, that's the reality today.\n\nChildren should not have to pass through metal detectors to go to school. Nor should teachers should have to arm themselves to keep students safe. Safety drills and lockdowns are only school rituals because we have failed as a nation to address the root causes of violence.\n\nEvery young person in America deserves to live without fear of gun violence. The two of us will be taking part in the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., this weekend because the young people leading this charge are onto something. In our public education work at the city, state and federal level, we've seen what it takes -- and what's missing -- to help our children stay safe and, ultimately, to have an environment in which they can learn.\n\nMore: Students marching for their lives are marching for the rest of America\n\nMore: Here's a gun control measure that even Tea Party members should support\n\nIn 2018, this debate is about guns, yes, but it must be about much, much more.\n\nWe have spent decades in schools and in our communities, and we believe sensible gun policies must be accompanied by efforts to improve school climate, help families dealing with trauma and give young people opportunities to learn and succeed.\n\nIn our past lives as U.S. Secretary of Education during the Obama administration and State Superintendent of Schools for Nevada, we both had the gut-wrenching responsibility of responding to school shootings. We also have seen that for many students, gun violence is a threat every day. More than 3,100 children and teens were killed with guns in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And though Saturday's march sprung from a tragic shooting on a school campus, the vast majority of that violence happens away from the schoolyards. On the steps of a church. Going to or from school. On the way to the corner store.\n\nTake Chicago, which had 2,786 shootings last year -- in which young black teen boys and men were the most likely victims. A less well known statistic is this: In 2014, 19% of Chicago's black 16- to 19-year-olds and 46 percent of the city's black 20- to 24-years olds were not working or in school. Chicago CRED works with primarily black and Hispanic young men like these who have shot others or been shot -- often the same young people -- to give them a chance to break the cycle of violence. They are placed in jobs that can keep them off the streets and out of prison. These young men say a decent wage is what they need to exit street life and enter the legal economy. But they also need life coaches, housing, group counseling and because many are young dads, parenting support.\n\nIdeally, our nation would put these kinds of supports in place so fewer young people would even get to the point where they need interventions. That would mean exhaustively working to support all the needs of children -- from basics like food, clothing and housing to mental health care, tutoring and programs that help them develop socially and emotionally. It also means reaching out to troubled families who need help staying afloat.\n\nMore: Students are right on gun control, and Republicans are dangerously wrong: Dianne Feinstein\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nBreaking down barriers for students is what affiliates of Communities In Schools and other partners do every day. They work with administrators and teachers to make school a welcoming place students want to be; reduce the incidence of behavioral problems, bullying and violence; and overcome other obstacles that keep children from learning. These programs can supplement the efforts of school district counselors and social workers, who are often stretched thin, by placing trained social workers in schools or linking families to services in the community.\n\nWe hope the momentum being created by the Parkland, Fla., students and their young allies from Chicago, Washington, D.C., and beyond will lead to stronger school safety policies. No, not guns in the hands of educators, but solutions that too often don't merit headlines: more social workers in schools, fewer guns in the hands of people who intend violence, and more funding for mental health services, especially in rural areas where they are sorely lacking.\n\nThese issues have been studied and debated to exhaustion. In communities across the nation, we have seen the senseless anguish -- individual young lives cut down every day, more just this week in Maryland -- as well as mass horrors like Parkland that shock us out of complacency.\n\nKeeping our children safe shouldn't be about the narrow solution of \"hardening\" schools. That would ignore all that we know about the many communities across the nation plagued by violence -- and we know a lot. Saturday's march is a moment, but the brave young people of this rising generation are counting on us to turn it into what these communities deserve: a movement.\n\nArne Duncan is managing partner of Chicago CRED, a nonprofit project that links at-risk young men to jobs.

                "body": "More than 1 million people are expected to attend the March for Our Lives in Washington D.C. hoping for changes to gun regulations and school safety. USA TODAY\n\nThey walked out of classes. They are rallying in streets across the nation for March for Our Lives. They have the attention of millions. Now what?\n\nThe student-led movement forged in Parkland, Fla. after the high school shooting that took 17 lives is remarkable, organized and fierce -- but not completely rare. Endless lists of groups have protested, marched, rallied, cried and pleaded for changes, whether it's been for gun laws, immigration, women's reproductive rights or climate change.\n\nNow the question is whether these young people who dub themselves \"the mass shooting generation\" will fade into the background of the debate over gun-control or be the leading charge in changing the country's policies.\n\nIt won't be easy to blaze the trail. Experts and leaders of past movements say it's going to be an uphill battle to translate the #NeverAgain movement into significant reforms. A lot will revolve around local efforts, keeping pressure on lawmakers and having a clear message moving forward.\n\nJaclyn Corin, one of the core members of the group, knows it'll be difficult. But she vows that they aren't \"backing down.\" She said their successes thus far have been astonishing and they're committed to finishing what they started.\n\n\"Our target is the November elections and we know we definitely have to keep pushing forward to then,\" she said. \"This whole thing has taken off into a much bigger thing. We are starting a non-profit and want to continue to advocate for gun-control, reforms and voter education.\"\n\nMore: 'We're not backing down': One month after shooting, Parkland student movement picking up steam\n\nMore: 'We deserve better': Students nationwide walk out in massive protest over gun violence\n\nFocusing on elections and being \"relentless\" was a part of what made previous gun-control measures happen, said Richard Aborn, a former president of the Brady Center, which advocates gun control.\n\nIn the 1990s, Aborn worked to successfully advocate for the federal assault weapons ban and the Brady bill, which created a waiting period for some gun purchases and the establishment of a federal background checks system.\n\nHe said back then, getting support from either political party was difficult, and the National Rifle Association was still the goliath it is today. Over the years, the NRA has successfully slowed and dismantled gun-control efforts it said would hurt the 2nd Amendment and gun owners across the U.S.\n\nThe group filed a lawsuit in Florida shortly after the state passed a sweeping bill after the Parkland shooting. It included gun-control measures, including increasing the age to 21 to purchase firearms.\n\nThe NRA said the move violated the constitutional rights of millions of 18- to 20-year olds and called it \"political eye-wash.\"\n\nAborn says the Parkland students are resilient and have grit, noting that the group has all the elements of a successful movement. But, he says, they must remain focused on the local level and the cities where members of Congress are from, which can help thrust the issue into the spotlight of this year's elections.\n\nHe said while the march in D.C. will capture headlines, it's local effort that could lead to meaningful change. He added one of the keys will be making gun control a vote-changing issue for Americans and the younger generation. Only then, he said, will there be sweeping changes on policies.\n\n\"What happens with movements like this is you get great peaks of enthusiasm, then it dissipates,\" he said. \"You have to keep up the pressure and also keep things active at the local level with very specific goals, then you have to publicize all the wins, whether it's a key vote or successful efforts in a small town.\"\n\nThose small wins help keep up spirits and continue drudging forward because it's going to be a long and tough road before there are key shifts in the gun-control debate, said Meira Levinson, a Harvard University education professor who focuses on youth empowerment and civic education.\n\nShe added the Parkland students seem to have a really good shot at a sustained campaign because the children are diverse and joining forces with others.\n\n\"Everyone can recognize themselves in these kids, and that is really crossing boundaries,\" Levinson said.\n\nWhile some movements don't stand the test of time, others have proved prevalent over the years. The Black Lives Matter movement was started after George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman, shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was unarmed, in 2012.\n\nThe group has continued to fight against racial inequality and call for justice after the deaths of unarmed black men over the years, notably with massive protests after the deaths of Freddie Gray, Eric Garner and Michael Brown.\n\nThe group continues to make headlines and held large protests in Sacramento, Calif. this week after officers shot and killed an unarmed black man in his grandparents' backyard. The protests caught nationwide attention and delayed a Sacramento Kings basketball game on Thursday.\n\nParkland teens have voiced their support for the Black Lives Matter movement and also met with students in Chicago, a city plagued by gun violence for years. Parkland students say they all want the same thing: an end to gun violence.\n\nThe #NeverAgain organizers also have worked with the Women's March organization, which held rallies around the world to protest President Trump's first day in office.\n\nWomen's March organizers said after the march in 2017, which drew millions, they were faced with a lot of decisions and had to ask themselves whether this was just a march or something they were committed to making into a bigger movement.\n\nBob Bland, a co-president for the organization, said they quickly realized this could be a \"golden opportunity.\" The group helped coordinate with local groups and provided tool kits and goals to help them successfully organize around issues affecting communities across the U.S., something that could be useful for the Florida students.\n\nBland said they used the energy from the first march and created a list of 10 actions over the first 100 days of the Trump Administration, which included members organizing a post-card writing campaign to senators and additional protests.\n\nThey decided against solely focusing on issues like reproductive rights and targeted immigration, climate change and racial inequality. The organization's youth arm helped coordinate nationwide walkouts earlier this month in coordination with the #NeverAgain movement.\n\nThere were issues, though, as some women differed on where they wanted the movement to go and instead wanted to focus on women winning elections.\n\n\"When you're dealing with a mass movement and people are organizing in millions, not everyone is going to agree,\" Bland said, adding there were plenty of issues while trying to start their campaign.\n\nShe said while the students in Parkland can learn from other movements and others who have successfully created societal changes, \"a lot of us adults are being inspired by them.\"\n\n\"They should continue to play at their strengths and not try to be like the others before them,\" Bland said. \"These students have something really special and are leaders unlike what we've seen for decades.\"",

                "body": "Find out how industry trends are affecting sales of popular brands.\n\nBeer is one of the most popular beverages in the world, and holidays such as St. Patrick's Day act as a reminder of the cultural importance beer has around the globe. For London-based Diageo (NYSE: DEO), which owns the Guinness brand and has turned it into a worldwide favorite among beer drinkers, March 17 is always an important day. About 13 million pints of Guinness beer were consumed on the holiday, or about three times the ordinary run rate for the Irish stout.\n\nYet when you look more broadly at beer consumption throughout the year, the picture doesn't look as strong. Even with a generally successful brand such as Guinness, there have been obstacles to growth that have shown up recently. As you can see, organic volume of the Irish beer brand's sales has fallen in four out of the past five years.\n\nThere are several factors potentially at play. One is that the rise of craft brews has disrupted the usual brand loyalty among beer drinkers, instead leading many consumers to favor a wider selection of beers. In addition, a new emphasis on spirits in the marketplace has shifted consumer tastes away from beer toward hard liquor.\n\nCompanies in the industry are responding accordingly to keep up with changing consumer trends. Diageo, in particular, has seen tremendous growth in spirits brands such as Tanqueray gin and Crown Royal whiskey, which saw volume increases of 12% and 10%, respectively, in 2017. Beer won't disappear overnight, but its past dominance of the local tavern might slowly give way to a broader menu of adult beverages in the years to come.\n\nDan Caplinger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

                "body": "What should you read this weekend? USA TODAY's picks for book lovers include Chris Bohjalian's high-flying thriller The Flight Attendant and Anna Quindlen's new novel, Alternate Side.\n\nThe Flight Attendant by Chris Bohjalian; Doubleday, 354 pp.; fiction\n\nA woman. A murder. A mode of public transportation. Paula Hawkins put the formula on rails in The Girl on the Train. Ruth Ware took it out to sea in The Woman in Cabin10. It was only a matter of time before somebody gave it wings.\n\nIn the expertly turned thriller The Flight Attendant, the woman is Cassie, a flight attendant whose hard-partying ways are degenerating into alcoholism as she exits her 30s.\n\nDuring a layover in Dubai, a blackout-drunk liaison with a hedge-fund manager she met in first class leads to some familiar morning-after regrets. And then worse: She notices her hookup has had his throat slashed in bed.\n\nWas the murderer the mysterious woman she blurrily remembers visiting the suite? Has Cassie been set up for the crime? Might she be so out of control that she committed the murder herself?\n\nBohjalian lets Cassie torment herself for a time, but it's soon clear the killer was a Russian assassin hired by one of the fund's wronged investors. Cassie has been oblivious not just to the harm she's been doing to herself with alcohol, but to a complex network involving American spies, Russian oligarchs, chemical weapons and Cassie's family and co-workers.\n\nUSA TODAY says ★★★ out of four. Bohjalian \"has developed a graceful hand at thriller mechanics, smoothly shifting from Cassie's private paranoia to the intricacies of spycraft.\"\n\nAlternate Side by Anna Quindlen; Random House, 284 pp.; fiction\n\nAn upper-class Manhattan neighborhood chooses sides after a lawyer with anger issues takes a golf club to a beloved handyman's leg in a fight over a parking spot.\n\nUSA TODAY says ★★★. \"Captures the angst and anxiety of modern life. ... Quindlen's book reads like a metaphor for our divisive times.\"\n\nThe Stowaway: A Young Man's Extraordinary Adventure to Antarctica by Laurie Gwen Shapiro; Simon & Schuster, 256 pp.; non-fiction\n\nTells the true story of young, indefatigable Billy Gawronski, who in 1928 was determined to sneak aboard Richard Byrd's ship bound for the South Pole.\n\nUSA TODAY says ★★★½. \"Excellent. ... The Stowaway is a must-read for all polar exploration enthusiasts and lovers of well-told adventure stories.\"\n\nChicago by David Mamet; Custom House, 332 pp.; fiction\n\nMobsters and newspapermen populate this Prohibition-era murder mystery set in a Chicago soaked in hooch, prostitution and gangland crime.\n\nUSA TODAY says ★★★½. \"Splendid. ... This novel has a romantic heart, and the emotional stakes enrich the whiskey-drenched whodunit.\"\n\nThe Food Explorer: The True Adventures of a Globe-Trotting Botanist Who Transformed What America Eats by Daniel Stone; Dutton, 416 pp.; non-fiction\n\nThe story of how Department of Agriculture botanist David Fairchild transported thousands of plants to American soil between 1894 and 1904 and its ripple effect upon what we eat.\n\nUSA TODAY says ★★★. \"A meticulous retelling.\"",

                "body": "Mostly sunny skies are forecast for the more than 500,000 students, parents and teachers who are expected to take to the streets in Washington, D.C., Saturday for the March for Our Lives, a rally to protest gun violence in schools lead by the survivors of the Parkland, Fla. massacre. More than 760 sister marches will take place in major cities across the country calling for stricter gun regulations. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas students organizing the march have raised more than $3.3 million dollars for their cause, and celebrities including Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato will march alongside them. Here's what you should know about attending a mass rally, especially if it's your first.\n\nThe road to the Final Four kicks into overdrive this weekend starting with the tournament Cinderella. The Elite Eight tips off Saturday when NCAA tournament darling Loyola-Chicago takes on Kansas State in a No. 9-vs.-No. 11 matchup to determine one of the Final Four spots. Will Sister Jean be making a trip to San Antonio? We'll find out. In the second game, No. 9 Florida State battles No. 3 Michigan, which has the look of a legitimate title contender. While Saturday features tournament underdogs, Sunday will highlight favorites -- No. 1 Villanova will face No. 3 Texas Tech before No. 1 Kansas plays No. 2 Duke.\n\nAdult film actress Stormy Daniels is scheduled to appear on CBS' 60 Minutes Sunday to discuss her alleged affair with President Trump. Daniels signed a nondisclosure agreement to stay silent about the 2006 tryst (which the president denies) in exchange for $130,000 (which Daniels offered to return). The actress has since claimed the agreement is invalid because Trump did not sign it. Speculation has swirled about the Daniels affair. Does she have photos or other evidence to back her claims? Did the $130,000 payment break the law? Was Daniels physically threatened to stay quiet about the alleged affair? Does Daniels owe as much as $20 million for violating the agreement?\n\nThe first-ever gay pride parade in Starkville, Miss., will be held on Saturday after organizers won a battle against the town's Board of Aldermen. The board initially voted 4-3 to deny Starkville Pride's application to hold the parade. But the aldermen decided to reconsider after the group filed a federal lawsuit claiming the permit denial violated the First Amendment and 14th Amendment rights of members of the LGBTQ community. This time, one objecting alderman abstained, leading to a 3-3 tie, which Starkville Mayor Lynn Spruill broke with a vote in favor of the event.\n\nA French police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage died of his injuries, officials said Saturday. Col. Arnaud Beltrame was among the first officers to respond to Friday's supermarket attack in southern France that killed at least four people -- including Beltrame -- and injured 15 others. The European country has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. French President Emmanuel Macron said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.",

                "body": "TREBES, France -- A French police officer who offered himself up to an extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage has died of his injuries, the interior minister said Saturday.\n\nCol. Arnaud Beltrame was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday. His death, announced by French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, raises the toll to four. The gunman was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.\n\n\"France will never forget his heroism, bravery and sacrifice,\" Collomb said about Beltrame on Twitter.\n\nThe gunman first hijacked a car and opened fire on police, then took hostages inside a supermarket. Baltrame volunteered to take the place of a female hostage and surreptitiously left on his cellphone so police outside could hear what was happening inside the store.\n\nOfficials said the decision was made to storm the building when they heard shots fired.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.\n\nOn Friday night, authorities searched a vehicle and a building in central Carcassonne.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called \"Fiche S\" list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nDespite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was \"no warning sign\" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nA woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He did not identify her.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nLakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury was not serious, Lefebvre said.\n\nLakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.\n\nRelated: French police kill gunman in supermarket siege that left 2 hostages dead\n\nHe shouted \"Allahu akbar! (God is great)\" and said he was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.\n\n\"We heard an explosion - well, several explosions,\" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. \"I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.\"\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people.",

                "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- It was a stellar day for the Pac-12 with Oregon State and UCLA both pulling off upsets to advance to the Elite Eight.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Beavers beat second-seeded Baylor, while the third-seeded Bruins knocked off No. 2 seed Texas.\n\nIt's UCLA's first trip to a regional final since 1999. It will face top-seeded Mississippi State on Sunday night for its first Final Four trip.\n\n\"I'm so happy for the seniors who were courageous enough to dream big and play big and have an opportunity to play for a spot in the Final Four,\" UCLA coach Cori Close said.\n\nThe Beavers will face top-seeded Louisville on Sunday for a trip to their second Final Four in three seasons. That year, Oregon State beat Baylor in the regional final to advance to the school's first Final Four.\n\nThe Cardinals spoiled a perfect night for the Pac-12, routing Stanford in the other semifinal in the Lexington Regional.\n\nThe other half of the Elite Eight will be set Sunday with the Albany and Spokane Regions set to play. The Mid-American Conference hopes for similar success to the Pac-12 by getting its two teams to advance. That would be a much taller order for the two 11 seeds: Central Michigan and Buffalo.\n\nBoth teams seem to be loose and ready to keep playing. Buffalo coach Felisha Legette-Jack buried a half-court shot during practice Friday.\n\nLegette-Jack will need shooting like that from her team to knock off defending champion South Carolina. The Chippewas face No. 2 seed Oregon.\n\nOregon coach Kelly Graves knows all about taking an 11-seed on a deep run in the NCAA Tournament. He was the coach at Gonzaga when the Bulldogs made back-to-back Sweet 16 runs in 2011 and 2012. Graves has been the head coach of the last two double-digit seeds to reach a regional final -- Gonzaga in 2011 as a No. 11 seed and Oregon last year as a No. 10 seed.\n\nGraves was asked if he had any advice for the No. 11 seed based off his past success as a lower seed.\n\n\"Just play, be who you are. I don't think at this point it helps anybody to change or to add new things or anything like that,\" he said. \"I think at this point pretty much every team has seen everything. They're not running anything tomorrow that we haven't seen before. I think just kind of be yourself, have fun with it.\"\n\nHere are a few other tidbits from the women's regionals:\n\nPERFECTION: Mississippi State star center Teaira McCowan was 11 for 11 from the field and made both of her free throws in the win over N.C. State.\n\n\"This time of year, you lose, you go home,\" McCowan said. \"You basically start over. So my team, my seniors -- the four I got -- I'm just trying to make it the best it can be, go as far as possible.\"\n\nTIMING: Louisville coach Jeff Walz complained about his team playing the late game Friday, more because of the burden on Cardinals fans having to make the drive with snow in the overnight forecast.\n\nTurns out he had nothing to worry about from their fan base, which showed up for the Oregon State-Baylor semifinal and comprised much of the 5,715 that hung around for the nightcap.\n\nWalz was feeling better after Louisville's rout, but still clock-watching.\n\n\"Are you past your deadlines?\" he asked reporters. \"We're past deadlines, so what you'll see is you can ask me as many questions tomorrow as you all would love to because I'd like to get these kids back to get into bed and we have a noon game on Sunday.\n\n\"My cell phone, I'll be happy to give it to you when we're done, you can call me, I'll give you as much as you want. But I'm finished with my statement because it's 12:10 right now and we play a noon game on Sunday. So I want to get these kids back to sleep. It's the student-athlete welfare that I think is important.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Tim Booth and Gary B. Graves contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- In a wild NCAA Tournament full of upsets, it's somehow appropriate that the first ticket to the Final Four will go to a No. 9 or No. 11 seed.\n\nAnd the second could go to another 9-seed.\n\nWelcome to the madder half of the March Madness bracket. The Elite Eight games Saturday in the South and West lack the Selection Sunday favorites and instead feature a surging 3-seed (Big Ten champion Michigan), two teams who were power-conference also-rans (No. 9 seeds Florida State and Kansas State) and the upstart (11-seed Loyola-Chicago).\n\nThe Wildcats and the Ramblers meet in the first regional final to wrap up the South bracket in Atlanta, then the Wolverines and Seminoles meet in Los Angeles.\n\nFurther down the line, one of those teams will end up playing for the national championship in San Antonio.\n\nIt's quite a feat considering three of those teams faced at least some bubble uncertainty in the final month of the regular season. And that was particularly true of the Ramblers (31-5) , who went 15-3 in their Missouri Valley Conference but could have easily been left out of the field of 68 had they not won the league tournament.\n\nYet, the Ramblers beat 6-seed Miami 64-62 in the first round on 3-pointer by Donte Ingram with 0.3 seconds left. Then came a 63-62 second-round win against third-seeded Tennessee on another late shot, this one a jumper from Clayton Custer with 3.6 seconds left. And finally, they held off No. 7 seed Nevada 69-68 in the Sweet 16, putting them a win away from the national semifinals for the first time since winning the 1963 national title .\n\nWhew.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of parity in the game, and I love it for our league,\" Ramblers coach Porter Moser said. \"There was a lot of talk that we weren't going to get in if we didn't win the tournament, and we know in the Missouri Valley how good a league it is from top to bottom. And for us to get in here, I think it's going to spark conversation about this, and I know the committees have such a hard job.\"\n\nNow they're meeting the Wildcats in the first 9-vs-11 game in NCAA Tournament history.\n\nKansas State (25-11) caught a break when UMBC pulled the first 16-vs-1 upset of top overall seed Virginia, allowing the Wildcats to avoid the Cavaliers in the second round. Kansas State beat UMBC then took out Kentucky's latest crop of touted freshmen to reach its first regional final since 2010 and second since 1988.\n\n\"We know that every team right now is trying to make history,\" Kansas State guard Barry Brown Jr. said.\n\nHere are things to know about the NCAA Tournament's second week:\n\nROLLING AGAIN: For the second straight season, the Wolverines (31-7) got hot late in the year to win the Big Ten Tournament title and reach the NCAA regional rounds. Now they're the closest thing to a favorite in their half of the draw.\n\nLast year's team lost by one to Oregon in the Sweet 16, but Michigan blew out Texas A&M on Thursday to reach its third regional final in six seasons.\n\n\"I'd prefer more games like that,\" coach John Beilein said afterward. \"I don't think we'll see any more, but I'd prefer it.\"\n\nFor the record, Michigan has won 12 straight and hasn't lost since falling at Northwestern on Feb. 6 .\n\nLONG WAIT: The last time Florida State was in a regional final, two-sport point guard Charlie Ward was months away from claiming the Heisman Trophy as the Seminoles' quarterback, the Fab Five ruled at Michigan -- and the Seminoles were blown out by a Rick Pitino-coached Kentucky team featuring Jamal Mashburn.\n\nThat was 1993.\n\nThe balanced Seminoles (23-11) got here by upending 1-seed Xavier then beating a 32-win Gonzaga team in the Sweet 16.\n\n\"We just don't care who plays or who scores the basket, as long as everybody's happy,\" FSU's Braian Angola said. \"We buy into the system, and that's what we're doing right now.\"\n\nSEMBLANCE OF ORDER: The other half of the bracket looks much closer to form.\n\nIn the East, Jalen Brunson was fantastic in leading top-seeded Villanova past Press, umm, West Virginia in Friday's Sweet 16. That pushed the Wildcats -- the highest overall seed left -- into Sunday's regional final in Boston to face third-seeded Texas Tech, which beat 2-seed Purdue.\n\nAnd in the Midwest, bluebloods Kansas and Duke advanced to a chalk regional final in Omaha, Nebraska. Neither had an easy time of it, with the top-seeded Jayhawks holding off fifth-seeded Clemson while the second-seeded Blue Devils beat No. 11 seed Syracuse in an Atlantic Coast Conference-heavy doubleheader.\n\nCONFERENCE BREAKDOWN: The Big 12 and ACC are leading the way entering the Elite Eight.\n\nThe Big 12 earned seven bids and has three teams (Kansas, Texas Tech and Kansas State) still alive to go with an 11-4 tournament record (.733). The ACC tied its own record with nine bids and has two left (Duke and FSU) to go with a 12-7 record (.632).\n\nThe Big East (Villanova), Big Ten (Michigan) and Missouri Valley Conference (Loyola-Chicago) have the other spots.\n\nFAIL: ESPN says there were 17.3 million entrees into its bracket contest. And zero -- as in nary a one -- got the Elite Eight teams correct. So maybe you don't have to feel so badly about your up-in-smoke picks?\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "We interrupt this March for underdogs with a reality check from some of college basketball's blue bloods.\n\nKansas, Villanova and Duke are still alive in the NCAA Tournament, ready to tilt the bracket back toward the favorites.\n\nCall Friday the exception to what has been an extraordinarily-maddening, upset-laden March. One that showcased three powerhouse teams, each good enough to be deemed the favorite if they reach the national title game.\n\nIn the East, top-seeded Villanova held up to fifth-seeded West Virginia's pressure. In the Midwest, top-seeded Kansas staved off fifth-seeded Clemson's late comeback attempt.\n\nNo. 2 seed Duke solved 11th-seeded Syracuse's zone to advance, too, and set up a star-powered regional final on Sunday against the Jayhawks.\n\nOrder restored in the tourney -- at least for one night.\n\n\"But they say this time of year is survive and advance, and we were able to do that,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said after his team held on for a four-point win in the Midwest Region.\n\nVillanova will face Texas Tech in the East final after the third-seeded Red Raiders beat a second-seeded Purdue team without injured starting center Isaac Haas.\n\nThe East and Midwest are on the right half of the NCAA tourney bracket, the half that hasn't had as many upsets. That foursome of teams alone would have made for an intriguing Final Four. Even Syracuse doesn't really count as a Cinderella team given its title-winning history.\n\nUnderdogs rule the left side.\n\nNo. 3 Michigan is the highest seed remaining in that half of the bracket and will face No. 9 seed Florida State in the West Region final on Saturday. In the South final, ninth-seeded Kansas State will face 11th-seeded Loyola-Chicago and its 98-year-old scouting chaplain and social media star, Sister Jean. It's the type of foursome that might meet in some early-season nonconference tournament held in Hawaii.\n\nNo favorite feels safe anymore in the NCAAs after 16th-seeded UMBC's history-making win over No. 1 overall seed Virginia last week in the first round.\n\n\"I'm not surprised there's low seeds in here. I mean, things happen,\" Ramblers coach Porter Moser said about the Elite Eight. \"They're finding ways to win, and things happen this time of year, especially when you get a group that just believes and has made some really clutch shots down the stretch.\"\n\nKansas guard Devonte' Graham said all the upsets have helped his team to avoid overlooking opponents.\n\n\"But also we just know we've got to be focused,\" Graham added. \"If we slip up and don't come prepared, it's going to be the end of the season.\"\n\nUnder pressure, Kansas passed its test, just like Villanova.\n\nThe Wildcats followed a familiar formula, shooting over Press Virginia from the 3-point arc to overcome 16 turnovers.\n\nVillanova didn't wilt in the face of the pressure. Coach Jay Wright decided to attack it head-on.\n\n\"So when I started watching film, I just thought, man, this is a tough matchup,\" Wright said, \"and if we survive this, we're a pretty mentally tough team, and this is going to be like an old-school, grind-out game.\"\n\nDuke also did what is expected of a tourney favorite, outlasting Syracuse thanks in part to its decided talent advantage. No easy feat, by the way, after the Orange's 2-3 zone took down Michigan State in Detroit in the second round.\n\nPerhaps feeling the heat, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski tore off his jacket and threw it to the floor in frustration after calling a timeout early in the second half to slow a Syracuse run. In time, the best player on the court, Duke's Marvin Bagley III, took over on the floor. He had 13 of his 22 points and eight of his nine rebounds in the second half.\n\n\"That was a tough game to be a part of. It came down the wire,\" Bagley said.\n\nBut for at least one more game, the higher seed prevailed, sanity ruling on a relatively ho-hum Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nUSA TODAY Sports recaps the key takeaways following Friday's four Sweet 16 NCAA tournament games.\n\n1. Jalen Brunson and Villanova are at another level right now. Brunson, the national player of the year, propelled the Wildcats to a 90-78 win over a very tough out in a No. 5 West Virginia team that was probably as good as a No. 2 or No. 3 seed. The Mountaineers' pressing and physical style of play threw 'Nova out of sync offensively, but it was Brunson (27 points) who got his team in control and spearheaded a second-half 11-0 run that essentially put the game away. The Villanova floor general hit big bucket after big bucket and makes the Wildcats the national title favorite here in the Elite Eight.\n\nMORE ELITE EIGHT: 5 key takeaways from Thursday's Sweet 16 games\n\nELITE EIGHT PREVIEW: Breaking down Saturday's NCAA tournament schedule\n\n2. Duke vs. Kansas will be must-watch. Both the Blue Devils and Jayhawks survived close games against inferior opponents to reach the Elite Eight on Friday. Duke dispatched a Syracuse team that had wreaked havoc in this tournament on three teams with its 2-3 zone, while the Jayhawks used an early offensive flurry to put the game out of reach for a pesky Clemson team that made it close in the final minutes.\n\nAnd now, we get an awesome No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown in the Midwest Region. Whichever team survives this game could easily go on to be the national champion, as Duke has a wide array of weapons behind 6-10 freshman forward Marvin Bagley III and All-American Grayson Allen, while Kansas is the best outside shooting team left in this tournament fueled by Big 12 player of the year Devonte' Graham and a coming-into-his-own Malik Newman.\n\nCoach K's Jacket: TOSSED pic.twitter.com/xf49Tz1xbO -- CBS Sports (@CBSSports)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nTITLE SWAGGER: No. 1s Kansas, Villanova both show net-cutting ability\n\n3. Texas Tech is the best defensive team left dancing. The Red Raiders are headed to their first-ever Elite Eight after a strong performance to knock off Purdue. Texas Tech had a balanced all-around offensive effort but it was a smothering defense that proved to be the difference-maker. This team forced Purdue into 17 turnovers and guards the perimeter extremely well, which is a key ingredient to an upset recipe of upsetting Villanova. West Virginia's dismissal, along with the unexpected early exits of Virginia and Cincinnati mean Chris Beard's team is the best defensive team in the Elite Eight -- from a statistical perspective, where they limit teams to under 65 points and 40% shooting.\n\n4. Syracuse's Sweet 16 deserves our respect but...this team arguably did not deserve to be in the field of 68. The Orange had a resume that barely got them into the play-in game, but coach Jim Boeheim's 2-3 zone was the ideal weapon to defeat teams from the Pac-12 (Arizona state in the First Four), Big 12 (TCU in the first round), and Big Ten (Michigan State in the second round). The Orange's performance against Duke and upset of title contender Michigan State were undoubtedly impressive. But that doesn't prove the NCAA selection committee was right. It actually shows how valuable an at-large bid can be.\n\n5. The great wall of Sagaba Konate gave us the block of the tournament. Even though West Virginia is no longer in the Dance, sophomore forward Sagaba Konate had a highlight-reel block that temporarily stymied Villanova in the Mountaineers' attempt to knock off the tournament's best remaining seed.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SWEET 16\n\n2018 NCAA tournament: Best of the Sweet 16 Fullscreen Duke guard Grayson Allen gets fired up after a first-half bucket against Syracuse.

                "body": "CLOSE\n\nSportsPulse: The NCAA tournament's Elite 8 bracket is set, who do you have moving onto the Final Four? USA TODAY Sports\n\nOMAHA -- In a locker room crammed so full of media there was no room for emotion, someone asked Svi Mykhailiuk how he felt. Other than smothered, that is, by the cameras and microphones.\n\nAfter getting by Clemson 80-76 -- after a 20-point second-half lead almost evaporated, after the Kansas Jayhawks had to hold on through a tense final few minutes -- was it relief? Joy? Or was he just focused on what came next?\n\nThe senior guard looked up, paused for a moment, and then said: \"Everything.\"\n\nAnd when you think about it -- for this Kansas team -- that's probably just about right. What to make of that victory depends on what you make of these Jayhawks.\n\nKansas is headed to the Elite Eight for the third consecutive season; it will face No. 2 Duke. Considering, well, everything, it's a significant accomplishment. Given the program's standard, it's just a step. In the postgame locker room, senior guard Devonte' Graham told his teammates: \"This year, we've got to get over that hump\" -- meaning, into the Final Four for the first time since 2012.\n\nWhether they can do it might depend on what the real takeaway is from the win against Clemson. Kansas shot its way to a huge lead, three-pointer following three-pointer following three-pointer, and seemed ready to cruise into Sunday with a dominant performance. Then, hampered by foul trouble and maybe a little too comfortable, the Jayhawks sputtered to the finish.\n\nMORE: Duke finds way past Syracuse in tense Sweet 16 matchup of ACC rivals\n\nMORE: No team left will be tougher than the one Villanova just beat\n\nMORE: No. 3 Texas Tech ousts No. 2 Purdue to reach first Elite 8\n\nDuring the first 35 minutes, we saw all the things that so often make this team so very good. In the last five, we saw the stuff that makes you worry. With that four-guard lineup, they' have potential to heat up and race past any opponent. With sophomore center Udoka Azubuike, who appears all the way back from sprained knee, they have a 7-foot, 280-pound monster in the middle. And yet unlike most Kansas teams, there's not a no-doubt NBA first-rounder. They go eight deep only because they have to. If the shots stop falling or the fouls pile up -- Friday, the Jayhawks weathered foul trouble from both Azubuike and Graham, probably the two players they could least afford to lose -- things can go awry in a hurry.\n\n\"There's less margin for error,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said, \"but these guys have certainly rallied around that.\"\n\nAgainst Clemson, the 20-point margin made up for a collection of errors in the last few minutes (as Mykhailiuk put it, \"turnovers, a couple of rebounds, a couple of dumb fouls\"). But against Duke, in a 1-vs.-2 matchup of college basketball's biggest brands, there obviously will be even less margin for error. How then to view Friday's victory?\n\n\"I'll think about how we got up 20 as opposed to how we almost let it get away,\" Self said.\n\nKansas earned its 30th win Friday night and advanced to the Elite Eight for the eighth time in Self's 15 seasons. That brings us to the next statistic. The Jayhawks have reached the Final Four only twice in that span; premature exits -- often, as an upset victim -- have become an unwanted story line for the program.\n\nWhen Azubuike, talking about his perception that each round in the NCAA tournament has \"a different vibe,\" described getting to the Elite Eight as \"you feel like you've accomplished something, like all that hard work all season paid off\" -- well, that's how it should be. It's how it is for most teams in most programs.\n\nThings are different at Kansas.\n\n\"It's been a great year,\" Self said. \"For this team to win 30 games and (the Big 12), and to play (Sunday) in the biggest game of the year so far, it's been a great year -- but it would be nice to make it special-special.\n\n\"And I think in order to do that at Kansas, you've got to get to a Final Four.\"\n\nHowever improbably, the Jayhawks head into Sunday with yet another shot to get there. Duke presents a significant obstacle. The Blue Devils have been inconsistent this season, but they might have the most talented team in the tournament, very young but loaded with future NBA players. It's why Self planned to tell his players to just \"let it fly\" on Sunday.\n\n\"We should play free and loose,\" he said. \"There's no reason we shouldn't. These guys have overcome more than most of our teams have to get to this point.\"\n\nIt's weird to note this, also: Where some of those more talented predecessors played lights out to get to the Elite Eight, and then faltered, these Jayhawks have been solid but unspectacular in the NCAA tournament. In beating Penn, Seton Hall and Clemson, the Jayhawks haven't come particularly close to their peak performance level of late February and early March, when they surged to win the Big 12's regular-season and tournament titles.\n\nThey clearly have been feeling their way back to normalcy as Azubuike's knee healed. And Graham, a consensus All-American and their best player and floor leader, hasn't played all that well in the tournament.\n\n\"We haven't seen the real Devonte' yet,\" Self said.\n\nAnd yet here they are. Azubuike said the knee felt better Friday, and it sure looked like it. Graham has been so good this season it's only a matter of time. Instead of heading for a breakdown, maybe they're due to break out.\n\nThis being Kansas, the weight of expectations remain. So do the Jayhawks' deficits. But so far, neither has been crippling. Come Sunday, they have a chance to let it fly.\n\n\"Of all the teams that we've had here, this would be the team that everyone would have thought would not be in this game,\" Self said. \"And so, 'Hey, we're in this game.' \"\n\n2018 NCAA tournament: Best of the Sweet 16 Fullscreen Duke guard Grayson Allen gets fired up after a first-half bucket against Syracuse.

                "title": "Wisconsin's small organic dairies squeezed by Texas mega-farms",
                "body": "MILWAUKEE -- You're in Wisconsin, America's Dairyland.\n\nYou go to the store and buy some organic milk. You have this image of a small farm somewhere in rural Wisconsin, maybe one of those cool little towns in the Kickapoo Valley.\n\nBut it could be from a big farm. A really big farm. In Texas.\n\nYes, Texas.\n\nWisconsin's organic dairy farmers are getting squeezed by mega-sized farms that may have more than 100 times as many cows. And while some in Wisconsin claim their oversized brethren aren't playing by the rules, for the most part, government regulators have dismissed the complaints.\n\nThink of this as the dairy industry version of small-town retailers having Walmart come in and push them to the edge.\n\nFor years, farmers have turned to organics to get paid more for their products without as many price fluctuations. But organic dairy has become big business, attracting mega-sized farms in places you wouldn't think of having them -- like west Texas, which is more known for longhorn cattle than Holsteins.\n\nThe Texas farms can produce milk cheaper, partly because they buy cattle feed in large quantities grown on thousands of acres. They also can afford to ship milk longer distances, which is important because there aren't that many people living around cities like Amarillo.\n\n\"It's economies of scale. Your costs of production go down, and because you're so big, you're in a stronger (negotiating) position with processors and wholesalers,\" said Steven Deller, a University of Wisconsin-Madison agricultural economist.\n\nEven with transportation costs, some dairy processing plants have switched from buying milk locally to getting it from Texas, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dairy Market News.\n\n\"The churning within the organic dairy sector continues,\" the USDA publication says.\n\nDairy Market News, based in Madison, Wis., says its information comes from USDA market surveys and other industry sources.\n\nIt doesn't disclose names of farms and processing plants but says six organic dairy farms in Texas produced 481.4 million pounds of milk in 2016, about 23% more than all of Wisconsin's 453 organic dairy farms combined.\n\nSome Texas dairies have more than 10,000 cows, while Wisconsin's herd size for organics is often fewer than 100 cows per farm. In average sales, Texas boasts $27.4 million per farm while Wisconsin is just under $278,000, according to USDA data.\n\nFarm size is a \"continuing source of friction within the organic dairy industry,\" Dairy Market News says.\n\nOverall, it's more expensive to produce milk under USDA organic rules which call for pesticide-free grain, at least 120 days of pasture access a year, and a significant amount of fresh grass in a cow's diet.\n\nYet the amount that farmers are paid can be nearly double what they would get for nonorganic milk and they can make a living on fewer cows.\n\n\"I think it's still good,\" said organic dairy farmer Kevin Thull, who milks about 70 cows on his family farm in Kewaskum, Wis., and sells the milk to Organic Valley Cooperative in LaFarge.\n\nBut as the organic market has become saturated, with milk from some very large farms flowing across state lines, some farmers say they've lost about 30% of the price they received a couple years ago.\n\n\"That's right off the top, even as our expenses continue to go up,\" said Jim Goodman, an organic dairy farmer in Wonewoc, about 70 miles northwest of Madison. \"The growth is in the big farms, like in Texas. You don't see a lot of small organic dairy farms starting up these days.\"\n\nHe and other Wisconsin dairy farmers say the big operations aren't following the USDA rules that call for a minimum amount of grazing for organic cows and for the use of certified organic grain.\n\n\"We are required to have an acre of pasture per cow, and that's one of the standards some big farms totally bypass,\" said Carla Kostka, owner of Castle Rock Organic Dairy in Osseo.\n\n\"If the (USDA) held everyone to the original organic standards, the huge farms couldn't do it,\" Kostka said.\n\nThe big farms say they've met the standards and that they shouldn't be criticized for their size.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that some activists continue to perpetuate the misguided belief that only small dairy farms can be organic,\" Aurora Dairy, which has thousands of cows in Texas and Colorado, said in a statement.\n\nLast fall, the USDA closed complaints against Aurora brought by The Cornucopia Institute of Wisconsin and said the mega-sized farm complied with regulations.\n\nAurora says it manages nearly 12,000 organic pasture acres where its cows graze during the grazing season and that it gets organic grain from more than 100 farms.\n\n\"The truth is our size makes a positive difference. ... Our scale has also helped create markets for all organic milk producers,\" Aurora said.\n\nAurora spokeswoman Sonja Tuitele said the farm doesn't ship milk to Wisconsin and that she didn't know which Texas dairies could be doing that.\n\nPete Hardin, publisher of The Milkweed, a dairy publication based in Brooklyn, Wis., is among those who remain unconvinced the Texas farms follow the rules.\n\nMore: Mich. farmers nervous over China trade dispute\n\nMore: 'Absolutely inhumane' farm where horses died was visited more than 80 times: Sheriff\n\nMore: Investigator Pays a Price for Discrediting Organic Fruit\n\nYou couldn't have thousands of cows grazing in the fields and still get them indoors twice a day for milking, according to Hardin.\n\n\"It's physically impossible for some of these big dairies to call themselves organic and meet the requirements,\" he said.\n\nBut it's not unusual for Texas farms to put their milk on trucks for hundreds of miles, said Donald De Jong, co-owner and CEO of Natural Prairie Dairy Farms, located north of Amarillo.\n\n\"There's a misalignment of where milk is and where it needs to be. I think there are a lot of growing pains in organics,\" De Jong said.\n\nNatural Prairie has thousands of cows and ships milk about 700 miles south to Houston.\n\nDe Jong said Texas farms sending milk to Wisconsin are probably desperate to find a processing plant, given transportation that could add about 20% to the cost of their product.\n\n\"I think the market is very weak,\" he said, adding that years ago there was a similar situation when Texas dairy farms shipped nonorganic milk to Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2017, dozens of dairy farms lost their milk buyer and were nearly forced out of business when Grassland Dairy Products of Greenwood dropped them because it lost millions of dollars of business in Canada.\n\n\"Looking back, it was the clap of thunder before the storm really started,\" Carrie Mess, a dairy farmer from Watertown said Monday in her blog Dairy Carrie.\n\nIf nothing changes, Mess said, \"Farms are going to be selling cows and going out of the dairy business left and right in the coming months.\"\n\nThe price farmers have received for nonorganic milk in recent months has been poor, in many cases below the cost of producing it.\n\n\"Every day that farms keep the lights on, we go a little further in debt,\" Mess said.\n\nIn 2016, Wisconsin dairy farmers produced more than 30 billion pounds of milk for the first time, a new record. And while the number of Wisconsin dairy farms has been declining for years -- to about 9,000 now from 14,265 in 2007 -- milk production has increased as farms have become bigger and more efficient\n\nThe production milestone for nonorganic milk came even as the global market was awash in dairy products and prices paid to farmers were depressed from the oversupply.\n\nFarmers \"would rather shoot themselves in both feet\" than scale back their operations and get a better milk price, Hardin said.\n\n\"It's a classic supply-and-demand squeeze where prices for farmers are collapsing and they are losing their markets because there's so darn much milk,\" he said.\n\nHardin said he's seen the price for organic milk drop more than 35% from an earlier high of about $36 per hundred pounds, roughly 12 gallons.\n\n\"U.S. organic farmers are on the verge of ruin with these current prices,\" Hardin said.",

                "title": "Steph Curry's injury frustrations continue in Golden State Warriors return",
                "body": "The Golden State Warriors' injury woes might have taken the most serious turn yet on Friday night, as two-time MVP Stephen Curry left the game against the Atlanta Hawks in the third quarter with a left knee strain.\n\nAccording to a person with knowledge of the situation, the initial diagnosis indicates an MCL injury. An MRI is scheduled for Saturday to determine the severity of the injury. The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nCurry and the Warriors have been down this road before, yet it's certainly not one they cared to revisit.\n\nOn April 27, 2016, when the Warriors were playing Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets with a 2-1 series lead, Curry suffered a Grade 1 MCL sprain of the right knee that ultimately cost him just four playoff games (and 15 days). Yet there was always a question of whether he returned to full health during that postseason, with the Warriors blowing that 3-1 Finals lead against Cleveland while Curry played some of his most inconsistent basketball down the stretch.\n\nThe following season, new addition Kevin Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain on Feb. 28 in a game against the Washington Wizards and didn't return until April 8 (missing 19 games in the process). In the end, he was healthy enough to earn Finals MVP honors as they downed the Cavs in five games. This time around, the Warriors (54-18) can only hope that Curry's latest MCL injury isn't that serious.\n\nReport: Ex-Kings offer to pay for Stephon Clark funeral\n\nMore: Kings owner on protests outside arena: 'Stunned'\n\nMore: Rockets unfazed by Warriors: It's 'about us'\n\nThis much is clear, though: With the top seed in the Western Conference already unofficially belonging to the Houston Rockets and a rash of other Warriors injuries to deal with as well, they'll be taking the long view from here on out. The Rockets (58-14) have a four-game lead with just 10 games to go, not to mention the tiebreaker they earned by beating Golden State in two out of three tries.\n\nAnd with an injury list like this, they're in desperate need of some fast healing.\n\n* Curry had missed his last six games with a right ankle injury before returning against the Hawks, with Warriors coach Steve Kerr telling reporters this week that the ankle wouldn't be fully healthy until next season. Curry, whose chronic ankle problems and surgeries nearly derailed his NBA career in his early years, has sprained it four times since Dec. 4.\n\n* Durant has missed the last four games with a rib injury, with no return date clear just yet.\n\n* Four-time All-Star shooting guard Klay Thompson has missed the last five games with a fractured right thumb, and is expected to miss approximately another week.\n\n* Three-time All-Star Draymond Green missed Friday's game against Atlanta with a pelvic contusion suffered on Monday against San Antonio, and is likely to return on Sunday against Utah at Oracle Arena.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick on Twitter @sam_amick.\n\nNBA photo of the day: 2017-18 season Fullscreen March 23:Washington Wizards forward Kelly Oubre Jr. (12) knocks the ball away from Denver Nuggets forward Will Barton (5) as Washington Wizards guard Tomas Satoransky (31) looks on during the first half at Capital One Arena.

                "body": "CLOSE\n\nSportsPulse: After some stunning results in Thursday's Sweet 16 games, the Elite Eight is beginning to take shape. USA TODAY Sports\n\nNo. 11 seed Syracuse bowed out of the NCAA tournament, narrowly falling to Duke in a Sweet 16 showdown between two ACC teams.\n\nThe Orange won three tournament games, beating Arizona State in the First Four, TCU in the first round and a heavily-favored Michigan State team in the second round.\n\nCoach Jim Boeheim's signature 2-3 zone was tough to prepare for and was the perfect weapon against teams from the Pac-12, Big 12 and Big Ten that hadn't faced that type of length in a zone throughout the regular season.\n\nNOT ENOUGH: Duke finds way past Syracuse in tense Sweet 16 war\n\nBut whether it was the zone or this team coming into its own in March, a Sweet 16 finish was undoubtedly impressive for this prestigious program. Whereas Tom Izzo's Michigan State team, a title contender, didn't reach its potential by exiting in the second round, this Orange team passed its potential by going as far as it did.\n\nAll that said, it is important to remember that this team arguably did not deserve to be in the field of 68. Of course an awesome Sweet 16 finish makes it easy to forget that 'Cuse was a bubble team that was one of the NCAA selection committee's most head-scratching inclusions in years given the teams it snubbed. The Orange's profile featured just four Quadrant 1 wins, with the best coming against Clemson -- a No. 5 seed in these NCAAs. The RPI was decent, the strength of schedule was solid, but this was a team that didn't capitalize on several Q1 opportunities by finishing 8-10 in ACC play with a handful of iffy losses.\n\nBut this isn't to knock Boeheim and his program as much as it is to point out how wildly inconsistent the committee is with its snubs and last couple of teams it puts in on a regular basis. Last year, Syracuse was snubbed and found itself in the NIT. That team could have gone dancing just as well in comparison to the bubble teams that year.\n\nAnd if anything, Syracuse's strong showing this March doesn't prove the committee right as much as it illustrates how getting into the field is all it takes for a deserving team to reach its potential in the postseason.\n\nBRACKET: See how teams got to the Elite Eight\n\nTITLE SWAGGER: No. 1s Kansas, Villanova both show net-cutting ability\n\nThe same argument could be made for VCU's Final Four team in 2011 and the Orange's Final Four team in 2016. Both were bubble teams that barely got in. When you consider the fact that two No. 9 seeds and a No. 11 seed are alive in the Elite Eight right now, that shows how valuable an at-large bid can be. Kansas State and Florida State both played their way on the right side of the bubble before staging impressive tournament runs.\n\nYet Loyola-Chicago, a team that would have been 50/50 as a bubble team had it not punched its automatic ticket by winning the Missouri Valley, is the exact type of example of a team that might've gotten snubbed in favor of Syracuse.\n\nWonder how far NIT teams USC, Notre Dame, Baylor or Saint Mary's would have gone had they made the NCAAs? It's hard to imagine they would have gotten as far as Syracuse, but it's also hard to rule it out. In a tournament that is all about matchups, 'Cuse poses a tough one for a majority of contenders. But the comitte's job is to assess overall body of work.\n\nWhat Boeheim and this offensively challenged team did in the tournament was nothing short of impressive. But at the end of the day, this could have easily been an NIT team.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SWEET 16\n\n2018 NCAA tournament: Best of the Sweet 16 Fullscreen Duke guard Grayson Allen gets fired up after a first-half bucket against Syracuse.

Guard Barry Brown, Jr., is a beast on the defensive end -- just look at what he did to Kentucky's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander -- and they're also getting unexpected contributions from players like guard Mike McGuirl, who averaged just 3.2 points in the regular season, and Xavier Sneed, who made five 3-pointers against Kentucky.\n\nWhy Loyola-Chicago will win: If the Ramblers can beat a physical, defensive-oriented team like Tennessee, why not a team like Kansas State that was a lesser version of the Vols for most of the season? Loyola will probably do the one thing Kentucky couldn't: Make perimeter shots. The likes of Clayton Custer (46% from the 3-point line), Donte Ingram (39.6%) and Marques Townes (38%) make it easy for the Ramblers to play small if they have to, and freshman big man Cameron Krutwig will be hard to handle given Kansas State's lack of post depth.\n\nNo. 3 Michigan vs. No. 9 Florida State\n\nTime, TV: approx. 8:49 p.m. ET, TBS\n\nWhy Michigan will win: When the offense clicks like it did Thursday in a rout of Texas A&M, the Wolverines are going to be hard to beat. They blew the game open in the first half by shooting better than 60% from three-point range -- led by Moritz Wagner -- and they ended up shooting better than 60% from the field on the day. Michigan, which has won 12 in a row, also has stepped it up on defense, allowing opposing teams to score only 63 points a game. That's a winning combination.\n\nWhy Florida State will win: The Seminoles, who did not close the regular season with any particular fire, happen to be on a roll in the NCAA tournament. After beating Missouri in the opening round, they rallied from 12 down to beat top-seeded Xavier, then took out No. 4 Gonzaga in dominant fashion. Florida State has size, depth and knows how to share the ball.\n\nMarch Sadness: Agony of defeat in the 2018 NCAA tournament Fullscreen Kentucky guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (22) reacts after losing to Kansas State in the Sweet 16.

Keenan Evans scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half, when Texas Tech scored 11 straight points to pull away.\n\nThe Red Raiders (27-9) will play No. 1 seed Villanova on Sunday in the East regional final for a spot in the Final Four. The Wildcats advanced earlier Friday night with a 90-78 victory over West Virginia.\n\nBeard is in his second year in Lubbock after leaving Arkansas-Little Rock, where he led the Trojans to a double overtime upset over fifth-seeded Purdue in the first round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament.\n\nThis time, No. 2 seed Purdue (30-7) was hoping to join Villanova in the Elite Eight, getting 30 points from Carsen Edwards and 12 points and 13 rebounds from Vincent Edwards.\n\nBut Beard was in their way again.\n\nTexas Tech trailed for most of the first before scoring the last 10 points of the half to turn a five-point deficit into a 30-25 lead. The Red Raiders led 58-55 with 5:44 left when Evans hit two free throws and then a three pointer to start an 11-0 run that put the game away.\n\nPurdue star center Isaac Haas, the team's No. 2 scorer and rebounder, could only be a cheerleader -- and a one-armed cheerleader, at that. After breaking his right elbow in the first-round game against Cal State-Fullerton, he tried to convince Painter he could play; the Purdue engineering department even pitched in, designing a special brace for his right arm.\n\nBut Haas remained on the bench, replaced by Matt Haarms, a redshirt freshman who at 7-foot-3 measures an inch taller but at 40 pounds lighter is hardly the force under the basket of that his senior teammate has been.\n\nHaarms finished with four points and three rebounds.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events",

                "title": "Stephen Curry returns then injures left knee as Warriors win",
                "body": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Stephen Curry returned from a six-game absence with a right ankle injury only to strain his left knee after scoring 29 points, and the beat-up, undermanned Golden State Warriors held off the Atlanta Hawks 106-94 on Friday night\n\nCurry grimaced as he hopped around and made it to the bench on a tender left side with 3:09 left in third after JaVale McGee fell over and the center's right elbow appeared to pound into Curry's left knee. The two-time MVP immediately sat in a chair and put his head down before going into the locker room.\n\nNick Young scored 24 points with six 3-pointers as the defending champions were already down their other All-Stars -- Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.\n\nYoung, Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell and Zaza Pachulia joined Curry in the starting lineup. Pachulia had nine rebounds, while Bell scored 12 points.\n\nMcCaw went down hard and headed to the locker room at the 10:24 mark of the first quarter. He returned to start the second, playing with a bruised lower back. Young went to the locker room late in the first half but was OK.\n\nCurry overcame a slow start in his return, shooting 10 for 18. He had rolled the ankle at Atlanta on March 2 but initially kept playing before re-injuring it again.\n\nWhen asked what he expected of Curry in his first game back, coach Steve Kerr quipped: \"52 points. I have seen Steph come back from injury and nothing would surprise me.\"\n\nCurry began 1 for 6 and missed his first four 3s before connecting 62 seconds into the third. His 3 at 5:53 in the third pulled the Warriors within 60-56 then he converted a go-ahead four-point play with 3:03 left in the third. Soon after, his night was done.\n\nDurant missed his fourth straight game with a broken rib while Thompson sat out a fifth in a row with a fractured right thumb. Green has a pelvic contusion.\n\nThe teams combined to miss their first 16 3-pointers -- the Hawks 0 for 9 and Golden State 0 of 7 -- before Atlanta's Taurean Prince made the first shot from deep at the 9:21 mark of second quarter. Young hit the Warriors' first 3 with 4:24 before halftime.\n\nQuinn Cook contributed 13 points, eight rebounds and six assists off the bench on his 25th birthday, helping the Warriors to a seventh straight win over the Hawks and 12th in 13.\n\nPrince led Atlanta with 20 points. Dennis Schroder, who rested Thursday night in a loss at Sacramento, was back for Atlanta and scored 16 points. He briefly went to the locker room with 11:23 remaining in the game before returning for the Hawks, who HAD lost seven of eight.\n\nHe missed two key free throws with less than 5 minutes to play and his team down four.\n\nGolden State began 9 for 35 and fell behind 33-20 before trailing 51-43 at halftime.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHawks: The Hawks lost their sixth straight on Golden State's home floor. They haven't won at Oracle Arena since Feb. 25, 2011. ... G Kent Bazemore missed his sixth straight game with a bruised bone in his right knee.\n\nWarriors: Omri Casspi missed a third consecutive game with a sprained right ankle. ... Golden State improved to 16-2 following a loss this season and 47-9 since 2014-15. The Warriors have only lost back-to-back games eight times during that span. ... Local students were recognized at halftime by the Bay Area All-Star Scholarship Team, a collaborative effort by the Bay Area professional sports teams to provide scholarships for youth striving to continue their educations.\n\nMARCH FOR OUR LIVES\n\nKerr plans to participate in the Oakland \"March For Our Lives\" walk Saturday with his family to offer his support in the movement to end gun violence and mass shootings in the U.S.\n\nEarlier this month, Kerr took part in a town hall at Newark Memorial High School and challenged students to vote and make their voices heard. He shared how his father Malcolm, president of the American University of Beirut, was murdered in Beirut when Kerr was 18 and a freshman at the University of Arizona.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHawks: Visit Rockets on Sunday.\n\nWarriors: Host Utah on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Marcus Morris scored 30 points and the short-handed Boston Celtics beat the Trail Blazers 105-100 on Friday night to deal Portland its second straight loss following a 13-game winning streak.\n\nTerry Rozier added 16 points for the Celtics, who are second in the Eastern Conference behind Toronto but have had to deal with recent injuries to Kyrie Irving and Jaylen Brown.\n\nDamian Lillard and CJ McCollum each finished with 26 points for the Blazers, who are third in the West behind the Rockets and the Warriors.\n\nThe Blazers led by as many as 12 points in the third quarter, but Boston closed within three points at 83-80 on Shane Larkin's pull-up jumper. The Celtics didn't pull in front until Morris' 3-pointer made it 85-84 with 6:30 to go.\n\nMcCollum went on a personal 5-0 run with a layup, free throw and pull-up jumper to give a 91-87 lead back to the Blazers, but Al Horford answered with a 3-pointer.\n\nJayson Tatum's layup and Morris' 3-pointer gave the Celtics a 101-96 lead with 54.8 seconds to go. Lillard had a pair of free throws, but Tatum dunked to make it 103-98.\n\nMcCollum's jumper got Portland within three at 103-100 with 28 seconds left. After a scramble, Rozier made two free throws with 3.2 seconds left. Lillard's 3-point attempt for Portland at the buzzer was off.\n\nPortland was coming off a 115-111 loss to the first-place Rockets, which snapped the Blazers' long winning streak that helped push them up the standings.\n\nIrving missed his fifth game with a left knee injury. He is scheduled to have a minimally invasive procedure on the knee on Saturday. There is no timetable for his return. Irving, who celebrated his 26th birthday on Friday, was averaging 24.4 points, 5.1 assists and 3.8 rebounds.\n\nHe was one of several key sidelined players for Boston, which is at Portland on Friday. He joins Jaylen Brown (concussion protocol), Marcus Smart (thumb surgery), Daniel Theis (knee surgery, out for season) and Gordon Hayward (ankle surgery rehab). Brown missed his sixth game.\n\nPortland's Shabazz Napier was a late scratch because of a left big toe injury.\n\nThe Blazers went up 33-25 on McCollum's 3-pointer in the first half, but Morris' layup pulled Boston even at 42. Maurice Harkless dunked to put the Blazers back in front and Lillard closed the half with a layup for a 52-47 lead.\n\nMcCollum dunked in the third quarter to give Portland a 64-53 lead, its largest to that point.\n\nThe Celtics were coming off a 100-99 win at home over Oklahoma City in which Morris made a 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds left for the victory.\n\nBoston also won the only other meeting between the teams this season. Horford hit a fadeaway to edge the Blazers 97-96 early last month.\n\nTIP INS:\n\nCeltics: Coach Brad Stevens said Brown had participated in practice and could play Sunday in Sacramento. ... Stevens said he has not been involved in discussions to bring in another player because of the injuries. \"I think that there is the possibility of applying for an exception again because of all the knee injuries and the length of injuries,\" Stevens said. \"I don't know where we are with that, and I haven't talked to them about any particulars.\"\n\nTrail Blazers: Lillard was awaiting the birth of his first child. Lillard's girlfriend was due Monday. Complicating matters was Portland's three-game road trip starting Sunday at Oklahoma City. The team was expected to depart on Saturday. Coach Terry Stotts said the team would help Lillard in any way he needed.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nCeltics: play at the Sacramento Kings on Sunday.\n\nBlazers: visit the Thunder on Sunday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Ferrari drivers Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen went one-two in the final practice session ahead of qualifying at the water-logged Australian Grand Prix on Saturday.\n\nVettel set a best-lap time of 1 minute, 26.067 seconds, more than 2.4 seconds faster than his teammate in second.\n\nBoth Ferrari drivers switched from their intermediate tires to the super-fast, ultra-soft tires for the final few laps of the session, testing conditions on the track after a day-long downpour left it slick and filled with small puddles.\n\nMercedes drivers Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton did not opt to try out their soft tires, sticking to the intermediates for the entire session. They had the seventh- and eighth-fastest times, after topping the leaderboard in practice in dry conditions on Friday.\n\nThe heavy rains subsided by early afternoon, allowing the track to rapidly dry during the third practice session and making conditions safe for drivers to test their soft tires.\n\nStill, only a few drivers completed a timed lap with the softer compounds, with Mercedes, Red Bull and most of the others staying with their intermediates.\n\nSauber's Marcus Ericsson had the third-fastest time of the session on ultrasoft tires, followed by Red Bull's Max Verstappen on intermediates.\n\nHamilton remains the favorite to capture his fifth straight pole position at the Australian Grand Prix in qualifying later Saturday. He had the fastest laps on ultrasoft tires in the two practice sessions on Friday, though Verstappen was right behind him.\n\nVerstappen and Vettel both slid on the slick track early in the third practice session, but maintained control and completed their runs without incident.\n\nVerstappen's teammate, Daniel Ricciardo, had the sixth-fastest time of the session. The Australian's chances of winning his fifth career Grand Prix on his home track in Melbourne took a hit late Friday when he was assessed a three-place grid penalty for Sunday's race.\n\nThe Australian driver was penalized for driving too fast under red-flag conditions during Friday's second practice session because of debris on the track.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Grieving mother joins March for Our Lives in the name of Stephon Clark, other black males taken by gun violence",
                "body": "My son Jordan Davis was killed in 2012. I've turned my pain into activism\n\nStephon Clark, a 22-year-old black man, was standing in his grandparents' backyard holding a cell phone when Sacramento police shot at him 20 times.\n\nHis family now joins a terrible club that no one ever wants to be a part of but that grows every day: Black families who have had their sons and daughters taken by gun violence. I've learned firsthand that those of us who live this nightmare must develop an indomitable will, and live each day with strength and perseverance. Our daily lives are filled with pain.\n\nI've been a member of this club since November 2012. My only son, Jordan Davis, was just 17 when a white man, angry that a group of black boys were playing music from their car speakers at a gas station, shot and killed my son. I believe this man killed my son because he assumed the worst of him just by the color of his skin.\n\nCOLUMN: Protesters block freeway after videos show Sacramento police firing 20 shots at unarmed black man\n\nCOLUMN: #MeToo can help push justice reforms beyond International Women's Day, Women's History Month\n\nMy son's killer didn't know or care that Jordan was sociable and friendly, that he was thoughtful and kind and always invited his friends over for meals. Jordan loved school and was curious about other cultures. I'll never forget the year he spent trying his best to learn Japanese. He was a good, loving kid.\n\nRemembering the sweet, gregarious boy that Jordan was reminds me that I fight for a future that was stolen from my son. A future that was stolen from Trayvon Martin (the 17-year-old who was walking through a Florida community when he was attacked and killed by George Zimmerman), Tamir Rice (the 12-year-old shot and killed by police after playing in an Ohio park) and now from Clark.\n\nOur gun culture encourages people to shoot first and ask questions later. This is disproportionately true when it comes to black lives. My son and Clark were vulnerable to a society that sees young black men as the danger instead of the victims, and guns as the solution to this problem.\n\nThe persistence of this dangerous view is no accident.\n\nThe fact is that gun violence hits marginalized communities the hardest. Our country experiences more than 8,000 gun-related hate crimes a year -- that's more than 20 each day. The vast majority of hate crimes are directed at communities of color, and 53% are directed at black people. Additionally, black men are 13 times more likely to be victims of gun homicides than white men are, and black men are three times more likely to be shot and killed by police than white men are.\n\nThe gun lobby openly exploits the intersection of gun culture and racism. That's why the NRA and its allies were virtually silent when Philando Castile, a lawfully armed black man, was killed. Their marketing, including the disturbing NRATV, dog-whistles racist paranoia. They sow fear to keep gun laws lax and profits high, shifting blame to our children instead of the law that armed their shooters.\n\nOur lax gun laws empowered my son's killer to feel entitled to shoot him in an argument. Many black people reasonably believe a culture of gun violence, racism and distrust caused the two officers in the Clark shooting to pull triggers rather than ask questions. All of this is preventable.\n\nWe know that law enforcement must be part of the solution to police shootings in communities of color. We need to engage with law enforcement. We need to build trust, which is impossible without police being held accountable. We need to train police about the dangers of implicit bias and in how to de-escalate situations rather than grabbing for their gun first.\n\nAnd we need stronger gun laws. When there are common sense gun safety measures in place, both civilians and law enforcement are safer, and it contributes to a more productive relationship between police and communities of color.\n\nSince Jordan's death, I have rallied in Washington D.C., marched in state capitols, and sat in living rooms all over America, consoling other mothers like me. Together, we fight to make our country safer for black boys and all our nation's children. We have had successes, changing laws state by state across the country. But there's so much more to be done -- as Clark's death shows. This purpose motivates me through the pain. Fellowship with others affected by gun violence and our shared hope for the future keeps me going.\n\nInspiring young people -- no older than my Jordan was when he was taken from me -- are demanding a better future from our leaders and each other. From Ferguson to Chicago to Parkland, teenagers have stepped up to join the fight with mothers like me. I am proud to join the March for Our Lives this weekend. I will march for my son, for Clark and for all the black men and women, boys and girls affected by racism and gun violence.",

Seven of those boards were on the offensive end and led to second-chance baskets.\n\nBut Syracuse stayed in it until the end. Not until Gary Trent Jr., made two free throws with 6.3 seconds left was this game sealed.\n\nBattle led the Orange with 19 points.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                "body": "CLOSE\n\nSportsPulse: After some stunning results in Thursday's Sweet 16 games, the Elite Eight is beginning to take shape. USA TODAY Sports\n\nBOSTON -- Villanova will not face a tougher test than the one it got from West Virginia.\n\nThat's no disrespect to Purduue or Texas Tech or Kansas or anyone else the Wildcats might face on the way to the national championship game. It's simply fact.\n\nPlaying the Mountaineers is the basketball equivalent of boot camp, as much a mind warp as it is a physical grind. They keep coming and coming and coming, never giving you a break and rarely making a mistake that allows you to feel as if you're in control. Or gives you hope you're anywhere close.\n\nSurvive that, and you can do anything. Beat anyone.\n\n\"The whole game, they don't say anything. They just come at you physically, aggressively, and mentally tough,\" Villanova coach Jay Wright said, respect evident in his voice. \"So if you're not better in those areas, they're going to get you.\n\n\"And to see our guys come out, more to be able to compete with them physically and mentally, it was really impressive to me.\"\n\nMORE: No. 1 Villanova fends off physical, pressing West Virginia\n\nMORE: Kansas on to third consecutive Elite 8 after defeat of Clemson\n\nMORE: No. 1s Kansas, Villanova both show net-cutting swagger\n\nThe final score of 90-78 doesn't do justice to just how demanding Friday night's game was. Or how close top-seeded Villanova was to having it all slip away.\n\nThe Mountaineers are called Press Virginia for a reason, and Villanova was clearly flustered by being hounded for the entire length of the court. A team that averaged 10 turnovers a game this season had nine at halftime. It managed just two field goals in the first 14 minutes of the second half, and didn't have a basket in the paint until shortly before the 10-minute mark.\n\nFor a team that has barely been challenged this month -- Villanova had won its previous six games by an average of 21 points -- this was the ultimate measure of who the Wildcats are, and where they want to be when all is said and done.\n\nFor Wright, it was a flashback to the Big East of old, where teams scrapped and scraped and banged like they were still out on the playground, fighting for who had next. But his players have never known that Big East, and there was no guarantee of how they'd respond to being punched in the mouth on every possession.\n\nPaschall came in like a SuperNOVA! ὣ1ὣ1ὣ1#MarchMadness#Sweet16pic.twitter.com/5eNAxlt59c -- NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\n\"I just looked at Jalen (Brunson), Mikal (Bridges), and Phil (Booth), and I could see in their eyes we were good. We were good,\" Wright said of the timeout he called after Jevon Carter's steal and layup gave West Virginia a 60-54 lead, its largest of the game.\n\n\"If I didn't, if I looked in their eyes and saw fear or worry, I would have maybe went a little crazy,\" he added. \"But I didn't.\"\n\nSaid Brunson, who has a poise and maturity far beyond his 21 years, \"Nothing changes for us. ... Sticking to our core values, 40 minutes of Villanova basketball.\"\n\nAnd then, in a two-minute sequence that unfolded like it was being played at double speed, the tide turned. It started with Brunson, who made a free throw and then converted a three-point play -- that first bucket in the paint.\n\nEric Paschall tied the game with a pair of free throws and, at the other end, Brunson came up with a huge defensive rebound. He rifled the ball to Bridges, who glanced at the floor as he caught the ball and quickly stepped behind the 3-point line before letting fly.\n\nThe Mountaineers' ears might still be ringing from Omari Spellman's block on James Bolden, and he came flying in to slam home a miss by Booth to cap the 11-0 run. Two minutes later, the big man made a three-pointer that put Villanova up 71-64 and, effectively, into the Final Four.\n\nDO WE HAVE TO SPELL-MAN OUT FOR YOU?!?!\n\nBLOCK + SLAM as Villanova takes a 65-60 lead! #MarchMadness#Sweet16pic.twitter.com/Jx54UnSHkr -- NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\n\"When I started watching film, I just thought, man this is a tough matchup, No. 1,\" Wright said. \"And if we survive this, we're a pretty mentally tough team.\"\n\nThere are no more easy games from here, not that there've been any in this roller coaster of a tournament. But as the Wildcats learned when they won it all two years ago, the ability simply to survive, to take body blow after body blow and stay standing, is every bit as important as a stingy defense or a high-octane offense.\n\n\"That's what a final eight game is going to be like,\" Wright said. \"I think that's a really valuable game for us. Really valuable.\"\n\nIf Villanova cuts down the nets 10 days from now, this will be the game where the title was won.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.\n\n2018 NCAA tournament: Best of the Sweet 16 Fullscreen Kansas guard Lagerald Vick (2) celebrates a first-half bucket against Clemson.

(AP) -- Asia Durr had 24 points, Myisha Hines-Allen added 17 and top-seeded Louisville rolled past No. 4 seed Stanford 86-59 on Friday night in the women's NCAA Tournament Lexington Region semifinal.\n\nArica Carter had 13 points and Jazmine Jones 10 for the Cardinals (35-2), who trailed for just 53 seconds to win their 10th consecutive game and advance to their first regional final since 2014. Louisville thrived offensively, shooting 52 percent and building a lead that reached 27 points with 1:24 remaining to finish their third consecutive NCAA Tournament rout.\n\nHines made 8 of 15 baskets and surpassed 2,000 career points. The senior forward also grabbed five rebounds.\n\nBrittany McPhee had 15 points and Dijonai Carrington 14 for Stanford, which hoped to upset a tournament top seed for the third straight March in Lexington after knocking out Notre Dame the previous two years.\n\nThe Cardinal's bench outscored Louisville 23-13, but Stanford committed 19 turnovers leading to 22 points for the Cardinals.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nStanford: The Cardinal started out doing what it needed to stay with Louisville offensively, outshooting the Cardinals 73 percent to 65 percent in the first quarter. But Stanford still trailed by six, and that early statistic demonstrated its struggle to slow down the athletic Cardinals. With that went the Cardinal's goal of toppling a top seed for the third straight spring.\n\nLouisville: Playing just under 80 miles east of home with many of 5,715 clad in red at Rupp Arena, the Cardinals gave them a lot to cheer by clicking in many areas. They outrebounded Stanford 34-29, controlled the paint and outraced the Cardinal in the late-evening contest. Hines-Allen set the initial tempo on offense before Durr and others chipped in. Forward Sam Fuehring had 11 rebounds and nine points.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLouisville faces No. 6 seed Oregon State in Sunday's regional final.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                "body": "With every mass shooting, positions on gun control seem to harden more with no major breakthroughs. These advocates are accelerating efforts to bypass the system and create change at the community level. USA TODAY Opinion\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are expected to take to the streets Saturday for March for Our Lives events across the U.S. -- the biggest set to happen in Washington, D.C.\n\nBusload after busload has filled the nation's capital with students from across the country, including some from as far away as California and Minnesota.\n\nThe march was announced by students days after the Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and since then, more than 800 sister marches have been planned.\n\nEvents are scheduled in every U.S. state and on every continent, all with the same mission: ending gun violence and taking up gun-control legislation. Organizers expect 500,000 to descend on the nation's capital, including many from Parkland.\n\nMei-Ling Ho-Shing arrived in D.C. on Thursday. She was one of the many who were inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during the attack, which left 17 dead. The junior said she plans to link arms with her classmates and march in hopes of changing laws so what happened at her school will never happen again.\n\n\"Douglas is in the house. We're here and coming to make a change,\" she said, adding \"this isn't a trending topic. This is people's lives. We're not going to stop after this. When we go home we're still going to be fighting for this.\"\n\nThe shooting instantly reignited the gun-control debate. But the students in Parkland -- who spoke with a loud voice and amassed an enormous following in the hours and days after the shooting -- seemed to disrupt the typical cycle after an attack and demanded an end to gun violence.\n\nWithin a month of the rampage, several companies cut ties with the National Rifle Association and stopped offering discounts, students from 3,000 schools held a nationwide walkout, and Florida's governor signed a comprehensive bill that included tightening gun laws.\n\nJaclyn Corin, one of the core group of Parkland students leading the #NeverAgain movement and organizing the marches, said it's been unbelievable to see the support around the nation and how thousands of students have rallied for the cause.\n\nShe said the outpouring is a \"constant reminder that even though this shooting was a horrible tragedy, we'll make these changes and see some light come out of the bad.\"\n\nCorin, 17, said preparations for the march have been stressful, but she and the others are excited. She said this march is just the beginning of what they hope to accomplish.\n\n\"We want to continue what we're doing, especially leading up to November,\" she said. \"We want every young person to register to vote and head to the polls, no matter who they're voting for or what party they've voting for.\"\n\nStudents in Parkland have teamed up with other student organizers across the country planning sister events and offered tool kits to help them get organized.\n\nAhead of one of those planned marches in Milwaukee, students rallied outside a school to demand action from lawmakers and gain support throughout the community.\n\n\"It is our time as youth in the community to make a difference,\" said Marvell Reed, a 10th-grader at Barack Obama School of Career & Technical Education. \"It is our time to stand up and speak out to our state and local politicians.\"\n\nTwo friends of Christiana Duarte, one of the 58 killed in the October shooting in Las Vegas, are also planning a rally in Tucson.\n\nHannah DeSanto and Jessica Hopkins, both college students, say it was \"horrifying\" to see another mass shooting after losing their friend. They say the time to act and see changes is now -- not after another attack.\n\n\"We've let it settle a lot more than the students in Florida have, and for people to be saying, 'They're acting too soon, they haven't let it sink in or had time to heal,' it's frustrating to hear that because I wish something was done sooner to prevent that Florida shooting, to prevent the Vegas shooting,\" DeSanto said.\n\nShe said they want to help these students and \"be the change.\"",

He also drew an assist as the Bruins got a short-handed goal by Tim Schaller.\n\nBut Pastrnak's game-winner was a crushing blow because the Stars were 11 seconds away from earning a crucial point.\n\nDallas defenseman Greg Pateryn had the puck in the Stars zone, but Pastrnak dug it loose, and two passes later (the last one by Marchand), Pastrnak had the puck back next to the crease and tucked it past Kari Lehtonen.\n\n11 seconds on the clock.

Dallas and Colorado each have eight games left.\n\nMaking matters worse, two teams ahead of them earned points.

                "body": "Duke and Syracuse both played in a 2-3 zone against each other in their Sweet 16 matchup Friday, and - as FTW's Steven Ruiz previously pointed out - the defense is incredibly effective but a bit unwatchable.\n\nBut that's not what had college basketball fans riled up during the game. Unless they were rooting for Duke, an enormous group of fans were appalled that the Blue Devils slapped the floor in the first half while in their zone defense.\n\nSlapping the floor is a decades-old tradition with Duke's defense - though it is occasionally mocked - and even when other teams imitate the move, the Blue Devils still come to mind. However, it's not often acceptable while in a zone.\n\nIn a 2015 New York Times story published days before Mike Krzyzewski led his team to the national championship, then-freshman Grayson Allen explained:\n\n\"You can't be weak when you do it. You've got to be strong. It's that thing where you're showing the other team, like, Look, we're here, we're ready to get a stop - and you're and the teammates behind you - like, Let's get a stop.\"\n\nWell, when the Blue Devils slapped the floor against Syracuse while in a 2-3 zone, some people (read: Duke fans) were pumped about it. But a lot of fans roasted the team for it - although they noted it was a quintessential Duke thing to do.\n\nMORE:\n\nWendy's released a surprisingly solid rap mixtape and ravaged McDonald's\n\nMike Bibby plays a game of 21 under a pseudonym, schools opponents\n\nESPN's Zach Lowe says Kevin Love gives the Cavs an 'unstoppable' lineup\n\nCurler Matt Hamilton hasn't heard from Aaron Rodgers since the Olympics ended",

                "body": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Kyle Connor scored 3:16 into overtime and the Winnipeg Jets edged the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 on Friday night to set a single-season franchise record for points.\n\nMark Scheifele and Nikolaj Ehlers also scored for the Jets (45-19-10), who won their fourth straight to reach the 100-point plateau for the first time. Winnipeg had 99 points in the 2014-15 season before being swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Ducks.\n\nThe game was the second straight in which Connor scored the overtime winner. The rookie had both goals in Winnipeg's 2-1 win over Los Angeles on Tuesday night.\n\nScheifele had the second of his two assists in the game on Connor's shot that beat John Gibson to win it. Blake Wheeler also finished with two assists as the Jets remained unbeaten on their six-game homestand (4-0-0).\n\nNick Ritchie tied it at 2 for Anaheim at 10:17 of the third period. He went in alone on Connor Hellebuyck, who squeezed his pads on the shot, but the puck dropped under him and went over the goal line. Derek Grant also scored for Anaheim, which had its four-game win streak end.\n\nWinnipeg had outshot the visitors 41-16 heading into overtime.\n\nHellebuyck made 16 saves for Winnipeg to pick up his 38th win of the season. Gibson kept his team in the game with some big saves, stopping 39 shots for Anaheim.\n\nWinnipeg had second-year star Patrik Laine back in its lineup. He left Tuesday's game early in the second period after blocking a shot with his left foot. The initial prognosis for the soft-tissue bruise was he'd miss Friday's game and likely Sunday's, but Laine participated in the morning skate and was deemed good to go.\n\nAnaheim used its first power play of the game to go up 1-0 as Grant deflected in a shot by Hampus Lindholm with 14 seconds left in a high-sticking penalty to Joel Armia. Winnipeg responded just 55 seconds later when Ehlers scored his 28th goal of the season with a toe drag and high wrister that beat Gibson at 6:46.\n\nScheifele picked up the primary assist, extending his points streak to three games since returning from an injury that kept him out for five. Wheeler notched his 63rd assist on the play, stretching his point streak to five games.\n\nThe Jets swarmed Gibson for most of the period, outshooting the Ducks 17-4.\n\nWinnipeg went ahead 45 seconds into the second after Wheeler did some nifty stick-handling around Ducks defenseman Cam Fowler, then passed it back for Scheifele, who fired a shot in over Gibson's blocker.\n\nNOTES: Veteran Winnipeg defenseman Toby Enstrom left the game with a lower-body injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDucks: at Edmonton on Sunday.\n\nJets: hosts Central Division-leading Nashville on Sunday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Jordin Canada scored 22 points, putting second-seeded UCLA on her back in the fourth quarter, and the Bruins beat Texas 84-75 on Friday night to avenge a Sweet 16 loss to the Longhorns two years ago.\n\nMonique Billings added 17 points and Kennedy Burke had 15 for the Bruins (27-7). They finally made it to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament after falling a game short the past two seasons.\n\nThey'll face top-seeded Mississippi State on Sunday night for their first Final Four trip.\n\nAriel Atkins had 20 points and Jatarie White had 17 for the No. 3 seed Longhorns (28-7), who kept falling into deep holes, slowly digging their way out and then letting UCLA pull away once more.\n\nTexas made one last charge when it got back-to-back 3-pointers from Atkins and Alecia Sutton to close within 76-72 with less than 2 minutes left. But Burke answered with a layup for UCLA, and Canada's jumper with just under a minute to go helped put the game away.\n\nUCLA wound up shooting 56.3 percent from the field in the second half.\n\nThe Bruins forged a 19-11 lead after the first quarter, then used their speed and athleticism to create turnovers and coast to easy layups to keep the Longhorns at bay.\n\nBillings had 11 points at halftime, when UCLA had a 39-31 lead.\n\nIt was Texas that came out roaring in the second half, though. Ariel Atkins began the charge with a 3-pointer, Brooke McCarty scored back-to-back baskets, and by the time UCLA coach Cori Close called a timeout the lead her team spent the first half building had been wiped away.\n\nThe Bruins eventually calmed down, and they proceeded to rip off a 17-4 run to end the third quarter. They forced three turnovers in a span of four possessions at one point, and were helped along by wild shots that McCarty and the rest of the Longhorns were forced to put up.\n\nIt was 59-49 at the start of the fourth quarter, and the Longhorns quickly closed to within six points, only for the lead to spool out once more. Canada scored seven straight for the Bruins at one point, then contributed to every crucial play down the stretch.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nUCLA's best NCAA Tournament finish was its Elite Eight trip in 1999. The Bruins can top that by knocking off the Bulldogs, who breezed past fourth-seeded North Carolina State on Friday night.\n\nTexas was sloppy the entire game, committing 21 turnovers that often led to easy run-outs. The Longhorns wound up getting outscored 31-13 in points-off-turnovers and 17-6 on the break.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Bruins will face Mississippi State, the national runners-up a year ago, on Sunday night for a spot in the Final Four in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Canelo Alvarez suspension boosts intrigue in Gennady Golovkin boxing rematch",
                "body": "CLOSE\n\nCanelo Alvarez tested positive for clenbuterol in trace amounts his team says are consistent with meat contamination that has impacted athletes in Mexico and China. Time Sports\n\nIt reads like a recipe for disaster: ahead of boxing's most-anticipated bout of 2018, one fighter, Canelo Alvarez, submits two positive tests for a banned substance. His opponent, Gennady Golovkin, promptly casts him as a long-term drug cheat. And, on Friday, Nevada athletic officials suspend Alvarez until he can answer why he failed the tests.\n\nAll this just weeks before the fight scheduled for May 5.\n\nYet this is boxing and thus all is not as it seems. While it would be easy to assume the lingering controversy is the worst fate that could have befallen the rematch between Alvarez and Golovkin following last September's disputed draw, it may be anything but.\n\nControversy does not equal apathy, and while it is not for reasons the promoters of the fight would like, the fact remains that the contest and its combatants are in the news six weeks before they are due to touch gloves in Las Vegas.\n\nThat wasn't the case the last time they fought. Last summer, boxing's chatter centered solely around the impending exhibition match-up between Floyd Mayweather and Ultimate Fighting Championship star Conor McGregor.\n\nMayweather vs. McGregor was a pure cash grab that carried far less appeal to the average boxing fan than Alvarez and Golovkin's scrap, yet the Mexican and the man from Kazakhstan struggled to register a blip on the mainstream media until the \"Money Fight\" was done.\n\nBy then, there was little time left to add weight to the promotional campaign and the pocketbooks of many casual potential observers already had been drained of nearly $100 by Mayweather's victory a month earlier.\n\nWhich is why Golden Boy Promotions chief Oscar De La Hoya and Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler may not exactly be devastated by the ongoing events regarding Alvarez's sample that registered trace amounts of Clenbuterol, even though it does nothing for the reputation of either Alvarez or his sport. In this instance, at least, there may be no such thing as bad publicity.\n\nMore: Gennady Golovkin accuses Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez of being long-term drug cheat\n\nMore: Canelo, Golovkin each vow to win rematch of their memorable draw\n\nTo break things down, Alvarez, a former two-weight world champion, formally was sanctioned by the Nevada Athletic Commission on Friday.\n\n\"Mr. Alvarez is temporarily suspended for his adverse analytical finding, and an April 10 meeting with the Nevada Athletic Commission will fully address this adverse analytical finding,\" commission executive director Bob Bennett told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn truth, the temporary sanction means nothing. Alvarez obviously was not going to fight competitively before April 10 and nothing in the decision stops him from training as usual.\n\nThe only action that could harm Alvarez, financially and professionally, would be if the commission ruled that he would be banned from the fight. The outcome of that remains to be seen, although Alvarez has claimed that the levels of Clenbuterol in his system were small enough to be consistent with the consumption of tainted meat.\n\nSeveral Mexican athletes previously have tested positive for Clenbuterol, a steroid regularly administered to Mexican cattle. It is a banned substance forathletes as it can increase stamina.\n\nRealistically, it would be a major surprise if the fight was called off, given the amount of money at stake. Even Golovkin, who fiercely criticized Alvarez and directly accused him of \"cheating\" on Tuesday, wants it to take place so that he can claim a likely career-best payday.\n\nThe fight sold 1.3 million pay-per-view buys the first time, and given the level of action and entertainment provided, could comfortably surpass that figure the second time around.\n\nIf the bout takes place.\n\nNext month's hearing will determine that, but until then Alvarez's fate will remain boxing's most newsworthy topic, and - appropriate or not - interest in the fight will only increase.\n\nFollow Rogers on Twitter @RogersJourno\n\nPHOTOS: BEST FROM GOLOVKIN-ALVAREZ I\n\nBest from Gennady Golovkin-Canelo Alvarez fight Fullscreen Gennady Golovkin (green trunks) celebrates after his middleweight championship bout against Canelo Alvarez (not pictured) at T-Mobile Arena.

                "body": "ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Patrik Berglund scored twice and the surging St. Louis Blues beat the Vancouver Canucks 4-1 on Friday night for their fourth consecutive victory.\n\nVladimir Tarasenko and Dmitrij Jaskin also scored for St. Louis. Jake Allen made 19 saves in his eighth straight start as the Blues won for the sixth time in seven games.\n\nSam Gagner scored for Vancouver, which has lost eight of nine. Anders Nilsson stopped 21 shots.\n\nThe Blues swept the season series and have won their last five games against the Canucks.\n\nTarasenko extended the lead to 3-1 just 14 seconds into the third period, slipping Jaden Schwartz's pass between Nilsson's legs. Tarasenko missed the previous two games with an upper-body injury.\n\nJaskin's sixth goal of the season with 2:29 left sealed it for St. Louis.\n\nBerglund gave the Blues a 1-0 lead 40 seconds into the game, beating Nilsson with a backhand over his right shoulder. It was Berglund's second goal in three games.\n\nAllen made the early goal stand up as the Blues were outshot 12-4 in the first period. Allen made four saves during a 45-second stretch of sustained pressure midway through the period as St. Louis failed to register a shot on goal for the final 13:09 of the opening frame.\n\nBerglund made it 2-0 with a short-handed goal at 4:46 of the second, cashing in on a strong effort by Kyle Brodziak to chip the puck out and spring Berglund on an odd-man rush. It was just the fifth short-handed goal this season for St. Louis and the ninth allowed by Vancouver.\n\nGagner snapped a 25-game goal drought, firing in a one-timer off a pass from Henrik Sedin with 5:13 left in the second to cut the Canucks' deficit to 2-1.\n\nThe Blues played most of the game with just five defensemen after Carl Gunnarsson left in the first period with a lower-body injury and did not return.\n\nNOTES: Canucks forward Daniel Sedin played in his 1,299th career game, and his assist on Gagner's goal gave him 50 points for the 11th time. . Blues D Robert Bortuzzo was fined $3,091.40, the maximum allowed under the collective bargaining agreement, for a cross-checking penalty on Bruins forward Jordan Szwarz in the first period Wednesday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCanucks: At the Dallas Stars on Sunday.\n\nBlues: At the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore NHL hockey: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A Border Patrol agent stayed on the bus to keep an eye on the driver along the way, McClellan said.\n\nAnother passenger on the bus, Philip Hurd, told CBS11 in Dallas on Thursday that people started to worry after the bus began swerving and they noticed the driver trying to stay awake.\n\n\"We would go over the white line and everybody would be like, 'Wake up,' and she had tweezers she was poking herself with,\" Hurd told the television station. \"It got to the point where we had to raise our voice, 'Pull over, we have children on this bus, pull over.' \"\n\nPassengers told CBS11 they were escorted to a safe location by U.S. Border Patrol agents and a new driver was assigned.\n\nWarning: Profanity in video.\n\nThe bus finally arrived seven hours late in Dallas.

                "body": "SportsPulse: After some stunning results in Thursday's Sweet 16 games, the Elite Eight is beginning to take shape. USA TODAY Sports\n\nA day after a No. 3 seed, two No. 9 seeds and a No. 11 seed advanced to the Elite Eight, Friday's Sweet 16 games provided us with a familiar dose of chalk.\n\nNo. 1 seeds Kansas and Villanova both took care of business to reach the Elite Eight, and are one win away from getting to San Antonio -- where they were expected to be heading into the NCAA tournament. While top overall No. 1 Virginia lost in a historic upset to UMBC and the worst of the No. 1s, Xavier, was upset by Florida State, we still have two kingpin teams dancing that are very much our title favorites.\n\nThat's a conclusion that's not just based on KU and 'Nova being the top remaining seeds here in March. It's based on how strong they looked in their Sweet 16 games Friday, and their ability to weather enough storms to be in position for Final Four berths.\n\nVILLANOVA: Wildcats fend off off physical, pressing West Virginia reac Elite 8\n\nKANSAS: Jayhawks on to third consecutive Elite 8 after defeat of Clemson\n\nFor Villanova, its Sweet 16 test against a physical, pressing West Virginia team showed an ability to flip the switch and pull away with its potent offense after playing out of sync for a half. That came in the form of an 11-0 run that West Virginia never recovered from. Usually a dynamic offense in the halfcourt, the Wildcats proved they can light it up -- at the rate of 54% from three -- in a sped up pace, too. The unsung hero was big man Omari Spellman, who had 18 points and two huge blocks and three-pointers. It's those type of performances from role players that define NCAA championship teams.\n\nFor Kansas, a team that's now reached three consecutive Elite Eights and has been knocking on the Final Four wall for too long, its Sweet 16 win over Clemson was the best performance of the tournament and one that reminds us how good Bill Self's team is. This is the Big 12 regular season and tournament champs, a group that plays with a necessary edge due to lack of interior firepower it's had in the past.\n\nWhat a start to the second half for @KUHoops!\n\nJayhawks jump out to a 9-0 run and lead by 20. #MarchMadnesspic.twitter.com/qDmfEI2zok -- NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nKU's Sweet 16 showdown with Clemson was all about the first big blow it threw at the Tigers to build a 17-point lead. That aggressiveness from the get-go put the game out of reach early. Clemson came back, but KU never trailed nor was really threatened. Credit the win to a solid 46% shooting from beyond the arc. We can make all the points we want about Kansas' reliance on perimeter shooting, but even on a night where top catalyst Devonte' Graham goes 4-for-11 from the field, the Jayhawks rarely go cold and the balanced scoring was indicative of that on Friday.\n\nMalik Newman's breakout performances in the NCAAs couldn't have come at a better time. Then factor in the key play of Udoka Azubuike (14 points and 11 rebounds), who has been the X-Factor in the Clemson win and Seton Hall second round win.\n\nBoth these No. 1 seeds have two of the best players in the whole tournament in Brunson, the national player of the year, and Graham, the Big 12 player of the year. Especially because they are point guards who create so much for their teammates, if one of these teams win the national title it will have so much to do with the lead guards. Brunson was particularly impressive in the Wildcats' victory, finishing with 27 points and willing his team to victory with his playmaking.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE NCAA TOURNAMENT'S SWEET 16\n\n2018 NCAA tournament: Best of the Sweet 16 Fullscreen Villanova guards Phil Booth (5) and Donte DiVincenzo (10) celebrate after defeating West Virginia to reach the Elite Eight.

Police say they believe he was armed, but he was holding a cellphone.\n\nProtests in Sacramento shut down I-5 during rush hour Thursday and delayed the start of the Kings-Atlanta Hawks game.

                "body": "YORK, Pa. -- Should schools arm teachers against school shooters?\n\nIt's a question that lawmakers are debating across the nation. But one Pennsylvania district has another solution, which it says serves as a last resort in the case of an armed intruder:\n\nHow about arming students with rocks?\n\nDavid Helsel, superintendent of the Blue Mountain School District in rural Schuylkill County, testified earlier this month before the state House Education committee, saying arming students with rocks is a part of the district's strategy to protect them against the threat of violence.\n\n\"We always strive to find new ways to keep our students safe,\" Helsel told The Associated Press in a telephone interview, adding that the rocks are one small part of the district's overall security plan.\n\nMore: Mostly sunny skies, cool temps predicted for Saturday's March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C.\n\nMore: Here's why you'll see evil eye gloves at the March for Our Lives\n\nStaff and students in the Blue Mountain district have been trained in a program called \"ALICE,\" which stands for alert, lockdown, inform, counter and evacuate. As part of the program, he said, every classroom has a 5-gallon bucket of rocks that students could use to \"stone\" a school shooter, if need be.\n\nThe district has about 2,700 students at three elementary schools, a middle school and a high school.\n\nDuring his House testimony on March 15, Helsel was asked if slingshots are allowed to help the students pummel the intruder.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"We have some people who have some pretty good arms. They can chuck a rock pretty fast.\"\n\nHe went on to say the process of equipping the rooms with rocks was \"pretty easy\" and involved a dump truck and a landscaper.\n\nIn the end, he said, the rocks are \"nice, they're smooth, and you can really hurtle them pretty quickly, and hard.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Harold English is on board with the plan.\n\n\"I commend your practical thinking,\" he said.\n\nOn the larger issue of arming teachers, Helsel said his district would not arm teachers, although some maintenance staff serve a duel role, including being armed security.",

                "body": "CHICAGO (AP) -- Shabazz Muhammad scored 21 points and the Milwaukee Bucks overcame another sluggish start to beat the Chicago Bulls 118-105 on Friday night.\n\nMilwaukee star swingman Giannis Antetokounmpo missed the game because of a sprained right ankle.\n\nFormer Bull Tony Snell added 18 points, and Brandon Jennings had 16 points and five assists to help the Bucks (38-34) move within a half-game of the seventh-place Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference playoff race. On a night when only one Bucks starter scored in double figures, Muhammad, Snell and Jennings came up big off the bench.\n\nDenzel Valentine led Chicago with 20 points, and Cameron Payne had 17 points and six assists. The Bulls have lost four in a row.\n\nThe lottery-bound Bulls led by as much as 32-20 in the first quarter. Jennings had 10 points and three assists in the second period, which the Bucks opened with a 14-3 spurt for a 38-37 lead.\n\nSnell scored eight points in the third period, which saw the Bucks extend their lead to 90-82.\n\nLate starts and shoddy defense plagued Milwaukee in recent games, and this one was no different.\n\nThe Bulls connected on five of their first seven field goal tries to take a 15-4 lead less than four minutes into the game. They took a 34-24 advantage into the second period before the Bucks bench swung the momentum.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nBucks: The 3-point and paint areas have been the root of their problems on defense of late. At the start of the day, they ranked 23rd in opponents' 3-point percentage and 24th in defensive rebounding percentage this month. ... G Matthew Dellavedova reported improvement in his sprained right ankle but there remained no timetable for his return.\n\nBulls: Rookie F Lauri Markkanen shook off some pre-game back stiffness and started after a five-game absence. F Paul Zipser (sore right foot) was unavailable. ... G Antonio Blakeney (fractured left wrist) will sit out the rest of the season.\n\nNEXT MAN UP\n\nThe Bucks were optimistic that Antetokounmpo's injury would not complicate their playoff run.\n\n\"I can't give you an honest answer and say exactly when he's coming back, but I believe it will be sooner rather than later,\" interim coach Joe Prunty said. \"I don't think it's worthwhile speculating at this time.\"\n\nMORE AIR TIME\n\nAntetokounmpo will be featured on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday. The segment will trace his unlikely rise from a gangly kid in Athens, Greece, to a 23-year-old NBA franchise player.\n\nRAMBLER MAN\n\nBulls coach Fred Hoiberg was among the legion of Chicago area fans who had a rooting interest in NCAA Tournament game between the hometown Loyola and Kansas State, led by Bruce Weber, the onetime Illinois boss.\n\n\"Loyola is just so much fun to watch right now with all the different storylines,\" Hoiberg said. \"Knowing Bruce, I know he's going to put a great game plan together. It should be an exciting game, but I gotta go for the Ramblers.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBucks: Host Spurs on Sunday.\n\nBulls: Visit Pistons on Saturday night.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Clippers are now three games behind Utah for the final postseason spot in the Western Conference. Utah was playing later Friday.\n\nLou Williams led Los Angeles with 27 points and DeAndre Jordan finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds as the Clippers lost for the fifth time in six games.\n\nThey certainly had a chance to turn things around.\n\nAfter the Clippers rallied from an 18-point deficit to take an 88-87 lead with 7:36 left in the fourth quarter, the teams traded the lead 10 times before Victor Oladipo made one of two free throws to leave it tied at 100 with 2:17 to play.\n\nBogdanovic broke the tie with a 12-footer and the Pacers followed that with seven straight points before Williams made a layup with 12 seconds left to end the run.\n\nThe Clippers were making shots early but couldn't pull away from Indiana.\n\nThey led 28-27 after one and allowed Indiana to use a 9-2 spurt midway through the second quarter to erase a six-point deficit and take a 40-39 lead.\n\nThe Pacers scored the final five points of the half to break a 53-all tie and broke it open early in the third when Oladipo made his first three shots of the game, including two 3-pointers to make it 66-55.\n\nIndiana then poured it on. Thaddeus Young's layup with 9:02 left in the third made it a 12-point game. Milos Teodosic's basket briefly halted the run, but the Pacers scored the next nine points to make it 75-57 with 6:19 to go.\n\nLos Angeles closed the third quarter on a 12-5 run to get to 82-76.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nClippers: Have lost three straight in the series. ... Coach Doc Rivers called two timeouts during a 13-second span in the third quarter and was clearly upset that his team wasn't running whatever he called during the first timeout. ... Tobias Harris had 18 points, Montrezl Harrell wound up with 16, and Teodosic and Austin Rivers each had 10.\n\nPacers: Oladipo missed all seven of his shots in the first half, wound up 4 of 16 from the field and still had 18 points. He also had two steals, giving him at least one in 56 consecutive games. Oladipo broke a tie with Chris Paul and Gary Payton for the sixth-longest streak in NBA history. ... Darren Collison had 13 points and 10 assists.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nClippers: Finish a four-game road trip Sunday in Toronto.\n\nPacers: Host the Miami Heat on Sunday before starting a four-game West Coast swing.\n\n___\n\nMore AP basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Hall's winner lifts Devils past Penguins 4-3 in overtime",
                "body": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Taylor Hall beat Matt Murray on a breakaway 27 seconds into overtime to lift the New Jersey Devils to a 4-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Friday night.\n\nHall was all alone when Nico Hischier found him with a long lead pass. Hall then slipped the puck between Murray's legs for his 33rd goal of the season as New Jersey picked up two vital points in the race for one of the two wild-card spots in the Eastern Conference.\n\nHall added two assists for New Jersey. Hischier finished with a goal and an assist, and Blake Coleman and Will Butcher also scored for the Devils. Keith Kincaid made 40 stops for the Devils, who finished a season-high six-game road trip 4-2.\n\nSidney Crosby scored his 25th of the season for Pittsburgh. Brian Dumolin and Phil Kessel scored in the third period as the Penguins erased a two-goal deficit. Murray finished with 30 saves as the Penguins lost for just the second time in their last 17 home games.\n\nNew Jersey's drive to end a six-year playoff drought has stalled since the All-Star break. A lopsided loss in San Jose dropped the Devils to just 13-12 since Jan. 30 and skated onto the ice at PPG Paints Arena with a tenuous grasp on the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nYet whatever issues the Devils have seem to disappear when they play the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions. New Jersey is 3-0 against Pittsburgh this season and recovered after being dominated early by the Penguins. Crosby gave Pittsburgh a quick lead by slamming home a rebound 2:29 into the game -- a far cry from the highlight double-tap he flicked to key a victory over Montreal on Wednesday.\n\nButcher's sizzling wrist shot from above the left circle 5:15 into the second tied it. When the Penguins failed to convert a 3-on-1, Coleman countered by holding off Pittsburgh's forward Derick Brassard with his left hand and flicking a backhand by Murray with his right just over 2 minutes later to put New Jersey in front. Just over 90 seconds later, the Devils pushed their lead to 3-1 when Hischier flipped a centering pass into an open net.\n\nPittsburgh recovered thanks to a spark from an unlikely source: Dumoulin. The defenseman blasted a shot from the point 3:13 into the third for his fifth goal of the season, matching his career total coming into the year. Kessel's 30th evened it, but Kincaid played brilliantly late to force overtime, when Hall won it.\n\nNOTES: New Jersey F Miles Wood missed his second straight game with an upper-body injury. ... Penguins D Justin Schultz's 400th NHL game ended early. He left in the third period after slamming into the boards. ... Hall (81 points) is the first New Jersey player to reach the 80-point plateau since Ilya Kovalchuk in 2011-12. ... Pittsburgh F Dominik Simon played 5:39 in his return after sitting out six games with a lower-body injury. ... Linesman Tony Sericolo left early in the first period with an injury, but returned at the start of the second.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDevils: Begin a four-game homestand Saturday when they host Atlantic Division-leading Tampa Bay.\n\nPenguins: Go for the season sweep of cross-state rival Philadelphia when the Flyers visit Sunday. The Penguins won the first three meetings by a combined score of 15-7.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The matchup also included some jaw-dropping blocks.\n\nMountaineers forward Sagaba Konate kept several Wildcats points off the board with big blocks throughout the game. But as the midway point in the second half approached, he went up for an incredible monster block to keep the No. 1 seed from tying the score at 52.\n\nWildcats guard Mikal Bridges soared for a poster dunk, and Konate pulled a volleyball move with his stunning defense.\n\nBut Villanova responded with a pair key blocks of its own coming from forward Omari Spellman.\n\nAs West Virginia's James Bolden went up for what seemed like a relatively easy couple points, he didn't even get close to the basket as Spellman powerfully swatted the ball back down, and he scored on the other end off the putback.\n\nThe two teams combined for five blocks in the first half and pushed into the double digits as the regulation clock counted down.\n\nVillanova advanced to the Elite Eight and will play the winner of Texas Tech-Purdue.\n\nMORE:\n\nWendy's released a surprisingly solid rap mixtape and ravaged McDonald's\n\nESPN's Zach Lowe says Kevin Love gives the Cavs an 'unstoppable' lineup\n\nSteph Curry wore Kentucky jersey at Warriors practice after losing NCAA tournament bet\n\nMike Bibby plays a game of 21 under a pseudonym, schools opponents",

                "body": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Antti Niemi stopped 35 shots for his first shutout in 27 months, and the Montreal Canadiens snapped a seven-game road skid with a 3-0 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Friday night.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen scored the go-ahead goal by converting a puck that bounced off the end boards 4:56 into the second period. Former Sabres forward Paul Byron and Brendan Gallagher then scored empty-net goals 22 seconds apart in the final 1:15 to seal the win.\n\nMontreal had lost its past four overall and gone 0-5-2 on the road since a 6-3 win at the New York Islanders on March 2.\n\nNiemi improved to 6-8-4 since being claimed by Montreal after being waived by Florida in mid-November. The shutout was the 36th of his career but first since a 20-save performance in the Dallas Stars' 4-0 win over Chicago on Dec. 22, 2015.\n\nThe Sabres closed their six-game homestand at 1-4-1, which included a 4-1 loss on Wednesday to Arizona, the Western Conference's last-place team. The Sabres' league-worst home record dropped to 11-22-5, and they must win their final two home games to avoid setting a franchise low for fewest wins in an 82-game season (13-21-7, in 2012-13).\n\nSabres rookie Linus Ullmark allowed one goal on the 22 shots he faced.\n\nBuffalo lost to a Canadiens opponent that is now tied with Arizona with the NHL's fewest road wins (10) and has scored a league-low 85 goals on the road.\n\nMontreal was being outshot 10-3 through the first 15 minutes and yet struck first on Lehkonen's goal 4:56 into the second period.\n\nAlex Galchenyuk's shot from the left circle was blocked in front, and the puck dribbled to Jacob de la Rose, who snapped a shot just wide of the net from the slot. The puck struck the boards and to Lehkonen, who flipped it in above Ullmark's out-stretched right leg.\n\nThe Sabres had their chances, including failing to score during a two-man advantage spanning 1:06 after Lehkonen was penalized for tripping 6:53 into the third period.\n\nBuffalo's best chance came a minute later when Ryan O'Reilly was facing an open net when set up alone just above the right post. O'Reilly, however, was unable to control the puck and failed to off a shot.\n\nScott Wilson had Niemi beat, but his shot from the left circle struck the crossbar 13 minutes into the game.\n\nSam Reinhart was set up alone in front but robbed by Niemi on a chance with 4:15 left in the second period. Some 20 seconds later, O'Reilly slipped a pass into the crease from behind the net, but Reinhart was unable to get a shot off.\n\nNOTES: Sabres C Zemgus Girgensons returned after missing two games with an undisclosed injury. ... After opening the season with a 3-2 shootout win at Buffalo, the Canadiens proceeded to go 0-6-1 in their next seven. ... Before the game, the Sabres honored Luke McDermott and Adam Page, two local members the United States gold-medal-winning Paralympic hockey team.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCanadiens: Host Washington Capitals on Saturday.\n\nSabres: At New York Rangers on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore NHL hockey: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- For the second consecutive season, the San Francisco Giants will be without injured ace Madison Bumgarner for a while.\n\nBumgarner broke a bone in his pitching hand Friday when it was hit by a line drive off the bat of Kansas City's Whit Merrifield during a spring training game.\n\nThe Giants said X-rays showed the 28-year-old fractured the fifth metacarpal on the outside of his left hand. Bumgarner said the timeline for recovery is four to six weeks and he will have a pin inserted into his pinkie Saturday.\n\n\"It's tough. But I can handle it,\" Bumgarner said. \"These guys can handle it. This obviously was not what I was expecting out of my last start. But it happened and I can deal with it.\"\n\nBumgarner, the 2014 World Series MVP, missed nearly three months with a shoulder injury last season after a dirt bike accident on April 20 during an off day in Colorado.\n\nHis latest setback is a huge blow to the Giants as they try to rebound from a surprising last-place finish in the NL West with 98 losses.\n\n\"It's just a downer. This was a short day. I feel for him,\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \"Obviously, we know what he means to us, but where he was, how well he's thrown the ball all spring. Unfortunately, you've got to deal with these things. But this one certainly was a downer today because we were all getting ready to go to San Francisco and now we've got to make some adjustments.\"\n\nAfter six straight seasons with double-digit wins, more than 200 innings and 30-plus starts, Bumgarner went 4-9 with a 3.32 ERA in 17 starts last season and threw just 111 innings.\n\nBochy wasn't ready to say whether right-hander Johnny Cueto would move into the No. 1 spot and pitch Thursday's opener at the NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers. Jeff Samardzija has a strained pectoral muscle that will shut him down for at least a week and likely force him to start the season on the disabled list.\n\n\"This is horrible news for us,\" Bochy said. \"There's nothing else we can do now except push on.\"\n\nCheslor Cuthbert hit a solo home run off Bumgarner and had four hits. Pablo Sandoval hit his third homer for the Giants.\n\nELSEWHERE AROUND THE GRAPEFRUIT AND CACTUS LEAGUES\n\nDODGERS 10, ROYALS (SS) 0\n\nClayton Kershaw stretched his scoreless streak to 21 1/3 innings with 6 2/3 innings in his final tuneup for Thursday's opener against San Francisco. He allowed a leadoff single to Jon Jay and no other hits. He struck out four and walked none in his first appearance since turning 30 on Monday. Ricky Nolasco, who signed with Kansas City on March 7, allowed eight runs, five hits and two walks over 2 2/3 innings in his first start.\n\nRED SOX 5, YANKEES 0\n\nAaron Judge hit leadoff for the first time in his professional career and went 1 for 4. Masahiro Tanaka gave up one run and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. Boston's Sam Travis hit his sixth home run and Ivan De Jesus Jr. had three hits, including a home run.\n\nCARDINALS 5, METS 1\n\nMichael Conforto went 1 for 4 as a designated hitter on his first big league game action since surgery Sept. 6 to repair a tear in the posterior capsule in his left shoulder.\n\nPHILLIES 8, PIRATES 2\n\nMaikel Franco hit a two-run homer and a grand slam after entering with a .167 average in 48 at-bats. Aaron Nola allowed four hits in his last outing before his first opening-day start, at Cincinnati.\n\nORIOLES 6, RAYS (SS) 1\n\nBaltimore opening-day starter Dylan Bundy yielded one run and five hits in five innings, and Chris Davis and Trey Mancini hit two-run homers. Kean Wong, a brother of Cardinals second baseman Kolten Wong, had a pair of hits for the Rays.\n\nRAYS (SS) 6, BLUE JAYS 5\n\nBlue Jays starter J.A. Happ allowed two hits in four scoreless innings. C.J. Cron had three hits, and Rays closer Alex Colome fanned one in a perfect sixth.\n\nTIGERS 11, BRAVES 3\n\nJames McCann doubled twice and drove in five runs. Detroit's Norris gave up three runs -- two earned -- three hits and four walks in five innings. Anibal Sanchez made his second start for Atlanta, allowing three runs and seven hits in five innings. Freddie Freeman hit his second homer.\n\nASTROS (SS) 2, TWINS 2\n\nRyan LaMarre's double leading off the ninth inning was the first hit for Minnesota and Tanner English followed his first homer. J.D. Davis hit a pair of solo homers, raising his total to five.\n\nROCKIES 8, REDS 2\n\nHomer Bailey, picked to start the Reds' opener, allowed consecutive homers in the fourth to Nolan Arenado and Carlos Gonzalez. Bailey, limited to 26 starts over the past three seasons because of injuries to his forearm and elbow, gave up three runs and eight hits in five innings.\n\nATHLETICS 4, ANGELS 2\n\nAlbert Pujols hit his first spring training homer for Los Angeles. Jake Smolinski finished a single shy of hitting for the cycle for Oakland.\n\nCUBS 4, BREWERS 3\n\nIan Happ hit his sixth homer. Tyler Chatwood allowed two runs, six hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings and also hit an RBI double.\n\nMARINERS 5, WHITE SOX 5,\n\nJames Shields struck out three in three shutout innings. Dan Vogelbach hit his sixth homer, Kirk Nieuwenhuis hit a two-run homer and pinch-hitter Craig Dedelow had a tying three-run drive in the eighth.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nBOSTON -- Jalen Brunson scored 27 and Omari Spellman had two big blocks and a dunk as top-seeded Villanova rallied to beat West Virginia 90-78 on Friday night and advance to the Elite Eight.\n\nWhat happened: Villanova struggled mightily against Press Virginia, and the Mountaineers seemed to be on the verge of taking control midway through the second half. But Brunson showed why he's a leading contender for Player of the Year honors, making a free throw and converting a three-point play to spark a 10-0 run that gave the Wildcats a 65-60 lead with 9:03 to play.\n\nKey moments: West Virginia's press gets most of the attention - and rightly so - but the Battle of the Big Men was the most intriguing matchup of the game. Sagaba Konate's thunderous block on Mikal Bridges with 13:22 left to play energized the Mountaineers, who got quick 3s from Esa Ahmad and James Bolden. A steal and layup by Jevon Carter gave the Mountaineers a 60-54 lead, their largest of the game.\n\nThese Cats are CLUTCH! ὄc\n\nNova extends the lead to 10 with 2:12 to go!#MarchMadness#Sweet16pic.twitter.com/6WgCyJPQpF -- NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nBut Spellman was every bit as dangerous around the basket as Konate. His block of a Bolden shot could be heard clear at the other end of the floor, and he came flying in to slam home a Phil Booth miss at the other end of the floor for the 65-60 lead.\n\nA Teddy Allen basket made it a one-possession game again, but Spellman blocked a Carter shot. Donte DiVincenzo made a 3-pointer following the 8-minute media timeout, and the Wildcats cruised from there.\n\nWhat's next? Villanova will play the winner of Texas Tech-Purdue on Sunday afternoon for a spot in the Final Four. It's the second Elite Eight appearance in three years for Villanova, which went on to win the national title in 2016.\n\nTHE GREAT WALL OF KONATE!!! ᾑaὣ1#MarchMadness#Sweet16pic.twitter.com/LHDxxShQkA -- NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SWEET 16\n\n2018 NCAA tournament: Best of the Sweet 16 Fullscreen Kansas State Wildcats guard Barry Brown (5) celebrates with fans after defeating the Kentucky Wildcats.

But even they might not have been able to stop the Suns from losing for the 25th time in 27 games.\n\nTroy Daniels scored 20 points, and Marquese Chriss had 19 to pace Phoenix.\n\nSeemingly disinterested early on, the Cavs found themselves trailing 30-23 after one quarter. But after missing their first seven 3-pointers, the Cavs found their range and knocked down four long shots in a row -- including a 28-footer by Love -- and went on a 32-7 run.\n\nThe Cavs outscored the Suns 39-18 in the second quarter, pushed their lead to 30 in the third and coasted to their seventh straight win over Phoenix.\n\nAlthough Nance Jr. was back, Cavs acting coach Larry Drew, sitting in while Tyronn Lue is away dealing with health issues, stuck with his same starting lineup. That could change in the days ahead as Cleveland tinkers with a team that has only been at full strength for one game all season.\n\nNance Jr. finished with 15 points and 10rebounds in 22 minutes. Hood had nine points in 21 minutes and Thompson nine rebounds in 16 minutes.\n\nNAP TIME\n\nJames religiously takes naps as part of his pregame routine. His plan for Friday was to wake up while his alma mater, St. Vincent-St. Mary, was playing in a state semifinal game. He got up earlier than expected.\n\n\"Well guess what, the inner #IrishPride woke me up 2 mins before tipoff anyways! Let's go Irish,\" James tweeted.\n\nThe Fighting Irish advanced with a win over Lexington. James joked that when he's getting ready to sleep, nothing stops him.\n\n\"It's really only my kids who can cut into my nap time, my wife as well, my mom if something is really needed,\" he said. \"They know once I go into that bedroom, it's really zero dark thirty. Leave me alone.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSuns: Booker, who has missed three straight games, tested his hand during pregame warmups before deciding not to play. The issue is more with him catching the ball than shooting. ... Warren has missed two games in a row and is unlikely to play Saturday. He's averaging 19.6 points. .... Veteran C Tyson Chandler has been limited to 46 games because of injuries and will be used sparingly over the final two weeks. \"We talked about his overall health more than anything,\" interim head coach Jay Triano said. \"He still practices, but he's obviously he's not 100 percent so it doesn't make sense to play him.\"\n\nCavaliers: James has scored at least 10 points in 863 straight games, three shy of tying Michael Jordan's NBA record. James is in line to tie the mark on Wednesday in Charlotte, potentially with Jordan in attendance. ... F Jeff Green left with an illness after playing seven minutes in the first quarter and didn't return. ... Drew doesn't know if Lue will join the team on its upcoming trip to Brooklyn, Miami and Charlotte. Drew visited Lue at his home on Thursday and the two discussed how to integrate the players returning from injuries. ... F Kyle Korver won't return until next week. He's been away with his family following the death of his younger brother, Kirk.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSuns: At Orlando on Saturday.\n\nCavaliers: At Brooklyn on Sunday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray each scored 25 points to keep the Denver Nuggets' playoff hopes alive by beating the Washington Wizards 108-100 on Friday night.\n\nThe one-two punch of Jokic and Murray plus outside shooting from Will Barton allowed the Nuggets to withstand a third-quarter charge from the Wizards and maintain their sights on one of the final two playoff spots in the Western Conference. Denver went into the night two games back of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Utah Jazz and shot 50 percent from 3-point territory to stay very much in the race with nine games remaining.\n\nBradley Beal led Washington with 24 points as it failed to gain ground in a competitive East where five teams are separated in the standings by four games.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNuggets: Barton finished with 23 points, including five 3s. ... Had only 10 turnovers after 23 in their first meeting with Washington in October. ... F Paul Millsap played 25 minutes after being questionable with flu-like symptoms. ... G Gary Harris missed his fourth consecutive game with a right knee injury. ...\n\nWizards: Seven 3-pointers in the third quarter were as many or more than the Wizards made in 21 different full games this season. ... G John Wall, who has been out almost two months after left knee injury, is doing some basketball activities and could practice as soon as Saturday. There's no definitive timeframe for Wall's return. ... F Mike Scott and G Jodie Meeks returned after each missing a game for illness.\n\nWIZARDS MEET PARKLAND STUDENTS\n\nSome students, parents and teachers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School stopped by the Wizards' shootaround Friday morning and met with coach Scott Brooks, who called it an honor to speak with them. They're in Washington to march for gun control after 17 people were killed at the school last month.\n\n\"They're here for a purpose,\" Brooks said. \"They've been through a lot. They've been through things that they shouldn't have to go through.\"\n\nSCOREBOARD GLANCING\n\nWith Denver far from in control of its own playoff hopes, coach Michael Malone isn't ignoring the out-of-town scores.\n\n\"When I'm going to bed at nighttime, you look at the score around the NBA, but I am not refreshing my phone every two minutes to see scores,\" Malone said. \"If we don't take care of our business, none of this stuff matters.\"\n\nCHENIER'S 45 RETIRED\n\nAt halftime, Phil Chenier became the fifth player in Wizards/Bullets history to have his number retired as his 45 was unveiled in the rafters along with a 33 and microphone to commemorate his time as a broadcaster. Chenier is the third player from the 1978 NBA championship team to have his number retired, joining Wes Unseld and Elvin Hayes, though back surgery prevented him from taking part in that playoff run.\n\n\"It really was exciting for me to see that 45 up there and to see my name,\" Chenier said afterward. \"It looked good up there.\"\n\nIn a video message shown in the third quarter, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar asked, \"The only question is, what took them so long?\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNuggets: Make stop No. 5 of their seven-game road trip Monday night at Philadelphia to continue their playoff pursuit.\n\nWizards: Host the New York Knicks on Sunday with the possibility of clinching their second consecutive playoff berth.\n\nFor more NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Kansas brings sanity back to March in 80-76 win over Clemson",
                "body": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- No crazy comeback story here.\n\nTop-seeded Kansas brought at least a temporary halt to the insanity this March, withstanding a wild comeback from fifth-seeded Clemson for a too-close-for-comfort, 80-76 victory on Friday.\n\nMalik Newman led the Jayhawks (30-7) with 17 points in a one-time runaway that got much closer and, quite frankly, won't mean much if KU can't finish the job in the regional final Sunday.\n\nFor the third straight year as a No. 1 seed, KU made its way through the Sweet 16. Getting to the Final Four has been a different story -- and the Jayhawks are on the doorstep once again.\n\nAs a top seed the last two seasons, Kansas made it through the regional semifinals, only to flop a game shy of the Final Four both times. In fact, this is the sixth time Bill Self's team has been seeded first since winning it all in 2008; the Jayhawks haven't made the Final Four one of those times.\n\nIt could've ended Friday.\n\nClemson trailed 62-42 midway through the first half, but climbed to within six with 2:27 left. But thanks to Devonte' Graham's offensive rebound with 1:57 left, the Jayhawks ran almost a minute off the clock. The Tigers got the ball with a chance to cut it to a one-possession game, but misfired on back-to-back 3s. From there, Kansas overcame a dogged Clemson press just long enough to ensure that the Tigers couldn't pull any closer until the final buzzer. Kansas came into the game a 4 ½-point favorite.\n\nGabe DeVoe had a career-high 31 for Clemson (25-10), which couldn't replicate the magic it showed in beating Auburn by 31 to reach its first Sweet 16 in 21 years.\n\nPIVOTAL MOMENT\n\nClemson had scored five straight points to cut KU's lead to 35-27 when Elijah Thomas, after a review, was called for a flagrant foul. Silvio De Sousa knocked down the free throws, Lagerald Vick buried a 3 and Kansas cruised into halftime ahead 40-27. Vick, Newman and Graham then opened the second half with 3s to extend the lead to 20.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nFor Kansas, it's three down, three to go for a program that expects to compete for a national championship year in and year out. One of the most encouraging things about KU's takedown of Clemson was that it jumped ahead by 13 at halftime despite a 1-for-7 start by Graham, the Big 12 player of the year. Udoka Azubuike looked strong in his first start of the tournament with 14 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nClemson: What a wild 12 months it was for coach Brad Brownell. He entered the season on the hot seat after six straight seasons without even making the NCAA Tournament, but the Tigers reached the regional semifinals for the first time since 1997 even after losing Donte Grantham, arguably their best player. The big question next is whether 2017-18 will prove to be a fluke or the start of something big in the Upstate. The school has spent the money it needed to spend on facilities to become a basketball school -- but will it ever get out of the shadow cast by Dabo Swinney's football team?\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Wolverines meet Seminoles with Final Four berth on the line",
                "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leonard Hamilton is well aware of the perception that Florida State is a football school. The coach also knows that the moniker is often applied to Michigan, the Seminoles' opponent Saturday night in a most unlikely NCAA Tournament regional final.\n\nAfter a lifetime of coaching hoops, the 69-year-old Hamilton can't understand why anyone would think about football in March when his players and coach John Beilein's squad have earned the right to play the biggest game of their lives at Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I think that's one of the most ridiculous phrases I've heard: football school,\" Hamilton said Friday. \"I mean, gosh, (Michigan has) been to the Final Four on a consistent basis. ... Our baseball team has probably had as much success at Florida State as anyone, but nobody would call us a baseball school. Our soccer team does an outstanding job. Our volleyball team is good. I just think that's a cliché, and that's a phrase we need to eliminate.\"\n\nOne of these don't-call-them-football-schools will be eliminated in LA in the culmination of two wacky weeks out West.\n\nSeparated by conference and geography, third-seeded Michigan (31-7) and ninth-seeded Florida State (23-11) didn't know much at all about each other until this improbable NCAA Tournament left them as the only two teams standing in the West Region.\n\nWith 48 hours to cram for this final, the Wolverines and Seminoles have learned a few things about each other that sound oddly familiar.\n\n\"They have some similar characteristics that we have,\" Michigan's Charles Matthews said. \"We have long players on this team, guys that like to get out in transition, and athletes as well. I feel like it's going to be a fun game. They're a very well-prepared team, and so are we.\"\n\nThe Wolverines also realize what's different and dangerous about the surprising Seminoles, who have upset three consecutive higher-seeded opponents to make an unlikely run to the third Elite Eight in school history.\n\nWith wins over top-seeded Xavier and national championship finalist Gonzaga already, Florida State is on the brink of an improbable achievement. The Seminoles went only 9-9 in ACC play and lost in the first round of the conference tournament, but after sweating out Selection Sunday, they've surged to the brink of the second Final Four in school history by hitting their stride just in time.\n\nMichigan's presence in the Elite Eight is less of a surprise, since the Wolverines have made it three times in the last six years. Beilein's team has won 12 straight games since Feb. 6, streaking to the brink of their first Final Four since 2013.\n\nBut after middling performances in their first two NCAA Tournament games, the Wolverines showed they're ready for the big time with a 99-72 thrashing of Texas A&M on Thursday, overshadowing their typically proficient defense with the school's highest-scoring NCAA Tournament performance since 1992.\n\nIf the Wolverines can come up with a fitting sequel, they'll end Florida State's best postseason run since 1993.\n\nHere are more things to know about the West Region final between Michigan and Florida State:\n\nDOGS IN THEM: Michigan is aware of the dilemma it faces with Florida State's pressing, shot-blocking \"junkyard defense,\" which has deserved its colorful name. \"Just really getting after it,\" Florida State's Phil Cofer said. \"We say 94 feet. That's picking the ball up early and playing hard to exhaustion. That's one of the key things of our junkyard defense. When everybody is locked into that, we can take ourselves all the way to the top.\"\n\nGUT GEMACHT, MORITZ: Florida State is paying particular attention to Moe Wagner, the Wolverines' 7-foot German star. Wagner scored 21 points and hit all three of his 3-pointers in Michigan's rout of A&M. Florida State has two impressive 7-foot interior defenders in Christ Koumadje and Ike Obiagu, but they typically don't venture to the perimeter.\n\nEVERYBODY SHOOTS: Wagner isn't the only outside shooter in maize and blue: Eight Wolverines hit a 3-pointer against the Aggies, and Michigan had 14 total 3-pointers. Florida State's junkyard defense allowed that many 3-pointers only once in 34 games this season.\n\nEVERYBODY SCORES: Florida State's impressive offensive balance showed up again while the Seminoles beat Gonzaga with just one double-digit scorer. If Michigan's semifinal performance was any indication, the Noles might need to score a whole lot more points to keep up -- and they think they've got the versatility to do it. Florida State has scored at least 74 points in seven games since January. \"When you get offense from every position, that makes it easier when somebody is getting shut down by the defense,\" said Terance Mann, who had 18 points to lead Florida State against Gonzaga. \"We feel like everybody on the floor can score for us, and that gives us an advantage.\"\n\nANN ARBOR WEST: Florida State has plenty of fans in Southern California, but Michigan had a truly impressive crowd in the Staples stands for the victory over Texas A&M. Beilein expects more of the same Saturday. \"Those people didn't travel here to see this game,\" he said. \"They live here, and that's what's great about coaching at Michigan. We're everywhere.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "CRESTON, Iowa -- The only place here large enough to hold the shock and grief engulfing this town will be Southwestern Community College, perhaps in the gymnasium.\n\nThat's where mourners will gather for the funeral of a local family of four -- parents Kevin and Amy Sharp and their children, Sterling and Adrianna -- who went missing during their Mexican spring break vacation and were found dead Friday in their resort condo in Akumal.\n\nFoul play isn't suspected, but that hasn't eased the pain of beloved relatives, friends and neighbors rocked by the tragedy.\n\nAmy Sharp's close family gathered on a chilly Friday afternoon at the home of Beth Fry, Amy's mother.\n\n\"Life is not going to be the same without her,\" Fry said, overcome with grief as she stood in the bitter wind. \"Half my family is gone.\"\n\n\"We're determined. We have love and support and family and friends and we will get through this. One way or another, we will.\"\n\nShe leaned on her older daughter, Renee Hoyt. Amy Sharp's cousin, Jana Weland, stood beside them.\n\nOther relatives circled around in the garage -- nursing beers, numb in grief, sharing funny memories and trying to cheer each other up.\n\nIt was surreal, they said, as if they were watching some TV crime drama rather than their own lives as friends and family walked up with sagging plastic bags full of donated food and other items.\n\nKevin Sharp had been a salesman for the family beer distributor, Southwest Distributing Co.\n\nAmy Sharp worked from home as a dental-claims specialist for Principal Financial in Des Moines.\n\nDaughter, 7-year-old Adrianna, \"was our fashion stylist,\" said her aunt, Hoyt.\n\n\"Our diva girl,\" added her grandmother, Fry. \"She ruled that family.\"\n\nSterling, 12, was comparatively quiet. But he was an avid athlete and sportsman -- baseball, swimming, fishing, hunting, etc.\n\n\"His dad and him are a team,\" Fry said, slipping into present tense.\n\nThe Sharps, both of whom took classes at Southwestern, by all accounts were two of the biggest Spartans fans in town. They welcomed basketball players into their home for Christmas dinner and other holidays.\n\nAs Spartans men's basketball coach Todd Lorensen prepared to play that night in Danville, Illinois, competing in the NJCAA Division II championship playoffs, his mind drifted to the Sharps.\n\n\"I consider them friends,\" he messaged. \"They were to be here watching us play. ... This family is an instrumental part of our Southwestern family, and we are all grieving their loss.\"\n\nMore: Woman who reported rape on TripAdvisor says company lied about apology for deleting post\n\n\"They traveled six days a week for those kids' sports,\" Hoyt said.\n\n\"They lived life on the fly, let me tell you,\" Fry said, managing a smile.\n\nThis would have been the family's second trip to Danville to cheer the Spartans.\n\nIt was their absence for the weekend that turned increasing worry in Creston into sheer panic, triggering Thursday night's intense manhunt via the U.S. State Department.\n\nThis tragedy touches nearly all of Creston.\n\n\"Have you ever seen family trees that the branches go every which way?\" Hoyt said, waving her hands above her to illustrate.\n\nThat was the Frys, Sharps and Baileys here. In that way, this family of four represents a loss for \"most of the community, one way or another,\" Fry said.\n\nNot to mention that Fry herself is a popular waitress at Mario's, the local bar and grill. Another relative runs a hair salon.\n\nHoyt not only was Amy's sister but also was a high school classmate of Kevin's. And her husband, Glen, was the guy who helped him catch the racing bug.\n\nKevin Sharp served in Glen's pit crew for stock car races on the dirt track in Corning.\n\nThe family thought there was no way that Kevin Sharpwould actually begin racing himself. He was too much the businessman. Not a gearhead in the least.\n\n\"Wouldn't even know a wrench,\" Hoyt laughed.\n\nBut he got behind the wheel, loved it and went on to win trophies. He handed out his distributing company's hats to winners, which turned out to be the most coveted trophies.\n\nSharp wasn't going to race more than a couple times this year because of the family's devotion to baseball and other sports.\n\nKevin and Amy Sharp had been married more than 16 years. They tied the knot in Vegas.\n\nThey met when Kevin began hanging around the Fry house for Sunday afternoon backyard volleyball games. Then he tagged along for a Fry trip to a Cardinals game in St. Louis.\n\nWhat had been planned as a modest family vacation became a raucous road trip with a rental van full of Amy's invited friends -- including Kevin.\n\n\"We loaded (the van) up and had the time of our life,\" Fry said. \"Her and Kevin kind of got together that weekend.\"\n\nAnd that's how the family lived: constantly on the fly.\n\nSterling and Adrianna didn't even know they were going to Mexico until they were at the airport and getting on the plane -- one more example of the family's sense of adventure.\n\nBut now, the travel has become a somber homecoming, as relatives streamed back to Creston. The horrible day Friday played out exactly a month before Amy Sharp's 39th birthday.\n\nHer stepbrother in the Navy was flying in from Virginia Beach.\n\nKevin Sharp's parents also had been on vacation and were en route.\n\nPowers Funeral Home is making the arrangements for the funeral late next week at Southwestern.",

                "body": "LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Marie Gulich had 26 points, Kat Tudor added 16 and sixth-seeded Oregon State shot 58 percent in the second half to upset No. 2 seed Baylor 72-67 on Friday night in the women's NCAA Tournament Lexington Region semifinal.\n\nTwo years after upsetting Baylor in the Elite Eight, Oregon State (26-7) followed up with a steady performance that ended the Lady Bears' 30-game winning streak. The Beavers had to withstand nine consecutive points by Alexis Morris that got the Lady Bears (33-2) to 69-67 with 42 seconds remaining before Katie McWilliams' left-corner 3-pointer provided a five-point edge.\n\nMorris missed two 3s and Natalie Chou another in the final 10 seconds for Baylor, which shot just 39 percent and was edged 38-37 on the glass.\n\nGulich made 10 of 17 from the field and had nine rebounds for OSU, which won for the 10 time in 11 contests. Tudor was 5 of 10 shooting and 4 of 8 from long range as the Beavers made 9 of 20 from behind the arc.\n\nKalani Brown had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Baylor, which was outscored in all but the second quarter in losing for the first time since falling 68-62 at UCLA in November.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOregon State: The Beavers weren't intimidated by Baylor's winning streak or size, working around the latter with crisp passing for good looks and controlling the boards throughout. Gulich thrived in both cases, hitting mid-range shots and the boards. Perimeter shooting was the difference, with Tudor and Corosdale combining for seven 3-pointers on 13 attempts. McWilliams' late 3 was the difference.\n\nBaylor: Just as the Lady Bears seemed to find their rhythm with Brown, they steadily fell apart after halftime and never found consistency. Making just 3 of 17 from long range didn't help, but being outrebounded after entering with a plus-26.5 margin was the biggest shortcoming for a team that had been dominant since early November.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOregon State faces the Stanford-Louisville winner in Sunday's regional championship.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The White House and Pentagon on Friday unveiled a new policy on transgender troops that will severely restrict their place in the military.\n\nPentagon officials had a deadline of Friday to put in place the new policy after months of consideration and court challenges. President Trump followed through late Friday and issued orders to ban transgender troops in all but extremely limited cases.\n\nIn August, Trump sent Defense Secretary Jim Mattis a memo ordering him to propose changes to the Obama-era policy that allows transgender troops to serve openly and receive medical treatment, including sexual reassignment surgery.\n\nBut Trump rescinded that directive Friday.\n\n\"I hereby revoke my memorandum of Aug. 25, 2017,\" Trump wrote in a memorandum. \"The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security . . . may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.\"\n\nMattis had given the White House his recommendation on transgender service in February. Without a new policy, the Pentagon would have reverted to its pre-2016 practice that effectively banned transgender troops from service on medical grounds.\n\nMattis has emphasized the readiness of troops to deploy and fight. In February, the Pentagon established a policy that dismisses troops if they cannot deploy for a period of one year. That principle could affect transgender troops who require medical care that could not be provided in a war zone.\n\nIn July, Trump overturned the policy on transgender troops. He tweeted that transgender troops were no longer welcome in the military, and that the military would no longer pay for their surgeries.\n\nPentagon leaders reassured transgender troops that they would not be kicked out and that there medical care would not be interrupted until a new policy was created. Federal courts have ruled that transgender men and women must be allowed to volunteer for service. Dozens of transgender recruits have signed up since becoming eligible Jan. 1.\n\nThere are believed to be as many as several thousand transgender troops among the active-duty force of more than one million troops, according to a RAND Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon in 2016. Their ability to deploy and cost of medical treatment would have a minimal impact on military readiness, according to the report.\n\nThe policy for transgender troops was established in 2016 by then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter. It allows transgender service members to serve openly, seek medical attention and allowed for recruits who have been stable in their gender for 18 months to join the military.",

USA TODAY Sports\n\nFlorida Gulf Coast University set the standard for NCAA tournament upsets when the Eagles dunked their way from obscurity to a national darling five years ago with its unprecedented run.\n\nFGCU famously became the first -- and still only -- 15 seed to make the Sweet 16 when the Eagles shot down second-seeded Georgetown and seventh-seeded San Diego State in 2013.\n\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County became the first 16 seed to beat a top seed in the NCAA tournament when the Retrievers rolled Virginia, 74-54, in Charlotte, North Carolina, last Friday.\n\nThat's why UMBC's Vice President for Institutional Advancement, Greg Simmons, this week called Chris Simoneau, the Vice President of University Advancement and the FGCU Foundation's executive director.\n\nSimoneau laughed when asked if he could relate to the worn but very eager voice on the other end of the line.\n\n\"There was a desire to take advantage of the situation and a feeling of, 'How do I leverage this to the full potential? We know this is good, but where do you go?'\" Simoneau said. \"I mean, these things come out of nowhere. You can't plan for this.\n\n\"My advice to him was, 'You've got to let it roll. Ride this as much as you can. Brand it. Be there. Be in front of your alumni, get people touring your campus. Get your president on national media as much as you can.'\"\n\nSimoneau pointed out the biggest difference in the happenings -- FGCU got five extra days of the whirlwind attention compared to UMBC because the Eagles won their second-round game before finally losing to third-seeded Florida in Arlington, Texas. UMBC dropped its second game to ninth-seeded Kansas State two days after the win against Virginia.\n\n\"We got the advantage of that entire week of people asking who we were, where we were, what programs we had,\" Simoneau said. \"I think it's going to continue (for UMBC) and they need to help it continue. But we were blessed by that entire week.\"\n\nSimmons felt the Retrievers were making the most of that two-day flash that still is pretty bright.\n\n\"It's true our run was a little bit shorter, but what we've been able to do, which is really exciting, is let people understand that the basketball success is emblematic of the rich rigor of accomplishments we've achieved over the last 25 years and we have not seen that slow down,\" he said. \"It's giving us a chance to tell our story. You really can't buy this kind of opportunity.\"\n\nThe start of Dunk City\n\nSimoneau literally signed on with FGCU -- his Boston friends had never heard of the school and thought he was nuts -- from Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, the day the second-seeded Eagles upset top-seeded Mercer on the Bears' home floor in the Atlantic Sun tournament final that sent them to their first-ever NCAA tournament in just their second year of eligibility.\n\nHistory!

Simoneau told then-FGCU president Wilson Bradshaw he should meet him in Philly.\n\n\"Well, we're playing Georgetown, who is a No. 2 seed,\" Bradshaw deadpanned, meaning Simoneau should stay put.\n\nSimoneau did and joined a half-dozen more folks with FGCU connections at Game On Fenway to watch the game. Literally no one else in the packed bar, of course, knew what \"FGCU\" stood for before the tip.\n\n\"They're looking over at us kind of strangely,\" Simoneau said. \"Then as the game goes on they started to get on our side. Then more on our side. And by the end of it they were all -- the entire bar -- cheering for Florida Gulf Coast to beat Georgetown. And it was so much fun.\"\n\nAnd then it was time to get to work. It was spring break at FGCU, but Susan Evans, now a Vice President and Chief of Staff, and bookstore employees and technical support folks, etc., on campus got after it as did Simoneau from afar as things absolutely exploded for the Eagles -- national TV, radio and print, website teetering on crashing, giant lines at the school's bookstore, gawkers on campus and on and on.\n\n\"What I experienced in Boston was true across the nation,\" Simoneau said. \"It went from, 'Who are these guys?' to, 'Oh, my God, let's look into that.'\"\n\n#RetrieverNation trended twice worldwide last weekend. The UMBC bookstore was supposed to be closed, but by 8 a.m. Saturday, 1,200 orders had been placed. So the employees flocked back to campus, just as they had done at FGCU.\n\n\"We celebrated the win Friday night for about 30 minutes and then me and my folks met in the hotel lobby and we planned what we were going to be doing the next day,\" said Simmons, noting lots of other departments helped. \"This was a real campus effort and people have not slowed down.\"\n\nSimmons was with the team in Charlotte, where someone tried to buy his UMBC sweatshirt and other gear after the upset. A friend in Las Vegas said someone told him there was no way he had his UMBC shirt before the Virginia game. The driver of a busload of UMBC students who made the trek to Charlotte said people sat on their car horns, waved like crazy and flashed their lights at the sight of them going by.\n\n\"You're starting to see more people wearing the gear and starting to see people who've worn the gear not having to explain what it stands for anymore,\" Simmons said.\n\nUMBC -- which also was on spring break during its upset win -- hired a few marketers before this happened to help with the school's 50th-anniversary celebration plans launched in June.\n\nA chuckling Simmons said some of the new marketers asked if it was like this every year.\n\nAssist from Dunk City\n\nSimmons also reached out to folks at George Mason (which made the Final Four as an 11 seed in 2006) and Loyola-Chicago, an 11 seed heading to the Sweet 16.\n\nBut it's FGCU that most comes up in correlation to what UMBC did. So calling Dunk City was a no-brainer.\n\n\"Chris was great,\" Simmons said. \"I really appreciate him taking the time to talk. In this business and any business, if you think you know all the answers, that's a great way to find yourself on the deep end without a life jacket.\n\n\"We want to make sure we understand what this moment is, but then look downstream to understand how we position it going forward.\"\n\nFlorida Gulf Coast University's basketball coach Andy Enfield new head coach at Southern California\n\nPerhaps the best advice Simoneau gave Simmons was that, \"People don't give because a basketball team won. They give once they get involved and they get engaged and they get invested. So this is not necessarily an opportunity for them to give, but it's an opportunity for you to get them involved so that they will give in the future.\n\n\"And that's what happened with us. It really opened people's eyes to what we are and what we could be and then they started to get involved.\"\n\nSimoneau has estimated the financial windfall of that Dunk City run to be about $30 million. Some of it took a while and some still is coming in. FGCU didn't see the jump in attendance some expected in the Fall of 2013 because students had already made their choices. But applications ballooned -- out of state by about 80 percent and instate around 35 percent -- during that time.\n\nFormer Dunk City mayor Fieler makes big pro jump\n\n\"What that enabled us to do was to be more selective with our students,\" Simoneau said.\n\nNot only did the rolls of students, Eagles boosters and season tickets holders swell, but so did visits to programs like art and music.\n\nThe Sweet 16 surge also was big for students who already were on campus.\n\n\"There was more of a sense of campus pride,\" Simoneau said. \"They wanted to stay. The value of their FGCU degree went up.\"\n\nFollowing Up\n\nBefore the Sweet 16 run, there wasn't much attendance or excitement for FGCU men's games in 4,500-seat Alico Arena. In fact, there had been only one sellout -- a win against Miami in 2012.\n\nThose became commonplace for the 2013-14 season despite the change from Enfield to Joe Dooley and in the styles they teach. Simoneau also pointed out that the President's Suite in Alico Arena now is always packed with potential future supporters.\n\nThe Dunk City moniker is believed to have been coined by a sportswriter in Philadelphia during the second half of the win against Georgetown when the Eagles had five powerful and sassy slams. UMBC still is working on a new, men's basketball-oriented hashtag.\n\n\"The athletics department really ran with that,\" Simoneau said of \"Dunk City,\" which adorns the front and lots of other areas in Alico Arena. \"It's a great moniker for the men's program.\n\n\"It doesn't much tell the story of the university. But I was walking through Boston with an FGCU shirt on and someone yelled out, 'Dunk City!' It at least enables you to start the conversation about what the rest of the university is as well.\"\n\nSince 2013, Dooley has led FGCU to two NCAA tournament appearances in five seasons. Despite being big ASUN favorites, though, the Eagles failed to win the conference tournament this past season, something they and most other mid-major programs must do to make the NCAA tournament. Attendance has dipped a couple notches, so there is concern the Dunk City window could be closing a tad.\n\nCollege basketball: FGCU's Fly offered by OSU\n\n\"The bar has been raised,\" Simoneau said. \"It's not enough to just be competitive. We can't be USC Upstate, NJIT. It looks like they are just tolerating a basketball program.\"\n\nUMBC's teams moved into the $85 million Event Center in February. It seats 6,000, about 3,500 more than the previous arena. It didn't come close to filling up, but likely will next season. The school is still looking for someone to pay naming rights and Simmons said there suddenly are \"a lot\" of discussions about that.\n\n\"Athletics is the front porch of the university,\" Simoneau told Simmons. \"You've got to get them in the door.\"\n\n\"It's been so exciting for the kids, it's been exciting for our alumni and faculty and staff,\" Simmons said. \"Clearly what the kids did on the floor is historic and they represented us so well. What's so great is the bright light that it shines on everything we've been doing on the campus for the last 30 years. The basketball players are the UMBC story in a microcosm -- work together, work hard and set high expectations and you can achieve things together that no one thought possible. It's hard to say how rewarding it's been. I don't think people can fully understand it.\n\n\"I don't think we'll understand it until we've had time to reflect on it for a while.\"",

                "body": "Operators of a Kansas waterslide were so infatuated with building the world's tallest ride that they ignored serious safety issues that led to the decapitation of a 10-year-old boy and at least a dozen injuries to others, according to a grand jury indictment unsealed Friday.\n\nThe indictment charges the operator of Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, along with its director Tyler Austin Miles, with involuntary manslaughter, endangering children, and a host of other criminal offenses.\n\nKilled in the August 7, 2016 accident on the Verruckt waterslide was Caleb Schwab, the son of Kansas Rep. Scott Schwab. The raft he was in went airborne, hitting a pole and netting designed to keep riders from being thrown from the ride.\n\n\"The death of (Caleb) appeared at first to be an isolated and unforeseeable incident until whistleblowers from within Schlitterbahn's own ranks came forward and revealed that Shlitterbahn officials had covered up similar incidents in the past,\" said the indictment, filed in Wyandotte County, Kansas.\n\nThe indictment says that a company co-owner, Jeffrey Wayne Henry, was the designer of the Verruckt, despite the fact that he \"possesses no technical or engineering credentials\" and is a high-school dropout.\n\nA video shows that Caleb Schwab was obeying all rider instructions when his raft went airborne and killed him, and also severely injured two adult women in the same raft, according to the indictment. Caleb was sitting in the front of the raft.\n\n\"Experts in the field of amusement ride design and safety examined Verruckt and found physical evidence which indicated that other rafts had gone airborne and collided with the overhead hoops and netting before the fatality,\" the indictment alleged. \"These experts noted that Verruckt's design violated nearly all aspects\" of longstanding industry safety standards.\n\nWinter Prosapio, a spokeswoman for Schlitterbahn, was quoted in the Kansas City Star as defending the company's safety practices.\n\n\"Our staff, since we opened Schlitterbahn Kansas City, has demonstrated the highest dedication to safety, from the training of our lifeguards and ride operators, to ensuring all rides have operated in accordance with our strict protocols,\" Prosapio said. \"Our team has been conscientious and committed to providing visitors to the waterpark a safe and enjoyable experience. We are shocked by any allegations of impropriety or negligence on the part of anyone associated with Verruckt.\"\n\nAfter Caleb died, detectives from the Kansas City police department, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and special agents from the Kansas Attorney General's office began reconstructing the design and operational history of the Verruckt, which was designed in 2012.\n\n\"Verruckt's designers and operators knew that Verruckt posed a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death or severe bodily harm,\" the indictment alleged.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Henry conceived of the Verruckt in 2012 \"in a spur-of-the-moment bid to impress\" the Travel Channel's Xtreme Waterparks series, but that he did not conduct proper engineering and safety tests.\n\n\"Henry openly admitted that one of his principal motivations in building Verruckt was to flaunt his achievements in the faces of other waterpark owners,\" the indictment said, quoting from an internal document. \"Hey guys, come on! Are you gonna let me have the bragging rights? Because I'm gonna brag a lot! We are the tallest ride in the world!\"\n\nHenry, the court papers said, acknowledged the danger. \"It's complex, it's fast, it's mean. If we mess up, it could be the end. I could die going down this ride.\"\n\nThe water slide was closed after Caleb's death. Company officials said it will be dismantled once the investigation is finished.",

                "body": "New national security adviser is a big fan of using military force: Our view\n\nAs if the Trump presidency hasn't created enough causes for concern, here's the latest: A president who famously threatened to rain \"fire and fury\" down on North Korea has hired one of the nation's most hawkish foreign policy experts as national security adviser.\n\nFormer United Nations ambassador John Bolton might very well reinforce Trump's most hard-edged impulses, among them trashing the Iran nuclear deal, in which Tehran agreed to dismantle its nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nAdd to this equation the voice of Mike Pompeo, the hard-line CIA director recently nominated to replace the fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and the three-year-old Iran deal's days appear to be numbered.\n\nU.S. withdrawal from the multilateral agreement with Europe, Russia and China is likely to prompt Iran to restart its nuclear weapons program, spawning the regional nuclear arms race that Bolton, years ago, wrongly predicted would be the result of President Obama's negotiations with Tehran.\n\nMoreover, withdrawing from the Iran deal would seriously undermine U.S. credibility. Why would North Korean leader Kim Jong Un give up his nuclear weapons in a negotiated agreement -- as Iran did in 2015 -- if an American president can come along later and arbitrarily tear it up?\n\nSo the world might soon face two heated, nuclear crises at once: one in Iran and another in North Korea. Never fear. Bolton -- whose belligerent policy ideas were too much even for a Republican-led Senate in 2005, which voted down his nomination as U.N. ambassador (he served temporarily as a recess appointment) -- has already opined on what the United States should do about Iran and North Korea: attack.\n\nIt's ironic that Trump, a harsh critic of the 2003 Iraq War, would hire an architect and chief defender of the calamitous U.S.-led invasion, which killed hundreds of thousands, created a regional power vacuum that Iran rushed to fill, and spawned the rise of the Islamic State terrorist organization.\n\nBolton is smart, knowledgeable about world affairs, a skilled bureaucratic infighter -- and a big fan of military force. He advocated airstrikes against Iran nuclear sites in 2015: \"The United States could do a thorough job of destruction.\" And the same last month in outlining a legal justification for pre-emptively attacking North Korea: \"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to ... North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first.\"\n\nEstimates of the dead in South Korea should such a first strike spiral out of control have ranged as high as 300,000 in the first few days. Trump, in one of his frequent about-faces, suddenly declared this month he would meet face-to-face with Kim, and Friday he told reporters that some level of early agreement is \"very close to being finalized.\"\n\nBolton, whose appointment does not require Senate confirmation, has scoffed at North Korea engaging in honest negotiations. What happens if such talks fail?\n\nUntil recently, a triumvirate of White House national security leaders served as necessary guardrails for Trump's fire-and-fury tendencies: Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary James Mattis.\n\nNow Tillerson and McMaster are heading out the door. \"God help us if we lose Jim Mattis,\" James Stavridis, the former NATO supreme allied commander, told MSNBC on Friday. It's a frightening thought.",

                "body": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Teaira McCowan had 24 points and 15 rebounds, Victoria Vivians added 14 points and top-seeded Mississippi State routed North Carolina State 71-57 on Friday night to reach the Elite Eight of the women's NCAA Tournament.\n\nMorgan William added 13 points and Roshunda Johnson, who lost her grandfather earlier in the week, added 12 as the Bulldogs (35-1) also broke their school record for wins in a season.\n\nThey'll have a chance to add to it Sunday, when they face second-seeded UCLA or No. 3 seed Texas for a spot in the Bulldogs' second consecutive Final Four.\n\nKiara Leslie had 27 points to pace the No. 4 seed Wolfpack (26-9), who led early in the second quarter before coming undone. Foul trouble set in, Mississippi State clamped down defensively and North Carolina State coach Wes Moore was hit with a technical foul as the Bulldogs pulled away.\n\nThe Wolfpack also had no answer for McCowan, whose size presented all kinds of problems. The only junior in a senior-laden starting lineup, she finished 11 of 11 from the field and made both of her foul shots on a night that would have been perfect except for a trio of turnovers.\n\nThe Bulldogs, who lost to South Carolina in last year's title game, looked like they would cruise to the doorstep of another Final Four when they roared to a 17-7 lead in the first quarter.\n\nNorth Carolina State leaned on its defense, and one of the best rebounding margins in the nation, to claw back. Leslie's 3 early in the second quarter gave the Wolfpack a 20-19 advantage.\n\nMississippi State responded with another run, fueled almost entirely by its 6-foot-7 star. McCowan easily grabbed rebounds over the smaller Wolfpack, scored a series of layups and wound up with 16 points on 7-for-7 shooting in the first half, as the Bulldogs took a 36-41 lead into the break.\n\nMississippi State still led 49-37 midway through the third quarter when the Wolfpack's Akela Maize, who had tangled with McCowan all game, picked up her fourth foul.\n\nMoore came unglued and was slapped a technical foul, then continued his diatribe as the officials mostly ignored him. William made two foul shots and Johnson a layup for the four-point trip down floor, and the Bulldogs eventually pushed their lead to 20 points.\n\nThey rolled the rest of the way to the Elite Eight.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNorth Carolina State still has not reached an Elite Eight since 1998, when the Wolfpack advanced to the Final Four in Kansas City. The end of their season likewise means the end for a senior class that helped resurrect a program picked to finish eighth in the ACC this season.\n\nMississippi State needed a big night from McCowan with its backcourt slow to produce. But once the Bulldogs' guards began to contribute, they breezed to their 10th win in the past three tournaments.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Bulldogs, whose only loss this season came to South Carolina in the SEC Tournament, head to the Kansas City regional finals against the Bruins or Longhorns.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Celtics say All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving is set to have surgery Saturday to alleviate pain in his left knee.\n\nIrving has been out since March 11, missing the last four games. There is no timetable for his return from the \"minimally invasive\" procedure.\n\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens was asked before Boston's game in Portland on Friday night the ramifications of Irving's surgery.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" Stevens said. \"He's going to have it tomorrow and we'll know more about timelines after that.\"\n\nThe knee is the same one that Irving injured in the 2015 NBA finals that required surgery.\n\nIrving is averaging 24.4 points, 5.1 assists and 3.8 rebounds per game. Friday was his 26th birthday.\n\nHe is one of several key sidelined players for Boston, which is at Portland on Friday. He joins Jaylen Brown (concussion protocol), Marcus Smart (thumb surgery), Daniel Theis (knee surgery, out for season) and Gordon Hayward (ankle surgery rehab).\n\nStevens said the team will focus on its strengths in light on the injuries.\n\n\"Do what you do best. That's it,\" he said. \"Everybody's got something they do well otherwise they wouldn't be in the NBA. Don't try to be something you're not, don't try to make up for Kyrie's absence, or Smart's absence, or Tyson's absence by trying to do what they do. Just do you and just be good at it, be reliable at it. That's all we're going to ask.\"\n\nStevens said he had not had a lot of discussion with the front office about adding another player.\n\n\"I think that there is the possibility of applying for an exception again because of all the knee injuries and the length of injuries. I don't know where we are with that, and I haven't talked to them about any particulars.\n\nHe said if the Celtics added anyone it would be to give the team perimeter depth.\n\nThe Celtics are currently in second place in the Eastern Conference, below the first-place Toronto Raptors.\n\n___\n\nMore NBA basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals have traded veteran offensive tackle Jared Veldheer to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a sixth-round pick in this year's draft.\n\nThe 30-year-old Veldheer, at 6-foot-8 and 322 pounds, started 53 games in four seasons with Arizona after coming to the team from Oakland, where he spent his first four NFL campaigns. Veldheer played left tackle the first four seasons and switched to the right side last year.\n\nIt was apparent Veldheer didn't figure in Arizona's plans under new coach Steve Wilks, especially after the team signed free agent and ex-New York Giant Justin Pugh, who figures to take the right tackle job with D.J. Humphries on the left side.\n\nThe move Friday saves Arizona $6.9 million in salary cap space. The sixth-round pick is the 182nd overall.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://pro32.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Florida State takes its win-by-committee philosophy seriously.\n\nThe Seminoles crowded six players on the dais with coach Leonard Hamilton for Friday's news conference at Staples Center. They were only required to bring five, but nobody gets left out on this team, including the walk-ons.\n\nMost coaches shorten their bench the closer they get to the Final Four, but Hamilton won't consider going away from his 11-man rotation. As a result, every player believes they are equally as important as their teammates.\n\n\"The coaches preach all the time it's going to be a different guy every night,\" forward Phil Cofer said. \"Everybody is definitely locked into helping each other.\"\n\nNinth-seeded Florida State (23-11) plays No. 3 seed Michigan (31-7) on Saturday in the West Region final. A victory would move the Seminoles into the Final Four for the second time in school history. They lost to UCLA in the 1972 national championship game.\n\n\"We always envisioned this and we always talked about it,\" guard Terance Mann said, \"so to finally be here definitely means a lot.\"\n\nThe Seminoles have knocked off three higher-seeded teams in the NCAA Tournament, including No. 1 Xavier in the second round.\n\nEach opponent experienced Florida State's so-called junkyard defense, a scrappy mindset embodied by pressuring the ball and going after little things like steals and deflections.\n\n\"Playing hard to exhaustion,\" Cofer adds. \"That's one of the key things of our junkyard defense.\"\n\nAt one time, the Seminoles kept a picture of a dog with a collar in the locker room and each player touched it on their way to the court.\n\n\"We want to be like junkyard dogs that really want to protect their yard,\" Hamilton said, adding with a laugh, \"It doesn't always work now. Sometimes we run into some junkyard lions, elephants.\"\n\n\"Coach Ham,\" as he's known to his players, has fostered an unselfish spirit among his players despite initial skepticism.\n\n\"Everybody at first was like, 'Uh, I don't know about this,'\" Cofer said, \"but when we started winning games it kind of changes everything.\"\n\nAnd when they're trailing and the outcome is in doubt, Hamilton is in his players' ears with positivity.\n\n\"He's always encouraging us,\" Cofer said. \"We even get down on ourselves and he just keeps telling us to keep pushing through. It gives us confidence. It feels like a second father.\"\n\nHamilton credits his upbringing in the church for his nurturing manner. Growing up in the South, he would attend a different church every Sunday with his grandmother. Living close enough to hear the church organ in his bedroom, he developed a passion for gospel music and owns a record label.\n\n\"It's kind of my way of giving back,\" he said.\n\nHamilton, who at 69 could pass for someone much younger, is known to dance and joke with his players. He doesn't drink or smoke, although he admits to cursing \"every once in a while.\"\n\nIn his three years at Florida State, Mann has seen a number of former players who come back and visit Hamilton, and also reach out to the current team.\n\nThat sense of community, more than his 1978 national championship ring as a Kentucky assistant or his other coaching honors, is what Hamilton enjoys.\n\n\"I'm more excited about when they graduate and get their degrees, when I get a chance to go to their weddings and be the godfather to their kids,\" the coach said.\n\nWith Michigan and its 12-game winning streak looming, Hamilton is eager to see his players create more memories they can cherish the rest of their lives.\n\n\"I hope that my reward would be to see the smiles on their face and hear their tone of voice and the excitement in it if we can win this game tomorrow,\" he said. \"This is a bunch of guys that are connected together. They cheer for one another.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Michigan tight end Ty Wheatley is expected to miss the rest of spring football with a foot injury.\n\nCoach Jim Harbaugh said Friday that Wheatley appeared to have a fracture in his foot, but is expected back in the fall for the 2018 season. Wheatley had three catches for 26 yards last year.\n\nThe Wolverines had their first spring practice Friday. Harbaugh said the reps are being evenly distributed among the quarterbacks. There is still no word on whether quarterback Shea Patterson, a transfer from Mississippi, will be eligible to play next season.\n\nMichigan doesn't have an official offensive coordinator listed on its staff. Harbaugh said running the offense will be a \"collaborative\" effort and that the play-calling process is still to be decided.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "ASSAGO, Italy - Olympic bronze medalist Kaetlyn Osmond of Canada won the figure skating world title Friday with a nearly perfect performance as Olympic champion Alina Zagitova fell a jaw-dropping three times and crowd favorite Carolina Kostner turned in a lackluster skate - both tumbling completely off the podium.\n\nOsmond, who skated first in the final group, watched with amazement from the sidelines after Zagitova's and Kostner's disastrous programs handed her the title and deprived the two favorites any medals at all. Japan's Wakaba Higuchi won silver and teammate Satoko Miyahara took bronze.\n\n\"I was fighting to skate clean and fighting to hit the podium. Being world champ is something I definitely never expected,\" said Osmond, 22, who ended a 45-year women's world title drought for Canada. \"And Carolina and Zagitova are both very strong competitors and very consistent competitors. Unfortunately, it didn't work for them today, but they are always incredible to watch.\n\n\"I am just happy I did what I could today,\" said Osmond.\n\nSkating to a Swan Lake-Black Swan suite, Osmond easily won the long program with 150.50 points for a total score of 223.23.\n\nShe hit seven triples with only a minor deduction for stepping out of a combination jump, seemingly leaving the door open to either Kostner, who had an eight-point lead after the short program, and the young Russian jumping genius, Zagitova, to battle for the title.\n\nBut Zagitova fell on a straight lutz, missing a combination, then fell again on two subsequent combinations. The 15-year-old waited two minutes to start her jumps, which in theory raises their value, but in this competition she seemed sapped of energy. The crowd rallied behind her in sympathy after the second fall, clapping rhythmically to urge her on.\n\nAll Kostner had to do was skate clean. But her nerves showed when she doubled an opening triple lutz. And she fell on a triple salchow late in the program and singled an axel. All of her artistic prowess couldn't make up for the errors in what could be her last world championship - in her home country no less.\n\nKostner said she wasn't aware of Zagitova's errors when she took the ice last.\n\nMore: After 16-year break, USA's Stellato, 34, competes at worlds\n\nMore: Lillehammer explores another Olympics\n\n\"You can see the fatigue in everyone's legs. We are all human beings. We have strong emotions when we are out there,\" Kostner said. \"I think that above all, the fact of feeling nervousness means it is important for us. You know how much work we have put in.\"\n\nWhile she said she was disappointed with the result, the 31-year-old former world title holder and Olympic bronze medalist said she wouldn't decide her future in the heat of the moment.\n\nIn a roller-coaster 15-year career, Kostner has won 11 European medals, the most of any woman, and three world championship medals in 14 appearances. There also have been painful moments, including a suspension for lying to doping officials for an ex-boyfriend that cost her two seasons.\n\nZagitova, who looked stunned at the end of her program, refused to comment.\n\nJapan's medals ensure its team three spots at worlds next year, which will be in Japan.\n\nAmericans Bradie Tennell and Mirai Nagasu finished sixth and tenth, respectively, leaving the U.S. women with just two spots next year.\n\nIn the ice dance, Olympic silver medalists Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron of France skated with nary a wardrobe mishap to lead the short program with a season's best performance\n\nPapadakis wore the same tropical flare dress that came undone during the Olympics - this time with extra safety measures sewed in during a trip to their training home in Montreal. And Cizeron had on his sleeveless muscle shirt as they performed perfectly executed direction-changing spins in unison and quick-moving rhumba steps to Latin dance and a musical medley including Ed Sheeran's \"Shape of You.\"\n\nAfter the opening of her dress made headlines in South Korea, Papadakis said she made sure that it wouldn't \"open in anyway,\"\n\n\"And it didn't,\" she said triumphantly.\n\nThere was something about the Italian ice that brought out the best in the ice dancers, with all top three couples in the short skating season-best performances.\n\nThe French couple, the only Olympic medalists at worlds, had 83.73 points ahead of U.S. couple Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, who pierced the 80-point ceiling for the first time. Canadians Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje finished third with 78.31.\n\n\"We wanted to go home from the Olympics and keep improving and really put out an incredible performance,\" Hubbell said, adding that they were especially pleased to have achieved the highest levels for all their elements. \"We really feel we gave our best performance today.\"\n\nArtistry, athleticism on display at figure skating world championships Fullscreen Italy's Carolina Kostner performs during women's short program at the Figure Skating World Championships in Assago, near Milan, on March 21.

                "body": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Carlos Gonzalez smiled at the thought of being back with the Colorado Rockies.\n\nGonzalez spent nine seasons with the Rockies, becoming a three-time All-Star. He left as a free agent after the World Series, then returned to the Rockies in mid-March with a $5 million, one-year contract -- a huge cut from his previous deal for $80 million over seven years.\n\n\"It was very different than in years past, my first time in free agency,\" the 32-year-old Venezuelan outfielder said Friday, speaking in Spanish. \"There were a lot good players sweating it out, and everyone knows how it all went down, but the most important thing is to be able to get back to playing baseball.\"\n\nGonzalez learned some things about the business side of baseball during a free-agent market that was the slowest since the end of the 1994-95 strike.\n\n\"Really glad to back here again,\" Gonzalez said. \"Not many players have the opportunity to be with the same team for a decade.\"\n\nGonzalez hit .221 with just six home runs and 22 RBIs in the first half of last season but batted .314 with eight home runs and 35 RBIs after the break. He was 2 for 5 with an RBI in the Rockies' NL wild-card game loss to Arizona.\n\nGonzalez is projected to play right field and hit in the middle of a batting order that includes NL batting champion Charlie Blackmon, former NL batting champion DJ LeMahieu and Nolan Arenado.\n\n\"Some of the guys called me during the offseason and told me they missed me,\" Gonzalez said. \"I just try to put up good numbers and try to be a good teammate, and really my main goal is to help those guys become superstars, like Nolan, DJ, Blackmon, (Trevor) Story. These are all guys I have watched grow from the first year they were here.\"\n\nGonzalez is beloved in Denver, popular and respected in the Rockies clubhouse. Teammates were outspoken about the void created by his absence at the outset of spring training.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the most important thing is that my teammates showed me they care. It definitely makes me feel good,\" Gonzalez said. \"I've spent many years in a place that welcomed me with open arms from the start.\"\n\nGonzalez is more than happy to mentor the younger Rockies.\n\n\"He's a really good player and veteran, and a good person, too,\" outfielder Raimel Tapia said in Spanish. \"He helps me with defense and batting because he's done it well his whole career. He's always really happy and full of energy, and he tells me I'm going to be good if I work hard.\"\n\nThe mentoring part comes from inspiration from accomplished big leaguers such as Carlos Beltran, from whom Gonzalez sought advice during the free agency period.\n\n\"Like they say, 'Pass the baton,'\" Gonzalez said.\n\nRockies manager Bud Black says Gonzalez brings both a competitive and calming influence.\n\n\"His presence here makes us a better team, first and foremost, on the field, if he plays like he's very capable of playing,\" Black said. \"He's a guy that connects with all the members of the team, so there's a leadership there that goes beyond what he does on the field.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Accounts of how many people died in the sinking of the USS Indianapolis during World War II have long varied by one. Were there 1,195 sailors and Marines aboard the ill-fated ship -- or 1,196? Did 879 men perish in the attack, in the water, or after rescue -- or 880?\n\nNow two historians have collaborated on a paper that helps explain the discrepancy: One young man, sometimes included on the ship's roster, did not actually sail on that fateful journey in July 1945, because of a last-minute change of plans.\n\nHowever, the paper finds, a record-keeping error led his name to appear on some versions of the passenger roster but not on the list of survivors, leading history to erroneously add a name to the roll of those whose lives were lost.\n\nMore: Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen finds lost WWII ship USS Indianapolis\n\nMore: Finally, some closure for USS Indianapolis survivor\n\nCo-authors Richard Hulver, a Naval History and Heritage Command historian, and Sara Vladic, a filmmaker and historian, cross-checked all the names associated with the Indianapolis to sort out the misunderstanding. They published their findings on March 20 in an issue of the U.S. Naval Institute's Proceedings Today.\n\nIn the paper, the two report that a Michigan couple was among the heartbroken who received news in mid-August 1945 that they had lost a son in the Japanese torpedo attack on the heavy cruiser on July 30.\n\nBut Charles and Ruth Donnor had spoken with their son, Clarence, since that date and knew that he was actually alive, well, and in training in the United States. While they informed the Navy of its mistake immediately, the paper recounts, the clerical error persisted in some accounts, resulting in the confusion.\n\nHulver and Vladic's work will help set the record straight for posterity. They explain in their paper why they undertook their painstaking research.\n\n\"To an outside observer, this small casualty discrepancy might seem insignificant,\" they write. \"To survivors, descendants, friends and the Navy, it is not. ... This entire event shows the inherent difficulties in accounting for casualties in the fog of war.\"\n\nSo what did happen to young Donnor more than seven decades ago?\n\nTurns out that the radio technician second class had reported to duty on the ship before it sailed. He had been on board for about half an hour when his Pacific deployment was canceled and he was sent to an officer training program in New York.\n\nDonnor's Navy career continued until a year after the war ended while he was stationed aboard the USS Chimariko. While the paper does not discuss the rest of his life, it does note that Clarence Donnor died on Feb. 1, 2002.",

We want MSU to move forward, rebuild its reputation and thrive.\"\n\nEngler didn't lobby against the bills, but rather sought to slow down the legislative process to allow for more analysis and public comment, said university spokeswoman Emily Guerrant. She said Engler is already making changes on campus and is determined to work with survivors.\n\nRevised legislation was recently approved by the Michigan Senate. House committee meetings on the bills will likely begin after the Legislature returns from its spring break on April 10, according to House Speaker Tom Leonard, a Republican from DeWitt Township.\n\nNassar, 54, was sentenced to between 40 and 175 years in prison for criminal sexual assault and 60 years for child pornography.\n\nMore: After 16-year break, U.S. figure skater, 34, competes at worlds\n\nMore: Russia stuck in stalemate with WADA after doping scandal\n\nVictims said the abuse also occurred while Nassar worked for USA Gymnastics, the Indiana-based organization responsible for training Olympians.\n\nMany are now suing the university and USA Gymnastics over their handling of sexual assault allegations against Nassar.\n\nArtistry, athleticism on display at figure skating world championships Fullscreen Italy's Carolina Kostner performs during women's short program at the Figure Skating World Championships in Assago, near Milan, on March 21.

(AP) -- Clayton Kershaw finished spring training with a 0.00 ERA.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers' three-time NL Cy Young Award winner stretched his scoreless streak to 21 1/3 innings with 6 2/3 innings against Kansas City in his final tuneup for Thursday's opener against San Francisco. He allowed a leadoff single to Jon Jay and no other hits. He struck out four and walked none in a 10-0 win.\n\n\"He was efficient as he could ever be,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Friday. \"He had everything working, fastball to both sides of the plate, the slider had the depth, the breaking ball was sharp. Clayton threw the ball really well. It was really encouraging for all of us. He doesn't smile too often after outings, but I think he was pretty pleased.\"\n\nKershaw allowed 12 hits in six starts, struck out 23 and walked four. The left-hander was pitching for the first time since turning 30 on Monday.\n\n\"Physically I feel great, which is good,\" Kershaw said. \"I've obviously pitched in the playoffs before, but finishing on November 1st, you never know how the extra couple of weeks will affect you. I feel good. I'm excited to get going and ready to feel a little bit of adrenaline.\"\n\nKershaw altered his conditioning program during the offseason.\n\n\"It was never been about conditioning, but about trying to stay healthy,\" he said. \"Everything I've done has been geared about trying to keep my back healthy.\"\n\nA bad back limited Kershaw to 27 starts last season for the NL champions, but the seven-time All-Star still tied for the NL lead with 18 victories.\n\nKershaw will make his eighth consecutive opening day start, a franchise record, and will have an extra day of rest.\n\n\"I kind of like this way because you feel like you're still building into the season,\" Kershaw said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Michigan's Moritz \"Mo\" Wagner figures to play a key role Saturday when the third-seeded Wolverines play No. 9 seed Florida State in an Elite Eight matchup. Yet it turns out the 6-11 junior forward was in danger of getting lost in the shuffle before he joined the team.\n\nMichigan coach John Beilein said an email he received from an overseas basketball contact about Wagner -- then a high school student in Germany and now a college junior and second-team All-Big Ten pick -- was part of a stack of unread emails piling. It was 2014.\n\n\"Finally I was just trying to clean it up,'' Beilein said Friday. \"It was maybe two or three weeks later that I watched this video (of Wagner).''\n\nSoon Beilein was in touch with Wagner and headed to Germany with plans to offer the kid a scholarship. It was October and the college basketball season was underway, but the Wolverines had a day off, according to Beilein.\n\n\"So I went over and back, in disguise, by the way,'' Beilein said. \"I wore no Michigan gear because I didn't want anybody seeing me because word travels fast. Then other people would come recruit him.''\n\nMORE: 5 key takeaways from Thursday's Sweet 16 games\n\nANALYSIS: Michigan shows Final Four potential in Sweet 16 smackdown\n\nMORE: Florida State shows off its length and depth on way to Elite 8\n\nThe plan worked. Well, that is,until Beilein flew home. He was spotted at the airport in Detroit and word of his overseas travel ended up on Twitter, the coach recalled..\n\nBeilein said, \"So you can run, but you can't hide.''\n\nOn Friday, there was no hiding Beilein's appreciation for how things have worked out, with Wagner leading the team in scoring (14.4 points a game) and rebounds (6.9 rebounds a game).\n\n\"The other thing is his passing right now,'' Beilein said. \"We all knew he could shoot, but his passing.\n\n\"... He's throwing passes right now, he's handling the ball and busting out of the break. I can see the similarities to what we saw this time of some of our other guys that became really elite players in college and went on to the pros.\n\n\"These next steps, all of a sudden, it's like wow, and you have these wow moments with them.''\n\nIndeed.

                "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- No. 9 seed Florida State (23-11) vs. No. 3 seed Michigan (31-7)\n\nFinal, West Region, Los Angeles, Saturday, approximately 8:49 p.m.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Michigan could earn a trip to its first Final Four since 2013 by setting a school record with its 32nd victory, but the Big Ten tournament champions must avoid becoming the fourth consecutive upset victim of Florida State. The Seminoles are surprisingly on the brink of the second Final Four in school history after extending the momentum from their upset of top-seeded Xavier last week by knocking out Gonzaga.\n\nBIGGER NUMBERS: After mostly muddling through last week's opening NCAA Tournament games, the Wolverines hit their offensive stride with a 99-point thrashing of Texas A&M in the Sweet Sixteen. Coach John Beilein credits his players' embrace of their up-tempo, aggressive approach while hitting nearly 62 percent of their shots. Michigan had five double-digit scorers in the Sweet Sixteen game, while Florida State had just one while beating Gonzaga.\n\nRARE AIR: Florida State is in the Elite Eight for just the third time in school history, while Michigan has made it three times in the last six years alone. These Seminoles probably aren't coach Leonard Hamilton's most talented team, but they embrace his motto of \"18 Strong\" by playing tremendous team ball on both ends, focused on game-changing defense. Florida State's only other Final Four trip came in 1972.\n\nON A ROLL: Michigan's 12-game winning streak is the second-longest in the nation thanks to the Seminoles, who ended the Zags' 16-game winning streak.\n\nQUOTABLE: \"We realize they have a unique system. They have a 7-footer that shoots 40 percent (on 3-pointers), which is unusual in itself. We have a couple of 7-footers that are more low post-type guys that don't guard people on the perimeter as well as probably you would need to. So we have adjustments we're going to have to make.\" -- Hamilton on Moritz Wagner, Michigan's sharpshooting German big man\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "CLOSE\n\nSportsPulse: Are the Cubs likely to dominate in the NL Central? USA TODAY Sports' Bob Nightengale breaks it all down. USA TODAY Sports\n\nThere's no good time for any major injury, but the broken hand Madison Bumgarner suffered Friday when he was hit by a line drive is about as bad as it gets.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants ace was pitching in his final spring start, the day before many fantasy leagues have their drafts.\n\nBumgarner having surgery tomorrow to insert pins in fractured pinky knuckle. It will be 4-6 weeks then he has to have pins removed. This is not going to be a short DL stint. But he expects to pitch before the All-Stsr break. -- Andrew Baggarly (@extrabaggs)\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nThis rekindles some unfortunate memories with Bumgarner. He missed roughly half of last season when he injured his shoulder in a dirt bike accident -- and wasn't the same after he returned.\n\nIt looks like another uphill climb for him this season.\n\nFor fantasy owners who've already drafted Bumgarner, there's nothing more to do but work the waiver wire to find someone to bridge the gap. But those whose leagues are drafting this weekend will have a more difficult decision to make.\n\nBefore the injury, Bumgarner was the No. 5 starting pitcher in my rankings -- behind the \"big four\" of Clayton Kershaw, Max Scherzer, Corey Kluber and Chris Sale.\n\nHis absence only increases the gap between the aces and the rest of the field. Fantasy owners should give those four aces another small bump up in value.\n\nAs for Bumgarner, he's still worth drafting in all formats to stash until he returns. Best case, he's back sometime in June after the pins are removed and his hand has time to heal.\n\nAnother issue is how soon his command and effectiveness will return. Remember, he didn't pitch that well when he came back from the accident last season.\n\nI'm moving Bumgarner in my starting pitcher rankings from No. 5 to No. 31 -- in between two other high-variance starters, Lance McCullers and Rich Hill.\n\nFantasy update:NL pitcher rankings\n\nTop 200 overall:Bumgarner down, but not out\n\nIf MadBum misses half a season, his stats won't be comparable to either of those two. However, Rotisserie leagues don't just count the stats a player accumulates, they count the stats his roster spot accumulates. Owners get to fill the opening with another player until Bumgarner returns and add their production together.\n\nHalf a season with a waiver wire pickup, plus half a season of Bumgarner, can still be a useful player. I'm dropping MadBum to No. 107 overall, which is still a late ninth-round pick in a 12-team mixed league.\n\nIn head-to-head leagues, Bumgarner still retains significant value because he'll presumably be healthy down the stretch and into the fantasy playoffs, when his owners need him most.\n\nThis serves as yet another reminder that injuries can strike at any time. Fantasy owners just have to be prepared to react quickly and move forward.\n\nProjecting MLB's Opening Day starters: 2018 Fullscreen RHP Dylan Bundy, Orioles John Minchillo, APFullscreen LHP Chris Sale, Red Sox Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen RHP Luis Severino, Yankees Kim Klement, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen RHP Chris Archer, Rays Kim Klement, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen LHP J.A.

                "title": "Patrick Reed bests Jordan Spieth in Match Play showdown that didn't live up to the hype",
                "body": "AUSTIN -- At least the most hyped match ended with a bang.\n\nThe titanic battle of Ryder Cup and President Cup partners Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth in Friday's third round of the World Golf Championships-Dell Technologies Match Play didn't live up to the buildup -- or provide expected fireworks -- on a blustery, overcast day at Austin Country Club.\n\nIn the winner-moves-on match, Spieth started his day with double bogeys on his first two holes, three-putted three times and never led, while Reed made a bogey and then nine consecutive pars in one stretch yet kept his lead.\n\nIn the end, Reed knocked in a 40-footer for birdie on the 17th hole to close out the meeting of the Stars & Stripes stars, 2 and 1, and advanced out of pool play while Spieth headed home to Dallas in search of a solid putting stroke.\n\n\"I don't think it would have been that tough to beat me today,\" Spieth said. \"I just didn't have a really good day. Sometimes that happens. I just got a little off. I thought I rebounded nicely after it kind of looked like a round of 90 or 92 through the first few holes. I thought I played decent golf from there. But with three water balls and three three-putts, you're not going to win many matches.\"\n\nNeither one said the hype leading into the match had anything to do with the fact there were no fist pumps or roars from the two. Instead, there were penalty drops, water balls, three putts, errant drives and short putts missed.\n\n\"It was just one of those days that with how the conditions were, it wasn't fun,\" Reed said. \"It was a grinder's day out there. You weren't going to see a ton of birdies. There's going to be just who doesn't make some mistakes, who's able to grind out some pars and maybe make a birdie here or there.\"\n\nReed moved to 3-0-0 and moved into Saturday's knockout stage, joined by 15 others who got out of pool play. Among those are Justin Thomas, new father Sergio Garcia, Matt Kuchar, who made a hole in one Friday, Bubba Watson and Ian Poulter.\n\nOnly five of the 16 top seeds moved out of pool play.\n\nReed won the first two holes of his match when Spieth became the only player in the tournament to start his round with two double bogeys. He hit his first shot of the day out of bounds, then hit his second shot on the second hole into a hazard. Spieth rebounded with birdies from one foot on both the ninth and 10th holes but Reed then won the 11th with a par. Reed went 2 up with a spectacular shot on the 13th, his approach from 147 yards, in high, crossing winds, piercing through the air to tap-in range.\n\nSpieth three-putted the 15th and Reed led 3 up with three holes to play and then ended the match with his 40-foot birdie.\n\n\"Those two wedge shots he hit on 9 and 10, I felt like the momentum switched his way. To go ahead and win 11 and to kind of capitalize on 13 like that, I felt like from that point on, all the momentum was in my favor,\" Reed said.\n\nSpieth doesn't have any momentum heading toward Augusta National and the Masters in two weeks. The 2015 Masters champion will play next week's Shell Houston Open before heading to Augusta.\n\nBefore getting to Houston, he will work on his putting stroke, the bread-and-butter part of his game that is, well, moldy at the moment. It was been all year -- in seven starts before the Match Play, he wasn't in contention late on a Sunday in any of them.\n\n\"I'm not sure. I'm not sure right now,\" Spieth said when asked if he'll have his putting in form for the Masters. \"I've got so many check points in my head right now that I'm trying to get to before I get line and speed.\n\n\"I've put in a lot of work and I'll get results out of it. It will just take a little time. I don't know when it will come. I don't know if it will come next week. I don't know if it will come next year. But all I can do is embrace the challenge. I mean it's better than backing away from it, that's for sure.\"",

(AP) -- All-Star second baseman Daniel Murphy is likely to remain behind in Florida when the Washington Nationals break camp.\n\nMurphy had micro-fracture surgery on his right knee on Oct. 20 and has not appeared in any major league or minor league spring training games. His rehabilitation has taken longer than expected, and Howie Kendrick or Wilmer Difo are expected to start at second in next Thursday's opener at Cincinnati.\n\n\"He's coming along,\" new manager Dave Martinez said. \"Might see him maybe get some at-bats here in the next week or so down in the minor league camp.\"\n\nA three-time All-Star, Murphy turns 33 on April 1. He is eligible for free agency after the season.\n\nThe 34-year-old Kendrick is a career .291 hitter with 104 home runs. He also plays the outfield.\n\n\"They kind of told me, you should get all your reps in the infield and just be ready to play,\" he said.\n\nDifo, 23, hit .271 last year, his first full season in the majors.\n\n___\n\nOft-injured first baseman Ryan Zimmerman has played in just one major league spring training game, opting for time in the batting cages and in minor league games.\n\n\"He's a guy that doesn't really like spring training, and he's had a good spring training,\" Martinez said. \"He says he's ready to go.\"\n\nZimmerman's lone big league game this spring was March 2. Martinez expects Zimmerman to be in the opening day lineup.\n\n\"He feels good,\" the manager said. \"He's going to run later on, and then we'll evaluate what's going on after that.\"\n\n___\n\nPitcher Jeremy Hellickson made his first start of the exhibition season as part of a split squad against Miami but won't be part of the first turn through the rotation.\n\n\"We're going to open up with A.J. Cole being our fifth starter,\" Martinez said. \"He's had a good camp -- good spring training. I liked the way he threw all spring, so hopefully he continues that.\"\n\nWashington signed Hellickson to a minor league last weekend and if he moves into the rotation, Cole could shift to the bullpen.\n\nBecause of off-days, Washington might start Max Scherzer in the fifth game on full rest.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Notre Dame, Texas A&M clash again, this time in Sweet 16",
                "body": "SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Gary Blair didn't need to be reminded about the last time Texas A&M came across Notre Dame in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe ring on the right hand of Texas A&M's coach commemorating the 2011 national title game win over Notre Dame did the job.\n\n\"I think about it every day,\" Blair said. \"But I don't think about the game itself. To be honest, I've never seen the complete game after the fact. I've only seen the highlights.\"\n\nFor the first time since that title game, No. 1 seed Notre Dame and fourth-seeded Texas A&M will meet again in the NCAAs, this time in the regional semifinals Saturday. Only once since the Aggies (26-9) won their lone national title has Texas A&M advanced beyond the Sweet 16.\n\nDoing it this time would mean taking down the Irish, who have made reaching the regional semifinals a yearly accomplishment. Notre Dame (31-3) has reached this round in nine straight tournaments and made the Elite Eight in six of the past seven years.\n\nThis could be among the most gratifying for the Irish and coach Muffet McGraw after a season during which Notre Dame has been hit hard by injuries.\n\n\"There's been some difficult situations come up. They've persevered. They haven't let it get them down,\" McGraw said. \"I think they've been knocked down a couple of times. They keep getting back up. They've really stayed together as a unit.\"\n\nThe other regional semifinal features Pac-12 champion and second-seeded Oregon (32-4) taking on No. 11 seed Central Michigan.\n\nOregon coach Kelly Graves knows all about taking an 11-seed on a deep run in the NCAA Tournament. He was the coach at Gonzaga when the Bulldogs made back-to-back Sweet 16 runs in 2011 and 2012. Graves has been the head coach of the last two double-digit seeds to reach a regional final -- Gonzaga in 2011 as a No. 11 seed and Oregon last year as a No. 10 seed.\n\nGraves was asked if he had any advice for the No. 11 seed based off his past success as a lower seed.\n\n\"Just play, be who you are. I don't think at this point it helps anybody to change or to add new things or anything like that,\" he said. \"I think at this point pretty much every team has seen everything. They're not running anything tomorrow that we haven't seen before. I think just kind of be yourself, have fun with it.\"\n\nCentral Michigan is the outlier among the four teams here, but the Chippewas (30-4) may be the best story remaining in the tournament. The champs of the MAC regular season and the conference tournament routed third-seeded Ohio State in the second round behind 14 3-pointers, playing a style Graves said was reminiscent of how his teams at Gonzaga played earlier this decade.\n\n\"If anything, I think it's going to be a fun game for the fans to watch and maybe a nightmare for me,\" Central Michigan coach Sue Guevara said.\n\nHere are other things to watch in Saturday's regional semifinal games:\n\nSTAR GUARDS: Two of the top guards in the country will be featured in each game. Texas A&M is led by freshman Chennedy Carter, who hit the game-winning 3-pointer in the second-round win over DePaul, while Oregon runs off the play of star sophomore Sabrina Ionescu. Carter is the top scoring freshman in the country and had 32 points in the second half against DePaul, while Ionescu averages nearly 20 points per game and set the Pac-12 single-season record for assists.\n\nINJURY STATUS: There is uncertainty about the status of Notre Dame forward Kathryn Westbeld for Saturday's game. Westbeld injured her ankle early in the first-round win over Cal State Northridge and was limited to just 16 minutes in the second-round victory against Villanova. McGraw said Westbeld has been in a protective walking boot all week.\n\nHEAVY MINUTES: All five Central Michigan starters average at least 31 minutes per game and two -- Presley Hudson and Renya Frost -- top 35 minutes. The most important player against Oregon may be 6-foot-3 senior Tinara Moore. The MAC player of the year and defensive player of the year will be trying to match Oregon standout forward Ruthy Hebard, who is shooting nearly 66 percent from the field on the season.\n\nLATE ARRIVAL: Oregon didn't arrive in Spokane until Friday morning, the result of a mechanical problem with the Ducks' charter jet. Other than dealing with the unexpected delay, the only major hiccup caused by the plane problems was the team missing out on dinner at the home of Oti Gildon, who is from Spokane, and Graves getting a chance to catch up with some old friends.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks added needed depth on their defensive line by signing veteran defensive tackle Tom Johnson and bringing back defensive end Marcus Smith.\n\nThe Seahawks are thin up front with the trade of Michael Bennett to Philadelphia and the loss of Sheldon Richardson in free agency. Johnson provides the Seahawks a solid veteran at defensive tackle who played on one of the premier defenses in the NFL last season.\n\nJohnson started 15 games for Minnesota in 2017 when the Vikings led the NFL in total defense and scoring defense.

                "title": "Iowa prison choir to be part of NY opera performance",
                "body": "IOWA CITY, Iowa -- A choir of inmates at an Iowa prison will soon be making their New York opera debut.\n\nMembers of the Oakdale Community Choir, including inmates from the Iowa Medical and Classification Center, performed the \"Prisoner's Chorus\" from Beethoven's Fidelio on Wednesday for a recording that will be broadcast during a live performance in New York City in May.\n\nThe inmates have been learning German and perfecting the right inflection for their part in the song for weeks.\n\nMore than putting on a good show, members of the choir hope their part in a New York opera will show they are trying to become better Iowa neighbors one day.\n\nThe choir, consisting of about 40 inmates and 30 volunteers from the community, was asked by Heartbeat Opera to take part in a modern-day performance of Fidelio, an opera about a woman's journey to free her falsely imprisoned husband.\n\nThe group is recording six choirs such as Oakdale's, each performing a different portion of the \"Prisoner's Chorus.\"\n\nThe production's director, Ethan Heard, traveled to the prison Wednesday to Coralville in eastern Iowa to record the Coralville choir's performance. Videos of four choirs and audio of another two will be combined and projected during a pivotal scene of the opera, where prisoners are released into a courtyard for a breath of fresh air.\n\n\"This is that moment right in the middle of the opera where, for the first time, we go from a very chamber-scale story to 'Here come dozens of incarcerated folks,'\" Heard said. \"And they sing just this beautiful piece about breathing freely for the first time in a long time, feeling that joy of the open air.\"\n\nHeartbeat Opera has been reimagining operas in New York for four years now, including a take on Carmen set on the U.S. border with Mexico and an annual drag opera. Heard said the idea is to make opera seem more relevant and more accessible.\n\nReimagining Fidelio -- updating the dialogue, changing some of the characters, adding a prologue and epilogue -- came to Heard when he began exploring injustice in today's prison system.\n\n\"I was looking for a story that would resonate in 2018, and it felt like 'Fidelio' was a story about hope in the face of injustice and perseverance in the face of corruption,\" he said. \"And I was also just really interested in learning about our criminal justice system in America and the epidemic of mass incarceration.\"\n\nInmate Shane Kendrick has participated in the choir's semi-annual performances for two years now. According to court records, Kendrick was arrested for performing sex acts on a child under the age of 12. He says he has six years left to serve on his sentence.\n\nPerforming with the group and writing songs, such as a parody of Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues\" called the \"Puppy Prison Blues,\" has been a comfort, he said.\n\nKendrick said he doesn't know much about the storyline of Fidelio, but he said any sort of depiction of inmates that humanizes them as better is a good thing -- not only for the inmates, but also for the community that they will re-enter.\n\n\"If I was on the other side and somebody was coming into my community, I'd probably be freaked out as well, at least standoffish,\" he said. \"But the more people can see prisoners and inmates as normal people who made a mistake -- if they've bettered themselves and they can come back out, I believe they should have a second chance.\"\n\nThe weekly meetings are a chance for inmates such as Bruce Pollard, who is serving a life sentence for first-degree murder and robbery, to interact with visitors.\n\nPollard spent the first years of his sentence in a maximum-security prison, where he said he learned to keep to himself and joined groups that he later regretted.\n\nSince then he has written a song called \"Thank You\" dedicated to the choral volunteers.\n\n\"Being a part of this has allowed me to open up and feel confident in my ability to stay out of trouble,\" he said. \"Be a part of a positive atmosphere rather a negative one.\"\n\nChoir director Mary Cohen started the program in 2009 in hopes of showcasing a more positive depiction of inmates. Their next performance will include the songs written by inmates, along with their performance of \"Fidelio.\"\n\nEach year, the group grows, and at each concert, community members are encouraged to join. This year, the choir is inviting parole officers and police officers to attend. Last year, prosecuting attorneys were invited.\n\n\"There's a new argument that says prosecuting attorneys are part of what has made mass incarceration rise, because their job is to put people behind bars for a long time, and it's important to think about what does that mean to human life if you are living behind bars,\" Cohen said.\n\nThe performance shows the rehabilitative side of prison, said warden James McKinney. He said most people only see prisons and designated areas to incarcerate people.\n\n\"While part of that is true, those 95% (of inmates) are going to be somebody's neighbor. Maybe yours, maybe somebody else's,\" he said. \"My job has always been to make them the best neighbor as possible, and punishment doesn't work. But I know if they start to learn to communicate with people and learn that they can be a contributing member of society, they usually walk out the door better prepared to be somebody's neighbor.\"\n\nHe said he hopes that this idea comes across at the performance, but it's not his first selling point on why the community should attend.",

                "body": "CLOSE\n\nSportsPulse: After some stunning results in Thursday's Sweet 16 games, the Elite Eight is beginning to take shape. USA TODAY Sports\n\nATLANTA -- The closest thing to a five-star recruit on the Philips Arena court Saturday will be a former shaggy-haired kid from the Kansas City suburbs who averaged 1.1 points a game his freshman year at Iowa State before booking it back to the mid-major level. The only legitimate NBA prospect in the entire game didn't even know where he was ranked in high school and took visits only to Illinois and Xavier before deciding on Kansas State.\n\nFor an Elite Eight game -- and yes, go ahead and wrap your mind around either Loyola-Chicago or Kansas State heading to the Final Four -- there's a pretty stunning lack of talent if you're measuring it by the typical way we talk about these things. The McDonald's All-American crew is gone; the future lottery picks are mostly out of the NCAA tournament and onto bigger and better.\n\nBut in the year the curtain was lifted on what goes on behind the scenes in college basketball, could there be anything more counterculture than an Elite Eight matchup between a mid-major and a coach in Bruce Weber who was fired from his last job largely because he missed on so many top recruits?\n\nMaybe that's overly sappy and simplistic, but this year, the irony is hard to ignore.\n\nAt a time when that whole FBI thing has turned college basketball upside down, cost coaches their careers and put numerous programs in limbo, the last two remaining in the South Regional seem far less likely to ever show up in indictments or wiretaps.\n\nMORE: Five key takeaways from Thursday's Sweet 16 games\n\nMORE: Kentucky's Sweet 16 loss to Kansas State is a missed opportunity\n\nMORE: Florida State shows off its length and depth on way to Elite 8\n\nLoyola-Chicago, whose rich basketball history and connections to the recruiting scene in Chicago had all but disappeared by the time Porter Moser got there five years ago, generally operates in that space below the top-tier of in-state recruits who end up in the Big Ten, Big 12 and ACC.\n\nAnd at Kansas State, which briefly became a recruiting brand name when it made Michael Beasley's AAU coach the nation's highest-paid assistant, Weber became an attractive candidate in 2012 not only for his resumé but his straight-arrow reputation.\n\nThat reputation, however, came at a significant professional cost.\n\nEven after making the NCAA championship game in 2005 with an Illinois roster that was largely constructed by his predecessor, Bill Self, Weber struggled to recruit the high-level players from Chicago. There were probably a bunch of reasons for that. But the bottom line is that Sherron Collins went to Kansas, Derrick Rose went to Memphis and Anthony Davis went to Kentucky, stripping Weber of any benefit of the doubt. Even Iman Shumpert, whom Weber started recruiting early and was Illinois' campus numerous times during his recruitment, went to Georgia Tech.\n\nThe criticism from fans was severe, and perhaps deserved. In recruiting, you either get the big-time local player or you don't. And the players Illinois ended up with got them one NCAA tournament victory in Weber's last four seasons.\n\n\"I just try to do it the right way,\" he said. \"At Purdue, years and years as an assistant we got a lot of kids that weren't top-100 that ended up in the NBA. We did the same at Southern Illinois, took it to the Sweet 16 with guys that weren't even recruited by other Division I schools. Illinois, we did some special things, had some guys play in the NBA. I just tried to do it right, the way I feel it should be done.\"\n\nEven at Kansas State, fans have been uncomfortable with Weber throughout his tenure. He wasn't a popular hire by former athletics director John Currie. And after Frank Martin was able to attract some higher-end talent to Manhattan, Kan., Weber's approach hasn't exactly turned the recruiting world on its ear.\n\nDean Wade, Kansas State's currently injured big man, was the 106th-best player in the 2015 class, according to rivals.com. Xavier Sneed, the versatile 6-5 wing who scored 22 points against Kentucky, was ranked 93rd two years ago and is just now on the periphery of NBA talent evaluators.\n\n\"I didn't get big into recruiting, really, like numbers and rankings,\" Sneed said. \"But Kansas State was my first offer and they were on me since sophomore year of high school, and I loved the coaching staff here and what they were doing and felt like my game could fit in well here.\"\n\nWhen Kansas State beat Kentucky on Thursday night, it was like two different versions of the same sport. On one hand, you had John Calipari's collection of McDonald's All-Americans. On the other, a group of players whose high school talent wouldn't have even put them on Calipari's recruiting board. And yet, when Kansas State was able to grind out a 61-58 win by playing to their strengths, it wasn't even one of the three biggest upsets of this tournament.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure we don't have no four or five-stars on this team, so that already has a chip on our shoulder and we can compete with anybody out there,\" guard Kamau Stokes said. \"We're real competitive and that makes up for a lot of things. I felt like we just wanted it more.\"\n\nFor a team whose roster wasn't highly regarded when Weber put it together, the most remarkable thing about this potential Final Four run is that it could include UMBC and Loyola, neither of whom out-recruit Kansas State.\n\nAs challenging as it might be for Weber to get involved with top-50 recruits, Loyola doesn't really try, focusing almost all its attention on players who project to play at the mid-major level. That comes with its own set of challenges, particularly when you recruit off high-powered Chicago teams like Simeon (where senior guard Donte Ingram played) and Whitney Young (freshman Lucas Williamson played there), where the player Loyola is evaluating may not get as many opportunities to show their ability.\n\n\"Those teams may have five, six, seven Division I players, so we're not looking for someone who's averaging 20 points a game but this kid knows what it takes to win and is part of a winning culture that's just as important as stats,\" assistant coach Bryan Mullins said. \"I think our guys can play on a lot of high major teams. Our guys have proved it.\"\n\nAnd the best part is, there's probably little danger of having to take down the banner.\n\n\"I'll be honest, I want to recruit top-100 players,\" Loyola coach Porter Moser said. \"But I think we're getting very good players, but we've never been a team of recruiting a number because it's rated this or that for your fan base. We've gotten guys that fit what we do. And we're going to continue to recruit at a high level, but we believe there's a certain way to do it. We're going to obviously follow the rules and do it the right way.\"\n\nThis year, that might carry a little more weight than normal.\n\n2018 NCAA tournament: Best of the Sweet 16 Fullscreen Kansas State Wildcats guard Barry Brown (5) celebrates with fans after defeating the Kentucky Wildcats.

                "body": "ATLANTA (AP) -- Let's not gloss over college basketball's myriad problems.\n\nRampant corruption. Academic malfeasance. One-and-dones posing as actual students.\n\nYet somehow, as this thoroughly maddening March has shown, the game finds a way to rise above it.\n\nInstead of sniping about FBI wiretaps and coaches in handcuffs, we're swooning over Sister Jean -- Loyola's 98-year-old, wheelchair-bound team chaplain, cheering on her beloved Ramblers -- and gritty squads such as K-State , which handed Kentucky's latest collection of fabulous freshman an earlier-than-expected launch to their NBA careers.\n\nNo one could've seen this coming.\n\nBut, really, we should have.\n\nCollege hoops has faced a gauntlet of trials and tribulations over the years -- many of them self-inflicted -- from the game-fixing scandals of the 1950s to Len Bias' cocaine-fueled death to the senseless slaying of a Baylor player shining the light on a sleezebag program of epic proportions.\n\nBasketball survived them all.\n\nIt will survive the current array of ills.\n\nNot because a bunch of shining knights are ready to gallop in to save the day. No, this will always be the domain of money-grubbing administrators and power-hungry coaches and a nauseating array of scoundrels, prowling the fringes in search of the quick buck.\n\nWe hold our noses when the ball is tossed in the air.\n\nIt's the price we must pay for the extraordinary.\n\n\"We're just so happy to be in this moment,\" Loyola's Marques Townes said Friday. \"Life is great.\"\n\nPerhaps as much as any time in its history, the NCAA Tournament has produced an exquisite array of startling upsets, implausible comebacks and heart-warming vignettes.\n\nFor the first time ever, a No. 16 seed (UMBC, short for the University of Maryland, Baltimore County ) beat a No. 1 seed (mighty Virginia, a unanimous choice as the best team in the land during the regular season). Nevada stared down a 22-point deficit with 11 minutes to go , pulling off a frenzied rally that stunned Cincinnati. Loyola, making it first tournament appearance since the Reagan administration, walked a tightrope in three straight games and somehow survived them all -- by a cumulative margin of four points.\n\n\"We all had that vision when we got to the tournament to win some games,\" said Cameron Krutwig, the Ramblers' burly freshman center. \"I don't know if we all thought we would get this far.\"\n\nWhen Kansas State faces Loyola on Saturday in the South Region final, it will be the first Elite Eight tournament game ever between a No. 9 seed and a No. 11 seed. That's only the latest bit of history produced by this grouping of teams, which became the first regional in NCAA history to lose its top four teams on the very first weekend.\n\n\"I'm not surprised,\" said Kansas State coach Bruce Weber. \"There's just so many good teams.\"\n\nAnd, perhaps, not as many great ones.\n\nFor all the much-deserved condemnation of a system that allows schools such as Kentucky to become nothing more than a single-season stopover for five-star recruits on their way to the NBA, the college game provides some intriguing contrasts that all seem to balance out in the wash.\n\nKentucky was clearly the most gifted of the four teams that made it to Atlanta, but that wasn't enough to carry them past a K-State squad that relies on bruising, relentless defense to stifle its opponents. These Wildcats may not be a bunch of future NBA stars, but they're the kind of guys you'd like to have backing you up in a dark alley. They managed to knock off Big Blue even after three players fouled out, holding Kentucky to its lowest point total of the season.\n\nBarry Brown Jr. summed it up this way: \"Making the right pass, playing for each other, just making open plays, staying confident no matter what the situation is, what the score is, what's going on in the game. Just staying together, never getting away from each other, and picking each other up when we're down.\"\n\nLoyola has demonstrated the value of continuity with a lineup that includes two seniors and two four-year juniors. There's no one-and-dones at the Chicago school, but the Ramblers are still alive -- and that's more than Kentucky can say.\n\n\"When you get teams to buy into collective efforts and play together,\" said one of those seniors, Donte Ingram, \"you end up with upsets.\"\n\nIn a little over a week, it's back to reality.\n\nA bunch of freshman stars will head off to the NBA.\n\nEveryone will nervously await the FBI's next hammer to fall.\n\nUntil then, enjoy the ride.\n\nNo matter how much they try to tear it down, the game always wins in the end.\n\n___\n\nPaul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press.

                "title": "Loyola to test Kansas State's strong D in regional final",
                "body": "ATLANTA (AP) -- Kansas State has been an afterthought through the NCAA Tournament -- until now.\n\nEven in the South Region, where the top four seeds were bounced out on the first weekend -- a first for the NCAA Tournament -- no one was really talking about these Wildcats.\n\nThere were those other Wildcats from Kentucky, which Kansas State sent home; the comeback kids from Nevada and of course the feel-good story of the tournament, Loyola-Chicago.\n\n\"We played with a chip on our shoulder throughout the whole season, just trying to prove people wrong,\" said Kansas State guard Kamau Stokes. \"And I feel like we're showing them.\"\n\nThe ninth-seeded Wildcats are indeed making a point. And so is their opponent Saturday night, No. 11 Loyola.\n\nIt is an unlikely pairing to play for a Final Four berth.\n\nNo. 9 vs. No. 11 in the Elite Eight, another NCAA Tournament first.\n\nBut then again, perhaps Kansas State's path to the regional final should not be seen as a surprise. The Wildcats have brought back-alley toughness to the Elite Eight. They don't back down.\n\nThey are winning with consistently strong defense that is proving to be the equalizer against higher seeds.\n\n\"I don't feel like anyone should pay attention to seeds because they are just opinions, you know? Opinions,\" Stokes said. \"The Top 25 is all opinions and then of course you have to win to get to this tournament. So, once you get here, it's like seeds don't matter at this point.\"\n\nKansas State's opponents can't win if they can't score, and the Wildcats (25-11) have held seven straight teams below 59 points. The latest demonstration of Kansas State's defensive prowess came in Thursday night's 61-58 win over Kentucky, which was held to a season scoring low.\n\nAsked on Friday to define Kansas State basketball, junior Barry Brown said \"First off, it's defending. We take a lot of pride on defense.\"\n\nCoach Bruce Weber said \"there's no doubt\" Brown is the team's defensive catalyst.\n\n\"When he was a freshman, I said, who's going to be our defensive stopper, and he's very stubborn,\" said Weber of Brown. \"He's a little bit confident, overconfident, but he said 'I am going to be, coach.' ... He's been the leader. Xavier (Sneed) has really taken some pride as the season has gone on in being a stopper. We've convinced him of that. And then the other guys just have kind of bought into it.\"\n\nLoyola (31-5) has won its three NCAA Tournament games by a combined four points.\n\nIn each NCAA win the Ramblers found a different player to deliver the big shot in the closing seconds. In Thursday night's 69-68 win over Nevada, only 6.3 seconds remained in the game when Marques Townes barely beat the shot clock with his crucial 3-pointer.\n\nLoyola's 13-game winning streak, the longest active streak in the nation, has left the Ramblers one win away from only the second Final Four appearance in school history. The 1963 team won the national championship.\n\nKansas State will play for its first Final Four berth since 1964.\n\n___\n\nHere are some more things to know about the Loyola-Kansas State regional final.\n\nLONG-AWAITED REVENGE: Former Kansas State player Ernie Barrett, who played on the team that lost to Kentucky in the 1951 national championship game, hugged players in the locker room following Thursday night's game.\n\nKansas State had been 0-9 against Kentucky before the regional semifinal. Barrett, 88, had to wait a long time to see his Wildcats finally beat Kentucky.\n\n\"It means a lot to us and this program, to the K-State history,\" Brown said Friday. \"He's been to a lot of our practices just to be there and see the hard work that we put in. ... We just wanted to go out there and just do it for him. And once we got it done, I knew he was so proud, was so happy ... just hugging everyone.\"\n\nMVC, TAKE A BOW: Loyola coach Porter Moser said his team's success in the tournament should bring more respect to the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of parity in the game, and I love it for our league,\" Moser said. \"There was a lot of talk that we weren't going to get in if we didn't win the tournament, and we know in the Missouri Valley how good a league it is from top to bottom.\"\n\nRESPECT FOR LOYOLA: Weber has tried to make sure his players respect Loyola, even if they may not know much about the team or its history.\n\n\"I told the guys, you can't look at the name, you can't look at the league,\" Weber said. \"You've got to look at the team. They're a good team, and I mentioned they beat Florida at Florida earlier in the year, they beat Tennessee who won the SEC; they beat Miami out of the ACC. So they've got to be pretty good, and whatever they've done here as of late, they're hot.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "CHICAGO (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks played without star swingman Giannis Antetokounmpo on Friday night, but were cautiously optimistic that his sprained right ankle would not complicate their playoff run.\n\nAntetokounmpo sat out against the Chicago Bulls after injuring himself in a 127-120 home loss against the Los Angeles Clippers two nights earlier. He rolled the ankle with four minutes left in the first half and did not return.\n\n\"I can't give you an honest answer and say exactly when he's coming back, but I believe it will be sooner rather than later,\" interim coach Joe Prunty said. \"I don't think it's worthwhile speculating at this time.\"\n\nForward Jabari Parker replaced Antetokounmpo in the starting line-up. The Bucks (37-34) entered the game in the eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff spot.\n\nIn his fifth pro season, Antetokounmpo leads the team in points, assists, rebounds and steals.\n\n\"I'm always concerned with everybody's injury in terms of we need everybody and we need him back,\" said Prunty, whose team dropped three of its last four games with Antetokounmpo in the line-up. \"But I trust that our medical staff is very good and they're going to get him back healthy in the right fashion.\"\n\nThe absence was Antetokounmpo's fifth this season. The Bucks split the previous four games.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

Walker was disciplined for an unspecified violation.\n\nThe 24-year-old Hernandez played 18 games for Arizona in 2016 and four the following year.

He was 4-3 with a 3.25 ERA in 35 relief appearances last year for Double-A Tennessee and Iowa.\n\nPeace, a right-hander who turned 24 last month, was 9-12 with a 3.08 ERA in 25 starts last year for Double-A Springfield of the Texas League and Triple-A Memphis of the Pacific Coast League. He is on the Memphis roster.\n\nWalker, who also turned 24 last month, hit .240 with no homers and 11 RBIs last season in 39 games for a pair of Class A teams. He is on the roster of West Virginia Power of the Class A South Atlantic League.\n\nThere have been 25 players suspended this year under the minor league drug program and six under the big league program: Houston pitcher Dean Deetz, Washington catcher Raudy Read, Pittsburgh pitcher Nik Turley, Kansas City outfielder Jorge Bonifacio, Toronto pitcher Thomas Pannone and Minnesota shortstop Jorge Polanco.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "'Welcome to Zlatan': Ibrahimovic makes play for LA's heart",
                "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic has really always belonged in Hollywood.\n\nThe powerful 6-foot-5 Swedish forward has loomed above soccer for nearly two decades, captivating the world with his sublime physical talent and uniquely outrageous personality. He has scored hundreds of majestic goals, won dozens of trophies and scuffled with a few teammates on his journey from Malmo to Milan to Manchester.\n\nWhen Ibrahimovic officially landed with the LA Galaxy on Friday, he announced his arrival in a new nation with classic, theatrical, Zlatan-esque style.\n\n\"Los Angeles, welcome to Zlatan,\" read the caption on a social media video featuring Ibrahimovic and a lion.\n\n\"Dear Los Angeles, You're welcome,\" said the back page of the Los Angeles Times sports section, with Ibrahimovic's signature at the bottom of the mostly blank sheet.\n\nIbrahimovic has been labeled as both a beloved hero and an arrogant villain during his career of high-scoring exploits, but most everyone would agree he is the very definition of a star. The ponytailed 36-year-old could capture the attention of the world's entertainment capital in a way that even David Beckham couldn't manage.\n\n\"After 20 years in Europe, playing for the best clubs in the world with the best players in the world, I decided it's time to move to a different continent,\" Ibrahimovic said in an interview distributed by Major League Soccer. \"Move over to the U.S., try the MLS. For me, there was no question about it. Galaxy was the team, and I chose them. They didn't need to choose me. I chose them, and I come to do exactly what I've been doing the last 23 years: Winning.\"\n\nHe'll start next week, when the Galaxy formally welcome him to Los Angeles just three games into their 2018 MLS season. If he feels comfortable immediately, he could even debut in a derby against their new archrival Los Angeles FC on March 31.\n\nThe Galaxy are coming off a last-place MLS finish after winning a paltry eight league games last season, but Ibrahimovic doesn't expect the five-time league champions' woes to linger with him leading the line.\n\n\"I want to accomplish as much as possible,\" Ibrahimovic said. \"Wherever I went, I won, so I'm coming with this objective. I come to win. I want to win. I think it's in my DNA that I'm winning trophies. It's not luck.\"\n\nIbrahimovic hasn't played since Dec. 26 for Manchester United, which released him from his enormous contract for the move. Yet he returned swiftly after injuring a ligament in his right knee last April, and he said he has been \"training very hard\" for months.\n\n\"I need to play,\" Ibrahimovic said. \"I'm like a little child that you give candy for the first time, and he's looking for candy all the time, so that is what I need. I need to play, and I want to play, so I'm hungry to play, because it has gone too long now that I haven't felt involved in the game.\"\n\nIbrahimovic also showed his motivation in the financial aspects of his move. He isn't one of the Galaxy's three designated players, instead taking a two-year deal paid with targeted allocation money -- $3 million total, according to numerous reports -- to fit into the Galaxy's payroll structure.\n\nInstead of banking a much fatter check from a European club, Zlatan appears determined to show his abilities in person to millions of new fans on a continent where soccer support has grown steadily for a generation.\n\nIbrahimovic's move also should energize the Galaxy, who will mix him into coach Sigi Schmid's intriguing collection of international talent. While French winger Romain Alessandrini and Mexican forward Giovani Dos Santos might not provide the same level of service as Paul Pogba, the Galaxy starters are among the best players in MLS, and Ibrahimovic must learn how to connect with them.\n\nIbrahimovic also confirmed he hasn't ruled out a return to the Swedish national team for the World Cup this summer despite retiring from the international game in 2016, saying that \"the door will always be open.\"\n\n\"But I think the main focus now is Galaxy,\" Ibrahimovic said. \"I settle in. Get to know my new teammates. Get to know the club. Get to know the city. When I feel comfortable there, you take the next step.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Acting coach Larry Drew said none of the players will start and all will be on minutes' restrictions.\n\nDrew, who is filling in while coach Tyronn Lue is on leave to address his own health, plans to keep his starting lineup intact and ease the returning players into the rotation.\n\nLeBron James, Jose Calderon, George Hill, Jeff Green and Kevin Love were scheduled to started against Phoenix, which has lost nine in a row. Drew said he and Lue will talk again Saturday about lineup changes for the upcoming trip to Brooklyn, Miami and Charlotte.\n\n\"I really didn't want to disrupt the starting five that we have out there right now and those guys will be playing limited minutes, so I wanted to get them slowly back and acclimated to what we're doing,\" Drew said. \"There's a chance that there could be some early substitutions to get the guys in there. I'm not ruling that out, but right now I just kind of want to stay with the flow, stay with what we've done the last couple of ballgames and then we'll probably after tonight we'll see as far as where we stand as far as starters are concerned.\"\n\nThompson missed nine games with a sprained right ankle, Nance Jr. was out four with a hamstring issue and Hood was out the past three games with a bad back.\n\nDrew said he did not know if Lue will accompany the team on its trip.\n\nBut while the Cavs are healthier than they've been in weeks, the team is still missing Kyle Korver, who is with his family in Iowa following the death of his brother, and rookie Cedi Osman, who is sidelined with a left hip flexor strain.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Villanova (32-4) has been even better on defense, holding its first two opponents to 37 percent shooting and less than 60 points per game.\n\nWest Virginia (26-10) is known for its defense, but rode its hot-shooting offense into the Sweet 16 for the third time in four years.\n\nSyracuse (23-13) faces its toughest test yet against the Blue Devils (28-7) in Omaha. Duke has a superb inside-out game with super frosh Marvin Bagley III in the middle and is averaging 85 points per game in the tournament.\n\nPurdue's 7-foot-2 standout Isaac Haas is hoping to get in the game against Texas Tech, thanks to an arm brace quickly engineered by grad students in hopes of meeting NCAA safety standards.\n\nAnd Kansas (29-7), the top seed in the Midwest, faces fifth-seeded Clemson (25-9) on a roll after a 31-point rout of Auburn.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://collegebasketball.ap.org ; https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://www.podcastone.com/ap-sports-special-events\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "body": "In announcing the Justice Department's proposal to ban bump stocks in a tweet on Friday, President Trump blamed his predecessor for permitting the devices to be sold.\n\n\"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks,\" the president tweeted, \"BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced a rule change that expanded the definition of machine gun in federal law to include \"bump stock-type devices.\"\n\nBump stocks, which use the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to simulate automatic fire, came into the national spotlight after a gunman in Las Vegas used the devices in a massacre that killed 58 people and injured more than 500.\n\n\"After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress,\" Sessions said in a statement Friday.\n\nSo, is Trump correct in his assertion that former president Barack Obama \"legalized bump stocks?\"\n\nThe answer is: sort of.\n\nMore: 'Bump stocks' may be new to you, but federal officials have grappled with them for years\n\nIn 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a \"firearm part\" could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.\n\nAdam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told PolitiFact that it is accurate to say the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks.\n\n\"Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,\" Winkler told the fact-checking organization, which explored the issue after the National Rifle Associated said the in October that the Obama administration approved bump stocks on two occasions.\n\nRick Vasquez, a former ATF official who took part in the decision to approve bump stocks, told Politifact that to blame the administration implies that Obama or his then-attorney general Eric Holder were involved in the determination.\n\n\"We never had any political people come down to our office saying we must or must not approve,\" Vasquez said.\n\nTrump is partly wrong about machine guns being illegal. Congress banned the sale of new machine guns for civilian use in 1986 but possession of older automatic weapons is still allowed with a special permit.\n\nEarlier this month, Sessions sent the changed machine gun definition to the Office of Management and Budget, continuing a process that began Feb. 20 when Trump signed an executive order directing Sessions to get the ball rolling on a bump stock ban.\n\nThe proposal will undergo a 90-day review period before becoming final. After that, if the rule is made final, bump stock owners will be required to surrender or destroy the devices.",

                "body": "ATLANTA -- Zell Miller, a former U.S. senator and Georgia governor who established the state's HOPE scholarship for college students, died Friday at age 86.\n\nMiller's grandson Bryan Miller, CEO of the Miller Institute Foundation, confirmed the death Friday. In a statement, he said the former governor had been treated for Parkinson's disease and died peacefully at his home in the tiny north Georgia town of Young Harris.\n\n\"My grandfather passed away peacefully surrounded by his family,\" Bryan Miller said. \"The people of Georgia have lost one of our state's finest public servants.\"\n\nZell Miller served as governor of Georgia from 1991 to 1999. During that time he established the HOPE (Helping Oustanding Pupils Educationally) Scholarship that is still a primary source of funding for aspiring college students to this day and is also used to fund the state's pre-kindergarten program.\n\nThe HOPE program paid college tuition for Georgia students maintaining a \"B\" average and was funded by establishing a state lottery. The program has aided more than 1.8 million students during that time.\n\nMore: Sandberg KIPP scholarship to 'cut through' unequal access to opportunity\n\nMore: Ex-senator Zell Miller gives split-ticket endorsement in Georgia\n\nMiller, a Democrat, came out of retirement in 2000 at age 68 to fill the final four years of a U.S. Senate term.\n\nHe often was at odds with his own party, which he criticized for veering from mainstream values. Many Democrats clamored for him to switch parties after he delivered a fiery keynote speech for then-President George W. Bush at the 2004 Republican National Convention.\n\nIt was the kind of unpredictable behavior that earned the ex-Marine the nickname \"Zig-Zag Zell.\" The moniker initially infuriated him but in later life he acknowledged there was some truth to it.\n\n\"I would be suspect of any politician who doesn't change their mind on some issues,\" he once said.\n\nBush sent condolences from Texas, calling Miller \"an example of service before self, country before party, principle before poll.\"\n\nMiller drew praise from another former president, fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter, who served alongside Miller as a state senator in the 1960s.\n\n\"Growing up in the hills of north Georgia gave Zell a straight-talking approach to politics that left no one in doubt of his views on any subject,\" the 93-year-old former president said, adding that Miller was \"a good friend.\"\n\nMiller worked a succession of state political jobs before winning the governorship in 1990 at age 58, easily defeating former Atlanta mayor and ex-UN ambassador Andrew Young in a Democratic runoff and then defeating Johnny Isakson, a Republican who would succeed him 15 years later in the Senate.\n\nDespite their political rivalry, Miller during his second term as governor appointed Isakson in 1996 to become chairman of the state Board of Education. Miller had just fired the previous board for political infighting with Georgia's new Republican school superintendent.\n\n\"I thought that must be a trick,\" Isakson recalled. \"I couldn't think why the guy I ran against for governor would want to appoint me.\"\n\nThe rousing success of Georgia's lottery for education program probably saved Miller from defeat in 1994 when he sought re-election. He had ignited a firestorm in 1993 with an unsuccessful attempt to remove the fighting banner of the Confederacy from the state flag.\n\nWith Atlanta due to host the Olympics in 1996, the business community wanted Georgia to remove a symbol associated with segregation. But many whites, and most legislators, opposed the idea.\n\nIn a stirring address, Miller told lawmakers it was time to jettison the old Confederate insignia added to the flag in 1956 \"to identify Georgia with the dark side of the Confederacy -- the desire to deprive some Americans of the equal rights that are the birthright of all.\"\n\nBut he couldn't muster the votes and ultimately abandoned the effort.\n\nThe family has not yet announced funeral arrangements.\n\n\"As his grandson, I learned more from Zell Miller both professionally and personally than from anyone else I have encountered,\" Bryan Miller said. \"He was more than my grandfather. He was my dear friend and mentor. I cherish all the time we spent together.\"",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Jeff Sessions proposed new regulations Friday that effectively ban so-called bump-stock devices that allow rifles to mimic fully automatic machine gun fire.\n\nThe move comes a day before hundreds of thousands of people are expected to descend on the capital to call for stricter gun control in the wake of last month's mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school.\n\nBump stocks were not used in the Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead, an attack that has since launched a reinvigorated campaign for tighter gun laws.\n\nPresident Trump, however, called for the Justice Department to act on the bump-stock devices, which were attached to rifles used in the Oct. 1 massacre in Las Vegas, in which 58 concert-goers were slaughtered by a lone gunman firing from a high-rise hotel.\n\n\"After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress,\" Sessions said in a written statement.\n\nSessions' action opens a 90-day public comment period before the regulation can become final.\n\nA long controversial firearm accessory, the devices use the recoil action of a semi-automatic firearm to speed the pace of gunfire, mimicking a fully automatic weapon.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had reviewed the device over the years and had issued opinions determining that the accessories were lawful.\n\nCongress banned the sale and manufacture of machine guns for civilian use in 1986, and machine guns in circulation before then are now tightly regulated.\n\nTrump took on the bump-stock issue in the aftermath of last month's Florida shooting, as students, victims' families and gun-control advocates launch their push for a re-examination of current gun laws.\n\n\"We must do more to protect our children,\" Trump said then, promising that the school safety would be a top priority for the administration.",

                "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) -- France's casual defending was exposed again as ruthless Colombia rallied from 2-0 down to win 3-2 in a World Cup warmup on Friday.\n\nEuropean Championship runner-up France scored twice inside 26 minutes through striker Olivier Giroud and wide midfielder Thomas Lemar. But poor concentration from goalkeeper Hugo Lloris let Colombia back in two minutes later, when Luis Muriel's cross eluded him and went in.\n\nRoared on by huge swathes of yellow-shirted fans at Stade de France, Colombia leveled in the 62nd when striker Radamel Falcao swept in James Rodriguez's perfect cross from the right for his 29th international goal. A clumsy foul just inside the penalty area from Samuel Umtiti gifted Colombia a chance to win, and substitute Juan Quintero slammed the spot-kick past Lloris in the 85th.\n\nColombia's fans, seemingly filling half the stadium, celebrated wildly at the final whistle. France coach Didier Deschamps, meanwhile, has plenty of thinking to do prior to Tuesday's game away to World Cup host Russia in St. Petersburg.\n\nIt must have felt like deja vu for Deschamps. His side twice led away to World Cup winner Germany in November, only to draw 2-2.\n\nAgainst a spirited and tough-tackling Colombia, France often gave the ball away too easily, particularly in midfield. Colombia caused panic with every attack, particularly down the flanks.\n\nEarly on, however, a rout looked on as slick France stretched Colombia with flowing moves.\n\nGiroud's 30th international goal moved him level with Jean-Pierre Papin and France great Just Fontaine, who holds the single-tournament scoring record for a World Cup with 13 goals in 1958.\n\nGiroud got his in 70 games, Papin in 54 and Fontaine in an astonishing 21, although he played in a far more high-scoring era. Only four more players have scored more than them for France.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) -- Trying to address an offseason need, the Arizona Cardinals have signed cornerback Bene Benwikere to a one-year contract.\n\nThe 6-foot, 190-pound Benwikere played the first three of his four NFL seasons with Carolina after the Panthers drafted him in the fifth round out of San Jose State. So he is very familiar with new Cardinals head coach Steve Wilks, who was the Panthers' secondary coach all three of those years.\n\nBenwikere has played in 39 NFL games, 13 as a starter, with two interceptions, 22 passes defensed, a sack, four fumble recoveries and two forced fumbles. He played in 14 games for Dallas last season after the Cowboys acquired him in a preseason trade with Cincinnati.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://pro32.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Conforto goes 1 for 4 in 1st game after shoulder surgery",
                "body": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Michael Conforto received a late-night phone call from New York Mets manager Mickey Callaway, who asked whether he wanted to fill an open spot as Friday's designated hitter.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Conforto recalled responding. \"I wasn't going to say no.\"\n\nIn his first big league game action since surgery Sept. 6 to repair a tear in the posterior capsule in his left shoulder, Conforto went 1 for 4 in a 5-1 loss to St. Louis.\n\n\"It's a good way for me to kind of dip my toe into it and just focus on hitting. Maybe tomorrow we'll see what happens,\" the 25-year-old outfielder said.\n\nCallaway said Conforto will play in the outfield on Saturday. The Mets have publicly projected May 1 as a target date for his return, but Callaway says Conforto is ahead of schedule.\n\n\"That's really Michael. That's probably on him more than anything, and he's feeling more and more comfortable,\" Callaway said.\n\nConforto had not played in a game since Aug. 24, when he swung through a 95 mph fastball from Arizona's Robbie Ray, collapsed and grabbed his shoulder.\n\n\"It meant a lot for the team, and it means a lot to the fans. They know that he's close. Obviously, having Michael Conforto on our roster and playing in games makes us a better team and a better organization,\" Callaway said. \"For him to get to this point in a major league game and is able to go out and compete is a huge step. He's showing us that he's going to be ready at some point.\"\n\nConforto was hitless in three at-bats Friday against Dakota Hudson, and the lefty singled on a curveball from left-handed reliever Sean Gilmartin in the seventh.\n\n\"I know he's got that big curveball. I bailed a little bit on the first one, but I stayed in on the second one and poked it through the hole,\" Conforto said.\n\nConforto struck out on a 93 mph 3-2 fastball in the first, was retired on a weak chopper to the pitcher in the third, then grounded to second in the fifth.\n\n\"I think right now I'm just a little bit late on the fastballs and a little bit more on time with the offspeed stuff,\" Conforto said.\n\nHe homered twice Wednesday in a simulated game, both off southpaw prospects. Conforto played seven innings in center field Thursday and hit for the cycle in his first four at-bats against Houston's top minor league club on a back field.\n\n\"After yesterday, I felt like I was ready to jump in there,\" the Seattle area native said.\n\nConforto set career bests last year with a .279 batting average, 27 homers and 68 RBIs.\n\n\"I've felt pretty good at the plate the last couple of days, played some defense, ran around and done some things, slid into home yesterday and everything went well,\" he said.\n\nNotes: The Mets optioned C Tomas Nido and P Hansel Robles to the minors. Nido, 23, hit .300 in 14 games and could play with either fellow backstop Jose Lobaton in Triple-A Las Vegas or in Double-A Binghamton. Robles, 27, was a key reliever in 2015 and 2016 but slipped in 46 appearances for New York last season. He posted a 9.26 E.R.A. in 11.2 innings this spring. . RHP Rafael Montero (torn ulnar collateral ligament in his throwing arm) will travel to New York this weekend and meet with doctors on Monday to decide when to have Tommy John surgery. The 27-year-old hurt the elbow in Tuesday's game and noticed swelling the next morning. Montero had a 9.00 ERA was was out of options. He will spend the season on the disabled list.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
