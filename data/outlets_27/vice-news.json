                "title": "Jeff Sessions just announced his plan to ban bump stocks",
                "body": "Nearly a month after President Donald Trump ordered his attorney general to ban bump stocks, Jeff Sessions has finally announced a plan to follow through on that promise.\n\nSessions proposed legally recognizing \"bump stocks\" as \"machine guns\" on Friday. Since most machine guns are illegal in the United States, the change would effectively ban bump stocks, which channel semi-automatic firearms' recoil into rapid fire, allowing them to spew bullets like automatic weapons.\n\n\"Since the day he took office, President Trump has had no higher priority than the safety of each and every American,\" Sessions said in a statement. \"After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.\"\n\nThe call to ban bump stocks first broke out last October, after a gunman mutated his semi-automatic assault-style weapon with a fitted a bump stock and used it to kill at least 58 people at a Las Vegas concert last year. Trump, however, didn't call for a ban on the accessories until Feb. 20, after the shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people. (The gunman in that massacre didn't use a bump stock.)\n\nTrump celebrated Sessions' announcement on Twitter. \"We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns,\" he wrote. Banning the accessories is also a move that National Rifle Association (NRA) supports.",

                "body": "The Communications Security Establishment -- Canada's NSA -- has confirmed the findings of U.S. officials that Canadian targets were compromised by Iranian state-hackers, and is conducting its own investigation into the cyberattacks.\n\nEarly Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed charges against nine alleged Iranian state-hackers for scheming to steal data from Canada, the U.S., and dozens of other countries.\n\nThe scale of the data breaches targeting Canadian university researchers, is still unknown, but the CSE says it is continuing its own analysis to understand the full scope of the hacks.\n\n\"CSE is aware of the charges announced today by the United States Government against members of the Mabna Institute based in Iran,\" said Canada's electronic spy agency in a written statement to VICE News. \"The information released by the United States Government is consistent with our analysis and CSE continues to conduct our own assessment with regard to Canadian impacts.\"\n\nOperating under the umbrella of the Mabna Institute, an educational company, which the DOJ says \"employed, contracted, and affiliated itself with hackers-for-hire and other contract personnel,\" the alleged hackers undertook various \"cyber intrusions to steal academic data, intellectual property, email inboxes and other proprietary data.\"\n\nAccording to charges filed by the DOJ, the hackers -- in the employ of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite branch of the Iranian military -- were active between 2013 and 2017 targeting intellectual property around the world.\n\n\"These nine Iranian nationals allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 American companies, five American government agencies, and also more than 176 universities in 21 foreign countries,\" said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe DOJ release said Canadian universities were among the targeted institutions.\n\n\"They successfully compromised approximately 8,000 professor email accounts across 144 U.S.-based universities, and 176 universities located in foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom,\" said the DOJ.\n\nThe FBI contacted foreign law enforcement to notify them of the intrusions.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Iranian hackers allegedly penetrated Canadian computers systems. In April 2013, the Canadian Center for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS), which is under the umbrella of the Ministry of Labor, had its network compromised along with accounts and password information.\n\nThe Canadian government, then led by Stephen Harper's Conservatives, admitted to the intrusion following a VICE News investigation in 2015. At the time, it wasn't clear why the center was targeted, but government officials admitted it was the work of Iranian hackers, but said no critical information was stolen.",

The data analytics firm, hired as a consultant by Donald Trump's campaign, illicitly obtained Facebook data for as many as 50 million of the site's users. Facebook discovered the breach but failed to notify its users.\n\nTwitter users responded to Musk and pointed out that his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, both have Facebook accounts with 4 million and 3 million followers, respectively. Musk responded that the accounts would be deleted. In fact, he said he didn't even \"realize\" the page for SpaceX existed, and he called the official Tesla page \"lame anyway.\" Both accounts appear to have been deleted.\n\nMusk didn't swear off Facebook-owned Instagram, however, because he believes the platform can stay \"fairly independent.\"",

But it would've been all on him, since Congress sent him a spending bill. That wouldn't have looked good for Trump. Top Democrats, in response to the tweet, said they wouldn't make concessions on the spending bill if Trump chose to veto it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump held his first press conference in over a year to complain about the spending bill that he's grudgingly signing into law, averting a government shutdown.\n\nHe'll have you know he'll never sign a bill like this again.\n\n\"I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again,\" Trump said. \"Nobody's read it, it's hours old, $1.3 trillion, the second-biggest ever.\"\n\nCongress put the omnibus spending bill on the president's desk to sign, after it passed in both the House and the Senate late Thursday. After threatening to veto the $1.3 trillion spending package in an early-morning tweet, the president complained about the legislative process and ultimately agreed to sign it.\n\nHad Trump followed through on his threat, the government would almost certainly have shut down at midnight, for the third time in 2018. But it would've been all on him, since Congress sent him a spending bill. That wouldn't have looked good for Trump. Top Democrats, in response to the tweet, said they wouldn't make concessions on the spending bill if Trump chose to veto it.\n\nHe called on the Senate to get rid of the filibuster rule, which requires a 60-vote majority in order to move legislation forward, and asked them to give him line-item veto authority, which was ruled in 1998 to be unconstitutional.\n\n\"I looked very seriously at the veto, I was thinking about doing the veto,\" Trump said as he was leaving the briefing room. \"Because of the incredible gains we were able to make for the military, that overrode any of our thinking.\"\n\nHe spent the press briefing outlining the great gains the bill would bring to the military, including 90 new F-35s (\"That's the most sophisticated aircraft in the world,\" Trump said. \"Total stealth.\"), and some new tanks and submarines. He's consistently pushed for more military resources and surrounded himself with generals and hawks in his Cabinet.\n\nBut Trump couldn't get everything he wanted out of Congress. He said he wanted an agreement on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, to be part of this spending bill, and blamed Democrats for their lack of action.\n\n\"I do want the Hispanic community to know, DACA recipients to know, that Republicans are much more on your side than Democrats, who are using you for their own purposes,\" he said.\n\nAnd he's not getting his wall. Trump has long insisted that funding for DACA be contingent on a fully-funded wall along the southern border with Mexico. The bill does include $1.6 billion for border security, some of which is earmarked for repairing parts of the already-existing border fence, but it doesn't fund Trump's ambitious wall.\n\nTrump had agreed to extend protections for DACA recipients for two-and-a-half years in exchange for $25 billion for his wall, a proposition which Democrats rejected, insisting on a pathway to citizenship.\n\nHe's certainly disappointing some of his staunchest supporters by signing this bill. Rush Limbaugh, reacting to the president's announcement, said \"The Donald Trump agenda just got gutted,\" and \"he's stabbing me in the back,\" according to Newsmax.",

Lakdim was killed, while Beltrame was wounded, and is now fighting for his life in hospital, Macron said.\n\nFrench police have shot dead a gunman who killed three people in a carjacking and hostage-taking in the south of the country Friday, according to reports.\n\nThe man, identified by authorities as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim, was engaged in an hours-long standoff with police after he took hostages at a supermarket in Trèbes. French President Emmanuel Macron said the incident appeared to be a terrorist attack.\n\nThe gunman claimed allegiance to ISIS and had been demanding the release of Salah Abdeslam, the main surviving suspect in the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris. An armed officer eventually entered the building and shot him dead, France's Interior Minister Gérard Collomb said.\n\nISIS later claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nCollomb said the standoff ended when a police officer, Arnaud Beltrame, negotiated to trade places with one of the hostages, then entered the supermarket and exchanged fire with Lakdim. Lakdim was killed, while Beltrame was wounded, and is now fighting for his life in hospital, Macron said.\n\nRead: Everything we know about the ISIS attack in the south of France\n\nThe incident began at about 11 a.m. local time when Lakdim carjacked a vehicle in the nearby city of Carcassonne, about 5 miles from the supermarket, according to Bruno Bartocetti, a local police union representative. One person in the car was fatally shot in the head and another was wounded.\n\nIn the stolen vehicle, Lakdim then shot at a group of four police officers who were jogging, injuring one in the shoulder.\n\nHe then drove to the Super U supermarket in Trèbes, a small town near Toulouse, yelling \"Allahu Akbar, I'll kill you all\" as he entered the store at about 11.15 a.m. (6.15 a.m. ET).\n\nAs police swarmed the scene, Lakdim demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the chief surviving suspect in the November 2015 Paris terror attacks, according to reports. Abdeslam is currently on trial in Belgium on charges relating to a shootout with police ahead of his arrest in March 2016.\n\nCollomb said the standoff ended when a police officer negotiated to trade places with one of the hostages, then entered the supermarket and exchanged fire with Lakdim. The officer was wounded and Lakdim was killed.\n\nOne of the hostages, who gave her name as Carole, told Franceinfo radio that shoppers had sheltered in the supermarket's cold room. \"There were ten of us, and we stayed an hour. There were more gunshots and we went out the back door,\" she said.\n\nThe attacker was known to police for petty crimes, including drug possession, said Collomb, but had not been considered an Islamist radical.\n\n\"We had monitored him and thought there was no radicalization,\" Collomb said.\n\n\"He was known for possession of drugs, we couldn't have said that he was a radical that would carry out an attack.\"\n\nFrance has borne the brunt of the wave of jihadi attacks in recent years more than any other Western country, with more than 240 people killed on French soil by ISIS members or sympathizers since 2015.\n\nFollowing the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015, France suffered the coordinated ISIS attacks of November that year that left 130 dead, and the Bastille Day truck attack in Nice that killed 84 people. In the most recent incident, two women were stabbed to death at Marseille railway station on October in an attack claimed by ISIS.\n\nCover image: French Police officers cordon off the area next during an incident in Trebes, southern France, Friday March 23, 2018.

                "body": "\"All these scenarios pose dangers for South Korea, especially civilians in Seoul, which is within the range of North Korean artillery near the Demilitarized Zone,\" he wrote. \"Any military attack must therefore neutralize as much of the North's retaliatory capability as possible together with the larger strike.\"\n\nThe appointment of John Bolton as national security adviser completes what some experts are calling a \"war cabinet\" of military hawks surrounding President Donald Trump, a move that will raise tensions on the Korean Peninsula before a planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nBolton has long advocated for the use of military intervention to solve the crisis on the Korean Peninsula, a belief that lead Pyongyang to call him \"human scum and a bloodsucker\" in 2003.\n\nAs recently as last month, Bolton dismissed the use of continued diplomatic efforts to bring about peace in the region in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal. Instead, he advocated for three drastic measures: a strike against the Hermit Kingdom's nuclear facilities, a strike against a test missile prior to launch, or the assassination of Kim Jong Un followed by an invasion.\n\nAll these options, Bolton readily admits, would cause collateral damage for South Korea.\n\n\"All these scenarios pose dangers for South Korea, especially civilians in Seoul, which is within the range of North Korean artillery near the Demilitarized Zone,\" he wrote. \"Any military attack must therefore neutralize as much of the North's retaliatory capability as possible together with the larger strike.\"\n\nBolton's appointment comes as tensions have eased dramatically in recent weeks, after a flurry of diplomatic breakthroughs on the Peninsula. North and South Korean athletes marched together during the Winter Olympics, and Trump even agreed to meet Kim Jong Un face to face at a summit planned for May, making him the first U.S. president to accept Pyongyang's invitation.\n\nBut Bolton's appointment, which comes after several recent shake-ups at the highest level of Trump's administration, could jeopardize whatever progress has been made in recent months, analysts warn.\n\n\"I think that Bolton's appointment brings us one step closer to a serious conflict,\" said Robert Kelly, an expert in international relations at Pusan National University in South Korea.\n\nKelly said Bolton's appointment shouldn't be viewed on its own but in the context of Trump's already hawkish Cabinet. Bolton joins Trump's team alongside Mike Pompeo, who replaced former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson just weeks ago, and several other top officials who share a more confrontational worldview.\n\n\"You've got basically hawks all around the president now,\" said Robert Kelly, an expert in international relations at Pusan National University in South Korea. \"I am concerned that we are moving closer to a war Cabinet, for lack of a better word. Pence is a hawk. Nikki Haley is a hawk. Pompeo is a hawk, and so is Bolton.\"\n\nStill others questioned how effective Bolton will be in his new position.\n\n\"I actually don't think Bolton will be all that effective in the job,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute. \"Maybe he's just a malign presence screaming on TV,\" he said, before adding a note of caution. \"Then we have to worry about the kind of stuff he's whispering in the president's ear.\"\n\nReaction in Seoul was mixed Friday in the wake of the news, though Kelly warned that Koreans may not understand the significance of Bolton's appointment.\n\nThe president's office in Seoul looked for a silver lining: \"Bolton has much knowledge on the issues regarding the Korean Peninsula, and most of all, we know him to be one of the U.S. president's aides who is trusted,\" a spokesman said.\n\nHowever, conservative lawmaker Kim Hack Yong, who is head of the national defense committee in the South Korean Parliament, called the appointment \"worrisome.\"\n\n\"North Korea and the United States need to have dialogue, but this only fuels worries over whether the talks will ever happen,\" he said. Hawks abound\n\nIn addition to advocating for a military strike against North Korea, Bolton has repeatedly said he believes China can be coerced into \"either overthrowing the regime\" or \"merging the two Koreas effectively under South Korea's control.\" But that's simply not in China's interests, according to Adam Mount, an expert on U.S. nuclear strategy and the director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\n\"It is surreal and frankly irrational to imagine Beijing, with U.S. forces on their doorstep, deciding to invade DPRK, then handing it over,\" Mount said.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed elsewhere in Asia on Friday. In Japan, Foreign Minister Taro Kono said he was \"a bit surprised\" by the appointment but didn't anticipate any major changes in U.S. policy on North Korea.\n\nFurther afield, in Russia, when asked if Bolton's appointment was a good idea, Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, \"That is not a question for us; it is for the U.S. administration.\" Peskov added that he hoped there would be more people in the White House who \"can see beyond the wave of Russophobia.\" The summit\n\nWhatever the rest of the world thinks, the significance of Bolton's appointment will likely first be felt in Korea, and in particular in relation to the upcoming summits.\n\nBolton previously said he thinks the negotiations will be short-lived.\n\n\"I think this session between the two leaders could well be a fairly brief session where Trump says, 'Tell me you have begun total denuclearization, because we're not going to have protracted negotiations. You can tell me right now or we'll start thinking of something else,'\" he told Washington's WMAL radio station earlier this month.\n\nWhile Bolton may not try to derail the talks, he could use them as leverage to push for more drastic action.\n\n\"Bolton could be strategically thinking two or three steps ahead. It could be argued that [Bolton] knows the talks are not going to work,\" Kelly said, adding Bolton could then \"use a failed summit ... to market a conflict or an airstrike to Trump on those grounds.\"\n\nAlan Mendoza, executive director of the neo-conservative British foreign policy think tank, the Henry Jackson Society, believes that Bolton's appointment will work in the U.S.'s favor during the talks by ensuring North Korea knows all options are still on the table.\n\n\"[The appointment] is more a message to North Korea than South Korea that the U.S. is serious about solving this issue, and will take any and all means necessary if sanctions and negotiations fail to avert a fully armed nuclear state,\" Mendoza told VICE News.\n\nBut as Mount points out, if Trump gives in to Bolton's instincts, the talks could instead lead to disaster.\n\n\"It's hard to overstate how extremist this view is. While there are other commentators that want limited strikes, I'm hard-pressed to think of anyone who openly condones invasion,\" Mount said. \"It would almost certainly lead to nuclear use and the deaths of millions.\"\n\nCover image: South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon, right, shakes hands with U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton during their meeting at the foreign ministry in Seoul, Tuesday, July 20, 2004.

CA is now at the center of a widening scandal for Facebook over its handling of user data in the 2016 election.\n\n\"The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp-wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues,\" Christopher Wylie, a member of the founding team at CA, told the Times.\n\nBolton is Trump's third national security adviser, replacing H.R.

According to the presentation, which can be viewed here, Cambridge Analytica used survey data to target 10,000 ads -- viewed billions of times -- to different people before the election.\n\nCambridge Analytica is at the center of a widening scandal for Facebook, following an undercover report by Channel 4 which showed the company's executives boasting about running the Trump digital campaign in its entirety and using shady tactics to avoid paper trails and congressional oversight. The firm illicitly obtained the data of some 50 million Facebook users, according to numerous reports. After a prolonged silence on the matter, CEO Mark Zuckerberg essentially likened the data harvest to a data breach.\n\n\"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\n\"I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform.\"\n\nZuckerberg said on CNN that he would be \"happy\" to testify before Congress -- and that's a good thing for him, because Congress has asked him to do just that. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, a panel that's supposed to keep Facebook and other tech giants in check, officially requested Zuckerberg testify.\n\n\"Mr. Zuckerberg has stated that he would be willing to testify if he is the right person,\" said Republican Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, the panel's chairman, and Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the panel's top Democrat, in a statement. \"We believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people. We look forward to working with Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg to determine a date and time in the near future for a hearing before this committee.\"\n\nThe FTC and the ICO, the UK's data protection agency, are both conducting investigations into Cambridge Analytica's dealings.

Instead, he advocated for three drastic measures: a strike against the Hermit Kingdom's nuclear facilities, a strike against a test missile prior to launch, or the assassination of Kim Jong Un followed by an invasion.\n\nAll these options, Bolton readily admits, would cause collateral damage for South Korea.\n\n\"All these scenarios pose dangers for South Korea, especially civilians in Seoul, which is within the range of North Korean artillery near the Demilitarized Zone,\" he wrote. \"Any military attack must therefore neutralize as much of the North's retaliatory capability as possible together with the larger strike.\"\n\nBolton's appointment comes as tensions have eased dramatically in recent weeks, after a flurry of diplomatic breakthroughs on the Peninsula. North and South Korean athletes marched together during the Winter Olympics, and Trump even agreed to meet Kim Jong Un face to face at a summit planned for May, making him the first U.S. president to accept Pyongyang's invitation.\n\nBut Bolton's appointment, which comes after several recent shake-ups at the highest level of Trump's administration, could jeopardize whatever progress has been made in recent months, analysts warn.\n\n\"I think that Bolton's appointment brings us one step closer to a serious conflict,\" said Robert Kelly, an expert in international relations at Pusan National University in South Korea.\n\nKelly said Bolton's appointment shouldn't be viewed on its own but in the context of Trump's already hawkish Cabinet. Bolton joins Trump's team alongside Mike Pompeo, who replaced former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson just weeks ago, and several other top officials who share a more confrontational worldview.\n\n\"You've got basically hawks all around the president now,\" said Robert Kelly, an expert in international relations at Pusan National University in South Korea. \"I am concerned that we are moving closer to a war Cabinet, for lack of a better word. Pence is a hawk. Nikki Haley is a hawk. Pompeo is a hawk, and so is Bolton.\"\n\nStill others questioned how effective Bolton will be in his new position.\n\n\"I actually don't think Bolton will be all that effective in the job,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute. \"Maybe he's just a malign presence screaming on TV,\" he said, before adding a note of caution. \"Then we have to worry about the kind of stuff he's whispering in the president's ear.\"\n\nReaction in Seoul was mixed Friday in the wake of the news, though Kelly warned that Koreans may not understand the significance of Bolton's appointment.\n\nThe president's office in Seoul looked for a silver lining: \"Bolton has much knowledge on the issues regarding the Korean Peninsula, and most of all, we know him to be one of the U.S. president's aides who is trusted,\" a spokesman said.\n\nHowever, conservative lawmaker Kim Hack Yong, who is head of the national defense committee in the South Korean Parliament, called the appointment \"worrisome.\"\n\n\"North Korea and the United States need to have dialogue, but this only fuels worries over whether the talks will ever happen,\" he said. Hawks abound\n\nIn addition to advocating for a military strike against North Korea, Bolton has repeatedly said he believes China can be coerced into \"either overthrowing the regime\" or \"merging the two Koreas effectively under South Korea's control.\" But that's simply not in China's interests, according to Adam Mount, an expert on U.S. nuclear strategy and the director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\n\"It is surreal and frankly irrational to imagine Beijing, with U.S. forces on their doorstep, deciding to invade DPRK, then handing it over,\" Mount said.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed elsewhere in Asia on Friday. In Japan, Foreign Minister Taro Kono said he was \"a bit surprised\" by the appointment but didn't anticipate any major changes in U.S. policy on North Korea.\n\nFurther afield, in Russia, when asked if Bolton's appointment was a good idea, Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, \"That is not a question for us; it is for the U.S. administration.\" Peskov added that he hoped there would be more people in the White House who \"can see beyond the wave of Russophobia.\" The summit\n\nWhatever the rest of the world thinks, the significance of Bolton's appointment will likely first be felt in Korea, and in particular in relation to the upcoming summits.\n\nBolton previously said he thinks the negotiations will be short-lived.\n\n\"I think this session between the two leaders could well be a fairly brief session where Trump says, 'Tell me you have begun total denuclearization, because we're not going to have protracted negotiations. You can tell me right now or we'll start thinking of something else,'\" he told Washington's WMAL radio station earlier this month.\n\nWhile Bolton may not try to derail the talks, he could use them as leverage to push for more drastic action.\n\n\"Bolton could be strategically thinking two or three steps ahead. It could be argued that [Bolton] knows the talks are not going to work,\" Kelly said, adding Bolton could then \"use a failed summit ... to market a conflict or an airstrike to Trump on those grounds.\"\n\nAlan Mendoza, executive director of the neo-conservative British foreign policy think tank, the Henry Jackson Society, believes that Bolton's appointment will work in the U.S.'s favor during the talks by ensuring North Korea knows all options are still on the table.\n\n\"[The appointment] is more a message to North Korea than South Korea that the U.S. is serious about solving this issue, and will take any and all means necessary if sanctions and negotiations fail to avert a fully armed nuclear state,\" Mendoza told VICE News.\n\nBut as Mount points out, if Trump gives in to Bolton's instincts, the talks could instead lead to disaster.\n\n\"It's hard to overstate how extremist this view is. While there are other commentators that want limited strikes, I'm hard-pressed to think of anyone who openly condones invasion,\" Mount said. \"It would almost certainly lead to nuclear use and the deaths of millions.\"\n\nCover image: South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon, right, shakes hands with U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton during their meeting at the foreign ministry in Seoul, Tuesday, July 20, 2004.

That was last Friday. When Trump congratulated Putin for his election win? That was Tuesday.\n\nBut even in the Trump-addled news cycle, Thursday stands out. If you happened to blink, here's what went down:\n\nTrump fired H.R. McMaster and hired John Bolton, his third National Security Adviser in 14 months\n\nThe revolving door at the White House keeps turning.\n\nTrump fired H.R. McMaster on Twitter on Thursday afternoon, surprising many of this own top officials, according to Bloomberg. He'll be replaced by John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and a noted warhawk.\n\nRead: What you need to know about super-hawk John Bolton\n\nBolton reportedly promised Trump that he \"wouldn't start any wars\" if he got the gig, according to CNN's Kaitlan Collins.\n\nThe Dow Jones dropped more than 700 points, its fifth largest daily point drop in history\n\nFears of a trade war between the U.S. and China spooked investors Thursday.\n\nThe Dow dropped 724 points, a 2.9 percent decrease, following Trump's announcement that he would place tariffs on some $60 billion worth of Chinese products. China's planning to retaliate with tariffs of its own on 128 U.S. products.\n\nThe Dow plunged further following reports that Trump's top lawyer had resigned because Trump wouldn't take his advice, prompting fears of political turmoil on the horizon. And the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which has tanked Facebook's stocks, is dragging down the entire technology sector, which was down 2.7 percent on Thursday, according to MarketWatch.\n\nTrump's lawyer stepped down because the president wasn't listening to him\n\nJohn Dowd, the top lawyer on the the legal team representing Trump in the Russia probe, stepped down. Trump wouldn't take his advice, he says. Trump had also added Joe diGenova, who's accused the Mueller investigation of partisan bias on Fox News, to his legal team. Dowd wasn't thrilled about that, either.\n\nRead: Trump's head lawyer in the Russia probe is quitting\n\nDowd had been trying to convince Trump not to sit down with special counsel Robert Mueller's team for an interview, which Trump reportedly wants to do. Dowd thinks it's too risky.\n\n\"I love the president,\" Dowd said in a phone interview with the New York Times. \"I wish him the best of luck. I think he has a really good case.\"\n\nAnother woman went on CNN and said Trump offered to pay her for sex\n\n\"After we had been intimate, he tried to pay me, and I actually didn't know how to take that,\" Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, told Anderson Cooper on CNN Thursday.\n\nShe was shocked, she said, adding, \"It hurt me that he saw me in that light.\"\n\nRead: Playboy model who alleges affair with Trump says he compared her to Ivanka\n\nThe interview was her first since she filed a lawsuit against American Media, Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer tabloid, owned by Trump's friend, to release her from a 2016 agreement that she says is invalid. The company offered her $150,000 before the election to keep quiet about the alleged affair, and required any dispute to be resolved quietly in arbitration proceedings rather than in open court.\n\nShe's the second woman to come forward in recent weeks to accuse the president of an extramarital affair. Stephanie Clifford, better known by her pornstar name, Stormy Daniels, was paid $130,000 by Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, before the election.\n\nMcDougal also apologized to first lady Melania Trump, to whom Trump was married during the alleged affair.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I wouldn't want it done to me,\" she said.\n\nGuccifer 2.0, who hacked the DNC, is identified as a Russian agent\n\nGuccifer 2.0, the \"guy\" who leaked the Democratic National Committee's emails before the 2016 presidential election, isn't the lone Romanian hacker he claimed to be, according to a report from the Daily Beast.\n\nHe's reportedly a Russian intelligence agent.\n\nRead: Guccifer 2.0 unmasking makes it a lot harder for Trump to deny collusion\n\nU.S. intelligence figured out who he was, according to the Daily Beast, because he forgot to activate his virtual private networking client before logging on to a U.S. social media website, which left his actual, Moscow-based internet protocol address behind in the social media site's server logs.\n\nRoger Stone, Trump's campaign adviser, admitted to being in touch with Guccifer over Twitter direct message during the campaign. Stone has also denied having had any contact with any member of the Russian government or Russian intelligence.\n\nTrump's tweet was a response to a speech by former Vice President Joe Biden in which he said, \"If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him,\" a response, apparently, to Trump's infamous \"grab 'em by the pussy\" comment from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nTrump's down to fight him, looks like: \"He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nBiden hasn't announced his candidacy for the 2020 presidential race yet, but some of his donors are hoping he will.\n\nCover image: U.S. President Donald Trump listens as Archbishop Demetrios of America, elder archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, not pictured, speaks during a Greek Independence Day celebration in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, March 22, 2018.

(VICE News and all major cable outlets covered the incident.)\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) is pulling out all the stops ahead of what's estimated to be one of the largest marches of all time on Saturday, when one million people plan to descend on the nation's capital to demand stricter gun control measures.\n\nNRA TV has been flooding its social media channels with videos criticizing the protesters under the hashtag #MarchForOurLives, the name student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, chose for the demonstration. Students leading the march want legislators to raise the federal age to buy a gun to 21, close background check loopholes for gun show and online gun sales, and ban assault weapons.\n\n\"If you're too immature to carry a firearm, you're too immature to make policy about firearms,\" said NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch in a video posted to Twitter on Thursday evening.\n\nAt the same time, the NRA is attacking pro-gun control organizations that support the march. They're using the Stoneman Douglas kids to further their agenda, the NRA said in Twitter videos posted on Thursday. Other videos attack the Parkland kids' privileged background and claim their efforts will do nothing for \"inner cities.\"\n\nNRA TV, the visual propaganda arm of the gun lobby organization with the slogan \"Take Back the Truth,\" also deployed a common strategy in its fight against the \"liberal media\": criticizing its coverage.

It's unclear, however, whether Rollins shot himself or was shot by the school resource officer.\n\n\"\"#Maryland's dozens of gun laws & restrictions didn't work, but an armed good guy did,\" NRA spokesman Grant Stinchfield tweeted on Thursday night.\n\nOne of the students injured in the shooting, 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey, died from her injuries late Thursday night. The NRA has not yet acknowledged her death.\n\nStoneman Douglas shooting survivor Jacklyn Corin, who's participating in demonstrations on Saturday, tweeted her support for the students at Great Mills High School. More than 840 demonstrations for greater gun control are planned around the world in solidarity with the march on D.C.\n\nIn the month-and-a-half since the Parkland shooting, lawmakers have passed more gun control legislation than in the last decade. Florida adopted stricter gun control measures earlier this month, despite the NRA's strong grip on the state legislature. The new law raises the minimum age for all gun purchases from 18 to 21, creates a background check waiting period for gun purchases, bans bump stocks, and allows school districts to arm school personnel.\n\nWhile the federal spending bill passed by Congress early Friday morning didn't go as far, new provisions do free up the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to study gun violence and provide funds to strengthen the federal background check system.\n\nCover image: NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch speaks during CPAC speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center February 22, 2018 in National Harbor, Maryland.

                "body": "The self-driving Uber car that hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona Sunday night was back at the scene Thursday night, this time with investigators using it to recreate the conditions of the fatal accident.\n\nOfficials from the Tempe, Arizona, police department, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the National Highway Administration took the self-driving Volvo to the road in Tempe where Elaine Herzberg was crossing her bike and tested how quickly the car could stop. The fatal accident was believed to be the first involving a self-driving vehicle, and the case will be the first to address this kind of liablility.\n\nAccelerating up to 40 mph -- the same speed the car was going when it struck Herzberg -- they slammed the brakes as they approached an obstacle in their path: the bike she was wheeling at the time. The tests appeared to be geared more toward testing the ability of the vehicle to stop than of the self-driving tech, as the car wasn't in self-driving mode during the test, according to the local CBS affiliate. Police told local news they were testing the car's brakes and visibility.\n\nHerzberg's daughter has lawyered up, according to Reuters, hoping to get some retribution for her death. The case opens up, for the first time, about who's liable in the event of an accident involving a self-driving car. (There was a person behind the wheel of the Uber vehicle, who was not looking at the road when the accident occurred.)\n\nStill, the crash was pretty straightforwardly the type of crash that Uber's Lidar sensors -- supposedly capable of seeing in the dark and detecting objects in their path -- were meant to avoid. Why the car didn't brake or swerve to avoid Herzberg, we still don't know.",

Cheney successfully pushed Secretary of State Colin Powell to hire Bolton in the State Department.\n\nBut in front of the Senate, Bolton was a politically polarizing choice and nearly all Senate Democrats and one Republican opposed his confirmation.\n\nBolton's nomination required 60 votes and so the process dragged on for five months until Bush decided to appoint him during the 2005 August recess. Such an appointment is only temporary and would only last until the next Congress in January of 2007. When Democrats won the Senate in November of 2006, Bolton realized he would never be confirmed and stepped aside.\n\nNational Security Advisor is not a Senate-confirmed position so Bolton will get a prime office in the White House regardless of how Senators feel.\n\nBolton later turned on the Bush administration, making Bush dismiss him as \"not credible.\"\n\nSoon after he left the Bush Administration, Bolton began publicly bashing the Bush administration for being too soft and naive in their foreign policy dealings and abandoning the tougher-mind foreign policy of the early Bush years. \"Nothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency, like this one, in total intellectual collapse,\" Bolton wrote in the Wall Street Journal in response to Bush lifting some sanctions on North Korea.\n\nBush did not take kindly to the rebukes, as documented in Peter Baker's \"Days of Fire\" account of the Bush presidency.

However, confirmation of the long held suspicion of U.S. intelligence officials that Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian spy brings the notion of collusion into sharper relief.\n\nTrump and his allies have consistently disputed the claim the Moscow was behind the DNC hack, particularly Roger Stone, a member of Trump's inner circle, who claimed to be in contact with the hacker during the campaign. Stone even released chat messages he exchanged with Guccifer 2.0 last year, in an attempt to debunk claims of a Kremlin link.\n\nStone was already reportedly in Mueller's crosshairs before it came to light Thursday that he was admittedly in contact with a Russian intelligence agent during the campaign.\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump again tweeted a denial of collusion between Russia and his campaign:\n\nEarlier this month Mueller signaled his intention to go after Moscow's agents when he charged 13 Russians tied to the Internet Research Agency, known as the \"Troll Factory,\" with a conspiracy \"for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.\"\n\nCover image: President Donald Trump holds a working lunch with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the Oval Office at the White House on March 20, 2018 in Washington, D.C.

However, confirmation of the long-held suspicion of U.S. intelligence officials that Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian spy brings the notion of collusion into sharper relief.\n\nTrump and his allies have consistently disputed the claim that Moscow was behind the DNC hack, particularly Roger Stone, a member of Trump's inner circle, who claimed to be in contact with the hacker during the campaign. Stone even released chat messages he exchanged with Guccifer 2.0 last year, in an attempt to debunk claims of a Kremlin link.\n\nStone was already reportedly in Mueller's crosshairs before it came to light Thursday that he was admittedly in contact with a Russian intelligence agent during the campaign.\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump again tweeted a denial of collusion between Russia and his campaign:\n\nEarlier this month Mueller signaled his intention to go after Moscow's agents when he charged 13 Russians tied to the Internet Research Agency, known as the \"Troll Factory,\" with a conspiracy \"for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.\"\n\nCover image: President Donald Trump holds a working lunch with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the Oval Office at the White House on March 20, 2018, in Washington, D.C.

                "body": "John Bolton, a controversial former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, will replace Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster as President Donald Trump's national security adviser next month.\n\nBolton is known for his hawkish, hardline stances on would-be nuclear powers like North Korea and Iran -- just last month, he wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled \"The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.\" He'll take office on April 9, just weeks before Trump is set to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nMcMaster's resignation had been in the works for weeks, White House officials told the New York Times, and his exit was far more amicable than that of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was abruptly fired via tweet. Still, with McMaster and Tillerson both out, there are few left in Trump's inner circle likely to advocate for a peaceful resolution to conflicts with Iran and North Korea. Mike Pompeo, the former head of the CIA who will replace Tillerson, is also known as a hawk.\n\n\"H.R. McMaster has served his country with distinction for more than 30 years,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He has won many battles and his bravery and toughness are legendy. General McMasters' leadership of the National Security Council staff has helped my administration accomplish great things to bolster America's national security.\"\n\nMcMaster is just the latest casualty of the Trump White House's record-breaking employee turnover. Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned about a month into the job after allegedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russian officials. Since then, dozens of major staffers have either resigned or been fired from the Trump administration, with at least eight people departing in the last two months alone.",

Trump's opioid chief told the teens to worry less about junk food and more about buying fentanyl-laced narcotics that can cause overdose deaths.\n\n\"On our college campuses, your folks are reading the labels, they won't put any sugar in their body, they don't eat carbs anymore, and they're very, very fastidious about what goes into their body,\" Conway said. \"And then you buy a street drug for $5 or $10, it's laced with fentanyl, and that's it,\" she said, referencing the synthetic that can be up to 100 times more potent than morphine and many times more than heroin.\n\nShe summed up her advice to the group short and sweet: \"As somebody double your age: Eat the ice cream, have the French fry, don't buy the street drug. Believe me, it all works out.\"\n\nConway started overseeing the White House's efforts to combat the opioids epidemic last year, after working as a political adviser for Trump and a Republican pollster -- and now she's being considered for White House communications director. Opioids have become a public health crisis, killing more than 42,000 people in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- that's more opioid related deaths in one year than during the entire Vietnam War. The Trump administration has responded to the worsening crisis by pushing a \"just say no\" campaign and, according to Politico, relying heavily on political staff instead of any drug policy professionals.",

                "body": "Several minutes after Sacramento police fatally shot an unarmed black man in his own backyard on Sunday night, they muted their body cameras, body camera footage released on Wednesday by the department shows.\n\nThe officers, however, kept talking to each other and other bystanders for at least two minutes.\n\nThe Sacramento Police Department released the footage just days after two of its officers shot and killed the man, identified as 22-year-old Stephon Clark by the Sacramento Bee, on Sunday. Initially, police thought the man had a gun. Then, the department said he had a \"toolbar.\" But he was only carrying a cell phone, according to a final clarification the department released on Tuesday.\n\nThe body camera footage released on Thursday reveals the officers did initially consider the suspect armed and shot him within seconds of pursuing him into his grandparents' backyard, where he also lived. The officers also appeared to mute their audio of their body cameras.\n\n\"There are a variety of reasons why officers have the opportunity to mute their body worn cameras,\" Sacramento police spokesman Sgt. Vance Chandler told the Sacramento Bee. The department did not immediately respond to VICE News' request for comment.\n\nThe officers have not yet been identified and have been placed on paid administrative leave.\n\nIn addition to footage from two body cameras, the department also released helicopter footage and two audio recordings, including a 911 call and dispatch audio. 911 call\n\nA neighbor called 911 on Sunday night when he saw what he described as a six-foot tall, thin man wearing a hoodie breaking car windows, including the caller's truck windows. The police department sent officers and a Sacramento Sheriff's Department helicopter to investigate. The caller did not identify the suspect's race. Body camera footage\n\nThe body camera footage starts when the two officers are driving to the location of the 911 call. About 7 minutes, 30 seconds in, the officers begin chasing a suspect. At the time, he was running into the backyard of a home he shared with his grandparents and some of his siblings.\n\nAs the officer takes cover behind a wall, one yells, \"Show me your hands! Gun!\" One of the officers yells again, \"Show me your hands! Gun, gun gun!\" and then an officer immediately shoots multiple rounds.\n\nOn the body camera footage, it's difficult to see the suspect being shot in the dark. But video footage from the helicopter shows the suspect hitting the ground after the first few shots. The officers continued shooting him while he was laying on his stomach, until both officers shot a combined 20 rounds, the police department told the Sacramento Bee.\n\n\"You alright, you hit?\" one officer asked on the body camera footage.\n\n\"Yeah I'm good,\" the other officer responded.\n\n\"He was still pointing when I saw again .... You alright dude?\"\n\nShortly after backup arrives, one officer says \"hey, mute.\" Before the audio on their body cameras is turned off, he said \"hey, you guys good?\" The audio then stops, but the video continues for about two more minutes. The officers can be seen speaking to each other and at least one civilian before the video ends.\n\nThe department has more videos from other responding officers that will also be released soon, the Sacramento Bee reports.\n\nCover image: Screenshot from body camera footage at 10 minutes, 34 seconds, provided by the Sacramento Police Department.\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE News US.",

Two people briefed on the matter told the Times that Dowd has already resigned.\n\n\"I love this president and wish him very well,\" Dowd told NBC on Thursday.\n\nDowd is a Washington, D.C., lawyer with a long history of representing politicians in federal investigations. Some questioned his strategy on the Russia special counsel investigation when he drafted a tweet for the president in December 2017 insinuating that Trump knew that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied to the FBI when he fired Flynn, potentially complicating Trump's defense.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the president Saturday, Dowd called for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to end the special counsel's investigation. He later walked that back and said he was speaking in a personal capacity.",

From the footage, however, it appears that the driver -- identified by Jalopnik as Rafaela Vasquez -- repeatedly looked away from the road in the seconds before the car struck the pedestrian, 49-year-old Elaine Hertzberg.\n\nA spokesperson for Tempe Police Department declined to comment directly on the footage, but confirmed that it would be considered as part of the police investigation into the incident. Hertzberg appears to have been wheeling a bicycle across the street when she was struck.\n\nIn a statement, an Uber spokesperson said, \"The video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with Elaine's loved ones. Our cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state and federal authorities in any way we can.\"\n\nUber temporarily took its self-driving cars off the road in Tempe, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Toronto, the Wall Street Journal reported.",

He shared the property with two roommates. Police found bomb-making equipment in his room and interviewed both of his roommates, neither of whom were arrested.\n\nThe family of Conditt issued a statement to CNN Wednesday, saying it was \"devastated and broken\" by the news.\n\n\"We had no idea of the darkness that Mark must have been in,\" the statement said. \"Our family is a normal family in every way.

                "title": "Mark Zuckerberg just broke his silence about the Cambridge Analytica scandal",
                "body": "Beyond the serious questions about data security, Trump's campaign also paid Cambridge Analytica $5.9 million to be one of its top consulting groups during the election. That suggests Cambridge Analytica may have used the purchased user data to better target its social media advertisements, a factor in Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\nAlmost two weeks after reports that Cambridge Analytica -- a data analytics firm that did work for Donald Trump's presidential campaign -- illicitly obtained Facebook data for up to 50 million users, CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed the scandal in what else but a Facebook post.\n\n\"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again,\" Zuckerberg wrote. He acknowledged that the company \"made mistakes\" and that \"there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.\"\n\nZuckerberg laid out his understanding of events and then pledged three changes to the platform to prevent more Cambridge Analytica-type situations in the future. The company will audit all app developers that collected user data before 2015, when Facebook began restricting access to data from friends of the user. Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan had gathered user data using a psychological personality quiz on the social network before the changes were made. He then sold the data to Cambridge Analaytica. Zuckerberg said the company would ban any developer that did not consent to the audit, but it's not clear what the company will do for developers that are no longer active on Facebook and may have already sold off the data they collected. Facebook will stop developers from gathering user data if the user hasn't been using the app for three months. Facebook will make it easier for users to remove apps and revoke access to their data from apps within the next month. The company will roll out a tool bar at the top of the news feed with the list of apps that currently have access. At the moment, it's difficult to remove apps because the option is partially hidden in the site's privacy settings.\n\nBeyond the serious questions about data security, Trump's campaign also paid Cambridge Analytica $5.9 million to be one of its top consulting groups during the election. That suggests Cambridge Analytica may have used the purchased user data to better target its social media advertisements, a factor in Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\nBefore his post on Wednesday, Zuckerberg had remained on the sidelines of the scandal, even though Facebook is set to brief state attorneys general and staffers on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Lawmakers at the state and federal level have been extraordinarily critical of the company over the last few weeks. Some state attorneys general have begun looking into whether the company broke state privacy laws.\n\n\"Attorneys General Healey [of Massachusetts] and Schneiderman [of New York] have raised several important questions,\" Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local policy, said in a statement. \"We appreciate their attention to this matter and look forward to responding.\"\n\nLawmakers in D.C. of both parties have also been irate. Some have even called for Zuckerberg to personally testify in front on Congress, which the company has avoided in past controversies. Most recently, Facebook's general counsel Colin Stretch was the one to testify to multiple committees investigating how Kremlin-linked Russians purchased political ads during the 2016 election.\n\nStill, the Cambridge Analytica scandal has set off a political firestorm unlike anything the company has ever faced.\n\nFacebook failed to notify tens of millions of people whose user data was compromised after the company discovered that Cambridge Analytica had bought the information. Instead, Facebook worked with Cambridge Analytica to push users to quietly delete their data. Copies of at least some of the data still exists, though, The New York Times and The Observer of London reported.\n\nAfter reporters notified Facebook that copies of the data still existed, the company announced it had suspended Cambridge Analytica from using the platform.\n\nFacebook COO Sherly Sandberg shared Zuckerberg's post and added, \"We know that this was a major violation of people's trust, and I deeply regret that we didn't do enough to deal with it.\"\n\nZuckerberg is expected to further address the issue on CNN on Wednesday night at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nAs the CEO said in his status update, \"I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform.\"\n\nCover image: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the commencement address at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 25, 2017.

                "body": "The Sacramento Police Department keeps changing its story about an unarmed black man two of its officers shot and killed in his own backyard on Sunday night.\n\nFirst, the officers thought he had a gun. Then the department said he had a \"toolbar.\" Then on Monday night, police issued a final clarification: The suspect was carrying a cell phone.\n\nThe man, whom the Sacramento Bee identified as 22-year-old Stephon Clark, was fatally shot on his own property. Officers were responding to reports of a man breaking car windows near his house and said they initially believed the suspect was armed. In a statement released after the fatal shooting, however, police said the suspect had a \"toolbar\" that he'd allegedly been using to break into cars -- not a gun.\n\nIt wasn't until a full day later that police clarified the suspect had nothing on him that could have been perceived as a weapon. He was carrying a cell phone.\n\nOfficers said they spotted Clark from a helicopter, which they were using to look for the person who'd been reported to be breaking car windows. From the chopper, they say they saw a suspect break a car window and run into a yard that turned out to be Clark's family home, according to police statements. Two officers pursued him there on foot.\n\nThey ordered Clark to stop and show his hands. When instead Clark turned around and fled instead, they pursued him. Officers then confronted him in the backyard, and \"fearing for their safety,\" according to the police statement, they fired multiple shots, which killed Clark.\n\n\"The only thing that I heard was pow, pow, pow, pow, and I got to the ground,\" Clark's mother, Sequita Thompson, who was sitting in her living room inside the house, told the Sacramento Bee. She didn't hear the officers' commands. Her husband called 911 to report the shots, she said.\n\nSeveral local authorities will investigate the shooting, including the Sacramento County District Attorney's office and the city Office of Public Safety Accountability, according to the Bee.

Even though he ran without an opponent, more than 20,000 voters cast their ballots for Jones.\n\nRepublicans aren't exactly celebrating.

Law enforcement used cell phone technology to locate Conditt at his hotel in Round Rock, a city north of Austin, according to KVUE, a local ABC-affiliate.\n\nProperty records suggest that Conditt bought property in Pflugerville with his father, William Patrick Conditt, in February 2017.",

One schoolboy had also been released.\n\nInformation Minister Alhaji Lai Mohammed said in a statement their release had been secured \"through backchannel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country.\" No ransom had been paid, he said.\n\nThe army had paused its operations in the surrounding area of northeast Nigeria to avoid casualties during the handover, he said. \"The government had a clear understanding that violence and confrontation would not be the way out as it could endanger the lives of the girls, hence a non-violent approach was the preferred option,\" he said.\n\nThe statement did not address the status of the girls who remain unaccounted for.\n\nResidents of Dapchi told reporters the girls were returned in a convoy by the militants early Wednesday, dropping them off before quickly leaving the scene.\n\nOne Dapchi resident told the Associated Press that the Islamist militants said they had returned the girls out of pity, and warned them not to let the girls return to school.\n\nBashir Manzo, head of a parents' support group in Dapchi, told AFP that the girls \"were not accompanied by any security personnel.\"\n\n\"We will get to know more details from the girls about their predicament while in captivity.\"\n\nFellow Dapchi resident Umar Hassan told the Associated Press that many locals had fled and hidden on hearing the militants were returning, only to be surprised by the sight of the girls getting out of their vehicles.\n\nBoko Haram has been fighting an insurgency for years to impose sharia law in the region, and has regularly targeted schools, which it sees as a source of forbidden western education.\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari had described the kidnappings, which echoed the mass abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in 2014 in Chibok, as a \"national disaster.\" More than 100 of the kidnapped Chibok girls remain in captivity. Reports have claimed the Nigerian government paid a ransom for the release of some of the Chibok girls last year, although the government has denied this.\n\nWednesday's release came just a day after Amnesty International released a report that accused the Nigerian military of failing to act on warnings of the raid on Dapchi. It alleged that at least five phone calls were made to the army and police on the day of the attack, warning them that the militants were coming, but that the authorities did nothing.\n\nThe Nigerian military has denied the allegations.\n\nCover image: Fatima Abdu, 14, Zahra Bukar, 13, Fatima Bukar, 13 and Yagana Mustapha, 15, four schoolgirls of Government Girls Technical College, who escaped from Boko Haram attack, sit at home of schoolmate at Dapchi town in northern Nigerian on February 28, 2018.

In February, Israeli jets struck Syrian and Iranian military targets in Syria.\n\nIran claims its nuclear program has only peaceful civilian purposes, and signed a 2015 deal accepting curbs on the program in return for sanctions relief -- a deal Israel heavily criticized.\n\nSyria has always denied the site was a nuclear reactor and that it cooperated with North Korea in a nuclear program. But the International Atomic Energy Agency has said the site was \"very likely\" a nuclear reactor, potentially built with North Korean cooperation.\n\nJames Jeffrey, deputy national security adviser to George W. Bush, the U.S. leader at the time of the strike, told Israel's Army Radio Wednesday that Bush had stood behind Israel's actions.\n\n\"[He] made it clear that we were very happy that events had eliminated this threat and that if there were any threats to Israel that would emerge from this situation, the United States would stand with Israel, period,\" he said.\n\nCover image: A handout image provided by the Israeli army on March 20, 2018 reportedly shows a before and after aerial view of a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor destroyed by an air strike in 2007.

They did so while facing opposition from the executive branch and the military. Ahead of the visit, Secretary of Defense James Mattis penned a personal letter to U.S. senators, urging them to halt the vote, and warning that such an effort risked straining relations and compromising American interests in the region.\n\nThe Senate rejected a resolution Tuesday seeking to end U.S. involvement in Yemen's spiraling civil war, which has killed thousands of civilians and thrown the country into the \"world's worst humanitarian crisis,\" according to the United Nations.\n\nIn a closer-than-expected result, lawmakers voted 55-44 against curbing U.S. military activity in Yemen, narrowly defeating the bipartisan legislation put forward by Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. But human rights advocates were heartened by what they believe is a growing opposition to America's unconditional support for Saudi Arabia's controversial campaign in Yemen.\n\n\"Today should have been the day that the Senate moved to end U.S. involvement in this catastrophe.\" said Scott Paul, Oxfam America's policy lead for Yemen. \"But it is clear from today's debate that the tide is turning,\"\n\nPaul was likely referring to the timing of the vote, which, despite urgent requests from the White House and the Pentagon, took place just as Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman visited with President Donald Trump at the White House. Trump praised the young leader as a \"very great friend\" to America; hours later the Senate debated the bill.\n\nCongressional leaders sought to use the Crown Prince's much-touted visit to press the White House and its powerful Middle East ally to end the brutal war in Yemen, along with the U.S. military's involvement in it. They did so while facing opposition from the executive branch and the military. Ahead of the visit, Secretary of Defense James Mattis penned a personal letter to U.S. senators, urging them to halt the vote, and warning that such an effort risked straining relations and compromising American interests in the region.\n\nBut there's a reason the senators pressed forward with the vote. Bin Salman may be touted as Saudi Arabia's young modernizing reformer, but he is also widely considered the architect of the Saudi-led air campaign in Yemen, which has had disastrous results for the country and its civilians.\n\nThe U.N. estimates that more than 8,750 civilians have died, with the majority of the deaths attributable to Saudi coalition airstrikes.\n\nThe U.S. has aided Saudi Arabia's controversial air campaign from its inception, refueling coalition jets and providing intelligence and strategic support. The U.S. is also Saudi Arabia's largest supplier of weapons, an aspect of the relationship that has received enthusiastic support from Trump.\n\nWith almost one-third of the estimated 16,000 Saudi coalition airstrikes since 2015 hitting civilian sites, monitors warn that the U.S. risks complicity in myriad potential human rights violations and war crimes.\n\n\"President Trump should recognize that by selling arms to a military force that is likely to use them unlawfully, he is putting U.S. officials at risk of aiding and abetting war crimes,\" Kristine Beckerle, a Yemen researcher for Human Rights Watch wrote in a recent op-ed.\n\n\"This is a deeply destructive war,\" added Adam Baron, co-founder of the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies. \"There's this tension with regards to whether U.S. involvement is either helping to end the war or extending the war further.\"\n\nThe Saudi-led blockade has proved no less disastrous. Today, Yemen is considered the world's worst man-made humanitarian crisis. More than 22 million people need humanitarian aid, including 8.2 million who are on the brink of famine, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nMaking matters worse, a cholera epidemic has swept through the country at lightning speed, infecting over a million people. Some 2,258 people died as a result of the epidemic between April 2017 and February 2018, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nStill, advocates see a silver lining in Tuesday's vote. Gerald Feierstein, a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen during the Obama administration, said the bill was \"a reflection of growing anxiety over the humanitarian situation in Yemen and a sense that Saudi Arabia hasn't exercised its caution as it should under the laws of armed conflict.\"\n\nCover image: A man walks to a house that was damaged during an airstrike carried out by the Saudi-led coalition in Faj Attan village, Sanaa, Yemen May 7, 2015.

                "body": "Zuckerberg laid out his understanding of events and then pledged three changes to the platform to prevent more Cambridge Analytica-type situations in the future.\n\nThis is a developing story. Please refresh for updates.\n\nZuck has finally spoken.\n\nAlmost two weeks after reports that Cambridge Analytica -- a data analytics firm that did work for Donald Trump's presidential campaign -- illicitly obtained Facebook data for up to 50 million users, CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed the scandal in what else but a Facebook post.\n\n\"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again,\" Zuckerberg wrote. He acknowledged that the company \"made mistakes\" and that \"there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.\"\n\nZuckerberg laid out his understanding of events and then pledged three changes to the platform to prevent more Cambridge Analytica-type situations in the future. The company will audit all app developers that collected user data before 2015, when Facebook began restricting access to data from friends of the user. Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan had gathered user data via a psychological personality quiz on the social network before the changes were made, and then he sold the data to Cambridge Analaytica.Facebook will stop developers from gathering user data if the user hasn't been using the app for three months. In the next month, Facebook will make it easier for users to remove apps and revoke access to their access from apps. The company will roll out a tool bar at the top of the news feed with the list of apps that currently have access. At the moment, it's a bit difficult to remove apps because the option is partially hidden in the site's privacy settings.\n\nFacebook COO Sherly Sandberg shared Zuckerberg's post and added that \"we know that this was a major violation of peoples' trust, and I deeply regret that we didn't do enough to deal with it.\"\n\nCover image: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the commencement address at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. on May 25, 2017.

                "title": "Cambridge Analytica CEO caught on tape saying company's Facebook scam helped elect Trump",
                "body": "Still, the revelation likely proved a death knell for the CEO, who was suspended from the embattled data firm just as the latest undercover video appeared.\n\nTop executives at Cambridge Analytica touted their role in getting Donald Trump elected to America's highest office, according to the latest undercover video released by Channel 4 News.\n\n\"We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,\" Cambridge Analytica's CEO Alexander Nix said in the video, adding that he'd met Trump \"many times.\" He pointed to his firm's use of \"unattributable and untraceable\" information warfare as a key differentiator, which allowed them to influence campaigns while avoiding greater government scrutiny.\n\nDespite Nix's boasts, Cambridge Analytica's portion of the Trump campaign spend was comparatively limited. The Trump campaign paid the company $5.9 million during the campaign out of the roughly $325 million it spent. The pro-Trump Super PAC Make America Number One also paid Cambridge Analytica more than $1.2 million out of $19.6 million spent.\n\nA Cambridge Analytica spokesman told Channel 4 News that it \"has never claimed it won the election for President Trump. This is patently absurd.\"\n\nStill, the revelation likely proved a death knell for the CEO, who was suspended from the embattled data firm just as the latest undercover video appeared.\n\n\"In the view of the Board, Mr. Nix's recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,\" the company's board of directors said in a statement.\n\nHere's the key takeaways from Channel 4's latest video. Nix on Nunes and company: \" They don't understand how it works \"\n\nThe video shows Nix claiming to an undercover reporter, who was posing as a prospective client, that his firm had avoided intense scrutiny from American lawmakers because they were technologically illiterate. \"They're politicians, they're not technical. They don't understand how it works,\" he said regarding U.S. investigations into 2016 campaign meddling. He added that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee did little inquiry into the company's activities and only asked three questions. \"After five minute -- done,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee recently announced that they had concluded their investigation, with Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California claiming the committee's investigation was thorough and showed that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian government. \"We spent 14 months on this investigation, looking for collusion. We didn't find any,\" Nunes said on Fox & Friends. The business of influence\n\nRegardless of how influential that company really was in Trump's surprise victory, the video reveals how Cambridge Analytica approached the American election as a model for how they would influence elections in nations around the world. A previous Channel 4 investigation showed executives claiming that they had worked on over 200 elections across the globe, employing shady techniques and various contractors along the way.\n\n\"So the candidate is the puppet?,\" the reported asked.\n\n\"Always,\" Nix responded. \"There's no evidence, there's no paper trail, there's nothing.\"\n\nNix, along with Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica, and Chief Data Scientist Alex Tayler were all filmed describing how they went about injecting propaganda and misinformation into the \"bloodstream, to the internet.\" Their methods went well beyond Facebook ads. The company's leaders explain how they used \"proxy organizations\" to spread their clients' messages. \"Charities or activist groups, and we use them -- feed them the material and they do the work,\" Turnbull said.\n\nNix also touted that the company was able to avoid scrutiny because it sent \"emails with a self-destruct timer.\" After two hours, Nix claimed, the email automatically deleted itself. \"There's no evidence, there's no paper trail, there's nothing,\" he said. Crisis mode\n\nCambridge Analytica has been mired in crisis after Christopher Wylie, a former employee, blew the whistle on how the company obtained Facebook user data of 50 million people without permission. The New York Times and The Observer of London found that Facebook investigated this violation of their privacy policies and asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data. Yet copies of the illegally obtained data still existed, and Facebook never followed up to ensure that the data was secure. The company also failed to inform users that their data had been obtained by an unauthorized third party, according to the reports.\n\nSince Wylie's revelations, a growing chorus of lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic have called for investigations into Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.\n\nFacebook's stock is getting hammered as of this writing, and Cambridge Analytica is likely on the lookout for a new CEO.\n\nCover image: Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica arrives at the offices of Cambridge Analytica in central London, Britain, March 20, 2018.

And Bundo the rabbit could turn out to be a cash cow for the Pences, who are hawking a children's book about the rabbit, written by Pence's daughter and illustrated by second lady Karen Pence.\n\nBut Pence's family values, reflected in decades of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and policy that prompted at least two U.S. Olympic athletes to publicly spurn him at the Winter Games last month -- could end up tanking his family's foray into publishing.\n\nEnter John Oliver, whose satirical news show \"Last Week Tonight\" made its own version of the Pence family's book, with one notable difference -- in their story, bunny is super gay.\n\nNow, the gay version of Marlon Bundo's story is outselling the Pence family's on Amazon, even though it's more expensive, and it's doing better critically, with 3,500 perfect ratings from customers compared to the Pence family's 74. (The show says the gay bunny book proceeds will go to LGBTQ-friendly charities like The Trevor Project and AIDS United.)\n\nAnd the book trolling Pence isn't just outselling its inspiration -- it skyrocketed to the top of Amazon's bestseller list, beating out major books like James Comey's upcoming memoir.",

The Enquirer, owned by Trump's friend David Pecker, used the tactic of buying a story and not running it, known in the tabloid business as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nMcDougal claims Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen was secretly involved in her AMI agreement, and that she was misled about the deal. She also asserts AMI threatened her after she talked about the affair to the New Yorker last month, that they warned \"any further disclosures would breach Karen's contract\" and \"cause considerable monetary damages.\"\n\nThe filing comes just days before porn star Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, is set to appear on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" to discuss her own affair with Trump in 2006, around the time his son Barron was born. Clifford, who said she was paid hush money of $130,000 in late October 2016 by Cohen, sued earlier this month, saying Cohen violated her NDA agreement when he admitted he'd paid her.",

Under oath, he identified the culprit: his wife, Candy Carson.\n\nCarson was speaking before the House Appropriations committee, when a Democrat at the hearing suggested he had made some \"ethical lapses\" -- an assertion that left Carson visibly annoyed.\n\n\"If it were up to me I would decorate my office like a hospital waiting room,\" Carson said, according to the New York Times. He then squarely placed the blame on his wife for making the purchase.\n\n\"I left it with my wife,\" Carson said. \"I said, 'Help choose something.' But I said, 'The money that is going to be used, we need to take care of the deputy secretary's office. And whatever's left over we can take care of the dining room furniture...'

At the time, HUD spokesperson Raffi Williams told CNN that Carson \"had no awareness that the table was being purchased,\" and that it was an internal decision made by government employees.\n\n\"The secretary did not order a new table,\" Williams told CNN. \"The table was ordered by the career staffers in charge of the building.\"\n\nBut CNN obtained an email that directly disputed his claims that Carson didn't know about the table. An email sent from a career administration staffer in August to Carson's assistant, using the subject line, \"Secretary's dining room set needed,\" refers to \"printouts of the furniture the Secretary and Mrs. Carson picked out.\"\n\nAfter the CNN article was published, Williams backtracked, saying, \"When presented with options by professional staff, Mrs. Carson participated in the selection of specific styles.\"\n\nCover image: WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 20: Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson arrives to testify before the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies on Capitol Hill March 20, 2018 in Washington, DC.

The Kremlin statement made no mention of the Skripal poisoning, which UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called \"a barbaric act.\" And Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian newswire Interfax that the Skripal issue indeed never came up.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump called Vladimir Putin to congratulate the Russian leader on his victory in Sunday's presidential election and discuss setting up a face-to-face meeting, both the Kremlin and the White House said Tuesday, despite reports of widespread irregularities in the Russian vote.\n\nThe call -- which the Kremlin described as \"constructive\" and Trump called \"very good\" -- comes less than a week after the U.S. joined NATO allies Britain, France and Germany in a joint statement declaring Moscow \"highly likely\" to have used a rare chemical weapon to try to assassinate former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal on British soil on March 4.\n\nTrump, speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, confirmed many of the details first released by the Kremlin.\n\n\"I had a call with President Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory,\" Trump told reporters. \"The call had to do, also, with the fact that we will probably get together in the not too distant future so that we can discuss arms, we can discuss the arms race. As you know, he made a statement that being in an arms race is not a great thing, that was right after the election, one of the first statements he made. And we are spending $700 billion this year on our military, and a lot of it is that we are going to remain stronger than any other nation in the world, by far.\"\n\nTrump's statement dovetailed with the Kremlin's account, which described the two presidents holding a wide-ranging discussion over a long list of issues including Ukraine, Syria, North Korea, \"the energy sphere\" and ways to limit the arms race. The Kremlin statement made no mention of the Skripal poisoning, which UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called \"a barbaric act.\" And Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian newswire Interfax that the Skripal issue indeed never came up.\n\nThe joint letter endorsed by the U.S. and its allies last week called the Skripal poisoning \"an assault on UK sovereignty\" that \"threatens the security of us all,\" and called on Russia to \"uphold international peace and security.\" And though Trump largely kept out of the diplomatic row, he weighed in last Thursday, saying \"it certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,\" and that his administration was \"taking it very seriously.\"\n\nThe drama did prove beneficial to Putin, however, according to one of his own media handlers. On Sunday evening Putin's campaign spokesman thanked Britain for inspiring voter turnout. \"They put pressure on us at the exact moment when we needed to mobilize,\" Andrei Kondrashov told Russian media.\n\nRead: Don't expect a fourth term to make Putin any friendlier to the West\n\nIndeed, Putin has cast himself as a powerful leader standing up to aggressive Western powers, and his pitch for re-election to a fourth term frequently referenced Russia's hostile relations with the West -- such as in a speech when Putin unveiled \"invincible\" nuclear weapons, or when authorities moved the official date of the election to the anniversary of Russia's seizure of the region of Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said the two sides also discussed the change in leadership at the State Department, where Trump recently fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and announced CIA Director Mike Pompeo would soon be taken over.\n\nA State Department spokesperson who asked not to be named declined to comment on the call directly. Asked about the freeness and fairness of Putin's re-election, the spokesperson pointed to an earlier statement by the White House Deputy Spokesperson Hogan Gidley, who \"addressed this by saying we are not surprised by the outcome,\" the spokesperson said. \"We don't have anything to add.\"\n\nSeveral observers have called Putin's re-election victory Sunday fraught with violations. The election monitoring group Golos said it received 2,972 complaints, and observers closely monitoring web-streamed security camera footage of polling stations shared clips on social media that appeared to show ballot stuffing.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain issued a sharply worded statement criticizing Trump for congratulating Putin on the election.\n\n\"An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\" McCain said. \"And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election.\"\n\nCover image: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump talk as they arrive for the family photo session during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Danang, Vietnam, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017.

                "body": "Trump's statement dovetailed with the Kremlin's account, which described the two presidents holding a wide-ranging discussion over a long list of issues including Ukraine, Syria, North Korea, \"the energy sphere\" and ways to limit the arms race. The Kremlin statement made no mention of the Skripal poisoning, which UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called \"a barbaric act.\" And Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian newswire Interfax that the Skripal issue indeed never came up.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump called Vladimir Putin to congratulate the Russian leader on his victory in Sunday's presidential election and discuss setting up a face-to-face meeting, both the Kremlin and the White House said Tuesday, despite reports of widespread irregularities in the Russian vote.\n\nThe call -- which the Kremlin described as \"constructive\" and Trump called \"very good\" -- comes less than a week after the U.S. joined NATO allies Britain, France and Germany in a joint statement declaring Moscow \"highly likely\" to have used a rare chemical weapon to try to assassinate former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal on British soil on March 4.\n\nTrump, speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, confirmed many of the details first released by the Kremlin.\n\n\"I had a call with President Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory,\" Trump told reporters. \"The call had to do, also, with the fact that we will probably get together in the not too distant future so that we can discuss arms, we can discuss the arms race. As you know, he made a statement that being in an arms race is not a great thing, that was right after the election, one of the first statements he made. And we are spending $700 billion this year on our military, and a lot of it is that we are going to remain stronger than any other nation in the world, by far.\"\n\nTrump's statement dovetailed with the Kremlin's account, which described the two presidents holding a wide-ranging discussion over a long list of issues including Ukraine, Syria, North Korea, \"the energy sphere\" and ways to limit the arms race. The Kremlin statement made no mention of the Skripal poisoning, which UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called \"a barbaric act.\" And Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian newswire Interfax that the Skripal issue indeed never came up.\n\nThe joint letter endorsed by the U.S. and its allies last week called the Skripal poisoning \"an assault on UK sovereignty\" that \"threatens the security of us all,\" and called on Russia to \"uphold international peace and security.\" And though Trump largely kept out of the diplomatic row, he weighed in last Thursday, saying \"it certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,\" and that his administration was \"taking it very seriously.\"\n\nThe drama did prove beneficial to Putin, however, according to one of his own media handlers. On Sunday evening Putin's campaign spokesman thanked Britain for inspiring voter turnout. \"They put pressure on us at the exact moment when we needed to mobilize,\" Andrei Kondrashov told Russian media.\n\nRead: Don't expect a fourth term to make Putin any friendlier to the West\n\nIndeed, Putin has cast himself as a powerful leader standing up to aggressive Western powers, and his pitch for re-election to a fourth term frequently referenced Russia's hostile relations with the West -- such as in a speech when Putin unveiled \"invincible\" nuclear weapons, or when authorities moved the official date of the election to the anniversary of Russia's seizure of the region of Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said the two sides also discussed the change in leadership at the State Department, where Trump recently fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and announced CIA Director Mike Pompeo would soon be taken over.\n\nA State Department spokesperson who asked not to be named declined to comment on the call directly. Asked about the freeness and fairness of Putin's re-election, the spokesperson pointed to an earlier statement by the White House Deputy Spokesperson Hogan Gidley, who \"addressed this by saying we are not surprised by the outcome,\" the spokesperson said. \"We don't have anything to add.\"\n\nSeveral observers have called Putin's re-election victory Sunday fraught with violations. The election monitoring group Golos said it received 2,972 complaints, and observers closely monitoring web-streamed security camera footage of polling stations shared clips on social media that appeared to show ballot stuffing.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain issued a sharply worded statement criticizing Trump for congratulating Putin on the election.\n\n\"An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\" McCain said. \"And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election.\"\n\nCover image: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump talk as they arrive for the family photo session during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Danang, Vietnam, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017.

McManus told reporters that the package was removed and is being handled by investigators, but he declined further comment.\n\nOriginal story: A fifth explosion hit the Austin area in the early hours of Tuesday morning, further adding to fears of local residents reeling from the recent series of bombs.\n\nAn employee at a FedEx sorting facility outside San Antonio, about an hour from Austin, suffered minor injuries after a package on an overhead conveyor blew up shortly after midnight, sending shrapnel everywhere.\n\nLocal news outlets reported that the package had been sent from Austin, to an Austin address. It detonated at about 12:25 a.m. while it was traveling along a conveyor belt at the FedEx facility. Seventy-five employees were working there at the time.\n\n\"We are investigating it as being possibly related to our open investigation,\" FBI spokeswoman Michelle Lee said. \"We can't know for sure until we have an opportunity to look at the evidence itself.\n\nOn Monday, Police Chief Brian Manley said that he believes a serial bomber was responsible for the previous four blasts, which have left two dead and injured six in less than three weeks.\n\nThe first three bombs were delivered in cardboard packages and left in front of residential homes, but were not delivered via the US Postal Service or a service like FedEx. The fourth explosion, on Sunday evening, was the result of a tripwire bomb (a sort of booby-trap), which had been planted on the side of the road in a quiet, residential neighborhood in southwest Austin. Two passersby were badly injured.\n\nCover image: Interim Austin police chief Brian Manley, at podium, stands with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Special Agent in Charge Fred Milanowski, left, FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs, second from right, and Assistant police chief Troy Gay, right, during a news conference near the site of Sunday's explosion, Monday, March 19, 2018, in Austin, Texas.

                "title": "Parliament Hill's weak anti-harassment policies and toxic culture are failing women",
                "body": "A former political staffer says that, after a night of drinking in the winter following the 2011 election, a senior member of the federal New Democrats forcibly kissed her, and it took her 25 minutes to get away. She feared for her job and believed party loyalty would quash her complaint, so she didn't report the man, who still occupies a prominent post in the NDP.\n\nA few years later, in 2016, a different former staffer working for a Liberal MP in a small office said her male coworker psychologically harassed her. She tried to report to HR, but the MP fired her shortly after.\n\nAnother woman, employed by an advocacy organization, found herself pursued for more than a year by a Conservative MP, starting in 2014. There was no anti-harassment policy on Parliament Hill that covered her, which is still true today.\n\nAlso in late 2011 or early 2012, an incident involving Drew Anderson, then director of communications for party leader Jack Layton, left another former NDP staffer shaken. She alleges Anderson made sexual comments to her and pressed his genitals against her outside a bar.\n\nThis would later give rise to a secret movement of female staffers within the party who risked their jobs to block Anderson from Parliament Hill -- a precursor to #MeToo that played out behind closed doors, revealed for the first time by VICE News.\n\nIn an emailed statement in response to these allegations, Anderson said he \"apologized unreservedly\" for unspecified actions.\n\n\"The work to make amends will continue for the rest of my life,\" he wrote. \"I wholeheartedly support those working to bring much needed change to today's political culture.\"\n\nParliament Hill in Ottawa is Canada's centre of political power. Women here often enter politics as young campaign volunteers, and are later hired as employees when their candidate is elected. They work long hours and suffer burnout, hoping to learn the ropes and perhaps someday become MPs themselves. But while in the parliamentary workplace, staffers tell VICE News they are subjected to sexism, harassment, and sexual violence.\n\n\"Because it's so normalized, it's basically part of the job description for a lot of young women in politics,\" former intern Arezoo Najibzadeh said.\n\nOver the last three months, VICE News has interviewed more than 40 women across all three major parties who have worked on Parliament Hill, and reviewed that workplace's current anti-harassment policies, copies of written complaints, and Bill C-65, the Liberal government's answer to harassment in federally regulated workplaces, including Canada's Parliament. With cross-party support, Bill C-65 is being fast-tracked and is now being examined by committee.\n\nThe VICE News investigation has found that weak anti-harassment policies alongside a baked-in hyperpartisan and male-dominated culture are failing women, particularly female staffers. And while Bill C-65 will bring Hill employees under Canada's Labour Code for the first time, giving them another route to report, it will not replace the Hill's feeble anti-harassment policies. Nor will it erase cultural reasons that prevent women from reporting abuse, including party loyalty, small office environments, and the imbalance of power between employees and superiors.\n\nWomen in the #MeToo movement have shared allegations against celebrities, politicians, and journalists, prompting a string of apologies, resignations, and firings. VICE employees themselves have faced allegations -- with The Daily Beast and The New York Times penning investigations in late 2017 calling out the company's culture of sexual harassment.\n\nAs #MeToo emboldened complainants in Canada early this year, several politicians now face accusations of sexual harassment. They include sports minister Kent Hehr, who resigned from cabinet following allegations of inappropriate remarks to a female staffer; former MP Peter Stoffer, who apologized after he was accused of forcibly kissing a female staffer; and NDP MP Erin Weir, who has had no specific allegations levied against him publicly, but has been suspended from his duties pending an independent investigation ordered by his party.\n\nWhile lawmakers in the United States have responded to the #MeToo movement and its toppled politicians by banning relationships between members of Congress and their staff, in Canada, Bill C-65 would cover not only Parliament Hill but all federally regulated employees. The bill would require all offices in Parliament to have clear anti-harassment policies, a third party to receive complaints, and for employers to investigate, report, and record all known incidents of harassment and violence.\n\nBut employees' stories raise questions about how effective Bill C-65 will be on the Hill, once it becomes law. Although enforcers of current anti-harassment policies and MPs across all parties vow that inappropriate behaviour will be taken seriously, staffers say they have learned that winning seats in the next election will always come first.\n\nCentre Block, Canada's iconic Parliament building, is starting to show its age, with cracked mortar and ancient pipes.\n\nPortraits of old white men, and some white women, hang in the hallways and meeting rooms of the maze-like building, which unbeknownst to many, sits on unceded Algonquin land.\n\nThis building will soon undergo a decade-long renovation, but for now, the walls remain lined with asbestos, a toxic building material that causes cancer.\n\nThe parallels are not lost on the people who work here.\n\nWomen describe Parliament Hill as a \"toxic\" and \"male-dominated\" workplace. The term \"old boys' club\" came up in numerous interviews.\n\n\"It's like Mad Men,\" said one current female staffer.\n\nBrielle Beardy-Linklater, an Indigenous trans woman who worked as a staffer here, felt she was an \"outsider\" -- there were few people who looked like her. Fae Johnstone, also a trans woman who volunteered and later lobbied on the Hill, said male politicians displayed \"arrogance\" and \"a sense of entitlement that they deserved to be in this place.\" There are no elected transgender MPs, she pointed out.\n\n\"It starts with you being called exotic because of your eyes and because of your name,\" said Najibzadeh, the former intern. \"And then it grows into things like groping and unwelcome touches.\"\n\nOne former Liberal staffer said her superior repeatedly asked her out, and once commented on a bruise high up on the back of her thigh. She said he fired her after she tried to report him.\n\nShe likened her experience to being harassed by a stranger on the street, but being unable to walk away. \"Imagine you have to stay there and tolerate it, or else you lose your job,\" she said.\n\nAfter a female volunteer on a provincial campaign reported sexual assault by the NDP candidate to the party, police, and media, she believes she was overlooked for a job opportunity with the federal NDP.\n\nMembers of Parliament are the most visible figures on the Hill, but they're supported by legions of staffers, interns, and volunteers, who have emerged as vulnerable groups in the highest corridors of power. They are not protected by Canada's Labour Code, operating under a pernicious power dynamic that has left them feeling unsafe coming forward.\n\nEvery election cycle, staff jobs become precarious. If an MP doesn't win back his or her seat, the staff disappear with him or her. They are lucky to be hired back in another MP's office.\n\nEmployees occupy a lower position in the hierarchy. It is understood that staff \"serve at the pleasure of\" the Member of Parliament, one current female staffer said.\n\n\"It's constantly beaten into you that you're different,\" she told VICE News. \"There are all these little rules that put staffers below MPs.\"\n\nStaff can't walk in certain spaces. The exit directly outside the House of Commons is designated for MPs, and staff can only walk through if an MP holds the door for them.\n\nCommittee meetings are catered and the food is only for MPs. Staff often will wait until the meeting is over and then will eat the leftovers, a former staffer said.\n\nIf a staffer breaks these rules, they are subject to discipline by MPs, their employers.\n\nSome MPs reinforce this power differential, snapping their fingers at staff to fetch them coffee, a staffer said.\n\nReporting mechanisms have improved over the years as more women have entered federal politics and demanded better policies to deal with unwanted comments, groping, and sexual assault by colleagues. As such, there is a framework for staff to report harassment. But employees say they risk their already precarious jobs to report within their own party, even more so if they are accusing someone in a position of power.\n\nAs one current staffer explained, if someone is experiencing harassment and they think there could be blowback from complaining, the best strategy is to quietly find a job in another office as a way to get out of the situation without reporting it.\n\nNot all current staff are aware of how to lodge a complaint. Two current staffers from different parties told VICE News they had \"no idea\" how to report harassment if they were experiencing it.\n\nAsked if she would report harassment, another current staffer alluded to her precarious job status: \"No, I probably wouldn't. I like working here.\"\n\n'A flaw in the system'\n\nIn fall 2016, a young female staffer began working for a Liberal MP in a small office. During her first few months on the job, a male coworker, her equal, subjected her to what she calls \"psychological harassment.\" He ordered her and her female colleagues around, and made comments that \"highlighted the inferiority of our gender, undermined our qualifications and were hurtful,\" she would later write in a letter, which was shared with VICE News.\n\nOn advice from a friend, she began recording her coworker's behaviour. She detailed five separate incidents over a period of eight days.\n\nShe tried confronting him directly, but it didn't help. So she says she went to House of Commons HR. She didn't know it, but she was covered by an anti-harassment policy that came into effect in December 2014 covering employers and their employees. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau takes credit for this policy, saying it was his call for clear guidelines in the wake of alleged harassment by two Liberal MPs that led to its creation.\n\nHR told her she could not file a complaint with them because the current policy states that an initial complaint will \"ideally\" be lodged with the MP, who is the employer, and is responsible for maintaining a harassment-free workplace. In other words, the staffer would have to complain directly to her boss, a male Liberal MP, while she was still on probation.\n\n\"There was nothing I could do,\" she told VICE News. \"I didn't want to make a big scandal. I didn't want to go to the news.\"\n\nShe wrote a letter to the MP, but never sent it. She was \"too intimidated.\" She was scared to lose her job.\n\nHer harasser often referred to their workplace as a \"boys' club.\" It was a small office, so she was easily identifiable if she complained. And she would have been reporting to a man about male behaviour.\n\n\"There was nothing I could do,\" she told VICE News. \"I didn't want to make a big scandal. I didn't want to go to the news.\"\n\nSoon after she went to HR, her MP let her go.\n\nShe believes her boss found out about her attempted complaint from a coworker she confided in, but she doesn't know for sure.\n\n\"He gave me no reason at all,\" she said. \"I don't think I'll ever know [why I was let go].\"\n\nPolicy loopholes\n\nStaff can be excused for not understanding the patchwork of policies that exist on the Hill. All are relatively new, and are still being updated with improved training on the way. But they haven't been well communicated to those who need them most, as evidenced by the current staffers who said they do not know how to report abuse.\n\nThere are numerous policies covering different groups of employees; for instance, NDP employees can report harassment through their union, while staff from other parties can lodge complaints under the December 2014 House of Commons policy, as the Liberal staffer above tried to do.\n\nBut VICE News has identified problems with these policies.\n\nFirst, each one has a different definition of harassment, meaning there is no consistent understanding across the Hill of what that word means.\n\nThen there are gaps between them.\n\nIf, for example, an NDP employee wanted to complain about harassment by a Conservative employee, the two are covered by separate policies, meaning the participation of the alleged harasser would be entirely voluntary.\n\nVICE News asked the House of Commons if there is any way to compel the alleged harasser to participate in a complaint under a policy that does not cover them.\n\n\"Not specifically, but past experience indicates that they would,\" House of Commons communications director Heather Bradley wrote in an email.\n\nFollowing repeated questions about this loophole from VICE News on January 31 and again on February 20, NDP union president Nasha Brownridge said she was working closely with the House of Commons to have this changed \"as soon as possible\" so NDP staff can have access to the House of Commons procedure. On March 1, the House of Commons' governing body, the Board of Internal Economy, agreed to amend the policy so it would also apply to the NDP.\n\nThe House of Commons said it is currently reviewing the December 2014 policy.\n\nIn late February, Chief Human Resources Officer for the House of Commons, Pierre Parent, vented about existing policies during committee hearings on Bill C-65. Timelines of investigations are lengthy: \"I'm dreaming of an investigation being conducted within a two-week period, but that never happens,\" he said.\n\nAnd while resolving complaints in House of Commons administration is relatively easy (with 1,800 positions, it's possible to shuffle employees to reduce conflict), in MPs' offices, he said it's like resolving issues with 338 separate small businesses. He nodded to an issue raised by the Liberal staffer above: \"In your environment, your offices are small,\" Parent told MPs at committee. \"You have your Ottawa office, and your constituency office. If something is unworkable, it makes it very difficult.\"\n\nIf passed, Bill C-65 would not replace existing anti-harassment policies on the Hill. However, employers in Parliament will need to adjust the current policies to make sure they meet the new law's requirements and regulations.\n\nAsked about the above incident with the Liberal staffer, employment minister Patty Hajdu said the new legislation will make it safer for employees to come forward.\n\n\"The legislation says that each employer needs to set up a third person that can receive the report,\" she told VICE News. \"If the person doesn't feel comfortable, or if the MP is the harasser, then there is an alternative person that they can speak to.\"\n\nShe said new \"robust\" training for employees and employers would ensure that, in the future, complainants would be informed of their options.\n\nIf at any time the staffer feels the situation is not being handled appropriately, they can go to the Ministry of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, which would investigate, she said.\n\nWhile this may be true, the bill's current iteration is lacking.\n\nIt doesn't have a definition of harassment, and it's not clear yet whether one will be added -- something MPs have said at committee is a \"big issue\" of debate. The Canadian Union of Public Employees, Canada's largest union, has criticized the bill for proposing changes to the Labour Code so that incidents of violence will no longer be investigated by health and safety committees.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the regulations are not drafted, so it's difficult to see the final effect of Bill C-65.\"\n\nThen there's the problem of parliamentary privilege, which is the legal immunity that MPs can invoke to protect themselves. It would be up to an MP to decide whether to invoke this privilege if they are accused of harassment, Clerk of the House of Commons Charles Robert told committee.\n\nQuestioned by Liberal MP Pam Damoff about whether Bill C-65 will make it easier for staff to report abuse in MPs' offices, Parent was not optimistic.\n\n\"It's a difficult question to answer,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the regulations are not drafted, so it's difficult to see the final effect of Bill C-65. Fear of retribution depends on the structure, and that is why I go back to the structure of members' offices.\" In a larger, corporate environment, he said, \"you feel a bit more secure.\"\n\nDamoff then turned to Robert: If a complaint is \"shoved under the rug,\" what recourse would the employee have under Bill C-65?\n\n\"It's actually too difficult to answer at this stage,\" Robert answered.\n\nLeft out of Bill C-65\n\nWhile Bill C-65 would give staff more routes to report, there are other groups on the Hill who won't benefit from the legislation.\n\nIn 2014, a woman working for a non-profit visited the Hill to engage MPs in the group's advocacy work. Instead, she says she found herself pursued for more than a year by a male Conservative MP in a manner she found \"inappropriate.\"\n\nOn one occasion that was confirmed by a male colleague, the group invited the MP for drinks, and he spent the evening sitting uncomfortably close to the woman and talking to her about his recent separation from his wife.\n\nAfter that, he added her on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, commented on her photos, and sent her direct messages.\n\nWhen her coworkers returned to the Hill without her, they said the MP would ask about her. \"It was the first thing he would ask,\" one colleague said.\n\nLater, in 2016, she was excited to attend a conference in Europe, and posted a photo of a famous landmark. The MP commented \"see you there in a few days,\" making her stomach sink. He later sent her a direct message asking if she was there, but she didn't respond.\n\nShe tweeted that she would be at a certain event, and sure enough, she spotted him there.\n\nShe backed into the corner to avoid him. \"I'm a pretty tough, independent, career-oriented woman, so the fact that I'm cowering in a corner is already so annoying to me,\" she said.\n\nSomeone thanked her over the mic, prompting the MP to walk across the room toward her. \"It's good to see you,\" he said, touching her upper back. She made an excuse to leave.\n\n\"Would I call that abuse on its own?\" she wondered. \"Definitely not. Would I call it harassment? Probably. To me, he operated in this mode of strategically just skirting the line.\"\n\nShe did not report the MP's behaviour because she was not aware of any mechanism to file a complaint as a member of an advocacy group. But she also didn't seek out a complaint process. She had mixed views about his behaviour; she knew it was inappropriate, but wasn't sure it was enough to warrant a formal complaint.\n\nLobbyists and advocates fall under their own employers' anti-harassment policies, House of Commons communications director Heather Bradley said. In other words, they are not covered by any parliamentary anti-harassment policies, so their organization would have to work with employers, such as the Conservative MP, to resolve issues of alleged harassment.\n\nBill C-65 will do nothing to improve the situation on the ground for lobbyists, who often engage with MPs at events involving alcohol.\n\nAnd it will not improve policies for MPs facing harassment, either.\n\nCurrently, they can lodge harassment complaints through a House of Commons policy passed in June 2015 that covers MP-to-MP harassment. But it only applies to sexual harassment, which is defined narrowly as: \"unwanted conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment.\" Parent noted at committee this is a \"very short definition\" of sexual harassment, compared to those found in other policies.\n\n\"People will make decisions based on protecting their party, and people get caught in that big bulldozer.\"\n\nAnother issue with the June 2015 MP-to-MP policy is that, unlike the December 2014 policy, there is no requirement to report annually on the number of complaints, making it difficult to assess its effectiveness.\n\nA sub-committee is now reviewing the policy, the House of Commons said.\n\nMPs face a high hurdle to report harassment, they told VICE News. \"Everything is so tainted by partisanship that it makes it almost impossible [to report],\" said one former NDP MP. \"People will make decisions based on protecting their party, and people get caught in that big bulldozer.\"\n\nGuerilla tactics\n\nSome women, fed up with abuse on the Hill and underserved by policy, have taken matters into their own hands.\n\nVICE News has learned of a movement of female staffers within the NDP who, in a show of solidarity, risked their jobs to expel a senior staffer for alleged inappropriate behaviour.\n\nBack in early 2011 or late 2012, Jessica Mitchell was a new staffer on the Hill, working for the NDP.\n\nOne evening she was at Brixton's Pub, the NDP's unofficial bar near Parliament Hill. Long hours on the Hill spill over to the dive bar, where alcohol fuels interactions.\n\n\"Brixton's is the office, not the bar,\" Mitchell said.\n\nWhen she went outside to smoke, Drew Anderson, then director of communications for NDP leader Jack Layton, followed her out. There, he made \"explicit sexual remarks\" to her, she told VICE News. She can't recall his exact words, but says it wasn't the first time he made sexual comments that left her feeling uncomfortable.\n\nThen Mitchell says Anderson pulled her close and pressed his groin against her. He had an erection. A friend and former coworker of Mitchell's confirmed she told him about details of the alleged incident shortly after it occurred.\n\nShe pulled back, but not abruptly. There were other male coworkers there, and she wanted to be seen as \"one of the guys.\"\n\n\"I remember feeling like this discredited me professionally because they had seen it and I hadn't known exactly how to react when it happened.\"\n\nShe avoided Anderson after that, even though her job required her to communicate with him on issues including party messaging.\n\n\"You're afraid that if you contact this person that they're either going to want something from you or treat you like a pariah.\"\n\nShe did not report it at the time because, she said, \"I knew it wouldn't be taken seriously.\"\n\n\"And I didn't take it seriously.\"\n\nAnderson apologized for unspecified actions in a statement emailed to VICE News.\n\n'People were in tears'\n\nIt was only after sexual assault allegations first broke against radio host Jian Ghomeshi, in the fall of 2014, that Mitchell reconsidered Anderson's actions. Ghomeshi was later acquitted on four counts of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking.\n\nIn December 2014, she and other women brought concerns to the party about Anderson's alleged inappropriate behaviour.\n\n\"It was more than grassroots. It felt guerilla,\" she says of the movement.\n\nAnderson had left the Hill, but was being brought back ahead of the 2015 election alongside party leader Tom Mulcair.\n\nBy this time, the party was aware of his alleged behaviour -- the NDP's national director and deputy national director had apologized to a woman in a letter after she said Anderson hit on her at the party's 2012 national convention, according to the National Post. At the time of the incident, Anderson was working at the University of Ottawa.\n\nWhen they heard he was coming back, female staffers rallied.\n\nThey contacted the chair of the NDP women's caucus, who told VICE News she later spoke to Anne McGrath, who was then National Director of the NDP. The staffers also invited the women's committee of the union to an emergency meeting, seeking the authority and protection the committee could give them. As the 2015 election approached, they were risking their jobs and going against party loyalty.\n\nAn email confirms the meeting was held around December 16, 2014. Mitchell and other sources say the meeting concerned Anderson's return and his behaviour. About 20 to 30 women attended the meeting, with more on a conference call, sources said.\n\n\"People were in tears, they were very upset at the turn of events,\" said one woman who called into the meeting.\n\nAs a result, the women's committee agreed to draft a letter outlining their concerns. The chair of the women's committee, Jenn Prosser, would send the letter to McGrath.\n\nThere were several drafts of the letter. One version, obtained by VICE News, lists the NDP's pro-women commitments, including ordering an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women, and states that the rehiring of Anderson, through a subcontractor, \"goes against everything our party stands for.\"\n\n\"What credibility do we have as New Democrats if the party's executive ignores these principles?\" the draft version of the letter asks. \"Knowing exactly whom they were hiring, and doing it covertly to boot, the party has chosen to endanger women's health and safety by forcing them to work with Mr. Anderson.\"\n\nFollowing allegations arising from the 2012 convention, the party promised to draft new protocols for fundraising events to prevent harassment. \"We are still waiting to see these protocols,\" the 2014 letter states.\n\n\"We will never agree to shut up for the good of the party,\"\n\n\"You have a moral and social responsibility ... to reassure us that you do in fact consider such behaviour unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Someone who has the audacity to commit such behaviour and who takes advantage of his position of power is not welcome among us, and never will be. Out of respect for the women of this party, we therefore request that you seek out expertise elsewhere.\"\n\n\"We will never agree to shut up for the good of the party,\" the letter states. \"...We expect you to respond within 15 days otherwise further action will be taken.\"\n\nProsser told VICE News she does not have a copy of the final letter, saying any hard copies would likely have been destroyed, but confirmed she sent it to McGrath. She said she believed the language would have been more carefully worded in the final version, and that they would have given a shorter timeline, and directly asked for Anderson to not be hired back. VICE News was unable to verify what the final version of the letter said.\n\nBefore they sent the letter, it was printed out so that staff could read it without risk of it being leaked.\n\nTwo sources said the women's committee chair dragged her feet in sending the letter. They checked in with her more than a week later, but she hadn't sent it. They had to \"insist upon it.\"\n\n\"The resistance we encountered was really a cultural thing,\" one source said. \"There was a culture that wanted to protect the reputation of the party.\"\n\nAfter they pressed her, the chair assured them she had sent the letter.\n\n\"In this case we were able to overcome this particular part of the culture,\" the source said.\n\nProsser remembers it differently. She says she sent the letter to McGrath after having a conversation with her. Prosser says that \"maybe my process would have taken longer than some folks would have liked.\" She says she was new in her role with the union, there was no clear process to follow, and she and others were concerned about the letter leaking. She said that a leak would have violated the privacy of members, and the reputation of the party -- \"because that is drilled into you.\"\n\nMcGrath declined to comment to VICE News on the record.\n\nShortly after the letter was sent, the staffers heard Anderson would not return.\n\nAsked by VICE News about the movement of women who prevented his return to the Hill, Anderson did not address specific allegations, but noted that he was last on staff in politics six years ago. \"At that time in my life I did not always treat people in an appropriate or respectful manner and alcohol was a negative factor in my life...\" he said.\n\n\"I am grateful for my friends and colleagues who intervened years ago,\" Anderson said. \"They provided me the impetus to change, and since then I have proactively focused on examining my own attitudes, on living alcohol free and on being a better model to my family and those around me. The work to make amends will continue for the rest of my life.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly support those working to bring much needed change to today's political culture.\"\n\n'Brick by brick'\n\nIn the halls of Centre Block on Parliament Hill, a staffer discussed its upcoming renovation. \"This whole place is going to have to be taken apart brick by brick,\" she said.\n\nThe fix needed here is not cosmetic, it is structural. When it comes to reporting harassment, improved training is a necessary step, as are efforts to bring parliamentary employees under the Canadian Labour Code. But this still won't address fundamental problems, including party loyalty, small offices, or the small number of women in positions of power.\n\nWith such a high bar to report abuse, the Hill exists in a catch-22 scenario. Because existing policy cannot account for cultural issues, women know it is not safe to speak up. And because they don't speak up, the culture of harassment continues.\n\nThis is why survivors coming out through the #MeToo movement, and its precursor within the NDP, are the best hope for change in Canadian politics.\n\nContact the reporter: hilary.beaumont@vice.com",

There have been no fatalities.\n\nThe school is no longer on lockdown, Kristee Boyle, a security specialist for St. Mary's County Public Schools, told VICE News.

In the meantime, there will be an extra police presence at Great Mills High to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nTuesday's shooting at Great Mills High School marks the 11th time a gun has been fired in a K-12 school since the Parkland mass shooting, according to The Trace, a nonprofit that studies gun violence.\n\nParkland survivors, many of whom have since become gun control advocates, tweeted out their support for students at Great Mills High School.\n\nCover image: Deputies, federal agents and rescue personnel, converge on Great Mills High School, the scene of a shooting, Tuesday morning, March 20, 2018 in Great Mills, Md.

French businessman Alexandre Djouhri, who was closely connected to Sarkozy's 2007 campaign, was also recently arrested in London on a warrant issued by France \"for offenses of fraud and money laundering.\"\n\nFrance has a campaign finance limit of $26 million, and no foreign contributions are allowed.\n\nSarkozy's relationship with Gaddafi was complex. Months after becoming president, Sarkozy honored the Libyan leader with a state visit. However, by 2010 France was leading a NATO offensive against Gaddafi's troops, helping rebel fighters topple the regime in 2011.\n\nCover image: French President Nicolas Sarkozy is welcomed by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafiupon his arrival in Tripoli 25 July 2007.

Now, it will have to prove the law can stand up in court.\n\nOn Monday, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant followed through on his promise to sign into law a bill that bans nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. No other state bans abortion so early on in pregnancy.\n\n\"I am committed to making Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child, and this bill will help us achieve that goal,\" Bryant, a Republican, tweeted Monday evening alongside a video of him signing the bill.\n\nThe law, which took effect instantly, forbids people from getting abortions after 15 weeks, even if the pregnancy is the result of incest or rape. Now abortion providers will only be able to perform the procedure after 15 weeks if the fetus has a health problem that makes it \"incompatible with life,\" or if the pregnant woman's life or \"major bodily function\" is endangered.\n\nIn the video, Bryant is seen telling the people surrounding his desk, \"We'll probably sued here in about a half hour.\" Looking up at the camera, he adds, \"That'll be fine with me.\"\n\nBryant's prediction wasn't too far off: Within hours of the bill becoming law, the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit on behalf of the state's only abortion clinic, the Jackson Women's Health Organization, and asked a U.S. district judge to immediately halt the ban's implementation.\n\n\"Under decades of Supreme Court precedent, the State of Mississippi cannot ban abortion priority to viability, regardless of what exceptions are provided to the ban,\" the lawsuit argues. \"Accordingly, the ban is unconstitutional as applied to all women seeking pre-viability abortions after 15 weeks.\"\n\nPrior to the ban, abortion was illegal in Mississippi after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but Jackson Women's Health Organization only performed abortions up until just over 16 weeks' of pregnancy. If the law is not halted, the clinic's manager estimates it will potentially affect about 200 women per year, Ashley Gray, a state policy adviser for the Center for Reproductive Rights, told VICE News earlier this month.\n\nHowever, Mississippi isn't the first state to attempt to ban abortion so early on in a pregnancy, Gray said. North Dakota recently tried to enforce a six week ban on abortion, while Arkansas sought to ban abortion after 12 weeks. Courts struck down both laws.\n\n\"We've seen these bans may come to the governors' desk,\" Gray said. \"But usually they're vetoed because they're so unconstitutional and they prefer to save the taxpayers in this state a hefty legal charge.\"\n\nCover image: Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant (L) looks on during a meeting of the National Governors Association at the White House in Washington, DC, February 23, 2015.

                "body": "Read: Cambridge Analytica bragged about using fake news, bribes, and Ukrainian hookers to influence elections\n\nWatch a version of this interview on VICE News Tonight, which airs on HBO weekdays at 7:30 p.m. EST.\n\nLONDON -- Christopher Wylie played a big role in building one of the most effective political weapons of the digital age. Now he's trying to make amends.\n\nThe 28-year-old London-based Canadian is defying a non-disclosure agreement to blow the whistle on his former employer Cambridge Analytica, the controversial political analytics firm known for its work on Donald Trump's presidential campaign in the U.S. and Uhuru Kenyatta's in Kenya. He says the U.K.-based company, which he helped found in 2013, has built a powerful software program to predict and influence the choices of voters by using data harvested from 50 million leaked Facebook profiles.\n\nThe data was collected by an app called thisisyourdigitallife, owned by the Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, which was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Users were paid to take a personality test, which they were told would be used for academic research. They might not have known that it also harvested information on their Facebook friends, creating a vast data set that was ultimately sold by Kogan to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nRead: Cambridge Analytica bragged about using fake news, bribes, and Ukrainian hookers to influence elections\n\nFacebook says that by selling the information to Cambridge Analytica, Kogan broke its rules, and it removed the app from the site in 2015. Kogan and Wylie had all given it assurances at the time that the data had been destroyed. But on Friday it said it had since received reports that this may not have been true, and that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie from the site while it investigated further.\n\nWylie spoke to VICE News in London Monday on his regrets about the new political reality he helped create, Facebook's role in electoral upheaval around the world, and what he hopes comes from his revelations.\n\nThis segment originally aired March 19, 2018, on VICE News Tonight on HBO.\n\nCambridge Analytica is a company that builds algorithms to profile the psychology of people. It was birthed out of a company based in London called SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories) Group, which is a military contractor that works in information operations around the world.\n\nCambridge Analytica is essentially the digitization of information operations whereby it harvests lots of data on people and builds algorithms that profile personality traits, political views, behaviors that you might have, takes that information and creates a web of disinformation.\n\nIt did so by misappropriating at least 50 million Facebook records.\n\nThe important thing for people to understand is that Cambridge Analytica isn't just a normal political consultancy. Its origins are in rumor campaigns, fake news, disinformation all around the world.\n\nWhat's the difference between this and how the Democrats used social media for targeting under Obama?\n\nFirst of all, Obama didn't win because of disinformation.\n\nThe fundamental difference between standard political targeting and information operations is this idea of informational dominance.\n\nThe idea of informational dominance is that I inject my messaging in all the streams of information around my target so that they start to think, they start to perceive things that aren't necessarily true ... And they go and behave in a particular way that I've led them to.\n\nWhat Cambridge Analytica has managed to do is digitize that and make it programmatic.\n\nWhat are Cambridge Analytica's links with Russia?\n\nWhen I was there, we were interfacing with a company called Lukoil, which is the second-largest oil company in Russia.\n\nWe were pitching microtargeting. Fundamentally we made them aware that we were building a massive data set of private data of American citizens and psychological profiling algorithms and finding out the most impactful way to influence the minds of citizens in America.\n\nThat information then went to a very senior level of the company. This is a company that has very public links with the FSB.\n\nAt the time, I thought it was really weird that we were interfacing with this oil company, particularly when I saw (Cambridge Analytica CEO) Alexander (Nix)'s slide deck to them, which started with some of their experience in Africa, where the first slide was on rumor campaigns. The second slide was on a voter inoculation. It was on making people distrust civic institutions and the validity of elections.\n\nIn addition to that, the professor that we were engaging to run this harvesting program (Global Science Research head Aleksandr Kogan) was working at the same time on a project in Russia, funded by the Russians, on profiling psychology of people. And for me, that's really concerning.\n\nI am not saying that ... anybody knowingly colluded with Russians. But we made it pretty damn well clear to very connected Russians what the hell we were doing. What I'm saying is that the company was pretty damn reckless.\n\nWhat was Steve Bannon's role in the company?\n\nSteve was really interested in... how to change the American culture.\n\nThat's what Breitbart was originally set up to do, although Breitbart was sort of failing in expanding beyond its fairly niche segments of angry conservative men. Steve wanted a company that could build him an arsenal of weapons to engage in this sort of cultural combat that he wanted to do.\n\nHow culpable is Facebook for what happened?\n\nFacebook is not just a social network any more. It's a battlefield that states are going to try to operate on.\n\nI'm not going to blame Facebook for getting caught off-guard. They're a tech company in Silicon Valley; they don't necessarily think about geopolitics. So I don't blame them for that.\n\nI think more broadly we need to have a conversation - obviously the CEO of Facebook has a very important voice in that conversation.\n\nIt sounds like you are frustrated with their response?\n\nYou can't on one hand say it's not a breach, and then on the other hand say it's a violation and we're going to investigate it because it's a very serious matter. You can't have it both ways.\n\nThe only reason Facebook is taking action is because I've gone public. For me, it's frustrating to be battling a platform that I agreed to help. The people we really should be focusing on are Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nWhy are you coming forward now?\n\nAfter I left (in late 2014), Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue me. So I had to sign an NDA back in 2015 saying I wouldn't talk to the media about anything I saw there.\n\nFrankly it's intimidating having a billionaire (Cambridge Analytica backer Robert Mercer) threaten to sue you.\n\nBut that was before 2016 happened, the rise of the alt-right and Donald Trump and a lot of the vitriolic, nativist discourse we're seeing.\n\nMy life was pretty chill before this; I didn't need to take on a billionaire and now apparently the most important social network in the world. But I think it's really important that people look at this because the integrity of our democratic process is at stake.\n\nBut let me be super clear: I accept that I have a lot of responsibility. A lot of this was my fault. But it is not solely my fault. This happened on Facebook's watch, and more fundamentally this was funded, authorized, approved, and encouraged by Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nI let my curiosity get the better of me. I should have done a much better job of due diligence, a much better job at ensuring we had an ethical framework in place.\n\nBut... the culture of the company...I fell into that culture, that's not to excuse it. I accept blame for that.\n\nWhat does this mean for the future?\n\nThere's an element of inevitability in state actors using the internet to influence democracies in other parts of the world.\n\nWhat I would say is this isn't new; it's just new for the West. The internet has made the American electorate accessible to a lot of other countries.\n\nHas this broken the model for democracy?\n\nI would never want to say democracy is broken. The fact we can have this conversation means it isn't. But things won't be like before.\n\nSo we need to think about this more broadly. Whether it's a regulatory legal framework or whether we consider the integrity of our national elections as a national security issue, these are things legislators need to talk about.",

                "body": "Website users are prompted to share their stories by uploading a video about how they \"overcame addiction, volunteered at a recovery center, or worked as a family to help a loved one get on the path to recovery.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump unveiled his plan to combat the opioid epidemic on Monday by spending \"the most money ever on the opioid crisis,\" primarily on commercials to raise awareness on the dangers of opioid misuse.\n\n\"Spending a lot of money on great commercials to show how bad it is,\" Trump said. \"You scare them from ending up like the people in the commercials.\"\n\nThe plan to fight the opioid epidemic by releasing ads on TV isn't a surprising solution coming from a 72-year-old former reality TV star. In the 1980s and '90s, the government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an unsuccessful \"Just Say No\" campaign.\n\nAlong with the funding for ads, Trump unveiled a new website that allows families of addicts to share their stories -- and in order to do so, users must grant the U.S. Government license to \"use, edit, display, publish, broadcast, transmit, post, or otherwise distribute\" their videos. The website, crisisnextdoor.gov, is named after the term Trump's administration has been using for the opioid epidemic.\n\nWebsite users are prompted to share their stories by uploading a video about how they \"overcame addiction, volunteered at a recovery center, or worked as a family to help a loved one get on the path to recovery.\"\n\nThe site says \"opioids killed more people last year than either car accidents or gun violence.\" More Americans died at the hands of opioids in 2016 than did during the entire Vietnam War. Opioids killed more than 42,000 people in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut the Trump administration isn't digging for statistical data. It wants stories from regular Americans that pull at the heartstrings. These sorts of emotional stories aren't uncommon in politics, and Trump routinely utlitizes anecdotal stories from voters to advance his agenda. In his State of the Union address alone, he told the story of New Mexico police officer Ryan Holets and his wife, who adopted an unborn child of a heroin user he'd encountered while on duty. Later, he told the story of two teenagers who were killed by MS-13 gang members. The girls' parents watched from the audience as guests of the president.\n\nTrump continued that tactic on Monday, when he invited the parents of an opioid addict to the stage during a rally in New Hampshire to share the story of how their son died because of his addiction. Trump used their appearance as a launchpad for a three-pronged plan to reduce opioid use in the U.S., starting with an advertising campaign to increase education and prevention.\n\nTrump said the plan also includes increasing federal funding for treatment, and helping addicts find jobs. He also praised Adapt Pharma's pledge to give colleges free doses of Narcan, a drug that treats people who overdose on opioids. Adapt Pharma does this in partnership with the Clinton Foundation, an organization Trump has called \"outright corrupt,\" according to Mic.\n\nTrump also proffered one of his controversial solutions, calling on Congress and the Department of Justice to seek harsher punishments for drug traffickers, including the death penalty.\n\n\"If we don't get tough on drug dealers, we're wasting our time,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And that toughness includes the death penalty. Some of these drug dealers will kill thousands of people, thousands of people, and destroy many more lives than that.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly spoken out in support of executing drug dealers, expressing admiration for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has overseen the death of around 12,000 people suspected of trafficking or dealing drugs, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nBut many experts disagree with Trump's assessment.\n\n\"How many folks are we willing to murder?\" retired Major Neill Franklin, the executive director of Law Enforcement Action Partnership, said in a press call on Monday. \"My heart goes out to the president... but executing people for selling drugs is absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nCover image: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to supporters and local politicians at an event at Manchester Community College on March 19, 2018 in Manchester, New Hampshire.

                "body": "Vladimir Putin scored a resounding victory in Russia's presidential election Sunday, and his campaign spokesman welcomed the good news by thanking an unlikely helper: the nation of Britain, which had spent the last week publicly accusing Moscow of poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil with a chemical weapon.\n\nAll that drama really helped get out the vote in Russia, he said.\n\n\"We must thank Great Britain\" for helping to ensure high voter turnout, campaign spokesman Andrei Kondrashov told Russian state-owned RT television. \"They put pressure on us at the exact moment when we needed to mobilize.\"\n\nKondrashov's comments touched on what analysts say was the clearest takeaway from Sunday's vote: Putin's longstanding antagonism with the West has solidified into a key pillar of his domestic popularity, raising the specter of continual confrontation to justify his rule. The success of this strategy presents the Kremlin with a worrisome incentive to lean in to further conflicts with the West as Putin begins his fourth term, Russia-watchers said.\n\n\"A state of confrontation with the West has become a necessity for Putin's regime,\" Anna Borshchevskaya, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told VICE News. \"I think we can expect an even more aggressive Russian foreign policy.\"\n\nRead: U.K. retaliates after Russia fails to explain poisoning of ex-spy\n\nTroublingly, the rallying effect from any given conflict -- whether over Syria, Ukraine, election-meddling, or the alleged poisoning of a spy abroad -- is short-lived, Borshchevskaya said, raising the unnerving prospect of a perpetual need for fresh run-ins with the West.\n\n\"The feeling of elation doesn't last,\" she said. \"You need these periodic injections to keep it going.\" A winning strategy\n\nPutin's victory was never in doubt, but his administration had appeared worried that low voter turnout would raise questions about his legitimacy. By Monday, the near-final tally showed the Kremlin had pretty much gotten what it wanted, observers said: a turnout of 68 percent, with 77 percent voting for Putin.\n\nPolitical analysts, critics, and some of Putin's staunchest supporters agreed that tensions with the U.S. and Europe had stoked a strong sense of nationalism that helped drive Russian voters into the president's arms.\n\n\"He has to sell the image of a besieged fortress,\" said Garry Kasparov, the Russian chess champion-turned-dissident, addressing a conference dedicated to Putin in New York City on Friday before the vote.\n\nFollowing British accusations that Russia likely stood behind the poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in the English town of Salisbury earlier this month, Russian media appeared all too happy to fan the flames of confrontation, despite Russia's denials of involvement.\n\n\"Don't choose England as a place to live,\" said presenter Kirill Kleymenov of Russia's state-controlled Channel One. \"Whatever the reasons, whether you're a professional traitor to the motherland or you just hate your country in your spare time, I repeat: No matter what, don't move to England.\"\n\nIn a Twitter storm following Putin's re-election, the editor-in-chief of Russian state-owned news outlet RT, Margarita Simonyan, put responsibility for this state of affairs on \"Western politicians and analysts, journalists, and spies.\"\n\nRead: Russian exile found dead in his London home was murdered, police say\n\nSimonyan pointed out that Putin's 77 percent combined with the vote for \"communist and nationalist\" candidates reached some 95 percent of the total tally. \"It is you who are to blame for this, my Western friends,\" she wrote.\n\nPutin's campaign, such as it was, stressed his prominent standing in world affairs, down to the motto \"Strong President, Strong Russia\", while placing less emphasis on domestic problems. Putin didn't debate his domestic opponents, shielding him from public criticism over Russia's recent economic sluggishness, which has pushed poverty to record levels. And one of his staunchest critics, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was barred from running in the election over a corruption charge Navalny claims was trumped up to silence him.\n\nWhile Putin did make promises of future domestic economic development, much of his campaign message was directed outward. At one of the few events widely acknowledged to have been a campaign speech, Putin made big economic promises, but he also unveiled \"invincible\" nuclear weapons and showed a video of nuclear warheads raining down on Florida.\n\nRead: No need to be scared of Putin's new nukes (any more than the old ones)\n\nThe strategy was so glaring that his opponents started calling him out on it. The tension between Putin and the West has turned the Russian president into \"the leader of anti-Americanism around the world,\" said Ksenia Sobchak, the socialite-turned presidential candidate during a brief trip to Washington DC a few weeks ago.\n\nPutin's stance against the U.S. is \"making him a hero\" among opponents of the United States worldwide, Sobchak said.\n\nEven the date of the election itself was moved last year to March 18, to coincide with the anniversary of Russia claiming the region of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. On election night, Putin himself appeared at a rally held outside the Kremlin -- originally scheduled to mark the Crimean anniversary -- to hail his re-election. A slight chance for calm\n\nPutin himself struck a more conciliatory tone in his remarks on Sunday after the vote, pledging that, \"from our side, we will do all we can so that the disputes with our [international] partners be resolved by political and diplomatic means.\"\n\nAnd some analysts acknowledged that the silver lining of Putin's resounding victory might indeed be that it presents him with room to strike a more conciliatory stance with the West following years of rising tensions. Still, they urged caution.\n\n\"There's this abiding hope that now that he's been re-elected, he may be more willing to make compromises,\" said Olga Oliker, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. \"But I don't see any way this moves forward without a certain amount of adult restraint from the Kremlin, which is tough thing to pin your hopes on.\"\n\nCover image: Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to supporters during a rally near the Kremlin in Moscow, Sunday, March 18, 2018.

Please refresh for updates.\n\nUber has paused its self-driving car tests after a woman was struck and killed by one of its vehicles Sunday night, in what appears to be the first known pedestrian death caused by an autonomous car.\n\nOne of Uber's self-driving cars was in autonomous mode but also manned by a human driver when it hit a pedestrian, Tempe Police said in a statement to VICE News. The woman was identified as 49-year-old Elaine Hertzberg.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the victim's family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\" an Uber spokesperson said in a statement provided to VICE News. A spokesperson also told the Wall Street Journal that the company is \"temporarily pulling its self-driving cars off the roads in Tempe, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Toronto.\" The National Transportation Safety Board says it is launching an investigation into the crash.\n\nThe woman's death is likely to raise questions about regulations surrounding the burgeoning self-driving car industry. Some 66 cities are already testing self-driving tech on their streets, according to Bloomberg and the Aspen Institute's Initiative on Cities and Autonomous Vehicles. And back in September, Congress passed a bill for regulations that would pave the way for self-driving cars across the country. It sailed through with bipartisan approval.",

                "body": "The paper, titled \"A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation,\" is under peer-review for publication in an unnamed major scientific journal.\n\nJust two weeks before he died, Stephen Hawking submitted his final paper that might lay out the math needed to prove that more than one universe exists.\n\nThe working paper, submitted for publication on March 14, according to the U.K.'s Sunday Times, may turn out to be a culmination of physicist's life's work. In his research, Hawking sought to solve problems he'd been pondering for the last 35 years -- ever since he published his theory of how the universe expanded following the Big Bang.\n\nThe paper proposes that evidence of a multiverse is detectable in the background radiation of our own universe -- and that that evidence could, in theory, be found and measured. If we do, in fact, live in a \"multiverse,\" our own cosmos is just one of many universes out there. Taken together, the multiverse -- made up of all its individual universes -- would comprise all of space, time, matter, and energy.\n\nThough Hawking's last paper could provide optimism for those hoping to test for the existence of multiple universes, his research also includes a bleak prediction: Our universe will eventually go dark once all its stars run out of energy.\n\nThe paper, titled \"A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation,\" is under peer-review for publication in an unnamed major scientific journal.\n\nIn 1983, Hawking and his colleague Jame Hartle co-authored a paper describing the inflation that took place after the Big Bang -- the rapid expansion of space that created the universe. The theory relied on the existence of other universes, formed at the same time as ours during the Big Bang. The theory, however, couldn't be tested.\n\nBut testing the idea through experimentation was exactly what Hawking sought to do. \"We wanted to transform the idea of a multiverse into a testable scientific framework,\" said Thomas Hertog, the co-author of the paper and Hawking's mentee, according to the Sunday Times. If Hawking were still alive, the paper might have even won him his first Nobel prize, other researchers said. The award, however, isn't given posthumously.\n\nBut not everyone agrees the working paper's findings are groundbreaking.\n\n\"His very last paper sought to rescue some predictiveness, but the arguments are as yet unconvincing,\" said Professor Neil Turok, director of Canada's Perimeter Institute and a friend of Hawking's told UK's The Times.\n\nHawking died peacefully in his home on March 14 due to complications associated with the neurodegenerative disease he'd fought for most of his adult life, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nCover image: Professor Stephen Hawking arrives for the Interstellar Live show at the Royal Albert Hall in central London on March 30, 2015.

                "title": "Austin police: We believe we are dealing with a \"serial bomber\"",
                "body": "\"A trip wire doesn't necessarily suggest a military background,\" said Manley. \"But it suggests that the suspect or suspects we are dealing with have a higher level of sophistication than we believed, as they're changing their methods to a more difficult device.\"\n\nAustin's police chief said Monday morning that they believe they're dealing with a \"serial bomber\" after the Texas city was rattled Sunday night by the fourth blast in less than three weeks.\n\nThe latest explosion, which left two men with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, used what's known as a trip-wire device, which is different in sophistication from the prior three bombs that were left on porches and detonated when opened. Despite that, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said there were enough similarities between the bombs to lead investigators to believe they were made by the same person or group.\n\n\"We are clearly dealing with what we see as a serial bomber,\" Manley said in a morning press conference.\n\nAuthorities also see the more sophisticated trip-wire device as a clear escalation in tactics from the cruder package bombs delivered over the past few weeks.\n\n\"A trip wire doesn't necessarily suggest a military background,\" said Manley. \"But it suggests that the suspect or suspects we are dealing with have a higher level of sophistication than we believed, as they're changing their methods to a more difficult device.\"\n\nBefore Sunday, authorities had been urging caution around handling package deliveries. Now they're telling residents to be careful about where they walk, as a trip-wire device can be activated by simply stepping on a wire connected to the bomb. Earlier on Monday, Austin Mayor Steve Adler told AP that the citywide anxiety was \"legitimate and real.\"\n\n\"We've seen a significant change from what appeared to be three very targeted attacks to an attack that would have hit any random victim who walked by,\" Manley said.\n\nUnlike in the earlier explosions, the victims in the latest bombing were both white.\n\nSunday night's bombing came just hours after Chief Manley made a televised appeal to the perpetrator (or perpetrators) of the earlier bombings, which killed two people and injured one.\n\n\"We hope this person or persons is watching and will reach out to us before anyone else is injured or anyone else is killed,\" Manley said. \"We assure you, we are listening and we want to understand what brought you to this point, and we want to listen to you, so please call us.\" What we know about the latest bombing\n\nAround 8:30 p.m. in Travis Country, a residential neighborhood in southwest Austin, two white men in their early twenties were walking along the side of the road when they or something else triggered a explosive device left by the road. They both suffered serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Manley asked residents of the area to stay indoors on Monday morning.\n\nSunday's bombing coincided with the final day of Austin's citywide South by Southwest festival, which started on March 9.\n\nThe Roots were scheduled to play Sunday, but the show was cancelled after Austin police learned of a bomb threat. They subsequently arrested Trevor Weldon Ingram, 26, who was charged with making a terroristic threat, a felony. \"There are no indications of any broader security concern for any activities relating to this incident,\" Austin police wrote in a statement. They said Ingram was not a suspect in the earlier package bombs.\n\nThere are 500 federal agents, from the FBI or Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco, currently assisting the investigation. Chief Manley said Sunday that they'd increased the combined reward for information leading to arrest and conviction in the case from $65,000 to $115,000. They are also urging residents in the Travis Country neighborhood to turn in any surveillance footage they have of the area. What we still don't know\n\nWas it the same person or group? Probably.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. Monday, Police Chief Manley said that based on preliminary evidence, they think the latest bomb was made by the same person or group who made the earlier bombs. The key difference was that the most recent bomb was designed to detonate with a trip wire, whereas the first three were essentially pipe bombs concealed in delivery boxes designed to detonate upon opening.\n\n\"We believe a trip wire was used in this device,\" said Manley. \"We are now dealing with someone using a higher level of sophistication and higher level of skill.\"\n\nFred Milanowski, the special agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco in charge of Houston, said he thinks the same person built the first three devices.\n\nWhy are they doing this?\n\nThe fact that the victims of the first three blasts were black or Hispanic had initially fueled theories that the bombings could be racially motivated. The NAACP reached out to Austin community members urging caution, and law enforcement said they were not ruling out the possibility that the explosions were hate crimes. The families of the two black victims reportedly knew each other and are active in Austin's African-American community.\n\n\"Is it domestic terrorism? Is it hate-related? We're early on in the investigation,\" said Manley on Monday. \"As the day moves on, that's something we're going to be looking at.\"\n\nManley added that they were going to examine whether there was a particular ideology behind the attacks. A timeline of terror\n\nMarch 2, 6:55 a.m., Harris Ridge, North Austin\n\nAnthony Stephan House, 39, opened a delivery box containing a pipe bomb, and it detonated. He later died from his injuries at the hospital. House, who was black, worked at Texas Quarries and had a young daughter.

Despite that, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said there were enough similarities between the bombs to lead investigators to believe they were made by the same person or group.\n\n\"We are clearly dealing with what we see as a serial bomber,\" Manley said during a press conference Monday morning.\n\nAuthorities also see the more sophisticated trip-wire device as a clear escalation in tactics from the cruder package bombs delivered over the past few weeks.\n\n\"A trip wire doesn't necessarily suggest a military background,\" said Manley. \"But it suggests that the suspect or suspects we are dealing with have a higher level of sophistication than we believed, as they're changing their methods to a more difficult device.\"",

The segment is set to air Monday at 7 p.m. (2 p.m. ET).\n\nAttempts to contact Cambridge Analytica's London offices Monday went unanswered.\n\nFacebook and Cambridge Analytica deny wrongdoing, but both face increasing pressure to explain why the information of so many people was harvested without consent.\n\nFacebook Friday banned Cambridge from its platform, even though it knew about the issue more than two years ago. It has also banned Wylie from using Facebook as well as its other properties WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic have hit out at Facebook in recent days.\n\nDamian Collins, the chair of the U.K. Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he'd be contacting Nix and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week to answer questions on the matter.\n\n\"It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,\" Collins said in a statement. \"This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.\"\n\nThe EU said Monday that it would investigate whether the data of 50 million Facebook users was misused.\n\nIn Washington, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Facebook to provide a full explanation while demanding that Cambridge Analytica be \"thoroughly investigated.\"\n\n\"The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through 'psychographic' targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election,\" Schiff told the Guardian. \"Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.\"\n\nZuckerberg, who said at the beginning of the year that he was going to \"fix\" Facebook, is facing increasing pressure to speak publicly about the company's shortcomings.\n\nShares in Facebook slid 4 percent in pre-market trading Monday.\n\nCover image: Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, talks with Matthew Freud, Founder and Chairman of Freuds, on the final day of the Web Summit in Altice Arena on Nov. 9, 2017, in Lisbon, Portugal.

She was also stationed in South Korea while serving in the Peace Corps.\n\nDespite its bizarre silence over the forthcoming meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, North Korea dispatched officials to Finland over the weekend to take part in talks with the U.S. and South Korea ahead of the historic summit.\n\nThe U.S. delegation includes two former ambassadors to South Korea -- Kathleen Stephens and Thomas Hubbard -- as well as academics Bob Carlin, John Delury and Karl Eikenberry, according to sources speaking to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.\n\nThe meeting was initially set to discuss the broader tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but following Trump's acceptance of an invitation to meet Kim, talks will now focus on the logistics of the summit.\n\nKimmo Lahdevirta, an official at the Finland foreign ministry, confirmed the three-way talks would take place this week, describing the sit-down as a \"track 1.5 academic meeting, involving representatives from North Korea, South Korea and the U.S.\"\n\nStephens served as ambassador to Seoul under Barack Obama and is fluent in Korean. She was also stationed in South Korea while serving in the Peace Corps.\n\nHubbard served as ambassador from 2001 to 2004 and has extensive experience dealing with North Korean officials. He was the principal negotiator of the 1994 Agreed Framework, a process aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program. He also headed the first senior-level U.S. government delegation to North Korea.\n\nThe date, time and location for the meeting has yet to be officially announced, but Yonhap sources said it would kick off with a dinner hosted by the Finnish government Monday, before talks get underway on Tuesday.\n\nIt is understood that Choe Kang Il, the deputy director general for North American affairs at North Korea's foreign ministry, is leading the delegation from the hermit kingdom, after he was seen boarding a plane for Finland at Beijing's airport.\n\nSouth Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung Wha told CBS Sunday that Kim was surprised by the Trump's willingness to meet, adding that the North Korean leader had expressed a sincere willingness to get rid of his nuclear arsenal. \"The significance of his word is quite weighty. In the sense that this is the first time the words came directly from the North Korean supreme leader himself.\"\n\nThe South Korean delegation at the talks will include Shin Kak Soo, former ambassador to Japan, Shin Jung Seung, former ambassador to China, and Kim Joon Hyung of Handong Global University.\n\n\"The meeting had been initially designed as a venue to discuss ways to ease tensions but is likely to discuss summit meetings as the situation has evolved,\" Kim told Yonhap. \"During the 1 1/2-day meeting, the discussion will start from scratch without any keynote speeches.\"\n\nCover image: This undated picture released from North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on September 12, 2017 shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un attending a photo session with teachers who volunteered to work at branch schools on islands and schools in forefront line and mountainous areas, in Pyongyang.

The district both parties were fighting so hard over doesn't exist anymore.\n\nThis was a big week for politics, which is fortunate when it comes to newsletters because I cover politics a lot for VICE News Tonight (weeknights at 7:30 PM ET on HBO.)\n\nFolks, we gotta talk about this western Pennsylvania thing.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrat Conor Lamb eked out a victory over Republican Rick Saccone in a closely-watched special Congressional election. Why was it so closely watched? Because it was in the heart of Trump Country, the 18th Congressional District. That's a district that the president won by double digits in 2016. So Republicans wanted to show they can hold the line in places they won last time. Democrats wanted to show they can rally behind the kinds of candidates who can win anywhere thanks to Trump's dismal approval ratings. Lamb fit the bill, it seems (more on how Democrats actually pulled it off here.)\n\nBut here's the weird part, as producer Mary Grace Lucas and I reported this week: the race actually didn't matter. The district both parties were fighting so hard over doesn't exist anymore.\n\nThanks to redistricting, voters in the 18th are now scattered and divided up in new ways. So if Lamb wants to stay in Congress, he now has to mount a Democratic primary campaign in a district that's a lot more Democratic than the 18th. Saccone, the defeated Republican? He already started gathering signatures to campaign in a new district where a Republican is all but guaranteed to win. The upshot: it's more than a little likely the candidates who fought over the 18th like it was the most important election in American history will both find themselves in Congress next year.\n\nSome other stuff from VICE News this week that has been good and weird tooMore from Pennsylvania's wild political world from my colleague David Noriega.

VICE News spoke to Dr. Vil Mirzayanov, a scientist who worked on developing novichok and later became a whistleblower. Mirzayanov fled to the U.S. in 1992, and he's been campaigning to get the chemical agent banned internationally ever since.\n\nMirzayanov said novichok is \"at least ten times stronger than any known toxic substance in the world. It strikes the central nervous system and shuts off the person's breathing.\" Because the chemical agent was only developed in Russia, Mirzayanov said he believes the odds are high that Russia was behind the attack.\n\n\"I think it was a public display of the sort of fate that could await any potential opponent of the Kremlin,\" he added.",

We are investigating how that happened so that we can make sure it never happens again.\"\n\nThe apology didn't satisfy the singer, who issued a statement on her Instagram story saying the company knew what it was doing.\n\n\"Now SNAPCHAT I know you already know you ain't my fav app out there! But I'm just trying to figure out what the point was with this mess!\" Rihanna wrote. \"I'd love to call it ignorance but I know you ain't that dumb. You spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to DV victims and made a joke of it.\"\n\nChris Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, also told US Weekly, \"They should change their name from Snapchat to Tone Deaf.\"\n\nA statement issued to Slate on behalf of Snapchat defended the company's stance on domestic violence, pointing out it supports the National Network to End Domestic Violence, whose executive vice president sits on Snap's safety advisory board.\n\nCover image: A protest message is affixed to a turtle as residents demonstrate near a building converted into a Snap, Inc. vender of Spectacles sunglass cameras for Snapchat on the Venice Beach boardwalk on March 11, 2017 in the Venice area of Los Angeles, California.

In the video, Harris, a former special education teaching assistant, is seen lying bloodied on the floor of the parking garage while six men in khakis and white shirts beat him with sticks.\n\nRead more: Alternative Facts: How white supremacists got the black man they brutally beat charged with felony\n\nHarris, who was 20 at the time, suffered a concussion, a head laceration that required 10 staples, a broken wrist, a spinal injury, and a chipped tooth. The injuries continued online, as far-right trolls, angry about the viral attention that Harris received and the arrests of several of his assailants, flooded social media with \"evidence\" that sought to discredit Harris' version of events and portray him as the aggressor.",

This involved reclassifying more countries as \"safe\" places of origin to return failed asylum seekers.\n\nSeehofer's interview drew swift condemnation from parties on the left, including from within one of the CSU's partners in the new \"grand coalition\" government, the Social Democratic Party. Natascha Kohnen, a lawmaker for the Social Democrats from Bavaria, told a German broadcaster: \"Saying that incites people against each other at a time when we really don't need that. What we really need is politicians who bring people together.\"\n\nCover image: Chairman of the Bavarian Christian Democrats (CSU), Horst Seehofer, speaks at a press conference on March 12, 2018 in Berlin, Germany.

That aggressive campaign has now been expanded to many more states.\n\nCyberattacks are \"literally happening hundreds of thousands of times a day,\" Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Thursday. \"The warfare that goes on in the cyberspace is real, it's serious, and we must lead the world.\"\n\nRussia has long been linked with attacks on critical infrastructure around the globe. Experts believe Moscow has been conducting cyberwarfare in Ukraine in recent years, using the country as a testbed for attacks against higher-profile targets.\n\nIn December 2016, Russian hackers infiltrated a Ukrainian power station and shut off the power to hundreds of thousands of users in what experts said was a stark warning to other countries.\n\nThe decision to publicly blame the Kremlin is a significant move for an administration that has been reticent to punish Russia for its attacks on the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\"The fact that the DHS and the FBI have attributed attempts to attack and compromise critical U.S. infrastructure to Russia is unprecedented and extraordinary,\" Amit Yoran, the founder of US-CERT, told VICE News.\n\n\"I have never seen anything like this,\" he said. \"It's a wake-up call for the industry and a reminder that we are still not doing the basics well and that our defense needs to constantly evolve and adapt.\"\n\nThe hackers who targeted power grids were working separately from the two other Russia hacking groups that attempted to disrupt the election. One group focused on stealing documents from the Democratic National Committee and other political entities, while the infamous Internet Research Agency -- aka the St. Petersburg \"Troll Factory\" -- focused on spreading disinformation.\n\nThe U.S. announced fresh sanctions Thursday against 19 individuals and five entities -- including the \"Troll Factory\" -- for \"their attempted interference in U.S. elections\" in 2016.\n\nRussia is not the only threat to U.S. power grids. VICE News reported earlier this month that North Korea is building a team of hackers who are already probing networks across North America.\n\nCover image: Wolf Creek generating station in Burlington, Kansas.

But a new report on Thursday indicates the Instagram user wasn't exactly wrong: Mnuchin has been billing taxpayers for \"the most expensive flight options available at every turn,\" the report concludes.\n\nThe report, compiled by the nonpartisan ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), relies on documents that show that Mnuchin used military jets for at least seven separate trips last year, which cost taxpayers almost $1 million. Those trips would have cost less than $25,000 in total on commercial flights, according to analysis from the New York Times.\n\n\"The public still has no reasonable explanation for why Secretary Mnuchin apparently has never used commercial aircraft while his predecessors did, or why he needs military aircraft that can accommodate 120 passengers when his travel manifests contain far fewer names,\" CREW attorney Anne Weismann said in a statement.\n\nAn investigation by the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General concluded in October that Mnuchin had not violated any laws but did note a \"disconnect between the standard of proof\" required to use military jets for travel \"and the actual amount of proof provided by Treasury and accepted by the White House in justifying these trip requests.\"\n\nTreasury secretaries have traditionally traveled on commercial flights for domestic trips and occasionally on military jets for international trips for extenuating circumstances.\n\nBut Mnuchin's flights include a number of domestic trips, including destinations like Miami and Las Vegas. Government emails obtained by CREW show the Miami trip, which cost $26,953.33, would have cost $688 round trip on a commercial flight.\n\nAn August trip to Fort Knox is also listed in the documents.\n\nMnuchin's wife accompanied him on that trip, which drew scrutiny after reports suggested he had secured the flight to coincide with a solar eclipse that occurred that day. Linton also saw the flight as a photo opportunity and posted a photograph of herself disembarking the military jet on Instagram. She listed the designer brands she was wearing in the caption.\n\nAn Oregon woman saw the photograph and posted a comment. \"Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable,\" she wrote.\n\nLinton responded with a lengthy tirade berating the woman for suggesting the trip was a personal one and said that she and Mnuchin stimulate the economy with their tax returns -- before later apologizing in the Elle profile.\n\nDocuments revealed in September, however, that she and Mnuchin did submit a request for a military jet for their honeymoon in Europe, although they later withdrew it.\n\nCover image: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, right, and his wife Louise Linton, hold up a sheet of new $1 bills, the first currency notes bearing his and U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza's signatures, Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2017, at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) in Washington.

Earlier, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson told a local news station that between six to ten people were dead.\n\nFlorida Highway patrol said just before 3 p.m. that five to six cars were crushed under the 174-foot section of the collapsed \"UniversityCity\" bridge, which was built to create a safer pedestrian route between the campus and the city of Miami at a price tag of more than $14 million.

The entire scope of the subpoena isn't clear.\n\nThis is the first time Mueller has asked for documents specifically related to President Donald Trump's business dealings with Russia. Trump warned in July that Mueller would be crossing a \"red line\" if he investigated his family finances unrelated to Russia. The subpoena appears to be be inching close to that line.\n\n\"Since July 2017, we have advised the public that the Trump Organization is fully cooperative with all investigations, including the Special Counsel, and is responding to their requests,\" Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, told VICE News in a statement. \"This is old news, and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.\" The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe president has repeatedly denied allegations of collusion with Russians ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide, told MSNBC earlier in February that investigators \"may\" have something on the president. Nunberg said investigators asked him whether he had ever heard people speaking Russian in the Trump office and about Trump Tower in Moscow.",

The talks would \"focus on Sweden's consular responsibilities as a protecting power for the United States, Canada, and Australia\" according to the statement. \"They will also address the security situation on the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\nDays earlier, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven had spoken of his willingness to help facilitate talks between the United States and North Korea.\n\n\"If we can help in any way, we will do it,\" he said at a press conference on Saturday. He told Sweden's TT news agency that his government's rare relationship with Pyongyang put officials in an ideal place to act as a go-between.\n\n\"The fact that we are a protecting power for the U.S., have been at the border since the 1950s and have had an embassy in Pyongyang since the start of the 1970s has given us a relationship with North Korea in which we feel they trust us,\" Löfven said.\n\nREAD: North Korea just built monuments for the missiles Trump thinks Kim Jong Un will give up\n\nSweden, which has had diplomatic relations with Pyongyang since 1973, is one of the few Western countries with an embassy in North Korea. The country has long acted as an intermediary between North Korea and the U.S., which have no diplomatic relationship.\n\nIn its capacity as a \"protecting power,\" Sweden provides consular services for Americans who encounter problems when visiting the isolated dictatorship.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea had been involved in Sweden's preparations for the talks between Ri and Wallström, Sweden's newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported. Sweden has also been rumored as a possible site for the summit between Kim and Trump, along with the truce village in the Demilitarized Zone between the Koreas; China; and Switzerland, a historically neutral country where Kim was educated.\n\nREAD: Meeting Kim Jong Un could make Trump a genius negotiator or another Dennis Rodman\n\nFollowing months of escalating rhetoric over the North's nuclear ambitions, Trump's announcement left diplomats with little time to prepare for the historic summit, scheduled for May. Trump's firing of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State this week has threatened to throw preparations into disarray.\n\nSouth Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha traveled to Washington on Thursday for State Department meetings aimed at keeping preparations for the summit on track, despite the recent changes at the top of the department, the New York Times reported.\n\nCover image: A woman walks by a huge screen showing U.S. President Donald Trump, left, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, in Tokyo, Friday, March 9, 2018.

They come a month-and-a-half after a congressionally imposed deadline to impose new sanctions against Russia had passed. Despite the delay, Thursday's sanctions amount to the harshest penalties imposed by the White House against Russia to date. They bar the individuals from traveling to the U.S. and freeze whatever assets they have in the country.\n\nMost notably, the U.S. targeted the Internet Research Agency, a covert operation based in St. Petersburg and known as the \"Troll Factory,\" where the Kremlin allegedly orchestrated its disinformation campaign to sway the U.S. election in 2016.\n\nThe sanctions also target Yevgeniy Prigozhin, one of Putin's closest confidants. Known in Russian media as Putin's \"chef,\" Prigozhin is thought to be the mastermind financier behind the Internet Research Agency's troll army that spammed social media with fake news, helped organize political demonstrations, and harassed U.S. journalists.\n\nREAD: Putin's \"Erik Prince\" is tied to some of Russia's riskiest covert operations\n\nFBI special counsel Robert Mueller, who's leading the investigation into Russia meddling in the U.S. election, indicted Progozhin last month along with 12 other Russians, all linked to the Internet Research Agency.\n\nOperating since 2014, the Internet Research Agency ran an increasingly sophisticated campaign against the U.S. by \"impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of government,\" according to the indictment Mueller filed last month.\n\nThe indictment lays out in detail how a comprehensive campaign called \"Project Lakhta,\" conducted using social media channels as well as in-person, sowed \"discord in the U.S. political system,\" according to the indictment.\n\nREAD: Everything we know about the Russia operatives accused of meddling in the U.S. election\n\nPrigozhin previously served nine years in jail for offenses including fraud and robbery, according to independent Russian media outlet Meduza. Following his time in jail, he turned to the restaurant business, first selling hot dogs and then haute cuisine.\n\nPrigozhin's relationship with Putin, who he met in 2001, grew after personally serving the Russian president at one of his restaurants.\n\nCover image: Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with the permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.

It said the attack fitted a \"pattern of behavior in which Russia disregards the international rules-based order, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide, and attempts to subvert and discredit Western democratic institutions and processes.\"\n\nThe statement came after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley blasted Moscow at an emergency session of the Security Council.\n\n\"If we don't take immediate concrete measures to address this now, Salisbury will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used,\" said Haley. \"They could be used here in New York or in cities of any country that sits on this council.\"\n\nMoscow's ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia dismissed the allegations of Russian involvement, suggesting Britain was the more likely culprit.\n\n\"The most probable source [of] origin [of] this chemical are the countries which have since the end of the 90s been carrying ... out intensive research on these kinds of weapons, including the U.K.,\" he said.\n\nThe targets of the nerve agent attack, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, are still fighting for their lives.\n\nCover image: Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson leaves Number 10 Downing Street following a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May over the spy poisoning case on March 14, 2018 in London, England.

But in the highly charged and intensely partisan conversation around student safety following the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, people are seizing on whatever examples they can to make their case for and against arming teachers or putting more guns in schools.\n\nTwo blunders involving guns in schools on Tuesday -- one in California, the other in Virginia -- are vindicating those who say putting more guns in schools won't make them more safe.\n\nIn Seaside, California, not far from Monterey, a math and \"administration of justice\" teacher who also serves as a reserve police officer accidentally fired a gun inside a classroom while teaching a course on public safety, injuring three students (none seriously). Dennis Alexander discharged his weapon while it was pointed at the ceiling. Fragments of bullet and pieces of ceiling went flying across the classroom. One 17-year-old boy got fragments of the bullet lodged in his neck. Alexander has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, Virginia, on Tuesday morning, a school resource officer accidentally discharged his firearm while sitting down in his office. The interim superintendent of the school district said the incident further affirmed her opposition to the idea of arming teachers. \"We had this happen with someone who's a highly trained officer,\" Lois Berlin told NBC Washington. \"I think that speaks for itself.\"\n\nRead: Here's all the states where teachers already carry guns in classrooms\n\nTypically, such incidents might not have made national headlines. But in the highly charged and intensely partisan conversation around student safety following the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, people are seizing on whatever examples they can to make their case for and against arming teachers or putting more guns in schools.\n\nHere are a few other recent incidents where teachers or officers fired their weapons inappropriately:\n\nTwo days after the Valentine's Day massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a sheriff's deputy shot himself in the leg by accident shot himself in the leg while responding to inaccurate report of shots fired at a nearby private school.\n\nAbout a week after the Parkland shooting, a high school teacher in Dalton, north Georgia, barricaded himself in a classroom and fired a single shot from his handgun out of the window, prompting an evacuation of the immediate area. The teacher has since been arrested and is facing a litany of charges, including for aggravated assault and reckless conduct.\n\nOn Feb. 5 in Maplewood, Minnesota, about ten minutes from St. Paul, a school liaison officer was talking to a group of young kids about building trust with cops, when a third-grader got hold of his holstered gun and pulled the trigger, firing a shot. Nobody was hurt.\n\nIn November, 2016, in Bay County, Michigan, a school resource officer was convicted of having \"negligently discharged\" a gun in a school building. The bullet traveled through at least one wall, into a classroom full of children, and struck a teacher in the neck. The bullet did not break skin, police later said, and the teacher wasn't injured. The deputy was a 20-year veteran of the Auburn Police Department and a former \"officer of the year.\" He was sentenced to a month in jail.\n\nIn September, 2014, at an elementary school in Utah (where teachers are permitted to carry concealed weapons), a teacher accidentally discharged her gun in a school bathroom. The bullet hit her in the leg and broke a toilet. She was later charged with a misdemeanor.\n\nCover image: Items left at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on March 7, 2018.

Now, she's followed through.\n\nMay announced a raft of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday, including expelling diplomats, severing high-level contacts, and freezing assets, after Moscow failed to meet a midnight deadline to explain how the nerve agent, Novichok, was used in the attempt to kill former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the town of Salisbury on March 4. The two are still fighting for their lives.\n\nRussia, however, completely ignored the ultimatum to provide an explanation. Speaking in Parliament Wednesday, May said the country had responded with \"complete disdain.\"\n\n\"There is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable for the attempted murder of Mr. Skripal and his daughter, and for threatening the lives of other British citizens in Salisbury,\" she said. \"This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom.\"\n\nIn response, May announced that 23 Russian diplomats, who she said had been identified as \"undeclared intelligence officers,\" would be given a week to leave. It's the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats from Britain in more than 30 years, she said.\n\n\"For those who seek to do us harm, my message is simple: You are not welcome here,\" she said.\n\nREAD: What happens when Russia ignores the U.K.'s ultimatum over nerve agent attack\n\nMay added that Britain would also suspend all high-level bilateral contacts with Russia. Members of the royal family and government ministers won't attend this year's FIFA World Cup hosted by Russia, a way to politicize what will be a showpiece event for Russia on the world stage. Britain plans to rescind an invitation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to visit as well.\n\nBritain will also ramp up its response to hostile activity from Russia, including freezing Russian assets \"wherever we have the evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of U.K. nationals or residents,\" May said.\n\nThe creation of new laws will allow Britain to detain suspected intelligence operatives at the border and introduce Magnitsky Act-type amendments intended to seize the assets of people suspected of human rights abuses. British lawmakers have called for such measures as an effective way of exerting pressure on Vladimir Putin and the Russian elites which support him.\n\n\"We will continue to bring all the capabilities of U.K. law enforcement to bear against serious criminals and corrupt elites,\" May said. \"There is no place for these people -- or their money - in our country.\"\n\nMay said Britain would also pursue measures against Russia that she couldn't disclose publicly.\n\nA day earlier, Putin had brushed off questions about the use of Novichok at a press conference, and Russia's embassy in London responded to the sanctions on Wednesday with the same attitude. \"We consider this hostile action as totally unacceptable, unjustified and shortsighted. All the responsibility for the deterioration of the Russia-U.K. relationship lies with the current political leadership of Britain,\" the statement reads.\n\nREAD: British troops are decontaminating the site of the Russian spy attack\n\nSergey Kislyak, a senior member of Russia's international affairs committee, and former ambassador to the U.S., vowed that Moscow's response would be \"harsh,\" state-run RIA Novosti reported. \"The reaction will be such that the UK will regret their actions,\" he added.\n\nThe sanctions were announced shortly after the British government called for an urgent meeting of the U.N. security council, which includes Russia as a permanent member, to update the body on its investigation into the Salisbury affair.\n\nBritish police have also announced that a counterterrorism unit was leading the investigation into the death of another Russian exile, Nikolai Glushkov, whose body was found in his London home on Monday. Glushkov, former deputy director of the Russian national airline Aeroflot, had been granted political asylum in the U.K. in 2010.\n\nWhile there's no evidence of a link to the Salisbury case, according to London Metropolitan police, counterterrorism officers would lead the investigation \"as a precaution because of associations that the man is believed to have had.\"\n\nGlushkov had been a friend of the late Boris Berezovsky, a powerful oligarch and opponent of Vladimir Putin who was found hanged in his U.K. home in 2013. At the time, Moscow was suspected to have played a role in Berezovsky's death, and the coroner returned an open verdict.\n\nCover image: President Vladimir Putin's during a meeting with Acting Head of Dagestan Vladimir Vasilyev in Makhachkala.

                "title": "What you need to know about the special election in Pennsylvania",
                "body": "The Democrat won -- probably -- in a district that was gerrymandered to ensure that would never happen. As election officials count the remaining absentee and provisional ballots in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional district, there is one thing to remember: this race shouldn't have been competitive in the first place and Republicans should have easily won.\n\nInstead, 33-year-old Democrat Conor Lamb looks likely to beat 60-year-old Republican State Rep. Rick Saccone in a district that Donald Trump won by 20 points just 16 months ago. At this writing, his margin is less than 1,000 votes, but if it holds it will be the latest in a string of victories for Democrats in the Trump era, part of a blue wave that progressive hope will wash away hundreds of Republicans and install Democrats in 2018 when 36 governorships, 435 House seats, and thousands state legislative seats are on the ballot in November.\n\nHere's what you need to know: Trump campaigned hard in this district\n\nWhen Republicans lost the gubernatorial race in Virginia and the senate seat in Alabama late last year, Trump was adamant that those result were in no way a reflection on him and his presidency.\n\nTrump may try to claim the same after this race but that would be spin. Trump twice campaigned in the district for Saccone, sent out barrages of tweets in support, had Donald Trump Jr. out on the campaign trail on Monday, and even coined a derisive nickname for the Democrat, dubbing him \"Lamb the sham.\"\n\nSaccone also repeatedly embraced the president. \"I was Trump before Trump was Trump,\" he said from the beginning of the race. Saccone also tried to match Trump's blend of culture war and \"America First\" populist economics with praise for the recently announced steel tariffs and saying this week that Democrats were motivated by \"a hatred for God\" and \"a hatred for our country.\"\n\nIt's just one race and there are still seven months until the November elections but the Republican defeat here is at least partly a reflection on the president. It's starting to look like a blue wave\n\nDemocrats, energized in opposition to the Trump administration, have overperformed in high-profile special elections in Virginia, Alabama, and now Pennsylvania's 18th district. \"This outcome is tantamount to a Democrat winning (or tying) a statewide race in Louisiana or Kansas or Montana, which also voted for Trump by 20 points,\" FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver said on Twitter Monday night. Democrats have also flipped 36 state legislative seats from red to blue in the Trump era.\n\nStill, Democrats may not want to order champagne quite yet. Saccone was a weak candidate\n\nSaccone was a poor candidate, with weak fundraising and not a lot of charisma. \"The fact is that the Saccone campaign was a joke,\" Corry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, said in a statement. Republican committees and Super PAC's tried to make up the difference by dumping over $10 million into the race. Lamb is a very conservative Democrat\n\nLamb is also far more conservative than many of the Democrats running across the country in 2018. Lamb is stridently aligned with labor unions but he is against most gun control, describes himself as personally against abortion, and supports fracking. The only high-profile national Democrat Lamb brought to the district was former Vice President Joe Biden rather than liberal icons like Sens. Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.\n\nCecil Roberts, the head of the United Mine Workers which endorsed Lamb, praised the candidate as \"a God-fearing, union-supporting, gun-owning, job-protecting, pension-defending, social-security-believing... sending-drug-dealers-to-jail Democrat.\" A recount is possible\n\nRepublicans may request a recount, which Pennsylvania law says they're entitled to if the margin is less than 0.5 percent. Overseas ballots still have to be counted. And after all the campaigning and the tens of millions of dollars, the district may not even exist in November. Courts have ruled the congressional map is illegally gerrymandered in order to give Republicans an advantage and have ordered it to be redrawn and more representative.\n\nWhoever wins the race will potentially have to run in a new district in just seven months.\n\nCover image: President Donald J.

She gained transatlantic prominence last November when Trump retweeted three anti-Muslim videos she posted on her account.\n\nGolding, the group's 36-year-old leader, was also jailed after being convicted of one count of harassment.\n\nFacebook has been under significant pressure from lawmakers across the globe -- and particularly in Europe -- to clamp down on hate speech on its network. The company was this week heavily criticized in unprecedented comments by U.N. investigators for its role in facilitating the spread of violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar.\n\nCover image: Leaders of Britain First, Jayda Fransen and Paul Golding lead March Against Terrorism on April 01, 2017 in London, England.

Google's ban will be imposed across its search and display-advertising network, as well as YouTube.\n\nScammers have sought to capitalize on the combination of a growing interest among the general public in cryptocurrencies and a lack of technical understanding of how they work.\n\nGoogle said from June it will no longer allow ads for \"cryptocurrencies and related content, including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice.\"\n\n\"Improving the ads experience across the web, whether that's removing harmful ads or intrusive ads, will continue to be a top priority for us,\" Scott Spencer, director of sustainable ads said in a blog post.\n\nSpencer said Google removed 3.2 billion ads that violated its policies, which equates to more than 100 bad ads every second. It was more than double the amount removed in 2016.\n\nHe told the Wall Street Journal the company removed more than 130 million ads that were used by hackers to mine for cryptocurrency, a process known as cryptojacking.\n\nThe announcement had an immediate impact on the markets.\n\nBitcoin's price fell from almost $9,300 to below $8,650 in a few hours, with the rest of the cryptocurrency markets -- with a couple of exceptions -- following suit.\n\nHowever some bitcoin enthusiasts believe linking the two may be flawed:\n\nWhen Facebook implemented its ban at the end of January, enterprising advertisers found workarounds, including purposely misspelling bitcoin.

                "title": "Duterte just bounced the Philippines out of the International Criminal Court",
                "body": "President Rodrigo Duterte said Wednesday he was pulling the Philippines out of the International Criminal Court, accusing it of \"baseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks\" on him as it probed his deadly war on drugs.\n\nCritics say the move shows Duterte is worried about the investigation, which could lead to charges of crimes against humanity at the Hague.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Duterte accused the court -- which last month announced a preliminary investigation into allegations the leader had committed crimes against humanity -- of a \"violation of due process and presumption of innocence.\"\n\n\"I therefore declare and forthwith give notice, as president of the Republic of the Philippines, that the Philippines is withdrawing its ratification of the Rome Statute effective immediately,\" said Duterte, referring to the court's founding treaty.\n\nHe said the Hague-based court, the only permanent international tribunal that addresses crimes against humanity and war crimes, had demonstrated \"brazen ignorance of the law\" -- and that the Rome Statute, ratified by Manila in 2011, had been improperly implemented in the country anyway, rendering it illegitimate.\n\nThe outspoken leader has given shifting responses to the ICC probe. Duterte initially said he welcomed the examination, launched last month in response to a complaint from a lawyer in the Philippines, daring the ICC to indict him so he could put the prosecutor on the stand. He later said he would prefer a firing squad to jail.\n\nDuterte then sought to thwart investigators' inquiries, telling Philippine police and military to refuse to cooperate with any external probe.\n\nOn Monday, following comments by U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein that Duterte should have \"some sort of psychiatric examination,\" the Philippine leader said the court was being used \"as a political tool\" against his country. He said al-Hussein's remarks -- made after Duterte placed a U.N. investigator on a list of communist terrorists -- were evidence of \"international bias\" against him.\n\nPhilippine lawmakers have been scathing of Duterte's latest move. Senator Antonio Trillanes said that Duterte's withdrawal was an indication of his guilt. \"Duterte, by withdrawing from the ICC, has practically admitted that he is guilty of the allegations filed against him,\" he said in a statement.\n\nCongressman Antonio Tino described the statement as \"utterly self-serving and driven by sheer panic.\" \"Saving his own skin has taken precedence over the long-term commitment made by the Philippines state to human rights,\" he said, according to the Guardian.\n\nJude Sabio, the Philippine lawyer who filed the complaint with the ICC last year, said Duterte's actions were designed to appeal to his base, but pointed out it would have no legally binding effect.\n\nIf the ICC's preliminary examination finds evidence of crimes against humanity, Duterte's declaration would not shield him from prosecution, as withdrawal takes a year after the U.N. is notified, and pulling out does not retroactively revoke the court's jurisdiction.\n\nRights groups say about 8,000 people have been killed since Duterte launched his war on drugs after taking office in May 2016.\n\nCover image: Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte before a breakfast event on the closing day of the 25th APEC Summit.

U.K. lawmaker Yvette Cooper called YouTube's evidence \"shockingly weak.\"\n\nWojcicki was asked Tuesday how the company decided what was a credible and trustworthy source. She refused to say what factors go into the decision, claiming they \"are usually complicated algorithms.\" She did admit that factors such as the \"number of journalistic awards\" and the \"amount of traffic\" a source has are considered.\n\nThe news that YouTube was working with Wikipedia immediately raised the question about the trustworthiness of the open source online encyclopedia:\n\nOthers noted that the partnership could lead to mass exploitation of Wikipedia given that anyone can edit the pages.\n\nCover image: A finger touching the logo of the Youtube video sharing website on a computer screen.

I held her baby as the mother attempted to resuscitate their 10 month old puppy. I cried with them three minutes later as she sobbed over his lifeless body. My heart broke with theirs as I realized he was gone.\"\n\nA United spokeswoman told VICE News that the airline was accepting \"full responsibility\" for the animal's death and said it will conduct an investigation.\n\n\"This was a tragic accident that should never have occurred, as pets should never be placed in the overhead bin,\" the airline added in a statement. \"We assume full responsibility for this tragedy and express our deepest condolences to the family and are committed to supporting them. We are thoroughly investigating what occurred to prevent this from ever happening again.\"",

Human Rights Council fact-finding mission Marzuki Darusman said overall social media networks \"substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict.\"\n\nMore than half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar since last August amid a brutal and bloody crackdown by government security forces. UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein told the UN Human Rights Council in September that the violence was a \"textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"\n\nFacebook told the BBC there was \"no room for hate speech\" on its platform.\n\n\"We take this incredibly seriously and have worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to develop safety resources and counter-speech,\"the Facebook spokeswoman added.\n\nBut this isn't the first time Facebook's role in Myanmar's spiraling crisis has been criticized. Last October, a New York Times report found the platform played a crucial role in stoking ethnic violence, specifically as a microphone for ultranationalist monk Ashin Wirathu who spread false information and hate speech to his loyal followers.\n\nLast month, the social media platform removed the Facebook page of the infamous monk for violating community standards.\n\nFacebook has struggled to take a clear stance on controversial political content and misinformation, particularly in countries with strongman governments. The tech company removed an anti-migrant video posted by the chief of staff to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán for violating its user guidelines, but later reposted it because it was \"newsworthy.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the Sri Lankan government blocked Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Viber in an attempt to prevent anti-Muslim violence.\n\nCover image: Rehana Khatun, whose husband Mohammed Nur was among 10 Rohingya men killed by Myanmar security forces and Buddhist villagers on September 2, 2017, poses for a picture with her child at Kutupalong camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, January 19, 2018.

Former officials say they doubt Pompeo will be able to leverage his closer alignment with Trump to revive the beleaguered department that's already lost many of its most experienced career diplomats.\n\n\"The firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will leave the State Department a shell of its former self,\" Michael Kimmage, who served on the Secretary's Policy Planning Staff at the U.S. Department of State under President Barack Obama told VICE News. \"The capacity of the next Secretary of State to employ the department's resources and to place these resources behind effective policies will be minimal, whatever his relationship with the president.\"\n\n\"Pompeo risks dragging U.S. diplomacy into the world of intelligence.\"\n\nTillerson frequently found himself at odds with Trump not just over how to to handle global hotspots, but also other issues, like the Paris accord on global warming, or trade policy.\n\n\"Tillerson advised sticking with the Paris climate agreement, staying in the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, preserving the Iran nuclear accord, being tough with Russia over Ukraine, and toning down the rhetoric on North Korea,\" Anthony Blinken, who served as both Deputy Secretary of State then and Deputy National Security Advisor under Obama, told VICE News.\n\n\"Now, our partners will know that Pompeo speaks for the president. But they are not likely to appreciate what they hear,\" Blinken said.\n\nOthers said the run-down condition of the State Department may provide Pompeo with a chance to remake the department's mission -- with potentially \"dangerous\" results. Brett Bruen, director of Global Engagement in Obama's White House, pointed to Pompeo's lack of experience as a diplomat and more recent background in intelligence operations as cause for concern.\n\n\"Our diplomatic staff, structure and strategy have been so badly depleted in the last year, there's a real risk that the department gets remade under Pompeo to perform functions that are far outside of the realm of state-to-state relations,\" Bruen told VICE News. \"Pompeo risks dragging U.S. diplomacy into the world of intelligence. He has no background in foreign policy and stealing secrets is a lot different than influencing other world leaders.\"\n\nTillerson's restraining influence was seen, for example, in the fact that Trump certified Iran's compliance with the nuclear agreement on two occasions -- despite railing against it on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I did always view Tillerson as a counterbalance to the president, and I think we lose that because Mike Pompeo, I believe, thinks and talks more like the president,\" Michael Hayden, who served as CIA chief for former president George W. Bush, told intelligence journal The Cipher Brief.\n\nIndeed, one of Tillerson's last acts as America's top diplomat was to slam Russia for \"likely\" poisoning a former Russian intelligence officer in England earlier this month -- after the White House held back from supporting America's closest ally, Britain, when British Prime Minister Theresa May voiced the same conclusion on Monday.\n\nRead: UK points finger at Russia for poisoned spy, Trump stays mum\n\nHayden and Strobe Talbott, Bill Clinton's trusted advisor on Russia, both said they thought Tillerson's tougher response toward Moscow over the poisoned spy may have been the last straw for Tillerson's relationship with Trump.\n\n\"While the Tillerson firing has yet to be authoritatively explained, circumstances suggest that POTUS canned his SecState for supporting May's claim that Russia committed murder in the UK,\" Talbott tweeted. \"If so, Trump is, yet again, siding with Putin against a key ally.\"\n\nTillerson's weakened position and his habit of taking positions at odds with his boss ultimately proved a lethal combo, observers said.\n\n\"He didn't do anything for the organization and the White House didn't take him seriously,\" said John Sipher, a CIA career professional. \"He'll be thought of as one of the worst Secretaries of State ever.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's disregard for traditional foreign policy approaches, consistent positions and engagement with multilateral bodies and treaties is likely to have a lasting, negative impact on U.S. standing in the world, Amr warned.\n\n\"The more erratic the White House becomes, the less thoughtful we become, the less power we're going to have,\" Amr said. \"And it's not even clear the next president will get that back.\"\n\nCover image: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson steps away from the podium after speaking at a news conference at the State Department in Washington, Tuesday, March 13, 2018.",

                "body": "\"She was up to her eyeballs in torture: both in running a secret torture prison in Thailand, and carrying out an order to cover up torture crimes by destroying videotapes,\" said Chris Anders, deputy director of the ACLU's Washington legislative office. \"One man held at the secret prison she ran was waterboarded 83 times, slammed against walls, sleep deprived, and locked in a coffin-like box.\"\n\nPresident Trump made history Tuesday by choosing a woman, Gina Haspel, to be the next CIA director, but in the process he also dredged one of the darkest hours in the agency's history: The torture of terror suspects at secret prisons after 9/11.\n\nHaspel -- who is set to replace current chief Mike Pompeo, who in turn replaces the fired Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State -- oversaw one of the CIA's most brutal interrogations and was later involved in destroying videotapes of the torture.\n\nHaspel requires confirmation from the Senate before she can take the CIA's top job, and she's likely to face stiff opposition from Democrats and civil liberties groups, including the ACLU, which sued the government over its \"enhanced interrogation\" program. The lawsuit revealed many grisly details about the torture program, including some information about the key role that Haspel played in perhaps the most infamous case of detainee torture.\n\n\"She was up to her eyeballs in torture\"\n\n\"She was up to her eyeballs in torture: both in running a secret torture prison in Thailand, and carrying out an order to cover up torture crimes by destroying videotapes,\" said Chris Anders, deputy director of the ACLU's Washington legislative office. \"One man held at the secret prison she ran was waterboarded 83 times, slammed against walls, sleep deprived, and locked in a coffin-like box.\"\n\nAnders is referencing the case of Abu Zubaydah, an al-Qaeda suspect who was detained in Pakistan in March of 2002. He was initially suspected of being the terrorist organization's third or fourth in command after Osama bin Laden, though the Senate's 2014 report on CIA torture concluded that he wasn't even a member of the group. He is still being held at the detention center in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nA spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment on-the-record about Haspel's involvement in the agency's enhanced interrogation program, and referred questions to the White House, which did not immediately respond to an inquiry about the nomination.\n\nVICE News reviewed a CIA document, once marked \"top secret\" but declassified and released in December 2016 as part of the ACLU's lawsuit against the so-called architects of the CIA torture program, that details the techniques used against Zubaydah and other detainees. The document (embedded below) also offers a chronology of how the program shifted amid pushback from Congress and questions from some members of the intelligence community about its effectiveness.The Central Intelligence Agency's \"Chronology of CIA High-Value Detainee Interrogation Technique\"\n\nThe document describes Zubaydah's case and notes that when he was captured in early 2002, \"there was no CIA interrogation program and the only techniques being used were sleep deprivation, dietary manipulation, and loud music/white noise.\" The CIA believed that Zubaydah was withholding information about al-Qaida plots and \"sought to develop other, effective, and legal techniques to use.\" These included the use of \"stress positions,\" waterboarding, \"cramped confinement,\" and \"use of harmless live insects,\" which the document notes was never actually utilized.\n\nWhile the CIA maintained that these techniques did not amount to torture, the document states that the list of acceptable tactics to use on detainees was \"curtailed for prudential reasons to avoid to avoid putting CIA officers in jeopardy of vexatious civil or criminal litigation.\"\n\nOne of those presumably exposed to legal risk was Haspel. She was the \"chief of base\" at the black site in Thailand where Zubaydah was held and tortured. The details of his ordeal have been thoroughly reported elsewhere, including by ProPublica, which used declassified documents, Zubaydah's own account of his ordeal, and books by ex-CIA officials to assemble what the investigative news organization called \"the fullest public account of Haspel's role in the questioning of Zubaydah.\"\n\nAccording to CIA cables and other documents reviewed by ProPublica, Haspel watched as \"Zubaydah vomited, passed out and urinated on himself while shackled.\" Once while he was being waterboarded, Zubaydah \"lost consciousness and bubbles began gurgling from his mouth,\" and he had to be revived by medical personnel. Haspel reportedly allowed the most interrogations to continue for nearly three weeks even as CIA headquarters was notified that Zubaydah had not \"provided any new threat information or elaborated on any old threat information.\" While he was detained by the CIA, Zubaydah lost vision in his left eye.\n\nJames Mitchell, a CIA contractor who developed the enhanced interrogation program, wrote in his book that at one point, the chief of base at the Thailand black site walked into Zubaydah's cell and \"congratulated him on the fine quality of his acting.\" Haspel isn't identified by name, but Mitchell says the chief of base told Zubaydah, \"Good job! I like the way you're drooling; it adds realism. I'm almost buying it. You wouldn't think a grown man would do that.\"The Central Intelligence Agency's \"Chronology of CIA High-Value Detainee Interrogation Technique\"\n\nA career employee of the CIA who joined the agency in 1985, Haspel was eventually promoted and became chief of staff to Jose Rodriquez, the director of operations for counterterrorism. Without approval from the White House or Justice Department, Rodriquez ordered Haspel to destroy 92 VHS recordings of the Zubaydah interrogations, which she had initially been instructed to keep. Rodriquez wrote in his 2013 memoir \"Hard Measures\" that CIA agents used \"an industrial-strength shredder to do the deed.\"\n\nThat move led to a backlash that prompted the Senate Intelligence Committee to examine of the CIA's enhanced interrogation program, eventually publishing a 7,000-page report that concluded torture was not effective.\n\nIn the declassified chronology obtained by VICE News, the agency maintained that the harsh interrogations \"enabled the CIA to disrupt terrorist plots, capture additional terrorists, and collect a high-volume of critical intelligence.\" The CIA specifically mentioned several plots that were disrupted as a result, including plans to to crash a hijacked airliner into the tallest building in Los Angeles, and to detonate a nuclear \"dirty bomb\" in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"You feel like your arms and your legs are going to separate from your body\"\n\nThe document shows how in 2006 the CIA settled on seven techniques designed to \"quickly induce an exploitable state of mind\" in detainees. These were deemed \"critical to the effectiveness\" of the program. They included \"sleep deprivation of up to 180 hours in a 30-day period,\" and \"dietary manipulation,\" which included the use of a \"mathematical formula\" to determine each detainee's minimal allowable calorie intake.\n\nThe CIA wrote that the sleep deprivation \"focuses the detainee's attention on his current situation rather than ideological goals,\" while withholding food \"helps undermine the detainees motivation to continue withholding information.\"\n\nIn a deposition with the ACLU, another former black site detainee, Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud, described his experience being subjected to some of these techniques at a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan. He recounted being stripped naked, having cold water poured on him, and getting his head slammed into a wall. He was strapped to something he called \"the terror table,\" placed in a small box he dubbed \"the coffin,\" and locked in \"the hanging room,\" where he said he was chained to a metal rod with his shackled behind him and his feet barely touching the floor.\n\n\"You feel like your arms and your legs are going to separate from your body,\" he said.\n\nAnother technique favored by the CIA was called \"walling,\" where a detainee would essentially be slammed against a wooden wall while he being questioned. The CIA said this tactic had a \"significant effect\" on the person being interrogated.\n\n\"It's a big wooden wall placed on a wall where the prisoner will be pushed strongly against the wall in a continuous, rough way,\" Ben Soud said. \"Also I was naked. Because of that they would put a round plastic tube around my neck. And then they would hit me forcefully against the wall.\"\n\nBen Soud was eventually released and he won a settlement against Mitchell and another contractor who helped the CIA design the enhanced interrogation program. He maintains that he never had any connection to al-Qaida or other terrorist groups.\n\nDespite the legal issues, public outcry, and questions about the efficacy of torture, President Trump has expressed support for bringing back the enhanced interrogation. So far, his top advisors, including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, have talked him out of it. (\"Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers, and I'll do better,\" Mattis reportedly said while explaining to Trump that winning the trust of detainees is more effective.)\n\nCIA officials who worked with Haspel have defended her record, including Pompeo, who issued a statement calling her \"an exemplary intelligence officer and a devoted patriot,\" who has \"an uncanny ability to get things done and to inspire those around her.\" James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence under President Obama, said Haspel is \"deeply respected by the workforce as well as those outside the agency.\"\n\nBut if Haspel takes over at the CIA, there is concern that Trump will again be tempted to revive the use of torture on U.S. detainees. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he opposes her nomination and called for more information about her role in the the torture program to be made public.\n\n\"Ms. Haspel's background makes her unsuitable to serve as CIA director,\" Wyden said. \"Her nomination must include total transparency about this background, which I called for more than a year ago when she was appointed deputy director. If Ms. Haspel seeks to serve at the highest levels of U.S. intelligence, the government can no longer cover up disturbing facts from her past.\"\n\nCover image: This March 21, 2017, photo provided by the CIA, shows CIA Deputy Director Gina Haspel.

Many top officials there took pride in the Iran nuclear deal as proof that diplomacy can work and felt the United State should be building bridges with all of the Muslim world rather than being inherently at odds with it.\n\n\"Pompeo will enable Trump's worst ideological instincts on issues like the Iran nuclear deal.\"\n\n\"Pompeo will likely be a more effective manager and has a good rapport with Trump,\" Colin Kahl, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and former national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, told VICE News. \"That is the good news -- and it is also the bad news, since Pompeo will enable Trump's worst ideological instincts on issues like the Iran nuclear deal.\"\n\nStill, the State Department under Pompeo may also enjoy more influence than it did under Tillerson which has the potential to improve morale at the department that has suffered from a wave of retirements of senior officials and scores of top positions being left unfilled.\n\nRead: Tillerson rushes home to organize the North Korea meeting he wasn't told about\n\nTrump's fraught relationship with the former Exxon CEO often led the White House to cut out the department from sensitive diplomatic negotiations, as was highlighted last week when Trump accepted an invitation to meet North Korea's Kim Jong-un just hours after Tillerson said such a meeting wouldn't be \"realistic.\" In other words, Tillerson had managed to alienate both the career bureaucracy at the State Department and the president who appointed him.\n\nAnd with Tillerson gone, this what you need to know about his likely successor: Pompeo meets with Trump almost every day\n\nPompeo personally briefed Trump most days on the CIA's Presidential Daily Brief, a rundown of the country's most sensitive intelligence. Pompeo filled that briefing with \"killer graphics\" to \"get to the core of the issue quickly,\" as he told the Washington Post last year. \"That's our task, right? To deliver the material in a way that he can best understand the information we're trying to communicate.\" Some critics have mocked this approach for demonstrating that the president doesn't like to read and only has a superficial understanding of the issues.\n\nBut the tact seems to have endeared Pompeo to the president. As early as November, Chief of Staff John Kelly had developed a plan to have Pompeo replace Tillerson at the State Department, according a New York Times at the time. He's been accused of politicizing the CIA to defend Trump\n\nTrump often demands loyalty of his top appointees and is furious when they defy him, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions found out the hard way when he recused himself from the Russia investigation. This presents every top official with a tough balance between serving the institution and serving the president, and some within the intelligence community has felt that Pompeo errs on the side of the president.\n\nPompeo raised questions about his independence when he met with a 74-year-old former intelligence official who had been pushing a disputed theory that the Democratic National Committee's email leak was not the product of Russian hackers but rather an inside job. The former National Security Agency official, William Binney, told The Intercept that Pompeo met with him at the direct urging of Trump himself, suggesting that the president was attempting the pressure the agency in its Russia investigation.\n\nPompeo has also publicly boasted of delegating decision-making authority as director. \"Forty percent of the decisions that were previously made by he director of the CIA no longer are made by me,\" he told the American Enterprise Institute in January.\n\nBut Pompeo also conspicuously added a responsibility: having the Counterintelligence Mission Center, which is deeply involved in the ongoing Russia investigation, report directly to him. That move concerned top officials within the agency, according to The Washington Post.\n\nPompeo also appeared to be giving Trump political cover when last July he played down Russia's interference in the 2016 election, saying that Russia had meddled in that election \"and the one before that, and the one before that.\" That description contradicted the intelligence community's assessment in January of 2017 that said Russia's efforts represented a \"significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the highest ranking Democrat on the House intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he worried about Pompeo's deference to Trump.\n\n\"Director Pompeo has not always been willing to stand up to the President, particularly when Trump has questioned the intelligence community's conclusions on Russia, and we will need the new secretary to be willing to speak hard truths to the President,\" Schiff said. Pompeo believes in the threat of \"radical Islamic terrorism\"\n\nDonald Trump ran for president promising to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the country because they represented a danger to national security. While Pompeo publicly opposed that proposal, his record suggests he agrees with Trump's premise that large parts of the Muslim world are a major threat to the United States and that America must confront what Trump calls \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nA few quick facts:On the House floor, Pompeo accused American Muslims of being \"potentially complicit\" in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings because he said they had not sufficiently condemned the attacks. \"It casts doubt on the commitment to peace by adherents of the Muslim faith. Pompeo co-sponsored a bill to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization.After a Middle East fact-finding trip in 2015, Pompeo said that \"you don't find many Thomas Jefferson's over there.\" He added that while many Muslims deplore terrorism, \"the line needs to be drawn between those who are on the side of extremism and those who are fighting against them, of whatever faith we may find them.\"In 2015, Pompeo suggested there is a basic conflict between the \"Christian west\" and \"Islamic east\" and that Barack Obama seemed to sympathize with the latter. \"Every time there has been a conflict between the Christian west and the Islamic east the data points all point to a single direction,\" he said. \"It is very clear that this administration - and when I say that a very narrow slice inside the leadership regime here in Washington has concluded that America is better off with greater Iranian influence certainly in the Middle East but I think around- certainly it's tolerated around the world.\"Pompeo could help Trump blow up the Iran nuclear deal\n\nPompeo has long been itching for the federal government to be far more confrontational with Iran. In a speech last October when Trump was considering whether to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, Pompeo said that Iran \"has become more reckless and provocative, seeking to exploit the vacuum left by instability in the Middle East to aggressively expand its influence.\" He added that \"the threat is clear: Iran is mounting a ruthless drive to be the hegemonic power in the region.\"\n\nTrump is still considering whether to scuttle the agreement altogether, and Pompeo will likely encourage him to do so. As the Obama administration was negotiating the deal with Iran, Pompeo suggested that a military attack on the country's nuclear sites would be a better approach. \"This is not an insurmountable task for the coalition forces,\" he said in 2014.\n\nCover image: CIA Director Mike Pompeo delivers remarks at an event marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) June 16, 2017 in Washington, DC.

                "body": "But Russian President Vladimir Putin was in no mood to provide an explanation on Tuesday during an agricultural event in Krasnodar, Russia.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May issued an ultimatum to the Kremlin to account for how a Russian-made nerve agent ended up in an attack on British soil.\n\nRussia must explain by Tuesday at midnight how Novichok, the rare Russian-manufactured nerve agent, poisoned a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia on March 4 in the town of Salisbury. The two are still fighting for their lives. But with a Russian mea culpa looking highly unlikely, the big question is how May plans to follow through.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Monday, May said Russia only has two plausible explanations.\n\n\"Either this was a direct action by the Russian state against our country, or the Russian government lost control of its potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others,\" she said.\n\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin was in no mood to provide an explanation on Tuesday during an agricultural event in Krasnodar, Russia.\n\n\"Look, we're busy here with agriculture,\" Putin said, when asked by a British reporter whether Russia was responsible. \"As you can see the aim is to create good conditions for people's lives and you ask me about some tragedies. Get to the bottom of things there, first.\"\n\nMay added that if Russia didn't give a \"credible response\" by midnight on Tuesday, Parliament would announce an appropriate response to the \"unlawful use of force\" by Moscow on Wednesday.\n\nExactly what that response will entail, however, is now a matter of fierce speculation. Police officers stand guard at the bottom of the road where former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal lives in Salisbury, England, Tuesday, March 13, 2018. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)\n\nMathieu Boulegue, a research fellow in the Russia and Eurasia programme at London's Chatham House think tank, said the response will depend on two key factors: the extent to which Britain is prepared to rupture its relations with Russia, a powerful adversary, and the level of support Britain will receive from international allies, especially the European Union and the United States.\n\nIn regard to the first question, May said on Monday that Britain must \"stand ready to take much more extensive measures\" against the Kremlin than before. Those comments indicate she wants to do more than just expel Russian diplomats, as happened after the poisoning of the Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, also on British soil. On Sunday, Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said May, who was Home Secretary at the time, \"did nothing\" to protect other potential targets following her husband's murder.\n\nIn terms of international support, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that the \"strength of support\" shown by allies had been encouraging. NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday the attack was \"of great concern.\" The same day, former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson labeled the attack a \"really egregious act\" and warned of \"serious consequences.\"\n\nBut Tillerson has since been fired, and President Donald Trump has made no such resounding statements of solidarity.\n\nSome of the possible options available to the U.K., according to experts, include: Expelling Russian diplomats and its ambassador\n\nThis is the likely starting point for any response, but May indicated Britain wants to send a stronger message. Limiting involvement in the FIFA World Cup in Russia\n\nThe FIFA World Cup, which will be held in Russia in June and July, will be an important global showcase for Russia, and some political response from Britain around the tournament looks increasingly likely. Foreign Minister Johnson said last week: \"I think it would be that it would be difficult to imagine that U.K. representation at that event could go ahead in the normal way.\" A spokesman later clarified that he was referring to officials and diplomats boycotting the event, rather than the players. Revoking the licenses of Russian state media outlets\n\nBoulegue said that another option was the British broadcasting regulator Ofcom cracking down on Russian media outlets, such as RT and Sputnik, seen as important propaganda mouthpieces. \"Magnitsky Act\" measures against Kremlin-linked figures\n\nWith London being an important hub for wealthy Kremlin-linked figures and their money, Britain could look to target Russian money in the U.K. Such measures could include introducing so-called Magnitsky Act laws, which would give the government sweeping powers to freeze assets and place travel restrictions on Russian officials implicated in human rights abuses. Britain could also lobby for broader E.U. sanctions. Cutting Russia off from SWIFT banking system\n\nBritain could also recommend that Russian banks be cut off from SWIFT, the Belgium-based secure messaging system used by banks worldwide for international money transfers, Boulegue said. Excluding Russia from the system would make it harder for Russian banks and their customers to send or receive money across borders, which could have a broad impact on Russian trade and investment. Increasing NATO's presence in Eastern Europe\n\nBritain could look to increase strategic pressure against the Kremlin by pushing for a boost in NATO troop numbers stationed in eastern member states and lobbying to speed up Ukraine's provisional admittance into the military alliance, Boulegue said. Such a move could inflame the reviving Cold War tensions with Russia and require wider support from NATO allies. British government minister Dominic Raab played down the suggestion that the government's response would involve NATO during an interview on Tuesday.\n\nCover image: President Vladimir Putin at a meeting of the Russian Forum of Agricultural Producers will be held.

                "title": "ICE spokesman quits rather than make \"false\" statements for Trump and Sessions",
                "body": "\"I quit because I didn't want to perpetuate misleading facts,\" Schwab told the Chronicle. \"I asked them to change the information. I told them that the information was wrong. They asked me to deflect, and I didn't agree with that. Then I took some time, and I quit.\"\n\n\"False\" claims made by top Trump administration officials forced an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employee to resign on Monday, he said.\n\n\"I just couldn't bear the burden -- continuing on as a representative of the agency and charged with upholding integrity, knowing that information was false,\" the former ICE spokesperson in San Fransisco, James Schwab, told CNN.\n\nSpecifically, Schwab was frustrated over statements, made by officials like Attorney General Jeff Sessions, that Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf had helped about 800 undocumented immigrants evade arrest when she warned the public that ICE would launch a four-day raid in late February. The number of immigrants who avoided arrest was far lower, Schwab told the San Francisco Chronicle, which broke the news of his resignation.\n\nIn reality, ICE agents picked up 232 people, and the agency had expected to make an even smaller number of arrests, Schwab told Oakland Fox affiliate KTVU. In fact, he said ICE couldn't have possibly picked up those 800 people because the agency rarely captures 100 percent of the people it targets.\n\n\"I quit because I didn't want to perpetuate misleading facts,\" Schwab told the Chronicle. \"I asked them to change the information. I told them that the information was wrong. They asked me to deflect, and I didn't agree with that. Then I took some time, and I quit.\"\n\nStill, Sessions, ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan, and even President Donald Trump have taken swipes at Schaaf over her warning. While speaking in Sacramento on Wednesday, Sessions said, \"Those are 800 wanted aliens that are now at large in that community -- most are wanted criminals that ICE will now have to pursue with more difficulty in more dangerous situations, all because of one mayor's irresponsible action.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Trump also called Schwaaf's actions \"a disgrace.\" He added that ICE had been ready to arrest \"close to 1,000 people.\"\n\nIn an email, Department of Justice spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores wrote that Sessions had called the people who'd evaded the ICE operation \"wanted aliens,\" not \"criminal [sic].\" (Sessions said most were wanted criminals.)\n\n\"Given the Mayor's own comments, its [sic] strange to say she wasn't trying to hinder federal law enforcement's ability to pick up these wanted aliens,\" Flores added. \"She has said as much herself that that was the purpose of her comments.\"\n\nIn her statement letting the public know about the impending ICE sweep, Schaaf didn't explicitly say that she sought to stop law enforcement officials from doing their jobs. Instead, she outlined immigrants' legal rights in the face of detention. \"I believe it is my duty and moral obligation as mayor to give those families fair warning when that threat appears imminent,\" she wrote.\n\nWhen asked about Schwab's resignation, ICE spokesperson Liz Johnson said in a statement, \"Even one criminal alien on the street can put public safety at risk and as Director Homan stated, while we can't put a number on how many targets avoided arrest due to the mayor's warning, it clearly had an impact. While we disagree with Mr. Schwab on this issue, we appreciate his service and wish him well.\"\n\nIn fact, Homan initially did put a number on how many targets evaded arrest, when he spoke to \"Fox & Friends\" in late February: \"She [Schaaf] gave them warning,\" Homan said in an interview. \"There's 800 that we were unable to locate because of that warning, so that community is a lot less safe than it would have been.\"\n\nSchaaf, however, told CNN that she approved of Schwab's actions.\n\n\"I commend Mr. Schwab for speaking the truth while under intense pressure to lie,\" she said. \"Our democracy depends on public servants who act with integrity and hold transparency in the highest regard.\"\n\nCover image: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses the California Peace Officers' Association at the 26th Annual Law Enforcement Legislative Day, Wednesday, March 7, 2018, in Sacramento, Calif.

She's the first woman to hold the position.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump asked Tillerson to step aside last Friday and the former Exxon Mobil executive cut short his trip to Africa to return to Washington on Monday.\n\nUnder Secretary of State Steve Goldstein said Tuesday, however, that Tillerson never spoke to the president and \"had every intention of staying\" and is \"unaware of the reason\" he was fired. The state department also confirmed to CNN that Tillerson found out he was out from Trump's tweet. Other sources have said the same.\n\nHours after making the announcement, the White House fired Goldstein too, the AP reports.\n\nTrump claimed full responsibility for the firing on Tuesday and said he made decision \"by myself,\" adding that he believes Tillerson will be \"much happier now.\"\n\nIn a statement to the Post, Trump offered his thanks to the outgoing diplomat:\n\n\"I want to thank Rex Tillerson for his service. A great deal has been accomplished over the last fourteen months, and I wish him and his family well.\"\n\nTillerson's firing comes as the U.S. begins preparations for an historic meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un, scheduled to take place by the end of May. Tillerson said Trump made that decision entirely on his own.\n\nA senior White House source told VICE News Trump wanted to have his new team in place in advance of the upcoming talks with North Korea and various ongoing trade negotiations.\n\nTillerson's final act in the job was to point the finger of blame at Russia for the deadly nerve agent attack on a former Kremlin operative in Britain. That accusation went further than the official White House line, which condemned the attack but didn't name Russia as the likely suspect.\n\nIn a statement issued by the White House, Trump said Pompeo has earned bipartisan support by \"strengthening our intelligence gathering, modernizing our defensive and offensive capabilities, and building close ties with our friends and allies in the international intelligence community.\"\n\nHaspell will be the CIA's first female director, but many observers are pointing to her oversight of a top-secret CIA program that subjected dozens of suspected terrorists to savage interrogations during the early years of the Iraq War.\n\n\"The new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal cover-up,\" Edward Snowden said Tuesday on Twitter. \"Her name was on the Top Secret order demanding the destruction of tapes to prevent them being seen by Congress.

It appears that it clearly came from Russia,\" Tillerson said in a statement. \"Whether it came from Russia with the Russian government's knowledge is not known to me at this point.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the White House condemned the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, but refused to put the blame on or even mention Russia. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the attack an \"outrage,\" but when asked by a reporter, if \"you're not saying Russia was behind this,\" she responded by saying, \"Right now we're standing with our UK allies.\"\n\nTillerson, on the other hand, decried the nerve agent attack and said that \"we are outraged that Russia appears to have again engaged in such behavior.\"\n\n\"From Ukraine to Syria -- now the UK -- Russia continues to be an irresponsible force of instability in the world, acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens,\" Tillerson added.",

To find out what it means, we talked to former congressman Barney Frank, the architect of the bill.\n\nIf passed, the new bill will exempt midsize banks with less than $250 billion in assets from strict regulatory scrutiny, and loosen some rules on small banks. (Currently, banks with more than $50 billion in assets are subject to the regulation.) It's a Republican bill, but it's also being supported by more than a dozen Democratic senators.\n\n\"There's a very important reason for regulating different-sized banks differently,\" Frank said, pointing to the 2008 crash that radiated from large, overleveraged banks. \"For banks, who, if they fail and can't pay their debts, could threaten the economy beyond just the people who they owe the money to.\"\n\nVICE News spoke to Frank about what the new bill means, why some Democrats are supporting it, and how the original bill he helped write is holding up almost a decade after it was signed into law.",

Mike Conaway of Texas, who led the investigation, told CNN. \"We found no evidence of any collusion of anything people were actually doing, other than taking a meeting they shouldn't have taken or just inadvertently being in the same building.\"\n\nThe committee, chaired by vocal Trump supporter Rep. Devin Nunes of California, authored the draft report, is already being met with scorn from Democrats.\n\nIn a statement, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California criticized the Republicans for ending the investigation, calling it \"yet another capitulation to the executive branch.\"\n\n\"By ending its role in the only investigation authorized in the House, the Majority has placed the interests of protecting the President over protecting the country, and history will judge its actions harshly,\" Schiff said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee agreed with 98 percent of what American intelligence agencies had concluded about Russia having meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But in a departure from those reports, they deny there's any evidence to show that Russians tried to boost Trump.\n\n\"The bottom line: The Russians did commit active measures against our election in '16, and we think they will do that in the future,\" Conaway said, according to the New York Times. But he dismissed the commonly-held conclusion that those active measures were aimed at electing Trump.\n\n\"We disagree with the narrative that they were trying to help Trump,\" he added.\n\nConaway said a 150-page draft report will be given to Democrats to review, after which intelligence agencies will sift through and decide what can be made public. The report was based on interviews with 73 witnesses and about 300,000 pages of documents, according to CNN.\n\nThe draft report will likely be met with the same vehement objection Democrats had to the Nunes memo, a largely debunked report in which Republicans on the committee accused the FBI and the Justice Department of surveillance abuses under the Obama administration.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees are still investigating Russia's involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as is special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nCover image: WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 30: Rep.

                "body": "Tuesday night will bring the latest showdown between Democrats and President Trump over a special congressional election, and at this point the victor is anyone's guess. It's a familiar story in the wake of Trump's election, and one that will determine far more than just the newest member of Congress.\n\nThis time around, the players are Democrat Conor Lamb, a Marine reservist and prosecutor, who's running against Republican Rick Saccone, a longtime state legislator. The battle is centered in western Pennsylvania, a slice of of the state that went big for Trump in in 2016. It should be a gimme for the GOP. But Democrats are doing much better than they have any right to be. Though Trump won Murphy's district by double digits, Saccone is struggling against Lamb, a conservative Democrat, who's been riding a wave of voter dissatisfaction with Trump and a fired-up Democratic base to neck-and-neck polling ahead of Tuesday's voting.\n\nHis strong campaign is a bad omen for Republicans in November, when elections across the country give Americans everywhere a chance to vote. In short, if Democrats all over the country do as well as Lamb is doing in Western Pennsylvania, Republicans will likely end up on the defensive in places they never expected.\n\nHere's the twist though: The district the national parties are duking it out over, Pennsylvania's 18th, will essentially cease to exist the moment after polls close. That's because Democrats won a redistricting battle in Pennsylvania in February. The state Supreme Court ruled all the House district map drawn by the Republicans in years past was unfairly gerrymandered in favor of the GOP. So the court redrew the map. And the 18th was split into several new districts.\n\nThe one Lamb -- the Democratic rising star -- will have to run in if he wants to stay in Congress is much more liberal than the 18th. And there's already a primary going on that will take place in May, just two months and two days after tomorrow's special election. So that means Lamb has to run his appeal to Republican voters in a Trump district general election and his appeal to Democratic voters in a swing district primary at basically the same time.",

But 60 Minutes is reportedly set to air the porn star's first in-depth interview on the topic since the 2016 election, including new information about the affair, three unnamed sources told CNN on Monday.\n\nIf the interview airs while Daniels is still bound by the nondisclosure agreement, however, she may to have to fork over at least $1 million to Trump. So naturally, she's trying to get out of it.\n\nDaniels already filed a lawsuit in California court last week that argues the non-disclosure agreement can't be enforced because Trump -- or \"David Dennison\" as he's allegedly referred to in code name on the document -- never signed it. But Daniels made another move on Monday which could help free her from agreement: officially offering to pay back the $130,000 Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen gave her in exchange for her silence about her alleged affair with his boss.\n\nThe letter, sent to Trump's attorneys by Daniels' attorney, does have a catch. Daniels only offered to give the money back to Trump -- not Cohen, who said he used his personal money to pay Daniels and wasn't reimbursed -- \"because we do not believe there is any doubt as to where the money came from originally, in reality,\" Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti told NBC News.\n\nIf Trump accepts, Daniels could be freed from their alleged non-disclosure agreement. Typically, a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that's been left unsigned by one party could be voided if the other party returned the money, Roth Law Firm's Richard Roth told VICE News. But Roth, a white-collar crime and employment law expert, said he couldn't see why Trump would ever agree to the offer.\n\n\"It doesn't really change much,\" Roth said of the letter. \"It keeps them in the news. It is a continuation of embarrassment for the president .... It's not like the return of this money is going to keep it quiet.\"\n\nREAD: Stormy Daniels just denied her own denial that she pocketed hush money from Trump\n\nDaniels has spoken publicly about the affair before: In 2011, Daniels told In Touch Magazine some of the details -- not only did Trump apparently have her sign a DVD copy of her videos, but the sex was \"textbook generic.\"\n\nIf Trump accepts the $130,000 and ends their NDA, Daniels would be once again free to \"speak openly and freely about her prior relationship with the president and the attempts to silence her,\" according to the terms of the letter. She also wants to be able to \"use and publish any text messages, photos and/or videos relating to the president that she may have in her possession, all without fear of retribution and/or legal liability for damages.\"\n\nTrump would also be forbidden from doing anything that could block the interview that Daniels purportedly did with 60 Minutes from airing. An unnamed source told Buzzfeed News on Saturday that lawyers linked to Trump are preparing legal action that would keep the interview off the air. A spokesperson for CBS declined to comment on the report; Larry Rosen, who's representing Cohen, didn't respond to request for comment.\n\nCBS hasn't confirmed nor denied the existence of the taped interview. But Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, recently tweeted a photo of himself, Daniels -- whose real name is Stephanie Clifford -- and 60 Minutes correspondent Anderson Cooper.\n\nAvenatti didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nREAD: Stormy Daniels' lawsuit could prove Trump broke election laws\n\nThe White House has denied the affair, but if Trump did ever pay Cohen back, or if he had Cohen make the payment in an effort to influence the election, Trump may have broken federal election law, government watchdog groups told VICE News last week. Daniels was allegedly paid off in October 2016, shortly after a tape of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women leaked and at a time when the Trump campaign couldn't afford further questions about Trump's conduct toward women.\n\nThe letter's offer expires at noon on Tuesday. 60 Minutes' interview with Daniels is set to air on March 18, according to Buzzfeed News.\n\nCover image: Stormy Daniels poses for a photo before her performance at Gossip Night Club on February 22, 2018 in Melville, New York.

                "body": "Read: Meeting Kim Jong Un could make Trump a genius negotiator or another Dennis Rodman\n\nPresident Trump has touted his planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as an opportunity to extract a promise \"that missile launches will end.\" But new satellite images of North Korean launch sites indicate that achievement would literally be monumental.\n\nLast November, North Korea tested a powerful new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) called the Hwasong-15, which appears to be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead to anywhere in the continental United States. That launch followed another test in July of the Hwasong-14, an ICBM that put the West Coast within striking distance.\n\nThese events were such a big deal that the North Koreans decided to celebrate by building monuments at the launch sites -- and at one place where Kim watched the missiles take off.\n\nDave Schmerler, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, discovered the monuments in recent weeks while studying satellite imagery of locations associated with North Korea's weapons program.\n\nRead: Meeting Kim Jong Un could make Trump a genius negotiator or another Dennis Rodman\n\nPrevious research had shown that the Hwasong-15 launch site was constructed near a car factory about 25 miles north of Pyongyang. The project was hastily completed a day or two before the launch to keep things until the last minute. The site was then left dormant until mid-February, when satellite photos revealed new activity: A small oasis that sprang up in the middle of the countryside.\n\n\"It looks they took the site and added another concrete pad with a giant stone structure,\" Schmerler said. \"It looks like they did a lot of landscaping and manicuring. It looks a lot nicer than the other sparse parts of the country.\"\n\nRead: North Korea is too busy making plutonium to talk about the Trump meeting\n\nAfter Schmerler found the Hwasong-15 monument, he went back and looked at the known test site for the Hwasong-14. Satellite photos again showed signs of monument construction, which nobody had noticed before. He said the monuments appear to be large rectangular stones with plaques that carry some sort of inscription.\n\n\"It's in the middle of nowhere, but it's within driving reach of the capital,\" Schmerler said. \"I'm guessing there are people in the capital who if they do leave and can leave, they could visit. It could be a touristy site.... they cleaned up the launch pad, maintained grass, if you look at the vegetation nearby it's crappy and dead looking but this area looks like a golf course.\"\n\nThe satellite photos only offer a grainy bird's-eye view of the monuments but Schmerler speculated that Kim Jong Un is likely to make a personal visit to one or both sites, which would be accompanied by propaganda photos that would offer \"ground-truth images\" to confirm his findings. North Korean state media has made the importance of the Hwasong-15 test clear, quoting Kim as saying the November launch \"finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.\"\n\nRead: Trump's \"largest sanctions ever\" on North Korea may not matter\n\nTrump boasted over the weekend that North Korea hasn't conducted a missile test since the Hwasong-15 launch last November, but that might have little to do with the president's policies. It could just be that the North Koreans are so confident in their missile capabilities that they don't feel the need to conduct any more tests for the time being.\n\nAnd while Trump seems to think he can convince Kim to \"denuclearize\" -- meaning North Korea would promise get rid of its nuclear arsenal and halt ballistic missile testing -- Schmerler said the monuments offer yet another reason to be skeptical.\n\n\"Looking at the cultural importance of these missile tests or at least how they're being used culturally with the building of these structures,\" Schmerler said, \"it doesn't' make sense they'll build monuments for these things and then be like, 'Yes, we'll give them up.'\"\n\nCover image: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reacts with scientists and technicians of the DPRK Academy of Defense Science after the test-launch of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July, 5, 2017.",

                "body": "Asked outright whether schools in Michigan had gotten any better, DeVos said: \"I don't know. Overall, I, I can't say overall that they have all gotten better.\"\n\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos struggled to answer basic questions about the education system during an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday.\n\nThe interview aired the same day the White House announced that DeVos would lead a commission on school safety, part of which will involve figuring out whether and how teachers in public schools should be armed -- an idea both President Donald Trump and the NRA support. During the 60 Minutes interview, Devos said schools should have the option of arming teachers but also that she couldn't \"ever imagine\" her own first-grade teacher with a gun.\n\nAside from the topic of school safety, the interview touched on other areas of DeVos' controversial education policies, like school choice, that she either couldn't directly answer or repeatedly contradicted herself -- even about her home state of Michigan.\n\nFor example, DeVos admitted that she hasn't \"intentionally visited\" any underperforming schools. \"Maybe I should,\" she later conceded. DeVos also couldn't say whether schools had gotten any better in Michigan, where she spent millions of dollars promoting the use of public funds to bolster private and religious schools through vouchers.\n\nAsked outright whether schools in Michigan had gotten any better, DeVos said: \"I don't know. Overall, I, I can't say overall that they have all gotten better.\"\n\nCritics see school choice policies, which DeVos has carried with her from Michigan to the White House, as an attempt to privatize public education.\n\n\"Your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan, where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here,\" 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl noted during the interview.\n\n\"I hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them,\" Devos responded.\n\nWhen Stahl noted that the public school system in Michigan had, in fact, gotten worse, Devos admitted that \"Michigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it.\"\n\nREAD: Betsy DeVos guts school disability rules that once \"confused\" her\n\nIt's not the first time Devos has demonstrated a failure to grasp the basic issues related to education policy in the U.S. She fumbled her own Senate confirmation hearing -- so much so that she's the only cabinet member to ever need a tie-breaking vote from the vice president. During that hearing, she suggested localities should be allowed to decide whether guns are allowed in schools, because in some areas grizzly bears are a threat.\n\nAsked about a school in Wyoming, she said: \"I think probably there, I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies.\" After the hearing, the school said that it has a no-gun policy and does not keep a firearm on premises to protect against bears.\n\nREAD: Betsy DeVos' visit to Stoneman Douglas High School did not go well\n\nDespite her apparent lack of clarity on some issues, DeVos said she's the one who's \"more misunderstood than anything\" when asked her about unpopularity during the interview.\n\nCover image: Betsy DeVos, United States Secretary of Education, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) sponsored by the American Conservative Union held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Oxon Hill, MD on February 22, 2018 (Photo by Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA)\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE News US.",

Kremlin security said that shooting down the plane was the standard emergency procedure.\n\n\"I told them: act according to the plan,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian leader arrived with International Olympic Committee members at the opening ceremony moments after giving the order.\n\nPutin later received a second call reporting a false alarm and that a passenger was simply drunk.\n\nThe interview was conducted by reporter Andrey Kondrashov, who is also working as Putin's campaign press secretary.\n\nThe 65-year-old is facing seven challengers Monday but none are expected to make a dent in his bid to land another six years in office. Polls put support for Putin at a record 70 percent ahead of the vote.\n\nPutin also addressed Crimea in his interview. Asked if he could envision any situation where the peninsula would be given back to Ukraine, Putin said: \"What are you talking about? Such circumstances do not exist and never will.\"\n\nCover image: Russian President Vladimir Putin talks to workers while visiting the Uralvagonzavod, a machine plant on March 6, 2018 in Nizhny Tagil, Sverdlovsk oblast, Russia.

The party is still left without an official new leader -- Ford apparently beat Christine Elliott based on riding points, but Elliott won the popular vote.\n\nFord is thought to have clinched the victory by the narrowest of margins, beating out Elliott, Caroline Mulroney, and Tanya Granic Allen.\n\nHe will lead the tories into an election in Canada's most populous province, set for June 7, following the snap resignation of former Conservative leader Patrick Brown in January amid allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nAbout 64,000 people voted in the Conservative poll, which officials say is a new record for the party, although about 1,300 ballots are being disputed by Christine Elliot's campaign as they were allegedly allocated to the wrong ridings, according to CBC News.\n\nFord stands a good chance of becoming the next premier, with 44 percent of Ontario voters supporting the PC party, versus 24 percent for the NDP, and 19 percent for the governing Liberal Party, according to a poll published by the research group Dart Insight earlier this month.\n\nThe Ford family has been a fixture of Ontario politics since the late 1990s, garnering support from some as straight-talking populists who stand up for taxpayers against government waste, and derision from others for their crude rhetoric and occasionally debaucheros antics.\n\nRob Ford, the former Toronto mayor and the new PC leader's brother, made international headlines after he was videotaped smoking crack cocaine with alleged gang members. He died from a rare form of cancer in 2016.",

                "body": "Russel left his job at the State Department last March to join the Asia Society Policy Institute as Diplomat in Residence. We caught up with him Friday to talk about Trump's plan. The conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nPresident Trump has agreed to meet with Kim Jong Un -- a development that nobody would have predicted just a few months ago when the two leaders were trading insults and threatening each other with potential nuclear war.\n\nThe summit is expected to happen sometime before the end of May, and the rushed timeline leaves many questions: How is this going to work? What's going to be on the negotiating table? Is this going to massively backfire?\n\nIf anyone has those answers, it might be Daniel Russel, a former State Department official who spent most of his career dealing with North Korea. Russel last served as the Obama administration's top diplomat in East Asia, and before that he helped guide two former presidents through the process of visiting Pyongyang.\n\nThe first was Jimmy Carter's controversial 1994 trip to meet with Kim Jong Un's grandfather when tensions were running high with the U.S. Carter secured a deal that defused the crisis, promising aid in exchange for a nuclear freeze, but it rankled the Clinton administration in leaving them out of the loop. In 2009, Clinton met with Kim Jong Un's father to negotiate the release of two journalists. Russel briefed them both before their respective meetings.\n\nRussel left his job at the State Department last March to join the Asia Society Policy Institute as Diplomat in Residence. We caught up with him Friday to talk about Trump's plan. The conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nVICE News: Is Trump's meeting with Kim Jong Un a good idea?\n\nDaniel Russel: I think it's regarded by half the world as a sort of impetuous hail Mary play, and by the other half of the world as potentially cutting through the Gordian knot of impasse on the Korean nuclear issue. Everybody hopes a summit might succeed in producing a breakthrough, but all the folks who have been paying attention over the years and have looked at the ups and downs of previous efforts are, I think, pretty skeptical.\n\nWhy haven't previous U.S. presidents visited North Korea or met the North Korean leader?\n\nOn the one hand, putting forward the president of the United States as the problem solver to hold a summit with an adversary is usually the culmination of a considerable and rigorous diplomatic process, not the first step.\n\nThe things you'd want a president past or present to know going in include the history of the previous efforts, including not just what we think happened but what the North Koreans think happened, how they remember it. You want them to understand the vocabulary -- when the North Koreans says this, what they really mean is that. When they talk about hostile policy, that's really code for U.S. military presence in South Korea.\n\n\"I'm sure we're going to see President Trump cracking the books, so to speak.\"\n\nYou want to lay out, here's what Kim wants, here's what he's aiming for. Conversely, on the things the U.S. might have to offer, you want the president to bear in mind that some things might not be as appealing or credible to the North Koreans as we think. In particular because they don't trust us.\n\nThere's a lot that we want a president to be familiar with and understand in getting ready for an engagement of this magnitude. Of course, each president has his or her own style. I'm sure we're going to see President Trump cracking the books, so to speak.\n\nWhat type of planning does it take to pull something like this off? What kind of preparation usually has to happen?\n\nThere's just nothing normal about this. This is not an ordinary approach. I don't believe we have seen the North Koreans themselves go on record yet articulating an offer or making it clear what it is they're proposing. We're getting all this secondhand through the South Koreans, which is extremely unusual. The fact that a momentous policy decision was announced at the White House by the national security adviser -- not the national security adviser of the United States but the national security adviser of another country -- brings home that this is not really usual.\n\nNorth Korea's offers invariably come with some significant caveats and some asterisks, some hidden and some in plain sight. It's still very, very, early. Nothing has been offered yet other than secondhand ambiguities. We don't want to fall victim to cynicism, we don't want to pass up an opportunity to transform the relationship, but we also don't want to fall victim to a gambit to relieve pressure on the North Korean regime.\n\nPresident Trump has made clear again and again and again that some vague or some unenforceable proposal to maybe kinda sorta someday denuclearize by North Korea is just not going to cut it. It's up to him if he meets with Kim Jong Un to try to get an agreement to try to get a process going that can lead to the verifiable denuclearization, the irreversible denuclearization, that the U.S. has insisted on.\n\n\"Just having a meeting with Kim Jong Un, hey, that's what Dennis Rodman did. I don't think anything lasting or positive came out of that.\"\n\nHow will Trump likely get briefed or coached before for his meeting with Kim Jong Un?\n\nThis runs along the grain of the president's instincts: The first principle here is to maintain good communications and strong unity between Washington and Seoul and also our important ally and partner in Japan, as well as to ensure the Chinese and for that matter the Russians don't act as spoilers. Unity and coordination is job number one.\n\nSecond, although this may run against the grain of his instincts, I would walk him through what appear to be the most analogous, the most relevant precedent. That is Jimmy Carter acting against the wishes of the incumbent president, in a moment of tremendous friction, tension, and threats. There were voices calling for military action against North Korea. North Korea was upping its own threats. He went to North Korea to test the proposition that he could help North Korea save face through a face-to-face meeting in which he showed respect and undertook to use his personal and diplomatic skills on a one-on-one basis to defuse the situation.\n\nThe fact of the matter is he got a deal at that point. It was a modest deal where both sides agreed to hit the pause button then to engage in a process of serious negotiations. The agreed-upon framework halted the nuclear program and imposed inspections and verification on the North Koreans in exchange for a certain amount of economic assistance.\n\nThe price the North Koreans are likely to demand for freezing their program -- let alone rolling it back -- is likely to have gone up since then. And by the same token, given the trajectory of broken promises by the North, the U.S. is almost certainly going to insist on a fairly instructive verification arrangement, which is all to say this is not going to be easy.\n\nDo you think North Korea is actually serious about giving up its nuclear weapons? What would the U.S. have to give up to get that?\n\nMy source on North Korea's true intentions is Kim Jong Un. On January 1 in his New Year's Day statement, the same statement where he dangled the Olympic olive branch with the proposal for a joint team and a North-South meeting, he made it very, very clear that he remained committed [to nuclear weapons], that he would maintain his sword and shield and keep his arsenal.\n\nWe haven't heard anything from Kim Jong Un that contradicts that commitment. The pattern he's demonstrated, his behavior and statement, certainly suggest he's resolute in the view that he has a right to nuclear weapons, and at most the day may come when as two legitimate, full-fledged nuclear powers, the U.S. and DPRK could sit down to discuss mutual arms reduction and mutual controls.\n\nThe hypothesis that one ought to be operating on is that the North Korean gambit aims at trying to relieve some of the sanctions pressure in the short term. Certainly, that positions North Korea better than now to open some sort of peaceful path forward to see what the U.S., South Koreans, and others might be willing to offer in exchange for a temporary period of peace and quiet.\n\nOnce they've calculated they're not going to get any more through a charm offensive and once their missile scientists come back and say, 'OK, we're ready to conduct the next round of ballistic missile launches to test our next generation of ICBMs, then it's back to the provocation phase we've seen before. That's been the traditional North Korean pattern.\n\nIs there a chance that Trump's unusual style could actually work here?\n\nThat's a question that we'll only be able to offer an answer to in retrospect. We really simply don't know. As a general matter, inconsistency and unpredictability, those are qualities that come in handy for a street fighter or a guerrilla. Seldom are they the attributes you want to see in a superpower.\n\nWill we in retrospect judge that the zig-zags from \"Little Rocket Man is going to be totally destroyed\" to \"He's a smart cookie and I think we have good chemistry,\" from \"fire and fury\" to \"OK, I'll meet him and I'll meet him next month,\" are we going to conclude that was the secret sauce that solved the North Korean nuclear problem? I just don't know.\n\nCover image: A woman walks by a huge screen showing U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, in Tokyo, Friday, March 9, 2018.

And a 2011 Supreme Court decision protects video games under the First Amendment.

                "body": "Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a package provisions to address gun violence in schools on Friday, weeks after a massacre at a Parkland high school left 17 dead and reignited the debate over how to keep schools safe from mass shootings.\n\nThe bill, SB 7026, includes an initiative to allow certain teachers and faculty members to carry guns called the Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program, named for the coach who died trying to protect students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during the shooting. That program, at a price tag of $67 million, allows school staff to undergo law enforcement training and carry guns to class.\n\nThe package also bans the sale of bump stocks, controversial devices that effectively make semi-automatic rifles fire like machine guns, raises the minimum age to buy a firearm in Florida to 21 from 18, and creates a three-day waiting period to purchase firearms.\n\nOne hour after Scott signed the bill, the NRA filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida, saying that it was \"violating the constitutional rights of 18 to 21 year olds\" by raising the minimum age.The National Rifle Association had fought the passage of the bill, and urged Scott to veto it. \"YOU and every other law-abiding gun owner is being blamed for an atrocious act of premeditated murder,\" the NRA wrote in a statement earlier this week. \"Neither the three-day waiting period on all rifles and shotguns, raising the age from 18 to 21 to buy any firearm, or the bump stock ban will have any effect on crime.\"\n\nThe bill had created a political quagmire for Scott, a Republican who is running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson. When President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association came out in support of arming teachers, Scott initially opposed it, arguing \"teachers should teach, not pack pistols.\"",

The home is on lockdown.\n\nNapa County Fire Captain Chase Beckman also told the Associated Press that the shooter has taken hostages. California Highway Patrol, which is responding to the situation, wouldn't comment on the number of hostages, but the retirement home told the local affiliate of ABC News that three people are being held.\n\nJan Thornton's father, Harry Edwards, is a resident at the Yountville home. Thornton told VICE News that, after not being able to reach her father for awhile, she finally talked to him on the phone.

This is a perfect example of why the secretary believes we need to reform procurement processes.\"\n\nSecretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has -- like other members of the Trump administration -- spent exorbitant amounts on personal travel, all while his agency faces steep cuts.\n\nNow, Zinke's office is getting three new sets of doors for a cool $138,670. To justify the cost, his agency said it's working to maintain the \"historic FDR-era building\" in which the Department of Interior is housed, spokeswoman Heather Swift told VICE News in an email.\n\nThe item is described only as \"Secretary's Door\" on a publicly accessible government website, first reported by the Associated Press. It's not entirely clear why the doors would be so expensive, but Swift explained that they need to meet the specifications of the historic office, and thus, need to be custom built. The company contracted for the job, however, doesn't list historic restoration as a specialization on its website.\n\nFor his part, Zinke is claiming ignorance.\n\n\"The secretary was not aware of this contract but agrees that this is a lot of money for demo, install, materials, and labor,\" Swift said. \"Between regulations that require historic preservation and outdated government procurement rules, the costs for everything from pencils to printing to doors is astronomical. This is a perfect example of why the secretary believes we need to reform procurement processes.\"\n\nSwift also noted that the project was requested not by political staff but by \"career\" officials as part of a decades-long project of refurbishing the office.\n\nThe three sets of double doors in question had fallen into disrepair. They were leaking water into the secretary's office and parts had been replaced with cardboard and duct tape.\n\nMeanwhile, Zinke is planning to cut 4,000 positions from the agency's workforce to accommodate the $1.6 billion in proposed budget cuts to Interior.\n\nZinke isn't the only member of the Trump administration with a taste for expensive office decor: Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson reportedly spent $31,000 on a dining set for his office. And Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, spent $25,000 on a soundproof booth for his office and about $5,500 on biometric locks for his office door, all in service of providing additional security to the administrator. (The Department of the Interior also considered blast-proofing the doors to Zinke's office, but opted against it.)\n\nZinke also spent $14,000 on helicopter trips last summer, according to Politico. He took one of those helicopter rides to meet with Vice President Mike Pence for a jaunt on horseback. That trip cost about $6,250.\n\nCover image: United States Secretary of the interior Ryan Zinke listens as US President Donald J.

Twenty-one people have received medical treatment for possible exposure so far, although only three, including the Skripals, are still receiving treatment.\n\nSome 180 British military specialists were deployed to Salisbury Friday to decontaminate sites following the attempted murders of a former Russian double agent and his daughter with a deadly nerve agent.\n\nSergei Skripal - a 66-year-old former Russian spy who had sold secrets to British intelligence - and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition after they were found slumped on a bench near a shopping center in the town on Sunday. Both are unconscious and fighting for their lives.\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said Friday that investigators had called in members of the military with expertise in biological and chemical weapons to help remove vehicles and objects that were potentially contaminated with the chemical weapon.\n\nBritish officials have yet to reveal details about the substance or who deployed it, other than to say it was a rare nerve agent.\n\nWhatever it was, the substance is highly dangerous. Twenty-one people have received medical treatment for possible exposure so far, although only three, including the Skripals, are still receiving treatment.\n\nThe third victim is Det. Sgt. Nick Bailey, one of the first police officers to respond to the case. Officials say he is now conscious, but remains in serious condition in hospital. It emerged Friday that Bailey got sick after attending Skripal's home hours after they were found in the street.\n\nThat suggests that the pair were targeted in Skripal's residence, rather than attacked in the street, as was previously thought. There is also a possibility that Skripal's daughter may have inadvertently brought the agent with her from Russia. She had flown to London from Moscow the day before the attack.\n\nThe British government has refused to be drawn on a possible culprit.\n\n\"We will have to wait until we're absolutely clear what the consequences could be, and what the actual source of this nerve agent has been,\" Home Secretary Amber Rudd said in Salisbury Friday. \"At the moment, our priority is going to be the incident.\"\n\nRussia is the leading suspect, given Skripal's history; the use of a nerve agent, usually held only in state military arsenals; and the Kremlin's history of similar attacks. In 2006, FSB defector Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London with a cup of tea containing radioactive polonium. A public inquiry a decade later found there was a \"strong probability\" the FSB ordered the killing, and that the operation was \"probably\" sanctioned by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied any involvement with the attack on the Skripals. Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov said Friday his government was ready to assist \"any investigation,\" but protested it was \"not necessary to hurl unfounded accusations on TV.\"\n\nSkripal worked at the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, rising to the rank of colonel. In 2006 he was convicted of treason and jailed for 13 years for passing the identities of undercover Russian agents to British intelligence, who had recruited him in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2010, he was pardoned and released in a spy swap, and moved to Salisbury, a town of 45,000 people in southern England.\n\nCover image: Forensic police officers wearing hazmat suits examine a vehicle believed to belong to Sergei Skripal on March 8, 2018 in Salisbury, England.

He previously threatened to slap Agnes Callamard, who was probing extrajudicial executions taking place as part of Duterte's bloody war on drugs.\n\nThe creation of the hit list stems from the breakdown in peace negotiations between Duterte's government and the Communist party in December. This was followed by a signed proclamation that the CPP and NPA were terrorist groups and a warning that Duterte would go after their legal fronts.\n\nDuterte has previously worked with the left-wing groups, and some of them even backed his war on drugs, which has claimed the lives of more than 12,000 people since 2016.\n\n\"The Justice Department petition is a virtual government hit list,\" Carlos Conde, a researcher focusing on Asia at Human Rights Watch, said. \"The Duterte administration should publicly reject this petition and ensure the safety of those listed in it -- or risk being complicit in the resulting crimes.\"\n\nCover image: Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte before a breakfast event on the closing day of the 25th APEC Summit.

Steel is steel, you don't have steel you don't have a country.\"\n\nCanada and Mexico will initially be exempt, as they continue to renegotiate the NAFTA free trade agreement, while U.S. officials said other allies will be able to apply for alternative arrangements for similar exemptions.\n\nBut that's done little to mollify the U.S.'s major trading partners, who say their exports to the U.S. pose no threat to the country's national security. Allies and rivals alike protested the new measures, with some vowing to contest them at the World Trade Organization, or indicating they would impose retaliatory measures of their own. Here's a roundup of the reactions:\n\nChina, the world's biggest exporter, responded angrily, saying it would likely retaliate. Saying it was \"firmly opposed\" to the tariffs, China's Commerce Ministry called them \"a serious attack on normal international trade order.\" Ministry official Wang Hejun vowed Friday that China would take \"firm actions\" if Chinese businesses were affected.\n\nJapan, a key Asian ally, called the decision \"regrettable,\" with its Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying it \"might impact the economy and the cooperative relationship between Japan and the U.S.\"\n\nSouth Korea, another crucial trading and military partner in Asia, said it would \"actively respond\" to the tariffs and challenge their legality of the tariffs at the World Trade Organization. It also said it would actively chase an exemption from the tariffs. Trade Minister Paik Un-gyu conveyed his \"displeasure\" at the tariffs, calling them \"unjust.\"\n\nThe European Union has also said it will challenge the legality of the tariffs at the WTO, and threatened to respond with tariffs of its own on American goods including bourbon, denim, and motorbikes. European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström tweeted that as \"close ally\" of the U.S., the bloc should be granted an exemption, and that she would seek more clarity on the issue.\n\nBritain said it would work with the E.U. to get an exemption, while \"robustly\" supporting its industries. Trade Secretary Liam Fox said he would actively lobby for an exemption during a trip to washington next week.\n\nFrance's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said that his government regretted the move, and warned that there were \"only losers\" in a trade war.\n\nIn Australia, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said his government would be \"relentless\" in pursuing an exemption, and said that Washington could have no complaint about the nature of their trading relationship.\n\nEven Canada, granted an exemption to the new measures, vowed to continue to push Washington to drop the tariffs.\n\nCover image: Surrounded by steel and aluminum workers, U.S. President Donald Trump signs a 'Section 232 Proclamation' on steel imports during a ceremony in Roosevelt Room the the White House March 8, 2018 in Washington, DC.

                "body": "Update: March 10, 2:20 p.m.A spokesperson for Dropbox told VICE News that the folder described in this story has been removed from the platform: \"This link has been taken down and banned so it cannot be recirculated on Dropbox. As always, we investigate reports of content that violate our Acceptable Use Policy. If we find a violation, we take down the content and, when appropriate, take other measures such as banning the content and/or reporting to law enforcement.\"\n\nA Dropbox folder containing hundreds of explicit photos of female U.S. service members is currently circulating online, VICE News has learned. The women in the photos, some topless, others entirely nude, are largely identifiable and appear to be from all branches of the U.S military.\n\nThe folder is the latest example of an ongoing problem with revenge porn and online harassment in the U.S. military, one that persists even a year after the revelation of thousands of nude photos of service members shared in a Facebook group called Marines United caused a major scandal. VICE News reported in February on the existence of dozens of informal military social media groups where members continue to share nude photos and make derogatory comments about women, often alongside more banal posts about military life.\n\nThe new Dropbox folder, called \"Hoes Hoin',\" contains 267 images in all and three subfolders named for specific women. Some photos show the women's faces, others show their dog tags, others show their uniforms and name tags. The vast majority of the photos feature military clothing.\n\nSome of the photos are selfies, others are clearly taken by another person. Some show women performing sexual acts. A few are of service members fully clothed, in apparent attempt to shame or discredit them. Finally, some photos are crude collages showing a fully clothed service member in uniform on one side and a nude photo of the same woman on the other.\n\nSome of the photos are termed \"legacy,\" which means they've been shared repeatedly across online groups related to Marines United, while others appear to be new. (The original Marines United photos were shared via Google Drive.)\n\nThe Dropbox link first surfaced about two weeks ago on a closed and exclusively male Facebook group called \"Blame Marines United (Non-Butthurt Edition),\" one of a number of forums that popped up when Marines United was shut down in March 2017. Several administrators for the group were administrators for the original Marines United group, three people familiar with the groups' operations said.\n\nThe cover photo of the group is a blue falcon, known in the military as a \"buddy fucker,\" or someone who snitches. Several members of the group were calling for the Dropbox link before it appeared -- asking where it was, who had it, and whether specific women would be featured.\n\nFacebook shut down the group on Tuesday after Erin Kirk Cuomo, a Marine Corps veteran and cofounder of #NotinmyMarineCorps, an advocacy group, reported the activity to the company.\n\nThe \"Blame Marines United (Non-Butthurt Edition)\" group's size -- close to 400 members -- pales in comparison to the original Marines United group, which hosted more than 30,000 U.S. Marines, British Marines, veterans, and civilians. But the link to the Dropbox folder continues to be shared in similar forums, and it's impossible to know its full reach. Anyone with the link can access and download the photos.\n\nAfter the Marines United scandal broke last year, the Marine Corps got $18 million to address the nude photo-sharing scandal and more broadly to tackle misogyny within the ranks, according to the Military Times. Congress made the nonconsensual sharing of nude photos a criminal offense in the military in December.\n\nBut online harassment, which affects all branches of the armed forces, remains pervasive.\n\nRead: The Pentagon hasn't stopped the military's revenge porn problem\n\nCuomo said she was frustrated with the military's failure to identify and shut down these groups. \"They can't sit two intel officers in an office for two hours a day to see what's going on?\" she said, adding that she has a full-time job and still was informed of the link.\n\nFacebook has \"pushed really hard\" to tackle revenge porn on its platform, Cuomo said, but Dropbox has been relatively absent. Facebook and Dropbox did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nPentagon spokesperson Maj. Carla Gleason said the Department of Defense \"continues to monitor and assess the social media landscape.\"\n\n\"However, as social media platforms continue to expand, the challenge remains in becoming aware of and identifying victims of cyberbullying and cyber harassment, as well as identifying those individuals committing the offenses,\" she said.\n\nCover image: General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and fellow military leaders attend the State of the Union address on Jan. 30, 2018.

But instead of blocking users, the judge suggested Trump take advantage of a feature Twitter unrolled years ago: muting.\n\n\"Once it is a public forum, you can't shut somebody up because you don't like what they're saying,\" Buchwald said during arguments on Thursday.\n\nThe Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and seven people sued the president in July 2017 after he blocked them over their criticism of his policies. The plaintiffs claim that Trump's @realDonaldTrump account is a public forum that the president uses to communicate news and exchange views with his constituents. As such, blocking them violates their right to free speech, the suit argues.\n\nBut President Trump had asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit in August 2017. And U.S. Department of Justice lawyer Michael Baer, who represents the president, argued on Thursday that how Trump runs his personal Twitter feed shouldn't be up for the state court to decide.",

                "body": "The U.S., Canada and Mexico are currently in the seventh round of NAFTA negotiations. On Tuesday, U.S trade representative Robert Lighthizer said political headwinds would increase the longer the negotiations dragged on, warning that time was \"running very short\".\n\nCanada and Mexico will not be subject to tariffs on steel and aluminum imported in the United States, at least for the next little while, the White House said Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"Due to the unique nature of our relationship with Canada and Mexico ... we're gonna hold off the tariff for those two countries,\" Trump told reporters at a press conference, flanked by Vice-President Mike Pence and steel workers from Kentucky.\n\n\"If we don't make the deal on NAFTA, and if we terminate NAFTA ... we'll start all over again. Or we'll just do it a different way. But we'll terminate NAFTA, and that'll be it. But I have a feeling we're gonna make a deal on NAFTA... If we do there won't be any tariffs on Canada, and there won't be any tariffs on Mexico,\" Trump said, implying a permanent exemption beyond the current temporary one.\n\nTrump officially signed off on two proclamations that would impose 25 percent and 10 percent tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum respectively, except from Canada and Mexico. Canada is the biggest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States, followed closely by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Russia.\n\nThe U.S., Canada and Mexico are currently in the seventh round of NAFTA negotiations. On Tuesday, U.S trade representative Robert Lighthizer said political headwinds would increase the longer the negotiations dragged on, warning that time was \"running very short\".\n\n\"We would prefer a three-way tripartite agreement. If that proves impossible, we are prepared to move on a bilateral basis,\" Lighthizer said in a statement from Mexico City.\n\nThe Trump administration is threatening an all-out trade war by invoking an obscure provision in WTO's dispute settlement system in order to justify imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs -- that of national security.\n\nSection 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. to impose trade restrictions in the name of \"national security\". The U.S. will of course have to justify that measure to the international trade community under Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but it is a justification that few countries use, because it is arguably \"self-judging\", meaning that an international body does not really have the authority to override what any nation considers a threat to its own national security.\n\nIt is also most probably the reason why Trump is invoking the national security argument, says John Weekes, Canada's former chief negotiator of NAFTA, and currently Senior Business Advisor at Bennett Jones LLP.\n\n\"I think it's been pretty clear that Donald Trump is just not a big fan of trade agreements and open trade,\" Weekes told VICE Money.\n\n\"My most important job is to keep the American people safe,\" declared Trump at Thursday's press conference, pointing out how the decline of America's steel industry is not just an \"economic disaster\" but a \"security disaster\".\n\n\"Today I am defending America's national security by placing tariffs on steel and aluminium. Some countries have flooded the world market with cheap metal that is subsidized by their own countries. It has been an assault on our country,\" Trump said taking aim at China which has undeniably been flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminium over the last decade or so.\n\nBut what Trump failed to point out, is that Chinese steel only accounts for about three percent of American imports -- countries like Canada, Brazil and South Korea make up the bulk of steel and aluminium imports.\n\n\"It's got nothing to do with national security,\" says Weekes. \"He turns around and tells Canada if you're good boys and girls and you agree to what we want in NAFTA then we will keep these tariffs off. What's that got to do with national security?\"\n\n\"It appears to be that other mechanisms [that are conventionally used in trade disputes], are regulated by the WTO and thus subject to strict requirements,\" said Huge Perescano Diaz, one of the original negotiators of NAFTA and currently Director of Economic Law at the Centre of International Governance and Innovation.\n\n\"The national security exception has historically been considered to be self-judging by many countries, especially the U.S. thus it seems like the U.S. would argue that no country or WTO panels could second-guess the U.S. decision,\" Diaz told VICE Money via email.\n\nWeekes believes that Trump., with these latest tariffs, is perhaps trying to undermine the international trade system altogether. \"They would like to dismantle the system of trade agreements. The major countries have an understanding that you don't invoke the national security exception, because once you open that box, there's no going back.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn resigned as a result of Trump's decision to impose the steel and aluminum tariffs. The European Union has already said it is prepared to retaliate to the tariffs on the range of U.S. imports, including peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice, targeting States in the Midwest where Trump's base in the strongest.",

(Lauren is better known to fans of the franchise as \"Lauren B,\" since there are a seemingly endless number of Laurens competing for the bachelor's heart. A previous contestant, also named \"Lauren B.\", said on Twitter she's been receiving a lot of misdirected hate mail since the show aired.)\n\nIn the footage, Luyendyk is seen breaking it off with Kufrin before asking her if she wanted him to leave. She said yes, but instead of leaving, he stayed and stared at her. Then she asked him to leave, and he said yes, but instead of leaving he stayed and stared at her. Then she asked him to leave again, and he said yes, but instead of leaving he stayed and continued to stare at her.\n\nSo a state legislator from Kufrin's home state decided to help Kufrin out. On Tuesday, Minnesota Rep. Drew Christensen tweeted, \"If this gets a thousand retweets, I'll write a bill banning Arie from Minnesota.\"\n\nHis tweet was retweeted more than 11,000 times, and Christensen followed through his promise. On Wednesday, he tweeted a photo of the legislation, which reads, in part, \"The state of Minnesota hereby adopts a policy of zero tolerance of Arie Luyendyk Jr. from season 22 of the The Bachelor [sic]. It is state policy that every person in the state has a right to live free from the presence of Arie Luyendyk Jr. in the state.\"",

Later Wednesday, the bill passed the House in a vote of 67-50, two days after the Senate passed it.

                "title": "Stormy Daniels' lawsuit could prove Trump broke election laws",
                "body": "Just days before Daniels filed her lawsuit, CREW had requested that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) look into whether Trump \"held a beneficial interest\" in a limited liability company that Cohen reportedly used to pay off Daniels. If Trump had an interest in that LLC, CREW alleges, the president would've had to reveal that in the public financial disclosure reports he filed with the Office of Government Ethics during his candidacy. The watchdog is still looking into whether Daniels' lawsuit would affect that complaint, Libowitz said.\n\nIf former porn star Stormy Daniels wins her lawsuit against \"David Dennison\" -- aka Donald Trump -- she'll finally be able to tell the world all about their alleged affair. But her victory could also open the president up to charges of violating U.S. election law.\n\nAfter her alleged affair with Trump from 2006 to 2007, Daniels signed a non-disclosure agreement that prevented her from discussing the details -- like how she purportedly spanked Trump with a Forbes Magazine with his own face on the cover, for example. The president's lawyer Michael Cohen also admitted to \"facilitating\" giving Daniels $130,000 in hush-money in 2016, during Trump's campaign for the presidency.\n\nBut Daniels claims in a lawsuit filed in California court on Monday that the non-disclosure agreement doesn't matter because \"Dennison\" (Trump's code name) never signed the document. Daniels' complaint also alleges that Trump knew about his attorney's efforts to keep her quiet. If that's true, government watchdog groups say, the lawsuit could prove that Trump broke federal campaign finance laws.\n\n\"The facts that have come out of this lawsuit could definitely push forward many of the complaints or requests for investigation into this situation,\" said Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).\n\nJust days before Daniels filed her lawsuit, CREW had requested that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) look into whether Trump \"held a beneficial interest\" in a limited liability company that Cohen reportedly used to pay off Daniels. If Trump had an interest in that LLC, CREW alleges, the president would've had to reveal that in the public financial disclosure reports he filed with the Office of Government Ethics during his candidacy. The watchdog is still looking into whether Daniels' lawsuit would affect that complaint, Libowitz said.\n\nREAD: President \"David Dennison\" is getting sued because he didn't sign Stormy Daniels' hush agreement\n\n\"What are all the assets? Where does he hold interest? What could be a force motivating him on policy? Where could he owe things? Who could influence him? If he is leaving things off of that disclosure, that's a real problem, because we already know so little from the lack of tax returns,\" Libowitz said. \"We don't know who he's in bed with, to use a terrible metaphor.\"\n\nFor his part, Cohen said he used his own money to \"facilitate\" paying off Daniels and later complained that Trump, nor the Trump Organization, ever reimbursed him, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. (Cohen called that article \"fake news.\") Aside from the money, Daniels' lawsuit alleges that Cohen filed a restraining order against her and \"further threatened\" her, according to her lawyer.\n\nCommon Cause, another transparency group, has also filed a complaint with the FEC that asks the watchdog group to investigate whether Trump paid the $130,000 himself in exchange for Daniels' silence about the affair. That also would have broken campaign finance law. Stephen Spaulding, who served as special counsel for the FEC and now works as Common Cause's chief of strategy, pointed out that Daniels was purportedly paid off in October 2016.\n\n\"That was a week after the Access Hollywood tape leaked,\" Spaulding said. \"So there was a lot of reason to believe that this was hush money, essentially to keep out money at a very important time in the campaign.\"\n\nREAD: Trump didn't use a condom when he cheated on Melania with me\n\nBut the FEC finding evidence of wrongdoing is far from certain -- Spaulding called the agency \"one of the most dysfunctional\" in D.C. And even if the FEC does, Trump would only be slapped with a fine, Spaulding said. Common Cause also filed a complaint with the Justice Department over the alleged $130,000 payment, but it's unclear whether that will move forward.\n\nBreaking election laws can be a criminal offense though: Former Democratic North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, for example, was indicted for allegedly paying off his mistress. Although the president can be sued, it's unclear whether he can be criminally indicted.\n\nStill, Spaulding has hope. To start an FEC investigation, the agency needs only to decide that \"there might have been\" a violation of campaign finance law.\n\n\"We've fully passed that test,\" Spaulding said. \"Of the hundreds of cases that I reviewed when I was at the FEC, I can say I think it's one of the clearest places where there should at least be an investigation.\"\n\nCover image: Stormy Danielsattends Exxxotica Expo 2014 at the Broward County Convention Center.

Jerry Brown said shortly after Sessions' speech, according to the New York Times. \"This is pure red meat for the base.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions thinks California lawmakers are the \"most radical extremists.\"\n\nThat's what he said at a hotel in Sacramento on Wednesday when he addressed a California law enforcement lobbying group about the Department of Justice's lawsuit against the state. Filed on Monday, the suit alleges that California enacted legislation that's hampering federal immigration enforcement.\n\nDuring his speech to the California Peace Officers' Association, Sessions said that the state of California had been \"actively obstructing federal law enforcement\" by passing laws requiring local law enforcement to inspect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. Another law also prevents people detained by local police for non-serious crimes from being released into ICE custody. That's a step further than policies in other sanctuary jurisdictions, which typically don't hold undocumented immigrants arrested for minor crimes indefinitely until ICE can take custody of them.\n\nREAD: Jeff Sessions' lawsuit against California is about more than just sanctuary policies\n\n\"This is basically going to war against the State of California,\" California Gov. Jerry Brown said shortly after Sessions' speech, according to the New York Times. \"This is pure red meat for the base.\"\n\nThis past year, in fact, has strained the relationship between the Trump administration and California. Within days of taking office, Trump said California was \"out of control\" by considering becoming a sanctuary state and threatened to withhold all federal funding, among other consequences for the state's repudiation of the administration's hardline immigration policies. He's even suggested pulling ICE out of the state entirely.\n\nIn 2017 alone, Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general, sued the Trump administration two dozen times in 2017.\n\n\"The main argument that the Justice Department makes in their case is that California is trying to inject itself into immigration enforcement matters -- and that's a federal matter and not a state matter,\" said María Blanco, executive director of the University of California Immigrant Legal Services Center. But that's not what the California law does, according to Blanco. \"It's not required or constitutional for the local law enforcement to enforce immigration law,\" she said.\n\nBut California's laws are unprecedented at the state level, according to Blanco, although localities have pass similar on in the past, which have been upheld in the courts.\n\nStill, Sessions and his department see California's \"radical agenda,\" as Sessions puts it, as interfering with an area where the federal government has final say.\n\n\"Stop treating immigration agents differently from everybody else for the purpose of eviscerating border controls and advancing an open borders philosophy shared by only the most radical extremists\" he added.\n\nIn his speech on Wednesday, Sessions also singled out the Mayor of Oakland, Libby Schaaf, who warned the community about upcoming ICE raids a day before the feds arrested over 200 undocumented immigrants, about half of whom had prior criminal convictions.\n\n\"Here's my message to Mayor Schaaf: How dare you. How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to promote your radical open borders agenda,\" Sessions said.\n\nThough Sessions might insist that only a few radicals support the state of California's policies, recent polling suggests that more than half of Californians support their lawmakers' decisions on sanctuary policies, according to a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll taken in November of last year.\n\nOutside the hotel, about 300 protesters blocked traffic and held signs telling Sessions he's not welcome in their state.\n\nMeanwhile, across the country, Trump touted his immigration platform to a crowd of Latino business owners. During the speech, Trump didn't bring up the Justice Department's lawsuit, but he did link the \"drug problem\" with immigration and blamed Democrats for obstructing immigration debates in Congress.\n\nCover image: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses the California Peace Officers' Association at the 26th Annual Law Enforcement Legislative Day, Wednesday, March 7, 2018, in Sacramento, Calif.

In 2006, he was convicted of \"high treason\" by Moscow and sentenced to 13 years in prison for offering the identities of Russian agents in Europe to MI6, Britain's intelligence agency. Ultimately he didn't serve his whole sentence, and was pardoned in 2010 and sent to the U.K. as part of a prisoner swap with Moscow.\n\nMark Rowley, the Met Police's head of counterterrorism, said investigators believe the father and his adult daughter were targeted in a premeditated attack.\n\n\"The focus at this time is to establish what has caused these people to become critically ill,\" Rowley told reporters, before adding that he did not believe the attack posed a threat to the larger population.\n\nSkripal and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia, who was visiting the U.K. from Russia, remain in critical condition. A police officer who came upon the scene is also hospitalized and seriously ill.",

                "body": "PARKLAND, Florida -- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos got a frosty reception from students and faculty during a visit to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School early Wednesday, its first full day of classes since the Feb. 14 massacre that left 17 students, teachers, and faculty dead.\n\nDeVos, who arrived in a four-car motorcade with a police escort, toured the school with Broward County Superintendent Robert Runcie, school board members Rosalyn Osgood and Abbie Freedman, and six students. She laid a wreath in front of the school building where the teen gunman fired his AR-15-style assault rifle, \"interrupted\" a counseling session in the media center, and dodged students' questions.\n\nAccording to the Department of Education, the purpose of DeVos' trip was to \"connect with students and teachers\" in the wake of the shootings, which turned Stoneman Douglas students into activists and started yet another national conversation about gun control.\n\nThe tour was closed to the press, but students who were present said DeVos did not answer questions on what her agency can do to help prevent future mass shootings.\n\n\"We would love it if you could come back and answer some of our questions,\" said Isabelle Robinson, 17, one of the students who accompanied DeVos on her tour. DeVos responded that she would have a sit-down with students \"later down the road,\" according to Robinson.\n\nWhen school board member Freedman asked DeVos if she planned to be at the March for Our Lives event on March 24, organized by Parkland students to take place in Washington and other cities across the country, DeVos said she might not be in Washington at that time. \"There are marches all over the country and in other countries, so it shouldn't be a problem,\" Robinson replied.The main entrance to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida was still decorated with thousands of flowers and hundreds of memorial signs when students returned for their first full day of classes on March 7, 2018. (Photo: Kathleen Caulderwood, VICE News)\n\nKyra Parrow, 18, a student and editor-in-chief of the school yearbook, said DeVos' entourage \"interrupted a counseling session with students in the media center.\" Parrow said she asked DeVos what she'd do to prevent future mass school shootings.\n\n\"She gave me a BS answer,\" Parrow said. \"Nothing was informative, nothing about it told me anything about her agenda.\"\n\nLast week, DeVos announced that the Department of Education was awarding $1 million in funding to Broward County Public Schools (which encompasses Parkland), known as the Project School Emergency Response to Violence. That money was meant to fund mental health services, overtime pay for teachers, additional security staff, and substitute teachers.\n\nLater, at a press conference at a Marriott Hotel in Coral Springs, DeVos reiterated her support for arming school staff, a proposal the Florida Senate approved unanimously on Tuesday. \"I was just there to be there, to be with them,\" she said. \"I heard a variety of things from students I spoke to.\"\n\nBut some faculty at Stoneman Douglas echoed the students' skepticism.\n\n\"Is she coming for a photo op and pretending she cares, and pretending she's going to do something,\" said Greg Pittman, an American history teacher. \"Are they bringing additional pay for teachers, funding for security, and training for police officers to be on our campuses?\"\n\nPittman, who said he previously worked for former Republican North Carolina Sen. John P. East and former North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin, said he was concerned that DeVos was just coming to push the Trump administration's agenda.\n\n\"I hope she's not bringing ideas that the president is advocating for that we arm teachers,\" said Pittman. \"I'm here to teach, not to kill students.\"\n\nTwo other students, both juniors, expressed similar thoughts. \"She should go home,\" said Wiliam, a junior who declined to give his last name. \"No one wants her here.\"\n\n\"We don't think she should be at our school right now,\" said Sebastien, also a junior who also declined to give his last name. \"She doesn't care about us.\"\n\nThe antipathy toward DeVos before her arrival was also palpable online. Many of the student survivors took to Twitter to share their thoughts about DeVos' appearance.\n\n\"I've decided that I don't think we should walk out, ignore her, or block her from entering. I want to talk to her. I want her to understand what we're feeling,\" wrote Carly Nove on Twitter.\n\n\"However, I doubt we'll be able to discuss anything with her. She'll probably give us her sympathies and leave.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education did not respond to VICE News' request for comment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE News US.",

                "title": "Jeff Sessions' lawsuit against California is about more than just sanctuary policies",
                "body": "\"These provisions impermissibly prohibit even the most basic cooperation with federal officials,\" the Justice Department argues in its lawsuit, claiming the policies create \"an obstacle to the United States' enforcement of the immigration laws.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has launched a new offensive in his longstanding war with so-called \"sanctuary\" policies that shield undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Department of Justice sued California on Tuesday, claiming three state laws unconstitutionally interfere with efforts to strictly enforce federal immigration law. Sessions is scheduled to speak to state law enforcement officials Wednesday morning in Sacramento, and he is expected to elaborate on his rationale for filing the lawsuit. Sanctuary policies allow states and cities to shield undocumented immigrants in various ways to block the Trump administration's campaign to detain and deport as many of them as possible.\n\n\"The Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional policies that are imposed on you,\" Sessions plans to say, according to excerpts of his remarks released by the DOJ. \"We are fighting to make your jobs safer and to help you reduce crime in America. And I believe that we are going to win.\"\n\nSo far, coverage of the lawsuit has mostly focused on one specific sanctuary policy, California law SB54, which took effect this year. Under the law, local cops are prohibited from alerting immigration agents when people are about to be released from custody for low-level offenses. The feds want advance notice so that people who are wanted for immigration violations can be re-arrested and locked up in detention centers pending deportation. The law also blocks jails from asking inmates about their immigration status, and bans federal immigration agents from accessing local jails.\n\n\"These provisions impermissibly prohibit even the most basic cooperation with federal officials,\" the Justice Department argues in its lawsuit, claiming the policies create \"an obstacle to the United States' enforcement of the immigration laws.\"\n\nBut the lawsuit also challenges two other California laws. One is the state's Immigrant Worker Protection Act, which prohibits businesses from voluntarily providing information to federal immigration agents about employees. It also requires employers to let workers know if the feds are going to inspect their records.\n\nREAD: Sessions is \"blackmailing\" sanctuary cities, Chicago lawsuit claims\n\nThe third law that's under fire requires state inspections of federal immigrant detention centers. State lawmakers enacted the measure in response to reports of poor conditions and detainee abuse in the facilities, many of which are operated by private prison companies. As the Justice Department's lawsuit notes, the law also requires California's attorney general to ensure that due process is being provided to civil immigration detainees, and investigate \"the circumstances around their apprehension and transfer\" to federal detention facilities.\n\nSessions maintains that everything about the facilities should be kept secret -- unless the federal government decides the information should be released to the public. The lawsuit also claims the state \"has no lawful interest in investigating federal law enforcement efforts.\"\n\nA senior Justice Department official told the Washington Post that other states and cities with sanctuary laws could face separate lawsuits, but California will offer a high-profile test case that may determine whether the administration's legal challenge has merit. The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports restrictions on immigration, counts six sanctuary states and dozens of counties with similar policies.\n\nSo far, efforts by Sessions to force states and cities to help enforce federal immigration laws have hit a wall in federal court. Judges in San Francisco and elsewhere have summarily rejected the Trump administration's attempts to withdraw federal funding from sanctuary jurisdictions.\n\nCalifornia Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra said the state is ready to fight. \"We are doing what we believe is best to make sure the people of California are safe,\" he said, according to the Los Angeles Times. \"We are doing nothing to intrude on the work of federal government to do immigration enforcement.\"\n\nCover image: Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivers remarks to the National Association of Attorneys General at their Winter Meeting in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2018.

                "body": "Clifford's lawsuit alleges that Trump avoided signing in order to plausibly deny any knowledge of the deal down the line.\n\nPresident \"David Dennison,\" also known as Donald Trump, is facing a lawsuit because he didn't sign the \"hush agreement\" that would have kept Stephanie Clifford, also known as porn star \"Stormy Daniels,\" from talking about their alleged affair over a decade ago.\n\nIn the alleged non-disclosure agreement between Trump and Clifford, Trump is referred to throughout as \"David Dennison\" and Clifford as \"Peggy Petterson.\" Only in a separate, code-breaking document is Dennison identified as Trump. That part of the document in the court filing Clifford brought forward on Tuesday is blacked out, but Clifford's attorneys says \"David Dennison\" refers to Trump.\n\nNotably absent from the document is Trump's signature.\n\nThe heart of the legal matter here is whether \"Dennison\" in fact needed to sign this agreement, given that his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen (who does not have a nickname in the alleged non-disclosure agreement), did sign.\n\nClifford's lawsuit alleges that Trump avoided signing in order to plausibly deny any knowledge of the deal down the line.\n\nClifford had already talked about her relationship with Trump long before she signed the non-disclosure agreement. In a lengthy 2011 interview with InTouch magazine, she gave full details of hers and Trump's relationship.\n\nAnother salacious detail of the suit: There's an allusion to some photographic evidence of Trump and Clifford's alleged affair. The lawsuit makes reference to \"Images and/or Property and/or other Confidential Information relating to DD\" that Clifford might have, and, if her suit is successful, she could sell whatever she has.\n\nClifford also confirmed that she was shopping her story around before the election, and claims that her January 2018 statement that she received no cash from Trump in order to keep quiet about their affair was coerced.\n\nAnd Wednesday, Clifford's lawyer Michael Avenatti appeared on NBC's \"Today\" show to say she would be returning the $130,000 payment, which was part of the alleged non-disclosure agreement.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of this case, life won't ever be the same for the real-life actor David Dennison -- whose IMDB page includes such apropos credits as \"Indictment: Dead Witnesses Can't Talk\" and \"Divided We Unite.\"\n\nCover image: Adult film actress/director Stormy Daniels attends the 2018 Adult Video News Awards at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino on January 27, 2018 in Las Vegas.

                "body": "The U.N.'s human rights chief said Wednesday he strongly suspects Myanmar has committed \"acts of genocide\" against the Rohingya, as his office warned of continued ethnic cleansing of the country's Muslim minority.\n\nZeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said in a speech to the U.N.'s Human Rights Council that the reported bulldozing of mass graves showed a \"deliberate attempt by the authorities to destroy evidence of potential international crimes, including possible crimes against humanity.\"\n\nHis comments came after his colleague Andrew Gilmour, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, said Tuesday that Myanmar's ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya was continuing through a systematic campaign of \"terror and forced starvation.\"\n\nSpeaking after meeting with Rohingya who had recently arrived in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh, Gilmour said the nature of the campaign had changed since Myanmar's military launched its brutal crackdown six months ago, driving hundreds of thousands to flee across the border.\n\n\"The nature of the violence has changed from the frenzied bloodletting and mass rape of last year to a lower-intensity campaign of terror and forced starvation that seems to be designed to drive the remaining Rohingya from their homes and into Bangladesh,\" he said.\n\nHe said the ongoing persecution of the Rohingya meant that any potential return of the refugees was impossible at present, despite Myanmar's claims it was ready to begin accepting returning refugees.\n\n\"The government of Myanmar is busy telling the world that it is ready to receive Rohingya returnees, while at the same time its forces are continuing to drive them into Bangladesh,\" he said.\n\n\"Safe, dignified and sustainable returns are of course impossible under current conditions.\"\n\nJames Gomez, Amnesty International's regional director, backed the U.N.'s assessment.\n\n\"There is no question that the Myanmar authorities' vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing against Rohingya is still ongoing. Fleeing Rohingya told us how they are still being forcibly starved in a bid to quietly squeeze them out of the country,\" he said,\n\n\"This is yet more evidence that any plans for organized repatriation of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh are extremely premature. No one should be returned to Myanmar until they can do so voluntarily, in safety and dignity - something that is clearly not possible today.\"\n\nSome 700,000 people have fled into Bangladesh since August, joining 200,000 who had already taken refuge in the camps during a previous wave of violence.\n\nDespite extensive evidence to the contrary, Myanmar's military has denied committing abuses, apart from one incident in which it said security forces were involved in the killing of 10 unarmed Rohingya. It says its military operation has been a legitimate response to target Rohingya militants who fatally attacked police posts in August.\n\nIt denies that the Rohingya, a long disenfranchised Muslim minority in the predominantly Buddhist country, legitimately belong in Myanmar, where the campaign against the group has widespread support.\n\nCover image: A Rohingya refugee child at Cox's Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh on January 27, 2018.

It's the first space lab, capable of hosting manned missions and conducting space research.\n\nA Chinese space station is going to fall out of the sky in a few weeks, and no one knows where it'll hit.\n\nThe Chinese space program lost contact with -- and their ability to steer -- the 9.4-ton Tiangong-1 in March of 2016, after it had been spinning around the earth for over four years, according to state media. Now, it's losing speed in orbit and is expected to fall into the atmosphere sometime around the first week of April. The craft will tumble back into the atmosphere, and perhaps break up, and where it will fall is difficult to predict. Still, it's pretty unlikely to hit anyone on reentry.\n\n\"We can confidently say that this object will reenter somewhere between 43° North and 43° South latitudes,\" Aerospace, a federally funded space research center, wrote in a report.\n\nThat's about two-thirds of the world. New York City is just south of the 43rd parallel north, which runs through southern France and parts of Russia; the 43rd south runs south of the entire continents of Africa and Australia, and runs into the southern tips of Chile and Argentina in South America.\n\nThe Tiangong was a big-deal launch in 2012 for the Chinese space program. It's the first space lab, capable of hosting manned missions and conducting space research.\n\n\"The reason we can't predict where accurately is because we can't predict when. The reason we can't predict when is because when depends on how much headwind it's experiencing,\" Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell told VICE News.\n\nThe conditions on the sun affect the conditions of the upper atmosphere, and while we can measure the conditions on the sun pretty accurately, they're hard to predict in advance, according to McDowell.\n\nAdding to the challenge is that Tiangong rotates around the Earth about once every 90 minutes. So predicting where it will land involves predicting when it'll fall out of orbit with great precision.\n\nNonetheless, the report's authors write that \"the probability that a specific person (like you) will be struck by Tiangong-1 debris is about one million times smaller than the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot.\" The report notes, too, that only one person has ever been hit by any space junk. Lottie Williams was hit by debris from a NASA satellite in 1997, according to Fox News Tech. She wasn't hurt.\n\nWilliams described the piece of debris that hit her as she was walking through a park in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as having the weight of an empty soda can.\n\nSatellites fall out of orbit more often than most people know. There are nearly 19,000 artificial satellites in orbit at right now, according to space-track.org, which is run by the U.S. Air Force's Joint Space Operation Center. (Check out this visualization, Stuff in Space, of all the satellites currently in orbit.) In January, what is believed to be a Russian rocket fell into Peru, where locals found parts of it, mostly disintegrated on reentry.\n\nThe Tiangong-1, too, is expected to mostly disintegrate on reentry. Should any of the debris hit the ground, it'll likely fall within an area of about 100 kilometers.\n\nEven if there's a low risk of it posing any threat to people, McDowell told the Guardian, \"Tiangong-1 is big and dense, so we need to keep an eye on it.\"\n\nThe Aerospace report notes, too, that the space ship could be carrying a toxic fuel called hydrazine, used as a propellant in space. \"For your safety, do not touch any debris you may find on the ground nor inhale vapors it may emit,\" the report says.\n\nCover image: Scientists look at the screen showing the Shenzhou X manned spacecraft conducting docking with the orbiting Tiangong-1 space module at Beijing Aerospace Control Center on June 13, 2013 in Beijing, China.

                "title": "White House economic adviser Gary Cohn is resigning over Trump's trade war",
                "body": "The announcement came just hours after Trump assured reporters at a press conference that, \"Believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office.\"\n\nTwo hours after President Donald Trump bragged to reporters that, \"Everyone wants to work at the White House,\" his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, announced that he is resigning from his job with the administration.\n\nCohn, the leader of the National Economic Council, is expected to leave his job in the coming weeks, the White House confirmed. Before his announcement, Cohn had advocated against Trump's plan to ignite a trade war by imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, the New York Times reported, but was unable to stop Trump from forging ahead with the nationalist proposal.\n\nThose tariffs were the last straw for Cohn, the Times reported.\n\n\"Gary has been my chief economic adviser and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,\" Trump told the Times. \"He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\"\n\nThe announcement came just hours after Trump assured reporters at a press conference that, \"Believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office.\"\n\nCohn, a Democrat, is the latest in a steady stream of Trump officials who have left the White House, including national security adviser Michael Flynn, chief of staff Reince Priebus, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, communications director Anthony Scaramucci, chief strategist Steve Bannon, and White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman.\n\nHope Hicks, the White House's current communications director, announced last week that she also plans to leave the administration, after her reported ex-boyfriend staff secretary Rob Porter quit following allegations of domestic abuse that tied up his security clearance. His resignation led to the firing of two other White House staffers who were also unable to obtain full security clearances, and the demotion of Jared Kushner from top secret clearance to secret clearance.\n\nStaff turnover at the Trump White House is higher than the turnover rate in the last five administrations. It's triple the turnover rate of the Obama administration, and double that of the Reagan administration, a Brookings Institution report found in January. With his resignation, Cohn will be the sixth member of the Trump administration to depart in the last month alone, a group that includes Hicks, Porter, tech adviser Reed Cordish, communications aide Josh Raffel, speechwriter David Sorenson, and adviser George David Banks.",

                "title": "As the U.S. focused on painkillers, fentanyl caused a 30 percent spike in overdoses",
                "body": "Last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the creation of a \"Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Task Force,\" which will \"focus on targeting opioid manufacturers and distributors who have contributed to the epidemic.\" Last summer, Sessions launched an \"Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit\" within the Department of Justice, assigning 12 prosecutors to \"focus solely on investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud related to prescription opioids.\"\n\nThe number of opioid overdoses in the United States soared by nearly 30 percent last year, according to new data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But while the Trump administration's response to the opioid epidemic has largely focused on curbing access to prescription painkillers, the CDC report indicates that the spike in overdoses is likely being driven by heroin and illicit fentanyl.\n\nThe CDC looked at emergency room visits and hospital billing data on opioid-involved overdoses from July 2016 to September 2017 in 45 states. The report indicates the problem is getting worse in major cities and in a handful of states, mostly in the Midwest, where overdoses skyrocketed by nearly 70 percent. Not all of the incidents were fatal, and the CDC found that \"people who have had an overdose are more likely to have another.\"\n\nThe report doesn't devote much space to the underlying cause of the overdose problem, but the CDC authors do note that the dramatic increase is \"possibly related to the wide variation in the availability and potency of illicit drug products (e.g., fentanyl sold as or mixed into heroin) that increase overdose risk and drive increases in mortality.\"\n\nThat finding is starkly at odds with how the government -- including the CDC itself -- has tried to combat the opioid crisis thus far, by cracking down on doctors who prescribe opioids and making it much harder for people get access to pain medications.\n\nLast week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the creation of a \"Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Task Force,\" which will \"focus on targeting opioid manufacturers and distributors who have contributed to the epidemic.\" Last summer, Sessions launched an \"Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit\" within the Department of Justice, assigning 12 prosecutors to \"focus solely on investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud related to prescription opioids.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the CDC has tightened guidelines for primary care doctors prescribing opioids for chronic pain, and the government is currently mulling a policy change that would further restrict access to opioids for people on Medicare.\n\nThere's ample evidence to suggest that increased access to prescription opioids in the late 1990s and early 2000s contributed to the current crisis, but the latest federal data shows how the landscape has shifted in recent years. Most people who start misusing prescription pills didn't have the medication prescribed to them, and more people are turning to cheaper, more dangerous street drugs like heroin. Opioid prescribing rates peaked in 2010 and have fallen steadily since, but heroin overdose rates have quadrupled since 2010, and ODs linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased 72 percent from 2014 to 2015.\n\nThe implication is that the crackdown on prescription painkillers hasn't stopped people from using opioids. If anything, it's driving users to the black market, where drugs are increasingly tainted with fentanyl and the elephant tranquilizer carfentanil, which are both several orders of magnitude stronger than heroin.\n\nAt the same time, pain patients and the doctors who treat them are pleading for relief. They have also warned that tight restrictions on prescription pills could be driving legitimate pain patients to turn to heroin and fentanyl.\n\nThe recent CDC report includes some sensible recommendations to address the overdose problem, including expanded access to the overdose reversal drug naloxone, an embrace of harm reduction programs such as needle exchanges, and increased availability of medication-assisted treatments such as methadone and suboxone.\n\nIt seems unlikely, however, that the Trump administration will actually implement any of those ideas. The White House's answer to the opioid crisis thus far has been limited funding and a return to the failed \"just say no\" campaign from the Reagan era. The Justice Department has indicted two suspected fentanyl kingpins, but the Chinese government refuses to arrest them. Trump himself has expressed a desire to execute drug dealers, but if the new CDC report tells us anything it's that the opioid crisis has already caused enough deaths.\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE News US.",

The Hatch Act bans most executive branch employees from campaigning.\n\nThe first violation occurred on Nov. 20, when Conway appeared on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends\" and gave an \"implied endorsement\" of the Republican candidate Roy Moore, according to the report.\n\n\"Doug Jones in Alabama, folks, don't be fooled,\" Conway told the cable show. \"He will be a vote against tax cuts. He is weak on crime. Weak on borders. He is strong on raising your taxes. He is terrible for property owners. Doug Jones is a doctrinaire liberal, which is why he is not saying anything and why the media are trying to boost him.\"\n\nThen, on Dec. 6, Conway showed up on CNN's \"New Day\" and attacked Jones, while defending Moore from allegations that he'd sexually molested a 14-year-old girl. At the time, CNN's Chris Cuomo reminded Conway, \"You've got to be careful about the Hatch Act.\"",

                "body": "The last summit took place in 2007, when South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun met Kim's father, Kim Jong Il.\n\nNorth Korea is offering a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests in return for talks with U.S., a top South Korean official said Tuesday.\n\nThe potential opening comes after a delegation from Seoul held their first ever face-to-face meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Monday.\n\nSpeaking in Seoul on his return from Pyongyang, national security director Chung Eui-yong claimed North Korea is open to \"heart-to-heart\" talks with the United States, \"in an open-ended dialogue to discuss the issue of denuclearization and to normalize relations.\"\n\nChung also announced the two Koreas had agreed to hold the first summit between the countries' leaders in more than a decade, which will be held on the southern side of the demilitarized zone in April.\n\nThe last summit took place in 2007, when South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun met Kim's father, Kim Jong Il.\n\nChung said North Korea had made clear during talks that it wouldn't need nukes if the military threats against it were resolved and its security was assured. Pyongyang had agreed to stop conducting nuclear and missile tests while it was engaging in talks with South Korea, and promised not to use weapons, conventional or nuclear, against the South, he said.\n\nThe two countries also agreed to open a telephone hotline between their leaders, Chung said.\n\nThe announcement came after an unprecedented face-to-face meeting in Pyongyang between Kim Jong Un and senior South Korean officials, in which the delegations sat down for dinner together amid an atmosphere described by North Korean state media as \"compatriotic and sincere.\"\n\nState media released photographs showing Kim and his sister Kim Yo Jong smiling and laughing as they hosted the high-powered South Korean delegation, with Kim's wife Ri Sol Ju also present. The meeting took place following an invitation delivered by Kim Yo Jong during her visit south for the Winter Olympics, part of a wave of recent moves towards rapprochement.\n\nOther than maverick former NBA player Dennis Rodman and a former Chinese official, the South Korean delegation were believed to be the first non-North Koreans Kim had met with since he assumed power in 2011, CNN reported.\n\nNorth Korean state media reported that, following the meeting, Kim had said it was his \"firm will to vigorously advance\" the relationship between the Koreas and pursue reunification. It reported the two sides had \"made a satisfactory agreement,\" but did not provide details on what that entailed.\n\nIn comments to students at a military academy following the delegation's return Tuesday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his government was looking to strengthen its defense capability, at the same time as it sought to cultivate better relations with the North.\n\n\"We have started our journey for peace and prosperity with confidence that we can build denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula with our own strength,\" he said. \"But at the same time, we have to do our best to build countermeasure capability for North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles.\"\n\nNorth Korea has repeatedly dangled the promise of freezing its nuclear and missiles programs in the past, but has ultimately continued to develop its capabilities, fueling growing tensions with the United States. Last year, one of its diplomats said it was willing to freeze missile tests in exchange for the U.S. cancelling joint military exercises with the South.\n\nU.S. president Donald Trump posted his reaction to news Tuesday, saying \"we will see what happens.\"\n\nChung is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief U.S. officials on their talks in the North. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously said that talks with Pyongyang will happen only \"under the right conditions.\"\n\nChung Eui-Yong (4th R), head of the presidential National Security Office talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (5th R) during their dinner on March 5, 2018 in Pyongyang, North Korea.

The pair remain in a critical condition in Salisbury District Hospital.\n\nSpecialist counter-terrorism officers were called to help local police investigate, but Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police, warned against spreading conspiracy theories.\n\n\"There are deaths which attract attention,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Tuesday. \"I think we have to remember that Russian exiles are not immortal, they do all die and there can be a tendency for some conspiracy theories. But likewise we have to be alive to the fact of state threats as illustrated by the Litvinenko case.\"\n\nSkripal was one of four spies pardoned by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2010 as part of a spy swap deal that saw the repatriation of 10 deep cover sleeper agents planted by Moscow in the U.S. -- including \"Russia's most glamorous secret agent\" Anna Chapman. What happened?\n\nSkripal and the woman, who has yet to be formally named, were found on a bench in the Maltings shopping centre at 4.10 p.m. Sunday. CCTV footage seized by the police from a nearby gym shows the pair walking through an alleyway connecting an Italian restaurant with the bench at 3.47 p.m.\n\nPolice closed the restaurant Monday \"as a precaution.\"\n\nA passerby told the BBC: \"They looked like they had been taking something quite strong.\" Who is Sergei Skripal?\n\nSkripal worked at the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, and rose to the rank of colonel before moving to the Russian foreign ministry's office in Moscow. In 2003 he went into business for himself.\n\nHowever, he was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006 for passing the identities of Russian agents working undercover in Europe to MI6.\n\nThe FSB said Skripal had been passing state secrets to British intelligence since the 1990s and had been paid $100,000.\n\nSkripal was pardoned in 2010 and given refuge by the U.K. He was assumed to have been given a new identity, but Land Registry records obtained by the Guardian reveal he bought a house in Salisbury under his own name in 2011 for $360,000 with no mortgage.\n\nHis wife died two years after he arrived in the U.K. and his son died last year while on holiday in Russia, though the death was not treated as suspicious. Skripal has one surviving daughter who does not live in the U.K. What did the police say?\n\nThe pair are \"currently being treated for suspected exposure to an unknown substance,\" Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden told reporters. \"The focus is trying to establish what has caused these people to become critically ill.\"\n\n\"We are working with partners to prioritize this diagnosis and ensure that they receive the most appropriate and timely treatment.\" What has the Kremlin said?\n\nDmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, told journalists that Moscow had \"no information\" on the incident, but they were prepared to help with the investigation.\n\n\"We see this tragic situation but we don't have information on what could have led to this, what he was engaged in\", he said.\n\nOne Russian newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, had its own theory as to what happened Skripal:\n\n\"It cannot be ruled out that separate groups within British intelligence services are involved in such operations against defectors, who are already entirely in the (control) of new their owners, in order to discredit the Russian Federation and prevent the normalisation of relations between Moscow and London.\"\n\nAndrew Foxall, director of the Russia and Eurasia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, points out that there are now more Russian spies in the U.K. than at the height of the Cold War.\n\n\"While it is too soon to attribute responsibility, it would be foolhardy if the authorities were not to explore the Russia connection in relation to Mr. Skripal's illness,\" Foxall said.\n\nCover image: Pictured in this file image dated August 9, 2006, is retired colonel Sergei Skripal during a hearing at the Moscow District Court.

                "body": "The primaries in Texas in many ways mirror what's going on in races around the country with Republican incumbents retiring, perhaps too many Democrats running, and lots of female candidates. The results in Texas could be an early predictor for how races across the country play out this year.\n\nThe 2018 midterms officially kick off Tuesday with primary elections in Texas for 36 House seats, Ted Cruz's Senate seat, a governorship, and control of a state legislature all up for grabs this November.\n\nDemocrats in and out of Washington have been impatiently counting down the days to the midterms since Donald Trump won the presidency and Republicans maintained majorities in both chambers of Congress in 2016. The out-of-power party has targeted several Republican-held House seats in Texas in their quest to retake the majority in the House and depose Speaker Paul Ryan by winning 24 more seats.\n\nTuesday night is the first step in what will be a long road, paved with infighting and money, to November.\n\nThe primaries in Texas in many ways mirror what's going on in races around the country with Republican incumbents retiring, perhaps too many Democrats running, and lots of female candidates. The results in Texas could be an early predictor for how races across the country play out this year.\n\nHere's what you need to know: A lot of Democrats are running.\n\nFor the first time in 25 years, Democrats are running in all 36 House districts, according to the Wall Street Journal. In years past, Democrats wouldn't bother challenging some Republicans who appeared unbeatable. Fired up by the Trump presidency, however, 111 Democrats have filed to run for Congress in Texas leading to energetic and, at times chaotic, campaigns.\n\nThat chaos peaked two weeks ago when the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee waded into a key swing district and attacked Houston-area candidate Laura Moser, who the committee believes is a weaker general election candidate than her opponents. But the move may have backfired; Moser used the attack to rally her progressive base. The results of Tuesday's primary could affect how the national party operates for the rest of the cycle. And a lot of women are running.\n\nRight now, Texas has 36 representatives in the House, but only three of them are women. That's likely to change this year because at least 50 female challengers are running in the primaries on Tuesday -- 36 Democrats and 14 Republicans. Since some women are running against other women, that number will go down after the primaries, but voters will decide on Tuesday just how many women candidates will be on the ballot in November. Democrats are energized and voting early.\n\nThe number of Democrats choosing to vote early in the state's ten counties with the most registered voters has more than doubled compared to this point during the 2014 midterms. Republican early vote turnout, meanwhile, was only up at 15 percent, according to the Texas Tribune. So far, 370,219 Democrats have voted, compared to 282,928 Republicans.\n\nWhile it's unclear if the final vote numbers will match the early vote numbers with increased turnout, it's certainly an indicator that Democrats are not only marching but also voting. Even in conservative Texas, Democratic energy in the Trump era could be enough to win several congressional seats, and maybe more, this November. Democrats are trying to take down Ted Cruz.\n\nBeyond the House of Representatives, Democrats are daydreaming about beating Sen. Ted Cruz this November. In Washington, they think have a shot of winning with a handsome, articulate, and tireless candidate in Rep. Beto O'Rourke. A three-term congressman and former punk-rocker from El Paso, O'Rourke has proven himself an able fundraiser while criss-crossing the state and stumping in every small town he can find.\n\nRepublican Party leaders, however, don't think O'Rourke has a prayer. Dream on, they say. The primaries likely won't end on Tuesday.\n\nTo win a primary in Texas, a candidate needs to earn 50 percent of the vote. But some of these races have so many candidates -- multiple seats have seven Democrats running and one has drawn 18 Republican candidates -- that it will be difficult for any one candidate to reach the 50 percent threshold. The top two candidates will then go on to a May 22 runoff.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter @AlxThomp.\n\nCover image: Jim Mathis looks to place a campaign sign near a polling site as early voting begins, Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2018, in San Antonio.

                "title": "The wildest things former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg just said on live TV",
                "body": "\"I think he may have done something during the election,\" Nunberg told MSNBC's Katy Tur. \"I don't know that for sure.\"\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg plans to defy a subpoena he says he received from special counsel Bob Mueller, and if that means he'll get tossed in jail, so be it. But he is ready to talk -- to the media.\n\nNunberg, who was fired from the Trump campaign back in August 2015 over racist Facebook posts, said he'd already sat down for at least one interview with Mueller's team as part of their investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. But Nunberg says he's not going to continue cooperating with Mueller, in part because he believes the investigation will target his \"mentor,\" Roger Stone. Nunberg said Stone, a longtime Trump confidante who once ran a lobbying firm with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, is innocent. (Manafort is set to go to trial after pleading not guilty to a 32-count federal indictment brought by Mueller in February.)\n\n\"I'm not cooperating, arrest me,\" Nunberg told CNN's Jake Tapper over the phone Monday, essentially daring Mueller to file a motion to have Nunberg charged with contempt of court.\n\nNunberg dropped a series of bombshells over the course of three live interviews on MSNBC and CNN, including an assertion that President Donald Trump may be guilty of \"something.\"\n\n\"I think he may have done something during the election,\" Nunberg told MSNBC's Katy Tur. \"I don't know that for sure.\"\n\nIn a later interview with MSNBC's Ari Gellar, Nunberg said \"Trump did something bad,\" and said one line of questioning focused on Trump's business dealings.\n\nTrump wasn't the only person who Nunberg, who did not immediately respond to a VICE News request for comment, talked trash about on Monday. the most outrageous moments from Nunberg's media blitz: The subpoena is \"ridiculous\"\n\nNunberg says he's refusing to comply with the subpoena and appear before a grand jury on Friday, because its requests are too broad and \"absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\n\"I think it would be funny if they arrested me,\" he added.\n\nThe subpoena calls for Nunberg to turn over documents that date back to Nov. 1, 2015, and include communications with Trump, Stone, ex-White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, and former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, among several others, according to the New York Times.\n\n\"The president's right. It's a witch hunt,\" Nunberg told MSNBC's Katy Tur. \"Why do I have to spend 80 hours going over my emails that I had with Steve Bannon and Roger Stone? Why does Bob Mueller need to see my emails when I send Roger and Steve clips and we talk about how much we hate people?\"\n\nThe emails were due at 3 p.m., he said, a deadline he missed while on television. Nunberg is also scheduled to testify before a grand jury on Friday -- a meeting he initially said he intended to skip, before appearing to change his mind while on live television with MSNBC's Ari Gellar.\n\nNunberg said he wasn't a subject or a target of the investigation and that Mueller also offered him immunity. \"Idiot\" Donald Trump caused the Russia investigation\n\nNunberg may have once wanted to help Trump win the presidency, but he told Gellar he's no longer friendly with Trump, calling him the \"most disloyal person you're ever going to meet.\" Nunberg also told Tapper of the president, \"He treated me like crap.\"\n\nNunberg went on to bemoan his rising legal fees, pinning the blame for the investigation squarely on Trump.\n\n\"Granted Donald Trump caused this, because he's an idiot,\" he said. \"Cause he decided to give an interview to Lester Holt the day after he fired James Comey, and then he decided to have the Russians in the Oval Office.\"\n\nAt the same time, Nunberg maintained that Trump himself had not colluded with Russians to swing the 2016 election, despite his earlier assertion that the Mueller investigation had \"something\" on Trump.\n\n\"It is the biggest joke to ever think Donald Trump colluded with the Russians,\" Nunberg told Tur. Carter Page is a \"scumbag\"\n\nCarter Page has now found himself at the center of several investigations in Russian involvement in the 2016 election, but according to Nunberg, he was only a peripheral player in the campaign itself.\n\n\"Do you think I would communicate with Carter Page? He's a scumbag,\" Nunberg told Tapper. He aded, \"And he was colluding with the Russians.\"\n\nNunberg claimed that Page wasn't really an adviser, but was counted as part of the Trump campaign because officials \"were happy to get anybody they could get.\" \"I think that Carter Page is a weird dude,\" Nunberg concluded. \"I don't think he should have been involved in that campaign.\" Mueller wants Nunberg to testify about Wikileaks\n\nNunberg said he believes Mueller is looking at Stone's communications with Julian Assange.\n\n\"They want me to testify against Roger,\" Nunberg told CNN. \"They want me to say that Roger was going around telling people he was colluding with Julian Assange.\"\n\nIn a vague statement to CNN after Nunberg's interview, Stone said, \"I was briefly part of the Trump campaign and has [sic] been the President's friend and adviser for decades; and would expect that Mueller's team would at some point ask for any documents or emails sent or written by me. But let me reiterate, I have no knowledge or involvement in Russian Collusion [sic] or any other inappropriate act.\"\n\nStone and WikiLeaks communicated directly through private Twitter messages in October, the Atlantic reported last week. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., also communicated with Assange during the campaign. There are other targets\n\nThough Nunberg focused his train of thought largely on Trump, Stone, Bannon and Page, he did name other names. Nunberg said Mueller's team also requested emails from the recently resigned White House communications director Hope Hicks, Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen, and one-time campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\n\"I was thinking about this today, Katy, I was preparing it. Should I spend 50 hours going over all my emails with Roger and with Steve Bannon,\" he told MSNBC's Tur. \"And then they wanted emails that I had with Hope Hicks, with Corey Lewandowski, are you -- give me a break. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nNunberg also told Tur the questions focused on links between Trump and Russia.\n\n\"You know what they asked -- they asked things like, 'Did you hear people speaking Russian in the Trump office?' Katy, I did not hear people speaking Russian in the Trump office. They asked things like, 'Did you hear about Trump Tower Moscow?' No, I never heard about Trump Tower Moscow,\" he said. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a \"big fat slob\" but that's not why she's a joke\n\nAs Nunberg continued to give interviews, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied Nunberg's allegations about Trump during a White House briefing.\n\n\"I definitely think he doesn't know that for sure because he's incorrect,\" Sanders said. \"As we've said many times before, there was no collusion with the Trump campaign. Anything further on what his actions are -- he hasn't worked at the White House, so I certainly can't speak to him or the lack of knowledge that he clearly has.\"\n\nIn a subsequent interview with New York One, Nunberg said \"it's fine\" if Sanders wants to attack him, because, \"Everyone knows she's a joke.\"\n\n\"Okay fine, yeah, she's unattractive, she's a fat slob, but that's irrelevant,\" Nunberg said. \"The person she works for has a 30 percent approval rating.\"\n\nNunberg didn't stop there, later telling Melber, \"And I'm warning her, to shut her mouth.\" Is Nunberg on something?\n\nNunberg's friends believe he may have been drunk throughout his Monday media blitz, the Daily Beast reported. So CNN's Erin Burnett asked Nunberg about the rumors flat-out.\n\n\"You're sitting very close to me,\" Burnett told Nunberg. \"We talked earlier about what people in the White House are saying about you, whether you're drinking or on drugs or whatever had happened today. Talking to you, I have smelled alcohol on your breath.\" \"Well, I haven't had a drink,\" Nunberg replied.\n\n\"Antidepressants. Is that okay?\" Nunberg said. \"They can say whatever they want. Once again, they're pathetic.\"",

                "title": "Here's a guide to all the Netanyahu corruption scandals",
                "body": "\"His major ticket has always been, 'I'm the guy who best understands the United States,'\" Lipner said. \"Thousands of supporters at AIPAC [the annual policy conference] will give him a standing ovation. It doesn't get much better than that.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit with U.S. president and Twitter-pal Donald Trump couldn't come at a better time for the beleaguered leader, who faces mounting corruption charges that has him fighting for his political life.\n\nThe Israeli leader arrived in Washington for a five-day trip where he's expected to discuss shared concerns like Iran, Syria, and Palestinian peace negotiations with Trump. But the U.S. visit also doubles as a critical political lifeline for Netanyahu, who can play to his strengths abroad while temporarily distancing himself from the mounting pile of corruption probes he faces back home.\n\nIn this regard, the trip to America is \"fortuitous,\" said Shalom Lipner, a nonresident senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings.\n\n\"His major ticket has always been, 'I'm the guy who best understands the United States,'\" Lipner said. \"Thousands of supporters at AIPAC [the annual policy conference] will give him a standing ovation. It doesn't get much better than that.\"\n\nHe needs the boost.\n\nNetanyahu has tried to bat away one corruption charge after another for months, but the charges continue to stick. The Israeli police recommended last month that Netanyahu be indicted for fraud, bribery, and breach of trust for actions connected to two of the four corruption probes. Things appeared to get worse for Bibi on Monday, when Israel's Justice Ministry announced that his former confidant and top media adviser Nir Hefetz had turned state's witness against him in two of the four corruption cases circling the prime minister's office.\n\nHefetz, whose association with Netanyahu dates back to 2009, is suspected of bribery and obstruction of justice in one of the cases against Netanyahu, and is a key figure in other investigations surrounding him. He's the third, and most significant, of the prime minister's former confidants to turn against him in the mounting graft investigations.\n\nNetanyahu has taken a defiant, at times Trumpian, approach to the investigations and the 24-7 media coverage that's trailed it, regularly posting directly to Facebook and Twitter to deny all the \"outlandish\" charge against him.\n\nYet his adamant insistence hasn't stopped the Israeli political machine from pursuing one pressing question: Can Bibi beat back the crisis stalking his office and hold onto his fragile coalition government?\n\n\"Ultimately, there are two clocks ticking: legal and political,\" said Lipner.\n\nNetanyahu has hinted he could call a snap election to bolster his mandate in a bid to stave off political opportunists and mounting legal probes; polls suggest Israelis would reward him at the voting booth if he did so.\n\n\"This is pretty intense, but Netanyahu's faced -- and braved -- legal challenges before,\" Lipner said, pointing to the previous crises that brought down Israel's ruling government. Still, he said there's no doubt \"political piranhas are circling Netanyahu's office.\"\n\nHere's a rundown of the corruption cases against Netanyahu. CASE 1000\n\nIsrael police, seemingly aware of confusion about all the corruption cases, have made them a bit easier to follow by giving each one a numerical identifier: Case 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000.\n\nIn case 1000, Netanyahu is accused of accepting nearly $300,000 in lavish gifts, including cigars and champagne, from Israeli billionaire businessman Arnon Milchan, a Hollywood producer, and Australian billionaire James Packer between 2007 and 2016.\n\nPolice say the gifts grew in \"scope and frequency\" after Netanyahu became Israel's leader for a second time in 2009, and that Milchan's gifts were given \"in return for his action.\"\n\nPolice argue that Netanyahu used his power as Israel's leader to lobby on Milchan's behalf to then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry regarding an issue the film producer had extending a U.S. visa. He also sought to legislate tax breaks in the mogul's favor. Police haven't said what Packer is alleged to have gained from the relationship.\n\nLast month, police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted for accepting bribes, fraud, and breach of trust in relation to his dealings with Milchan, and for fraud and breach of trust in connection with Packer's gifts.\n\nThe case now rests with state prosecutors and Israel's Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who will ultimately decide whether to file charges. Another of Netanyahu's former confidants, former chief of staff Ari Harow, has testified against him in this case. CASE 2000\n\nPolice say that in 2009 Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, publisher of the Yedioth Ahronoth, a leading Israeli newspaper, struck a deal meant to serve their mutual interests. The bare bones of the alleged deal are that Mozes's newspaper would provide flattering coverage of Netanyahu, and in return Netanyahu would support the publication, in part by working to hinder the growth of Israel Hayom, a free, right-wing rival publication funded by U.S. super-donor Sheldon Adelson.\n\nIt's not clear whether the deal was ever acted on, but the police case hinges on voice recordings of meetings between Netanyahu and Mozes that were covertly taken by Harow, now a state's witness in this case.\n\nPolice recommended last month that in this case, Netanyahu should be charged with requesting a bribe, fraud, and breach of trust. They recommended Mozes be charged with offering a bribe.\n\nAgain, the decision on whether to file charges rests with Israel's attorney general. CASE 3000\n\nThis case probes alleged kickbacks in a multibillion-dollar deal to buy submarines and patrol boats from German firm ThyssenKrupp -- specifically, that state officials were bribed to make the purchase, despite opposition to the deal from the Defense Ministry.\n\nThe people allegedly involved in the scheme include Miki Ganor, the company's sales representative in Israel, top Israeli defense officials and senior aides to Netanyahu, including the prime minister's lawyer and confidant David Shimron.\n\nNetanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal, and Mandelblit has said he will be questioned. CASE 4000\n\nThe latest investigation centers on whether people close to Netanyahu pushed financial and regulatory perks worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel's largest telecom, Bezeq, in exchange for favorable coverage of the prime minister on a subsidiary news site called Walla.\n\nNetanyahu and his wife, Sara, were questioned by police for five hours Friday as possible suspects, the eighth time he has been formally questioned over various police matters in the past 14 months.\n\nThe police interview followed the arrests of seven others implicated in the probe last month, including two individuals close to the prime minister, Hefetz, and former Communications Ministry Director-General Shlomo Filber.\n\nShaul Elovitch, Bezeq's controlling shareholder and a family friend of Netanyahu's, was also arrested, along with his wife and son, and Bezeq CEO Stella Handler. Iris Elovitch, a friend of Netanyahu's wife, is alleged to have received messages from her with instructions on what shape the coverage should take.\n\nFilber, a longtime aide to the premier, has turned state's witness; the news on Monday that Nefetz, Netanyahu's official spokesman from 2009 to 2010 and a media adviser to his family between 2014 and 2017, had joined him will \"be nothing less than an earthquake,\" Chemi Shalev, a columnist for Israel's Haaretz newspaper wrote Monday.\n\n\"Hefetz was at the crossroads of virtually everything,\" Shelev wrote. \"He can testify to all four of the 'major' investigations in which Netanyahu is involved or implicated... Hefetz was the agent of Netanyahu's ugliness and, if he tells all, Netanyahu is supposedly done for.\" CASE 1270\n\nNetanyahu has also been linked to another scandal, in which Hefetz is alleged to have made an offer in 2015 to a judge, Hila Gerstel, that she would be appointed attorney general if she blocked an investigation into Sara Netanyahu. Gerstel refused the alleged bribe. Sara, meanwhile, was indicted in September 2017 for fraud and breach of trust for excessive spending on catering at the prime minister's residence.\n\nCover image: U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mrs. Netanyahu at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 5, 2018.

Though the majority of hospitalizations were for kids between the ages of 12 and 17, children under the age of 6 accounted for a third of the hospitalizations.\n\nThe study results mirror the research on opioid-related hospitalizations among American adults, which have skyrocketed in recent years. And they're intricately linked: about 20 percent of the children who were younger than 6 when they were hospitalized needed care after ingesting methadone, a drug that's used to treat opioid addiction -- suggesting that kids were accidentally taking their parents' medication.\n\n\"These kids are really the secondary victims of this adult opioid epidemic,\" Jason Kane, the study's lead author and an associate pediatrics professor at the University of Chicago, told the Associated Press.\n\nIt's unclear why opioids are sending so many kids to the hospital, though Kane said it's likely due to the fact that opioids have become both more potent and more easily available in recent years. The study looked at hospitalizations resulting from kids taking opioids both accidentally and on purpose.",

He apparently took the money from an account with First Republic Bank, which Clifford's lawyer received in a client-trust account at City National Bank on Oct. 27, 2016, just 12 days before the presidential election. The payment was supposedly hush money to keep Daniels quiet about her alleged sexual relationship with Donald Trump in 2006, the year Melania gave birth to Trump's son Barron.\n\nFirst Republic reported the transaction to the Treasury Department as suspicious, but it's not clear what date that was. By law, banks are required to report transactions that seem illegal or out of the ordinary to Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. City National Bank also began its own inquiry into the hefty payment a year after it was completed.\n\nWhen asked to comment on news about First Republic's Treasury Department report, Cohen wrote just \"Fake News\" in an email to the Wall Street Journal, though a few weeks ago he did admit he'd made the payment. He disclosed that he paid $130,000 of his own money and had not been reimbursed by the Trump campaign. In that way, it didn't violate any laws.",

                "body": "\"We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON'T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!\" Trump tweeted on Friday, soon after announcing the proposed tariffs.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to slap high tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to America will have a more severe effect on American industries that it will on the Canadian economy, according to trade expert and Scotiabank's deputy chief economist Brett House.\n\n\"The major impact of this will be seen in the U.S. They have 6.5 million workers in industries that use steel and aluminium, and only 140,000 workers in the actual steel and aluminium producing industries,\" House told VICE Money.\n\n\"We know from past experience that Trump's initial rhetorical position is always much stronger than what is actually done, so you have to first ask yourself if these tariffs are actually going to be imposed.\"\n\nThis latest trade fiasco began late last week, when Trump abruptly announced a plan to slap 25 percent and 10 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports respectively.\n\n\"We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON'T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!\" Trump tweeted on Friday, soon after announcing the proposed tariffs.\n\nIf imposed, that effectively means that companies in the U.S. that purchase steel and aluminium from Canada will see their costs go up substantially. A vast number of American industries -- beer brewers, airplane and auto manufacturers, and companies that make machinery -- depend heavily on steel and aluminium.\n\nAmerica does not produce enough of these two metals to meet local demand, hence relying significantly on imports. Canada, for its part, is the biggest exporter of both steel and aluminum to the U.S. In 2017, for instance, the U.S. imported 26.9 million tonnes of steel -- 16 percent of it came from Canada.\n\nCanada's steel industry, despite being in decline, still supports up to 100,000 jobs in the country, according to the Canadian Steel Producers Association. Indeed, Canadian jobs could be affected if Trump actually does impose tariffs, but at the same time, U.S. industries that rely on steel and aluminium imports will have to find a way of purchasing the metals regardless.\n\n\"Look, of course the tariffs will affect Canada, somewhat. But where are companies going to get their steel and aluminium from? U.S. producers cannot suddenly ramp up production of steel and aluminium to meet demand because both industries are very capital intensive and aluminum is a very power-intensive industry, and you cannot just build production facilities overnight,\" House argues.\n\nInvoking NAFTA\n\nBut on Monday morning, Trump further hardened his stance on the tariffs by invoking the North American Free Trade Agreement as a bargaining chip.\n\n\"Tariffs on Steel and Aluminium will only come off if new and fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must treat our farmers much better. Highly restrictive,\" Trump tweeted in the early hours of Monday morning.\n\nCanada is currently in the seventh round of negotiating a new NAFTA agreement with the U.S. and Mexico, a negotiation that has been riddled with spats and severe uncertainty.\n\nThe President's Monday morning tweets only serve to complicate that situation, with Canada's Finance Minister Bill Morneau calling Trump's stance a \"disadvantage for American businesses\" and a \"disadvantage from a security standpoint as we see Canada as a staunch ally of the United States.\"\n\nWhat Canada is ultimately seeking, with regards to steel and aluminium tariffs, is an overall country exemption, one that the government believes should apply to Canada in particular because of the highly integrated nature of the North American steel market.\n\nBut on the Sunday morning cable news talk shows, Trump's top trade advisor Peter Navarro was quick to dismiss that notion. \"There's a difference between exemptions and country exclusions. There will be an exemption procedure for particular cases where we need to have exemptions so that business can move forward, but at this point in time, there will be no country exclusions.\"\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross echoed those thoughts. \"Trump has made a decision at this point. If he for some reason should change his mind, then it will change. I have no reason to believe he's going to change his mind,\" Ross told NBC's Meet the Press.\n\nFor her part, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland tweeted that she had had a discussion with Texan Republican Rep. Kevin Brady about the U.S-Canada trade relationships, although no specific details of that discussion were mentioned.",

                "body": "Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Northern League, claimed Monday that his party had the right to lead the new government.\n\nPopulist and far-right parties dominated Italy's national election Sunday, an anti-establishment surge that leaves the country's politics deadlocked and its center-left in disarray.\n\nWith more than 75 percent of the vote counted Monday, none of the three main coalitions look able to secure the majority required to govern outright, raising the prospect of weeks of tense negotiations to form a government. Who were the biggest winners?\n\nThe eurosceptic, anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the right-wing nationalist Northern League were celebrating Monday, landing more than half of the national vote between them.\n\nThe largest political bloc to emerge is the center-right grouping, led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy). Surprisingly, the strongest party within the bloc is now the Northern League, a nativist, nationalist party that tallied around 18 percent of the vote - a swing that increases their seats in the lower house from 22 to 123. By contrast, Forza Italia, which had been seen as the senior partner, only received around 14 percent of the vote.\n\nMatteo Salvini, the leader of the Northern League, claimed Monday that his party had the right to lead the new government.\n\nThe Northern League took the hardest anti-immigration line during the campaign; its \"Italians First\" message resonating with an electorate anxious over illegal migration flows that have seen 600,000 people cross the Mediterranean in the past four years, many in smugglers' boats from Libya.\n\n\"We are packed with drug dealers, rapists, burglars -- and the League is the solution,\" Northern League leader Matteo Salvini said at a campaign rally last week.\n\nThe populist Five Star Movement, founded by comedian and blogger Beppe Grillo in 2009, emerged as the strongest single party, on track to win 32 percent. It is defiantly anti-establishment, with policies drawn from left and right: tough on immigration, critical of the European Union, friendly towards Russia, but also in favor of universal basic income and environmental protections. Who was the biggest loser?\n\nFormer prime minister Matteo Renzi's ruling center-left Democratic party suffered the greatest humiliation, falling to 19 per cent, according to projections, as voters rejected the social democratic establishment. Renzi announced Monday that he had decided to resign in the wake of the result.\n\n\"The populists won and the (Democratic Party) lost,\" outgoing Democratic Party lawmaker Andrea Marcucci wrote on Facebook.\n\nIts center-left coalition with the liberal More Europe party looks set to have only 23.5 percent, making them the third-largest group in Parliament after the center-right and the Five Star Movement.\n\nMatthew Goodwin, visiting senior fellow at Chatham House, told VICE News the results continued the swing against traditional social democrat parties that has remade the political map across Europe.\n\n\"Center-left social democrats had another bad election and parties that are tough on immigration and wanted to clamp down on refugees have done very well alongside populists,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether you look at Italy, Germany, Austria, or Brexit in Britain, what we're seeing is profound political change driven by groups of voters who feel very anxious about the identity issues of immigration, national security and terror.\" What does it mean for Europe?\n\nWhile the makeup of Italy's next government will follow weeks of intense political horse-trading, both the Five Star Movement and the Northern League are in a strong position.\n\nA senior Five Star official said Monday that forming a coalition without its involvement would be impossible, while the Northern League's economics chief floated the possibility of an alliance with Five Star.\n\nA government involving both parties would likely be Eurosceptic, opposed to European Union budget restrictions and integration, posing a further headache for the EU as it grapples with surging populist movements in its member states.\n\nThe results were cheered by leading Eurosceptic and populist forces elsewhere. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, wrote on Twitter: \"The European Union is going to have a bad night.\"\n\nDonald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, in Italy to monitor the fortunes of the populist and anti-immigration parties, told Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper that an alliance between the Northern League and the Five Star Movement was \"the ultimate dream.\"\n\n\"This election is crucial for the global populist movement,\" he said, framing the opposition to illegal immigration as a question of \"sovereignty\" for Italians.\n\nCover image: Lega far right party leader Matteo Salvini laughs during a press conference held at the Lega headquarter in Milan on March 5, 2018 ahead of the Italy's general election results.

Kim also sent his sister Kim Yo Jong to the Games where she met with Moon.\n\nWhile Mike Pence failed to engage with the North Korean delegation in Pyeongchang, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last month that the U.S. was \"listening\" for any indication that Kim was \"ready to talk.\"\n\nHowever, Donald Trump, who has conducted a feud with Kim over the last 12 months, is said to be considering a different approach to the rogue state.\n\nKnown as the \"bloody nose strategy\" the administration is considering plans for a preemptive strike against a North Korean military location in a bid to scare Pyongyang into submission.\n\nCover image: Chung Eui-Yong (C), head of the presidential National Security Office, Suh Hoon (2nd L), the chief of the South's National Intelligence Service, and other delegators pose before boarding an aircraft as they leave for Pyongyang at a military airport on March 5, 2018 in Seongnam, South Korea.

In thinking about an ideal world where you could set Facebook's policies, how would you handle the following: a private message in which an adult man asks a 14-year-old girl for sexual pictures.\"\n\nUsers were given the following choices, none of which included reporting the illegal act to the police.\n\nThe second question asked who should set the rules to deal with such an incident.

Guy Rosen, a vice president of product, tweeted: \"We run surveys to understand how the community thinks about how we set policies. But this kind of activity is and will always be completely unacceptable on FB. We regularly work with authorities if identified. It shouldn't have been part of this survey.

It is also trying to deal with other questionable content, such as death threats, hate speech and extremism.\n\nCover image: In this photo illustration, the app of Facebook is displayed on a smartphone on February 12, 2018 in Berlin.

Dick's Sporting Goods, Walmart, Kroger, and L.L. Bean all announced this week they would no longer sell guns to anyone under the age of 21.\n\nIn addition, Dick's will stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, while Walmart will stop selling items resembling assault-style rifles, such as air guns.\n\nSupport for gun control is surging, even if the chances of broad national legislation are slim: a recent Quinnipiac poll found that 66 percent of voters and 50 percent of gun owners support stricter gun control. But it's hard to know whether these moves by retailers will have much of an effect on gun sales. Walmart had stopped selling assault-style rifles in 2015, citing a lack of consumer demand, and Dick's stopped selling assault-style rifles in a majority of its locations following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.\n\nWithout a national registry, we don't know exactly how many assault-style rifles are out there, though the NRA estimates there are between 8.5 and 15 million assault rifles in the U.S. An estimated 12 percent of assault-style rifles sold are purchased at large retailers, according to a report prepared for a gun industry trade group.\n\nWhile ending sales at big-box stores will create good will from their pro-gun reform customers, that may be all it does.",

Former domestic abuse, for example, was a common denominator of the church shooter in Sutherland Springs, Texas; the shooter in Las Vegas; and the 19-year-old student who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida, two weeks ago.\n\nThe 30 states would join another five -- California, Connecticut, Indiana, Oregon, and Washington -- that already have red flag laws, which allow concerned family members or law enforcement to act on the warning signs and get a type of temporary restraining order. (Connecticut was the first, in 1999, Indiana was second in 2005, and the other three passed their laws in the last four years.)\n\nAlso called the \"Extreme Risk Protection Order,\" the law establishes a process by which family members, household members, or law enforcement can petition a judge for a gun violence restraining order against a particular individual. The specific details of the bills vary from state to state. But broadly, the law would allow for a temporary seizure (a few weeks), after which a judge decides whether the gun owner's behavior warrants a longer-term ban on the weapons.\n\nIf Florida had had a \"Red Flag\" law in place, the Parkland shooter, who'd killed squirrels with a pellet gun, bragged about his guns on social media, and worried his adoptive mother so much that she had to call the cops on him dozens of times, might have had his guns confiscated before it was too late.",

                "body": "Donald Trump's fired chief strategist Steve Bannon has plenty of time on his hands these days - enough, apparently, to take a firsthand look at Italy's surging populist movements ahead of Sunday's national elections.\n\nItalian daily La Stampa broke the news that Bannon had traveled to Rome on Thursday to investigate the populist and far-right parties playing a defining role in the race. Bannon, the former head of right-wing media outlet Breitbart News, is fascinated by the tightly contested election and believes it holds major implications for populist movements in Europe, the newspaper reported.\n\nBannon had hinted that he supported the anti-migrant, anti-European Union Northern League, which is polling at about 13 percent on the back of a Trump-like \"Italians First\" campaign, La Stampa reported. He had hoped to arrange a meeting with Matteo Salvini, the Northern League's leader, but Salvini had reportedly been too busy in the final days of the campaign.\n\nThe Guardian also confirmed Bannon's trip with a senior politician for the Northern League and a Rome-based friend of Bannon's.\n\nViewed as one of Trump's most influential advisers until he was unceremoniously booted from the White House in August, Bannon should find plenty to get excited about ahead of the March 4 vote, where his brand of nationalist, anti-immigration politics is gaining traction.\n\nThe Italian election is shaping up as a three-way race between a center-right coalition led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's party that includes the Northern League; the populist, Eurosceptic Five Star Movement, Italy's most popular party; and the ruling center-left Democratic Party.\n\nImmigration, one of Bannon's major political concerns, has been one of the defining issues of the election. More than 600,000 migrants and refugees have reached Italy in the last four years, the majority of them coming on smugglers' boats across the Mediterranean from Libya.\n\nParties across the spectrum have sought to capitalize on public sentiment against migration. \"We are packed with drug dealers, rapists, burglars -- and the League is the solution,\" Salvini said at a recent campaign rally. Berlusconi has described refugees as a \"social time bomb\" and pledged to deport them in the hundreds of thousands, while even the center-left Democratic Party has taken a tougher line.\n\n\"We do not have the moral duty to welcome into Italy people who are worse off than ourselves,\" said party secretary and former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in July, urging an end to a \"do-gooder\" mentality toward migrants.\n\nBannon has always kept a close eye on European politics, even after being ousted as executive chairman at Breitbart News in January following the publication of journalist Michael Wolff's explosive White House tell-all, in which he took shots at Trump and his family. He also has a strong relationship with Nigel Farage, seen as a chief architect of Brexit, who has in turn credited Breitbart News as an influential factor in the successful campaign to leave the European Union.\n\nCover image: The former Trump chief strategist and Breitbart chairman Stephen Bannon speaks during an interview conducted by Yomiuri Shimbun in Tokyo on Dec. 19, 2017.

                "body": "Read: Trump and Putin are both very insecure about the size of their nuclear arsenals\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin staged a grand unveiling of new \"invincible\" nuclear weapons that could strike at the heart of America to thunderous applause in Moscow on Thursday, pledging they'd make U.S. missile defense technology obsolete.\n\nBut the fancy new war machines, including nuclear-powered low-flying cruise missiles and long-range undersea drones, do practically nothing to change the Cold War-legacy logic of Mutually Assured Destruction, arms control experts told VICE News -- largely because unstoppable nuclear weapons solve a problem Russia didn't actually have.\n\nInstead, Russia-watchers said, Putin's nuclear bluster was primarily a flashy campaign stunt at a time when Russia's economy continues to slog along -- and the absence of any credible challenger in this month's presidential election risks embarrassing the Russian leader with lackluster turnout despite an inevitable victory.\n\n\"This is his campaign speech,\" James Collins, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VICE News. \"I see it in the political context of an election coming up in two weeks.\"\n\nRead: Trump and Putin are both very insecure about the size of their nuclear arsenals\n\nPutin has long cast himself as Russia's greatest defender from aggressive Western countries seeking to press their advantage after winning the Cold War, and sold himself to the Russian public as the leader capable of standing up to arrogant, hypocritical foreign powers led by Washington.\n\n\"How does that affect the strategic balance? Not at all.\"\n\nNow, as Russia's March 18 election draws near, Putin has refused to debate his domestic opponents. Instead, he's made his case to the public, analysts said, by campaigning against an opponent worthy of his towering stature: America.\n\n\"Putin has been running against the United States in elections for 10 years,\" said Stephen Sestanovich, who was ambassador-at-large and special adviser to the secretary of state for the new independent states of the former Soviet Union under former U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"Two-and-a-half weeks before the election, the primary audience of any speech, is, of course, the voters he wants to turn out,\" Sestanovich told VICE News.\n\nPutin described the new nukes as a response to an aggressive U.S. missile defense effort, an \"American machine\" encircling Russia in Alaska, California, Poland, Romania, Japan, South Korea and on 35 U.S. ships \"deployed to regions in close proximity to Russia's borders.\"\n\n\"If we do not do something, eventually this will result in the complete devaluation of Russia's nuclear potential,\" Putin said. \"All of our missiles could simply be intercepted.\"\n\nRead: Putin's \"Erik Prince\" is tied to some of Russia's riskiest covert\n\nBut the truth is that Russia doesn't need newfangled unstoppable nuclear delivery systems -- because its existing arsenal of 7,000 some-odd nukes could already overwhelm American defense systems, arms control experts said.\n\n\"How does that affect the strategic balance? Not at all,\" said Joshua Pollack, a nuclear weapons expert and editor of the Nonproliferation Review.\n\n\"No existing or prospective missile defense had any chance in making a dent in Russia's ability to retaliate against the United States with nuclear weapons,\" Pollack told VICE News. \"From that point of view, this is pushing on an open door. It doesn't add anything.\"\n\nPollack said if Russia actually does field these next generation nuclear weapons, it would complicate future arms control negotiations, which rely on careful definitions of what each side can deploy as well as agreements on how those forces will be monitored.\n\n\"Putin is doubling down not just on nationalism and militarism, but on a sense that Russia is basically alone in the world, under threat, and needs to show that it has sharp, sharp teeth.\"\n\nYet more than anything else, Putin's speech showed just how tense relations between Washington and Moscow have become, across a wide range of issues, long-time Russia watchers said.\n\nPutin's announcement follows reports that U.S. forces killed and injured roughly 300 Russian mercenaries in Syria in February, and as a long-running low-grade conflict in eastern Ukraine grinds on along Russia's border. In December, Washington angered Moscow by approving shipments of lethal weapons to the government of Ukraine to support its fight against pro-Russian separatists. The first delivery is now expected within weeks.\n\nRead: Putin is trying to downplay the deaths of Russian mercenaries in Syria\n\nHis unveiling of advanced nuclear weapons reveals the mindset of a leader who sees his country surrounded and locked in zero-sum competition with the west, Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian security issues, told VICE News.\n\n\"Putin is doubling down not just on nationalism and militarism, but on a sense that Russia is basically alone in the world, under threat, and needs to show that it has sharp, sharp teeth,\" Galeotti said by phone from Prague.\n\n\"For the foreseeable future, it looks that the US-Russia agenda will be limited to just one item: war prevention,\" tweeted Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. \"Good luck to us all.\"",

The general hasn't had an easy time in the Trump White House, notoriously shut out of the inner circle that Kelly and Mattis enjoy membership in. Not helping matters was a BuzzFeed report that McMaster referred to Trump as an \"idiot\" with the intelligence of a \"kindergartener\" at a private dinner last November.\n\nWhite House officials began openly discussing replacing McMaster last fall, CNN reported last week, but held off because they were weary of appointing three different national security advisers in the president's first year.",

Her departure is the latest in a series of high-profile exits from the State Department, including numerous diplomats and seasoned officials, during Trump's tenure.\n\n\"I have come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures,\" Jacobson said in her resignation letter, as reported by the New York Times. \"This decision is all the more difficult because of my profound belief in the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship and knowledge that it is at a crucial moment.\"\n\nJacobson will be resigning in May after serving just two years as ambassador. She was nominated by President Obama in 2015, but a partisan fight led by Marco Rubio based on her work to warm relations with Cuba kept her from being confirmed for nearly a year.\n\nShe spent most of her 31-year Foreign Service career in Latin America, including as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Canada, Mexico and NAFTA issues from 2007 to 2010, and as the director of the Office of Mexican Affairs from December 2002 to 2007.",

                "body": "\"The trip to Israel makes no sense,\" Grzegorz Schetyna, head of Poland's largest opposition party, Civic Platform.\n\nStarting today in Poland, it's a crime to say Poles were complicit in any Nazi war crimes. The controversial law went into effect as Polish and Israeli officials met in a bid to defuse tensions over the legislation.\n\nPoland has faced strong criticism from Israel over the law, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing it last month as an attempt to rewrite history. His Polish counterpart, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, responded by promising to open a dialogue in the hope of reaching a common understanding, but went on to pass the law before consultation could take place.\n\nIsrael initially rebuffed a meeting with Polish representatives to discuss the issue, on the grounds that it should have been held before the law was passed. But when Morawiecki said 10 days ago that Jews had also been among the perpetrators of the Holocaust, further inflaming tensions, the two leaders agreed that their representatives should meet in an effort to relieve the escalating crisis.\n\nAs the meeting finally took place in Jerusalem Thursday, between a Polish team led Deputy Foreign Minister Bartosz Cichocki and an Israeli team of historians and diplomats led by Foreign Ministry director-general Yuval Rotem, politicians in Warsaw condemned it as a pointless exercise.\n\n\"The trip to Israel makes no sense,\" Grzegorz Schetyna, head of Poland's largest opposition party, Civic Platform.\n\nThe role of Poles in Nazi atrocities on Polish soil during World War II has long been a touchy subject for Warsaw, which for years has objected to phrases such as \"Polish death camps\" to describe Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps on occupied Polish territory.\n\nPoland was the first country invaded by Nazi Germany, and its population - ethnic Poles and Jews alike -- suffered immensely. About 90 percent of Poland's Jewish population of 3.2 million were killed during the genocide, and millions of non-Jewish Poles were also killed.\n\nPoland's conservative government has described the law as a measure to defend national honor, and push back against what it sees as a false narrative of Polish complicity in the Holocaust.\n\nBut many in Israel and the United States have reacted with alarm, seeing the law as an attempt to whitewash the historical truth that some ethnic Poles were indeed complicit in Nazi crimes against Polish Jews.\n\nWhile most Jews living in Poland were killed by the Nazis, historians say many were also killed with the complicity of the Poles, who denounced Jews or directly participated in violence against them.\n\nMore than 6,700 Poles who risked their lives to save their Jewish neighbors from the Third Reich are formally honored with the title \"Righteous Among the Nations\" by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem. More Poles have been honored than any other nationality. Yad Vashem estimates that their efforts saved up to 35,000 people, about one percent of Poland's Jewish population at the time.\n\nCover image: Far-right groups hold a demonstration in front of the presidential palace to call on President Andrzej Duda to sign a bill that would limit some forms of Holocaust speech in Warsaw, Poland, Monday, Feb. 5, 2018.

                "body": "In a simulation video of the new cruise missile that played during Putin's speech, the weapon targeted the U.S. specifically.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin claims that Russia now has an \"invincible\" nuclear missile. And if provoked, he would use the weapon against the U.S.\n\nPutin laid out Russia's radically revamped military arsenal on Thursday during his annual state of the union address. By 2020, the Kremlin plans to roll out the new weapons, which include a hypersonic nuclear missile, a nuclear-powered underwater drone, and a cruise missile which the strongman claims has unlimited range and the capability to of pierce any U.S. missile defense system.\n\nPutin framed the development and deployment of his new nuclear arsenal in relation to last month's U.S. Nuclear Posture Review, which calls for more smaller atomic bombs to specifically counter Russia. He also warned that any use of a nuclear weapon against Russia or any of its allies would draw an immediate response. \"The response will be instant and with all the relevant consequences,\" he said.\n\nThe new Russian nuclear arsenal comes in response to the U.S. efforts to develop a missile defense system, with Washington failing to listen to Moscow's concerns. \"No one has listened to us,\" Putin said. \"You listen to us now.\"\n\nIn a simulation video of the new cruise missile that played during Putin's speech, the weapon targeted the U.S. specifically. Unstoppable\n\nThe new cruise missile is capable of carrying a variety of nuclear warheads and has virtually no range limits. Putin claimed it can attack across both the North and South Poles.\n\nPutin said that no missile defense system is capable of stopping the weapons, and by comparison, called NATO's U.S.-led missile defense \"useless.\"\n\n\"I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country's development: all what you wanted to impede with your policies have already happened,\" Putin said. \"You have failed to contain Russia.\" \"Like a fireball\"\n\nRussia is the first country to unveil a hypersonic nuclear weapon. Dubbed Avangard, the missile is capable of intercontinental travel and can fly at a speed 20 times the speed of sound and strike \"like a meteorite, like a fireball,\" Putin said.\n\nUnlike traditional ballistic missiles, which follow a parabolic path, hypersonic missiles are launched well into space before skimming out the of the atmosphere at speeds greater than 4,000 miles per hour, gliding towards their targets with high precision.\n\n\"No one in the world has anything like that,\" Putin said. \"It may appear someday, but by that time we will develop something new.\" \"Extreme depths\"\n\nPutin also unveiled a noiseless, nuclear-powered, underwater drone, which the Russian president said was capable of travelling at high speeds while carrying nuclear missiles. Putin said the drones were 100 times smaller than a conventional submarine.\n\n\"I can say that Russia has designed unmanned submersible vehicles capable of operating at extreme depths ... covering intercontinental distances at the speed, which greatly exceeds the speed of all submarines, up-to-date torpedoes and all types of high-speed surface ships.\"\n\nFinally, the Russian leader also spoke briefly about a new laser weapon system. He said Russia was well ahead of the competition and had already armed its forces with these new weapons.\n\n\"I would not want to go into details here -- it is not the time yet, but specialists would understand that having such military systems multiplies Russia's abilities in the defense sphere.\"\n\nIt was reported this week by state-run news agency Interfax that Russian engineers had \"completed work on the anti-satellite complex\" which includes a laser and ground control equipment.\n\nPutin added that the Kremlin would run a nationwide competition to name the new cruise missile and underwater drone.\n\nCover image: Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures as he gives his annual state of the nation address in Manezh in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, March 1, 2018.

                "body": "\"You'll never get this passed if you add concealed carry to this. You'll never get it passed,\" Trump told Rep. Steve Scalise, who is still recovering from gun wounds he suffered last summer in a politically motivated shooting. Scalise has been an outspoken advocate for the NRA's priorities after his hospitalization, but Trump shut him down repeatedly.\n\nPresident Donald Trump scrambled the gun control debate by scolding members of his own party for kowtowing to the National Rifle Association and not doing something \"comprehensive\" about guns.\n\n\"Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified,\" Trump told the bipartisan group of senators and representatives Wednesday. \"They have great power over you people. They have less power over me.\"\n\nTrump then chided Republicans in the House of Representatives for insisting on tying any background checks legislation with expanding the ability to carry concealed weapons, the NRA's top legislative priority.\n\n\"They have great power over you people. They have less power over me.\"\n\n\"You'll never get this passed if you add concealed carry to this. You'll never get it passed,\" Trump told Rep. Steve Scalise, who is still recovering from gun wounds he suffered last summer in a politically motivated shooting. Scalise has been an outspoken advocate for the NRA's priorities after his hospitalization, but Trump shut him down repeatedly.\n\nRepublicans in the rooms seemed stunned and continually attempted to steer the president back to their priorities to little avail. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who was seated next to the president and has been a long-time advocate of gun control, looked gleeful.\n\nThe NRA spent over $30 million in 2016 to support Trump's presidential campaign, the most the group has ever spent for a candidate. In return, Trump promised the group last spring that \"I will never let you down.\"\n\nBut on Wednesday, the Republican president appeared eager to assert his independence from the NRA, sounding inclined to pass the most comprehensive gun control in over two decades.\n\nHe said members of Congress should start with the Manchin-Toomey background check legislation that Obama failed to pass in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre. \"Be very strong on background checks; don't be shy,\" he said.\n\nAfter over a year of a harshly partisan presidency that has left Democrats exhausted from outrage, Trump appeared moderate on the issue of guns in the aftermath of the Valentine's Day school shooting in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 dead and about a dozen wounded.\n\nBut it's unclear if Trump's surprising rhetoric will be backed up with sustained pressure to get Republicans to go along. In a similar roundtable discussion last month on immigration, Trump also appeared to moderate his harsh immigration rhetoric, only to make a list of starkly partisan demands days later, which led to a short government shutdown.\n\nLegislative action on guns, even proposals supported by the NRA that center on better enforcement of the laws on the books, has been stalled in Congress with partisan bickering.\n\nDemocrats don't want to let Republicans claim they're doing something on guns if it only means NRA-supported proposals. Conservative Republicans don't want to take any action that could restrict gun ownership and say they shouldn't bring up such proposals when the party controls both chambers of Congress. And any Republican willing to maybe support some gun control won't do it unless Trump explicitly supports it and gives them political cover from the conservative base (which Trump has now suggested he will do).\n\nBut with 60 votes required to pass anything in the Senate, and Republicans having 51, any measure will need support from both sides.\n\nAnd so, nothing has happened. So far. But now congressional leaders are facing sustained protest from students, particularly those who survived the attack in Parkland and have become effective advocates for change.\n\n\"I'm not into popularity. I'm into getting something done,\" Trump said.\n\nWe're about to find out.\n\nCover image: President Donald Trump speaks during the 2018 White House business session with state governors in the State dining Room of the White House on February 26, 2018 in Washington, D.C.

                "body": "President Donald Trump doesn't want an \"Obama guy\" looking into his campaign's alleged ties to Moscow -- even if the investigation could uncover wrongs against his own campaign.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions had announced on Tuesday that the Justice Department's inspector general would be investigating an allegation, made in a GOP memo, that the FBI misled a judge to justify spying on a member of the Trump campaign. But Trump disparaged the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who took his post during President Obama's administration in 2012. \"Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL,\" Trump wrote in a tweet on Wednesday,\n\nSessions had confirmed that the Department of Justice would be looking into the matter during a press conference about the opioid. He had already alluded to an investigation by his department's inspector general on Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures' earlier this month, although it's unclear if they're one in the same.\n\n\"We believe the Department of Justice must adhere to the high standards in the FISA court and, yes, it will be investigated. And I think that's just the appropriate thing,\" Sessions said Tuesday, referring to the secret court created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which issues warrants for the surveillance of people with ties to foreign countries or groups. \"The inspector general will take that as one of the matters they'll deal with,\" he added.\n\nIn early February, President Trump signed off on making the memo, now causing a stir, public -- against the recommendation of members of the intelligence community. Its author, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes alleged that the FBI did not, and should have, disclosed that Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, had funded research used in an applications for a warrant to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Paige.",

Navalny said the lavish entertainment amounted to a \"bribe\" by the oligarch.\n\nThe woman at the center of a sexually charged political firestorm involving U.S.-Russian relations was arrested in Thailand while teaching a course on seduction, in a case she claims was trumped up by Moscow to punish her.\n\nAnastasia Vashukevich, a self-described sex instructor and \"huntress\" who goes by the name Nastya Rybka, issued a plea via her Instagram on Tuesday to American intelligence services and journalists to intervene on her behalf in exchange for information she claims to have about Russia and U.S. President Donald Trump, ahead of her looming extradition back to Russia.\n\n\"Please USA, help us not to die from Russians!,\" she posted.

At first, she seemed to revel in the attention, asking her 90,000 Instagram followers whether she should remove content related to the controversial documentary, and posting calls for porn producers to help her star in \"the best porno in the entire history of the porn industry.\"\n\nDeripasaka soon won an injunction from a Russian court that prompted Russia's media regulator to order Instagram to remove some of Vashukevich's posts, which the company quickly did. A similar order concerning Navalny's YouTube video is still yet to be resolved.\n\nWhen Navalny's video was released, Vashukevich appeared to be staying in a luxury hotel in Dubai. Then she traveled to Thailand for the \"training.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Thai police burst into the seduction class being led by Vashukevich and a Russian man who goes by the name Alex Lesley in a hotel in the beach resort of Pattaya, according to Thai media reports.\n\nSpecial Branch officer Dullayapat Techapornyasin told Thai press the cops received a tip from a \"Russian police informant,\" who had supposedly been given video clips from inside the teaching session from an unhappy \"student\" who felt the $700 lessons were \"not worth it.\"\n\n\"There were two women.

In a clip of the bust circulating online, some of those present are dressed in shirts emblazoned with the words \"Sex Animator\" above a big, red arrow pointing downward.\n\nFriends of Vashukevich and Alex Lesley (real name Alexander Kirillov), who spoke to VICE News by phone from Thailand, said the two are being kept in \"terrible\" conditions.\n\nPavlo Yunko, 32, a U.S. citizen who said he visited both Vashukevich and Kirillov in jail, said he expects both to be deported to Russia in the coming days.\n\n\"Alex and Anastasia were set up,\" Yunko told VICE News. \"Now time is running out. We're asking the U.S. to try to stop their deportation, to put it on hold, and to give them political asylum.\"\n\nRussia's ambassador to Thailand, Vladimir Sosnov, told Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti that Vashukevich and Lesley had simply been detained while \"participating in an illegal training,\" and that Thai police had informed him they would face \"court and then deportation.\"",

They allegedly caught him on wiretaps discussing drug trafficking in Calabria. But by that point, Vadala had already moved to Slovakia, and the charges were dropped.\n\nBefore he was murdered, a Slovakian journalist had been investigating the Italian Mafia. Now, his unfinished report has been published for all to read.\n\nJan Kuciak, 27, had been probing his country's political links to organized crime for months before he and his partner Martina Kusnirova were found shot dead Sunday evening in their home in Velka Maca, east of the capital, Bratislava. \"To honor his memory, set the record straight, and minimize the danger to his colleagues,\" the investigative journalism organization that supported his reporting published his last work before he died on Wednesday.\n\n\"At the time of his killing, he was continuing to collect records on men considered by Italian police to be extremely dangerous,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThe report revealed that a former topless model and Miss Universe contestant hired as an assistant to the Slovakian prime minister had previously co-founded a business with an Italian man suspected of having ties to the powerful Calabrian mafia, the 'Ndrangheta. The Prime Minister, Robert Fico, gave the former contestant, Maria Troskova, a job, despite her lack of relevant credentials.\n\nThe Italian police had issued an arrest warrant for the man, Antonia Vadala, in 2001, according to the report. They allegedly caught him on wiretaps discussing drug trafficking in Calabria. But by that point, Vadala had already moved to Slovakia, and the charges were dropped.\n\nSeveral Slovakian newspapers also published Kuciak's report, his last before he died, on Wednesday as the fallout over the killings continued to grow. Read the full report here.\n\nKuciak is the first journalist to be killed in Slovakia; police said the killings were carried out professional hitmen, likely in retaliation for his work, which focused on fraud cases involving businessmen with links to the government. Transparency International ranks Slovakia as the seventh most corrupt member of the European Union.\n\nFollowing reports that the former Miss Universe content was a focus of Kuciak's final investigation, the prime minister warned journalists to be careful with their accusations on Tuesday.\n\n\"Do not link innocent people without any evidence to a double homicide,\" Fico said at a press conference, standing next to a pile of one million euros ($1.2 million) in banknotes that the government is offering as a reward for clues in the slayings. \"It's crossing the line. It's no longer funny.\"\n\nAnother Slovakian-based journalist, Tom Nicholson, told reporters that Kuciak told him before his death that he was investigating potential mafia involvement in the payment of fraudulent European Union subsidies in eastern Slovakia.\n\nSome members of the the opposition party have accused national police chief Tibor Gaspar and Interior Minister Robert Kalinak of failing to protect Kuciak when he filed criminal complaints after receiving threats. The opposition has now called for anti-corruption protests in Bratislava on Wednesday, and demanded both Gaspar and Kalinank resign. Slovakia's Culture Minister Marek Madaric did resign on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"As the culture minister, I am not able to cope with the fact that a journalist was killed during my time in office,\" he said Wednesday.",

He's not alone: All of the White House staffers who had been granted that level of interim access to government information also had their security privileges downgraded, according to Politico.\n\nThe large number of White House advisers operating on an interim security clearance came to light after former Staff Secretary Rob Porter was accused of domestic abuse, allegations that were unearthed during his screening for security clearance, and which the White House knew or should have known about months ago. The allegations also prevented him from obtaining full security clearance, though he was responsible for reading anything that made it to the president's desk.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, dozens of White House staffers were granted unrestricted access to top secret information, despite lacking permanent security clearances.\n\nLast week, on the same day that Kushner lost his access, Trump told reporters that he would let Kelly decide whether Kushner could keep top secret access.",

And in the coming days, parts of the U.K. could dip down to 5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"Crazy,\" \"weird,\" and \"wacky.\" That's how scientists are describing the temperature in the Arctic.\n\nOver the weekend, the world's northernmost weather station, located just 440 miles from the North Pole, warmed to 43 degrees Fahrenheit during what's normally the coldest time of the year. That's about 60 degrees above average for February. The rising temperatures, caused by a \"warm air intrusion,\" have left scientists in shock. Sea ice in the region is also at its lowest level on record.\n\n\"This is simply shocking. I don't have the words,\" meteorologist Eric Holthaus tweeted.\n\nThe Arctic winter lasts from October to March and leaves much of the region in almost permanent darkness. During that time, the average temperature hovers around minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit. But so far in 2018, the Cape Morris Jesup meteorological site, at the northern tip of Greenland, has seen a record-breaking 61 hours of temperatures above freezing.\n\nIn fact, at one point this past weekend, most of Europe was colder than it was in Greenland. And in the coming days, parts of the U.K. could dip down to 5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nPeople across Europe are bracing themselves for harsh weather conditions dubbed \"The Beast from the East,\" which could cause sustained temperatures below freezing, power loss, and travel delays.\n\nThe Beast, a high-pressure ridge over Scandinavia that's funneling cold air down from Siberia, caused a rare snowstorm to hit Rome on Monday.

                "body": "So far, execs are standing by him. Asked by Variety whether Seacrest would still have a job at the Oscars, an E! spokesperson replied, \"Of course he is.\"\n\nRyan Seacrest will still host E! News' red carpet coverage at the Oscars this Sunday, BuzzFeed News reported Tuesday, despite detailed allegations by his ex-stylist that he sexually harassed and assaulted her repeatedly.\n\nSuzie Hardy, who worked as Seacrest's personal stylist at E! from 2007 to 2013, went public Monday, alleging that Seacrest repeatedly groped her crotch, hugged her while wearing only his underwear on more than 10 occasions, and once slapped her buttock so hard it left a welt that was still visible hours later. A former coworker of Hardy's also told Variety that he saw Seacrest shove Hardy's face into his crotch while Hardy was tying Seacrest's shoes on multiple occasions.\n\n\"I didn't know how to deal with it,\" Hardy said. \"I really didn't. I was battling finally being in a decent financial position to breathe and be a mom, that I didn't have to be freaking out all the time, and then dealing with this infantile celebrity person who was testing me on every level and manipulating me and knew that I was in a vulnerable position.\"\n\nSeacrest, who has repeatedly denied Hardy's allegations, currently serves as the face of several enormous shows. Besides his Oscars gig and regular event coverage for E!, Seacrest is the co-host of the morning show \"Live with Kelly & Ryan\" -- which made no mention of the allegations against him on Tuesday's episode -- and is set to return as the host of the rebooted \"American Idol,\" which premieres in two weeks.\n\nSo far, execs are standing by him. Asked by Variety whether Seacrest would still have a job at the Oscars, an E! spokesperson replied, \"Of course he is.\"\n\nEven before Hardy's allegations were made public, the Oscars' producers said that the ceremony will from stay away from making any political statements in support of sexual assault survivors, or the #MeToo and Time's Up movements.\n\n\"We certainly want to honor and respect Time's Up and allow that message to be heard,\" ABC President of Entertainment Channing Dungey told the New York Times. (ABC will broadcast the ceremony.) \"But we're trying to make it more planned than spur-of-the-moment -- it has its moment and then doesn't feel like it overshadows the artists and films being honored.\"\n\nE! launched an investigation into Hardy's claims in November, when her lawyer sent Seacrest, E!, and its parent company NBCUniversal a letter detailing Seacrest's alleged abuse. That investigation was \"extremely comprehensive and thorough,\" an E! spokesperson said, and found no evidence of misconduct by Seacrest when it concluded in February.\n\nThe spokesperson went on, \"Over the course of a two month process, our outside counsel interviewed more than two dozen people regarding allegations, including multiple separate meetings with the claimant and all firsthand witnesses that she provided. The investigator is an attorney with nearly 20 years experience and is highly regarded professionally. Any claims that question the legitimacy of this investigation are completely baseless.\" Seacrest's lawyer, Andrew Baum, also said that Hardy's claims were false.\n\n\"It is upsetting to us that Variety is electing to run a 'story' about untrue allegations that we were made against my client, after they were told that the accuser threatened to make those false claims against him unless he paid her $15 million. At that time, the claimant threatened to issue a demonstrably false press statement unless she was paid,'\" Baum said in a statement. He added, \"It's telling that after my client refused to pay her money, and the E! investigation resulted as it did, that she is now coming forward to share her debunked story to the press.\"\n\nHardy's attorney told Variety that his client never asked for any money, and Seacrest's representatives declined to provide Variety with any evidence that Hardy had made such a request. Representatives for both parties didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from VICE News.",

He ran a San Antonio-based digital marketing firm, Giles-Parscale, and first came into contact with the Trumps by designing the websites for Trump Winery and the Eric Trump Foundation. As the Trump 2016 campaign took shape, Parscale was hired to run its digital operations.\n\nDonald Trump is turning to the man who ran the most successful part of his otherwise dysfunctional 2016 campaign to help him win again in 2020.\n\nBrad Parscale, previously the Trump campaign's digital director, is going to be named campaign manager for Trump's 2020 re-election bid. Parscale, who was interviewed in October by the House Intelligence Committee during their investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, architected the campaign's aggressive and successful Facebook marketing strategy. His appointment suggests that Trump, once again, expects Facebook to be critical to another presidential victory.\n\n\"Brad was essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run,\" Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, said in a statement formally announcing Parscale's appointment. \"His leadership and expertise will be help [sic] build a best-in-class campaign.\"\n\nThe Drudge Report first reported news of Parscale's 2020 job.\n\nPrior to working on the Trump campaign, Parscale had no experience in campaign politics. He ran a San Antonio-based digital marketing firm, Giles-Parscale, and first came into contact with the Trumps by designing the websites for Trump Winery and the Eric Trump Foundation. As the Trump 2016 campaign took shape, Parscale was hired to run its digital operations.\n\nThe Trump campaign's use of Facebook has been a source of controversy for the platform and pride for the embattled president. This past weekend, former Facebook executive Antonio Garcia Martinez penned an op-ed for Wired detailing how the Trump campaign designed their Facebook ads and targeting system to minimize cost and maximize reach. Responding to the article, which went viral, Parscale boasted in a tweet that the Trump campaign likely paid 100 to 200 times less than the Clinton campaign did for its Facebook ads.\n\nIn the days before Election Day, Parscale described to Bloomberg a comprehensive Facebook spend focused not just on turning out Trump voters but also on Democratic \"voter suppression\" through paid ads meant to depress support for Clinton. All in all, the otherwise spendthrift Trump campaign spent about $70 million on Facebook through Election Day, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIt's this supposed digital savvy that has earned Parscale a shot at managing the entire campaign, despite his minimal political experience. It also doesn't hurt that Parscale has been a loyal Trump supporter well after the election, repeatedly defending both the Trump campaign and the White House.\n\n\"The #FakeNews media continues to lie about the \"Hoax,\" Parscale tweeted on February 17.\" The hoax is the LIE that the campaign colluded with this Russian campaign. \"The hoax is the Democrats want you to believe the Russians had real influence over the election.\n\nCover image: Brad Parscale, then candidate Donald Trump's campaign digital director, stands on the stage of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

And in the coming days, parts of the UK could dip down to 5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"Crazy,\" \"weird,\" and \"wacky.\" That's how scientists are describing the temperature in the Arctic.\n\nOver the weekend, the world's northernmost weather station, located just 440 miles from the North Pole, warmed to 43 degrees Fahrenheit during what's normally the coldest time of the year. That's about 60 degrees above average for February. The rising temperatures, caused by a \"warm air intrusion,\" have left scientists in shock. Sea ice in region is also at its lowest levels on record.\n\n\"This is simply shocking. I don't have the words,\" meteorologist Eric Holthaus tweeted.\n\nThe Arctic winter lasts from October to March and leaves much of the region covered in almost permanent darkness. During that time, the average temperature hovers around minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit. But so far in 2018, the Cape Morris Jesup meteorological site at the northern tip of Greenland has seen a record-breaking 61 hours of temperatures above freezing.\n\nIn fact, at one point of the weekend, most of Europe was colder than it was in Greenland.

                "body": "\"I felt like by the third interview, it was obvious the investigator was whitewashing it for Seacrest's side,\" Hardy said. E! told Variety its investigation, which was conducted by an outside investigator, was \"extremely comprehensive and thorough.\"\n\nRyan Seacrest's former personal stylist said Seacrest repeatedly sexually assaulted her, Variety reported Monday, in the first full public account of the sexual misconduct allegations against Seacrest. Seacrest is set to host the red carpet for E! News at the Oscars ceremony this weekend.\n\nSuzie Hardy, who worked as Seacrest's personal stylist on E! from 2007 and 2013, first privately accused Seacrest of sexual misconduct last November, when her attorney sent Seacrest, E! News, and its parent company NBCUniversal a letter demanding that they \"come up with a plan to address the treatment of all women at the networks and to take responsibility for the wrongful treatment\" of Hardy.\n\nA week later, Seacrest publicly announced he was under investigation by E! News. He's since repeatedly denied all allegations.\n\nIn February, E! said they'd concluded an investigation into Hardy's complaint and found \"insufficient evidence to support the claims against Seacrest.\" But Hardy, who had not spoken publicly about her allegations until Monday, said she felt \"total exasperation\" when she heard the outcome of the investigation.\n\n\"I felt like by the third interview, it was obvious the investigator was whitewashing it for Seacrest's side,\" Hardy said. E! told Variety its investigation, which was conducted by an outside investigator, was \"extremely comprehensive and thorough.\"\n\nRead more: Harvey Weinstein allegedly had his employees inject him with erectile dysfunction shots Hardy was first hired to serve as Seacrest's personal stylist on E! News in 2007. As a single mom, she told Variety she was overjoyed to work flexible hours that would let her pick up her daughter from school.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it was happening,\" Hardy told Variety. \"I didn't have to worry anymore. I was going to get a regular paycheck every week.\"\n\nBut Hardy said Seacrest soon became sexually aggressive with her, and physically assaulted Hardy on multiple occasions. He hugged Hardy in his underwear more than 10 times, according to the November letter, and in one instance refused to let Hardy go until another person walked into the room. Seacrest also grabbed Hardy's crotch and vagina on multiple occasions, Hardy said, including once after he asked her if she'd had sex yet with her then-boyfriend. Several former coworkers and a friend of Hardy told Variety that Hardy had told them about the incidents at the time.\n\nSeacrest also allegedly once slapped Hardy's buttock so hard it left a welt that was still visible hours later. Hardy took a photo of the welt, photographed it, and provided it to E! investigators and to Variety. An analysis of the photo's metadata by Hardy's attorney confirmed that the photo was taken the same day that Hardy said Seacrest hit her.\n\n\"I didn't know how to deal with it,\" Hardy said. \"I really didn't. I was battling finally being in a decent financial position to breathe and be a mom, that I didn't have to be freaking out all the time, and then dealing with this infantile celebrity person who was testing me on every level and manipulating me and knew that I was in a vulnerable position.\"\n\nA former E! co-worker said that Seacrest pushed Hardy's head into his crotch while Hardy tied Seacrest's shoes on multiple occasions, and that Seacrest also repeatedly tried to trip Hardy. On one occasion, Hardy said Seacrest tearfully told her, \"I just don't think you're attracted to me.\"\n\n\"I'm attracted to my paycheck,\" Hardy said she replied.\n\nIn 2013, HR sought out Hardy to talk about her relationship with Seacrest, according to the November letter. Hardy said she told them everything.\n\nTwo weeks later, Hardy was told she would no longer be working at E! News.\n\nHardy now works at a San Francisco tech company, having left the entertainment industry. Seacrest has started co-hosting \"Live With Kelly & Ryan\" with Kelly Ripa. Seacrest avoided talking about Hardy's allegations on the Tuesday episode of the morning show, instead choosing to discuss topics like teeth whitening and the weather.\n\nCover image: TV personality Ryan Seacrest attends the 60th Annual GRAMMY Awards at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 2018 in New York City.

The career HUD employee, Helen Foster, responded to requests to \"find money\" for Candy Carson, Ben Carson's wife, to redecorate his office -- to which she replied there is a statutory limit of $5,000 for such projects, according to a copy of the complaint obtained by The Guardian.\n\n\"Five thousand dollars will not even buy a decent chair,\" Helen Foster said she was told by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's acting director.\n\nAfterward, Foster, formerly the chief administrative officer, said she was demoted to the department's chief privacy officer. Her role was also taken over by Trump nominee Suzanne Israel Tufts once she was confirmed as assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nFoster also said that she faced retaliation from her superiors for uncovering a $10 million budget shortfall, as well as attempting to complete some Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests that the office had received.

That's what Russia-probe watchers are wondering as longtime Trump ally Hope Hicks meets with the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors Tuesday as part of the committee's ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThe White House communications director is a crucial witness for the investigation because of her close ties to President Trump and the Trump family throughout the campaign, transition and presidency, and her involvement in drafting a misleading statement about the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between a Russian lawyer and top Trump campaign aides.\n\nCommittee members will surely ask her about the meeting and her role in its aftermath, but whether she will answer is still up in the air.\n\nTexas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway has been leading the committee's investigation since California Republican and head of the committee Rep. Devin Nunes recuse himself in April 2017 after an ethics complaint was filed about his close proximity to the president. Conaway told the Washington Post Monday that he \"would not be surprised\" if Hicks followed the lead of other close Trump aides, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former advisor Steve Bannon, who have refused to answer certain questions citing Trump's right to claim executive privilege at a later date.\n\nHicks, together with Trump, drafted a statement in response to a New York Times story about the nature of the Trump Tower meeting, claiming the Russian lawyer met with Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort about international adoption. In fact, the meeting was organized to discuss possible dirt on Hillary Clinton the Trump campaign could use.",

About 400,000 people are believed to be trapped in besieged rebel-held pocket near the Syrian capital Damascus, weathering a brutal offensive by the regime and its allies that has killed more than 560 people in just thr past weeks, while struggling to survive acute shortages of food and medicine.\n\nBut the U.N., residents and monitoring groups said that after a couple of hours of relative calm early in the supposed pause Tuesday, the onslaught swiftly resumed. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said helicopters and a warplane had struck targets from the air, while shelling and rocket fire had continued to pound the enclave.\n\n\"Only the fighter planes have been reduced, but the shelling and land-to-land rockets are continuing,\" Nour Adam, a local resident and activist, told the Guardian. \"None of the families or civilians have come out of the bomb shelters because nobody trusts the regime or the Russians.\"\n\nMoscow and Damascus blamed the failure of the pause on the Islamist rebel groups that hold Eastern Ghouta, accusing them of attacking an intended safe corridor out of the territory. Rebel groups denied the allegation, Reuters reported.\n\nA U.N. Security Council resolution passed Saturday had demanded a 30-day ceasefire across all of Syria, excluding certain jihadi and Islamist rebel factions, but did not give a specific start date.\n\nRussia, which raised several objections to the ceasefire proposal before it passed, said the U.N.-mandated truce will start when all sides involved reach agreement on how to implement it; instead, it announced Monday that it was ordering a daily five-hour humanitarian pause in fighting in Eastern Ghouta. Many groups, including the Syrian opposition, have accused Moscow of stalling to prevent a ceasefire being imposed, to allow the Syrian regime more time to pursue an outright military victory in the territory.\n\nSome aid agencies have said that, even if the pause hold, five hours will not be enough to bring in supplies to relieve the besieged population. Monitoring groups the Reach Initiative, told the BBC that many of the residents trapped in Eastern Ghouta will not be allowed to leave by the rebels.\n\nBritain's deputy ambassador to the U.N., Jonathan Allen, called on Russia to implement a 30-day ceasefire, saying if it believed it could impose a five-hour pause then it could help meet the U.N.'s demands for a broader truce.\n\n\"If it's able to do a five-hour pause, it's able to do a 24-hour pause,\" he told reporters. \"So it's up to Russia whether it wants to implement fully the resolution that it signed up to and voted for, or whether it wants to play cynical games.\"\n\nCover: A boy holds a placard during a protest in solidarity with residents of the Syrian capital's eastern suburb of Ghouta, in front of the Russian embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, Sunday, Feb. 25, 2018.

Over 250 were killed in the first 48 hours, marking the highest two-day death toll in the conflict since a 2013 chemical weapons attack in the same region, according to the Observatory.

But Britain's deputy ambassador to the U.N. Jonathan Allen said the daily pause doesn't mean much. \"That is not compliance. That is not implementation of the resolution passed on Saturday, but it does show that it can be implemented,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe daily pause will coincide with the opening of a humanitarian corridor aimed at allowing civilians to leave, according to a report in Russia's state-run Tass news agency. But the move won't be enough to allow for aid convoys to enter the devastated region to relieve its widening humanitarian catastrophe, an aid worker based in Damascus told VICE News.\n\nREAD: \"Hell on earth\": The U.N. calls for ceasefire in besieged eastern Ghouta\n\nThe sheer complexity of the Syrian conflict -- in which multiple rebel groups and foreign militaries are clashing together in spiraling chaos -- is blocking humanitarian outreach efforts due to the difficulty of securing a ceasefire from all the various groups involved, she said. The International Committee of the Red Cross, for example, hasn't had direct on-the-ground access to eastern Ghouta since November 2017.\n\n\"We cannot do our work,\" Ingy Sedky, a spokeswoman for the committee, told VICE News. \"The issue is that we don't have the consent of all the parties that are fighting on the ground in Syria or eastern Ghouta. We cannot send over a convoy in such a situation.\"\n\nIn addition to violations of the ceasefire, fresh reports have also circulated in recent days about the continued use of chlorine gas as a chemical weapon, although Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the allegations a \"hoax.\"\n\nThe Syrian American Medical Society tweeted on Sunday that 16 patients were suffering from exposure to chemical compounds, which the group said marked the 197th time chemical weapons have been used in Syria since 2011 and the seventh case so far in 2018.\n\nCover image: Syrians inspect the debris of buildings destroyed by Syrian forces' missile strikes in Al Ghouta East, in Duma, Syria, 22 February 2018.

Despite the spiraling violence, no major gains on the ground have been reported.\n\nRussian and Syrian warplanes continued hammering the devastated Syrian rebel enclave of eastern Ghouta on Monday, despite the U.N. unanimously calling for a ceasefire \"without delay.\" The heightened assault, which began a little over a week ago, prolongs one of the bloodiest episodes of Syria's seven-year civil war.\n\nAt least 550 people have been killed in the past eight days inside the suburb of the Syrian capital of Damascus, which is home to some 400,000 people, according the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war-monitor group based in the UK. That death toll includes 24 people killed during the 24 hours after the U.N.'s call for a ceasefire on Saturday.\n\nThe assault by the Syrian government, led by Bashar Assad, and its top foreign ally, Russia, has led to some of the deadliest violence since the country's civil war began. Over 250 were killed in the first 48 hours, marking the highest two-day death toll in the conflict since a 2013 chemical weapons attack in the same region, according to the Observatory. Amnesty International has said that the bombings amount to \"war crimes,\" and U.N. Secretary General António Guterres implored combatants over the weekend to \"stop this hell on earth.\"\n\nREAD: Assad has launched a \"war of extermination\" on eastern Ghouta\n\nJust minutes after the U.N. Security Council demanded a 30-day ceasefire for the delivery of aid, warplanes were already flying over the region, local witnesses told Reuters. Despite the spiraling violence, no major gains on the ground have been reported.Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya is seen addressing the Council during an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting regarding the humanitarian crisis in Eastern Ghouta (Syria) at UN Headquarters in New York, NY, USA on February 24, 2018.

But Britain's deputy ambassador to the U.N. Jonathan Allen said the daily pause doesn't mean much. \"That is not compliance. That is not implementation of the resolution passed on Saturday, but it does show that it can be implemented,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe daily pause will coincide with the opening of a humanitarian corridor aimed at allowing civilians to leave, according to a report in Russia's state-run Tass news agency. But the move won't be enough to allow for aid convoys to enter the devastated region to relieve its widening humanitarian catastrophe, an aid worker based in Damascus told VICE News.\n\nREAD: \"Hell on earth\": The U.N. calls for ceasefire in besieged eastern Ghouta\n\nThe sheer complexity of the Syrian conflict -- in which multiple rebel groups and foreign militaries are clashing together in spiraling chaos -- is blocking humanitarian outreach efforts due to the difficulty of securing a ceasefire from all the various groups involved, she said. The International Committee of the Red Cross, for example, hasn't had direct on-the-ground access to eastern Ghouta since November 2017.\n\n\"We cannot do our work,\" Ingy Sedky, a spokeswoman for the committee told VICE News. \"The issue is that we don't have the consent of all the parties that are fighting on the ground in Syria or eastern Ghouta. We cannot send over a convoy in such a situation.\"\n\nIn addition to violations of the ceasefire, fresh reports have also circulated in recent days about the continued use of chlorine gas as a chemical weapon, although Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the allegations a \"hoax.\"\n\nThe Syrian American Medical Society tweeted on Sunday that 16 patients were suffering from exposure to chemical compounds, which the group said marked the 197th time chemical weapons have been used in Syria since 2011 and the seventh case so far in 2018.\n\nCover image: Syrians inspect the debris of buildings which destroyed by Syrian forces' missile strikes in Al Ghouta East, in Duma, Syria, 22 February 2018.

Trump is calling out the armed school resource officer who was on Stoneman Douglas High School's campus during the Feb. 14 mass shooting but failed to enter the school. Trump has already called the guard a \"coward.\" During a 2016 campaign rally, however, Trump clutched his bodyguards when an unarmed protester rushed the stage.\n\nWATCH: This private school trains student \"warriors\" to swarm an active shooter\n\n\"When it came time to go in there and do something, he didn't have the courage or something happened, but he certainly did a poor job, there's no question about that,\" Trump said of the guard, Scott Peterson, last week. The teen gunman, a former student at the south Florida school, fired more than 100 rounds over a period of several minutes.",

So I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father.\"\n\nIvanka Trump has attempted to make women's issues a hallmark of her time in government. She has grandstanded for equal pay for women in the workplace, but her track record on the issue is spotty: She supported, for example, the end of an Obama-era rule that required employers to submit data on worker pay by race, ethnicity, and gender because it was \"burdensome.\"\n\nShe has voiced support for movements against rampant sexual harassment.

There's an estimated 800,000 young Dreamers in the U.S., many of whom have been here for more than 10 years and have few ties to their parents' native country.\n\nThe Trump administration announced in September that it would be ending the DACA program entirely by March 5, just over a week away.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision sends the case back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which will consider whether a federal judge's injunction to keep the program in place while Trump's repeal of the program is tested in court is legal.\n\nMultiple individuals protected by DACA, the University of California, and several states first sued the Trump administration over the repeal last September. They argued the move was arbitrary and motivated by discrimination. In January, Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court in Northern California ruled that the Trump administration must \"maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis\" while the case plays out in court and that the repeal was based on the \"flawed legal premise\" that the Obama administration did not have legal authority to implement the program in 2012.",

China is also investing heavily in its military, space exploration and cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing.\n\nWith a compliant state-run media bolstering his own high opinion of himself, Xi was declared \"core leader\" early in his first term in office, and most recently he was elevated even further when his name and writings were enshrined into his party's constitution.\n\n\"In this new Xi Era, the world must learn to deal with the most powerful Chinese leader in decades, while China itself is now the strongest it has been in centuries, with plans to become even more economically, militarily, and culturally powerful, on the road to its Great Rejuvenation,\" China watcher Bill Bishop said Sunday in his Sinocism newsletter.\n\nAs the U.S. chases an isolationist policy under Donald Trump, China is increasingly seeking to exert its influence over global issues ranging from the crisis on the Korean Peninsula to climate change.\n\nDespite a relatively successful trip to Beijing in November by Trump, tensions remain between China and the U.S., particularly when it comes to trade. According to a source speaking to Axios, the White House is preparing to \"impose tariffs on a 'shit ton' of Chinese products\" as retaliation for China stealing U.S. intellectual property.\n\nLiu He, a Harvard-trained economist and Xi's closest confidant on economic matters, will travel to Washington this week to try to defuse the potential trade war. Liu is also reported to be named next week as the new governor of the People's Bank of China.\n\nCover image: Chinese President Xi Jinping waits for British Prime Minister Theresa May (not pictured) ahead of a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Thursday, Feb. 1, 2018.

                "body": "So far, three people close to Trump -- Gates, former National Security advisor Michael Flynn, and former campaign advisor George Papadopoulos -- have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn and Papadopoulos lied about their interactions with Russians, and Gates lied about a 2013 meeting Manafort had with a member of Congress about Ukraine. The California man, Richard Pinedo, who allegedly sold bank accounts created with fake identities as part of Russia's election interference scheme, and the London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, have also pleaded guilty.\n\nA wave of indictments in the federal investigation into the Trump campaign and its relationship with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election came pouring out this week -- and the investigation shows no signs of letting up.\n\nSo far, special counsel Robert Mueller has charged 19 people and three companies in the wide-ranging investigation. A flurry of activity in the remarkably leak-proof operation began on Feb. 16, when his office charged 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies with conspiracy to interfere in the election. (A California man has also been charged with identity fraud, and a London based lawyer was charged with lying to the FBI in connection with that case.) And this week, Mueller also filed a series of new money laundering charges against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump campaign advisor Rick Gates.\n\nThe new indictments show two things: the inner workings of the Russian election interference and propaganda machine called \"Project Lakhta,\" launched in 2014 to deepen political divisions in the U.S. and promote distrust of Trump's political opponents, and a wide-sprawling money laundering operation allegedly spearheaded by Manafort.\n\nThe charges do not currently include an explicit link between Russian interference in the election and the Trump campaign, though the conspiracy nature of the recent charges suggests there is more to come. And though the language in the Russian interference indictment says Trump campaign aides \"unwittingly\" communicated with the Russian nationals, it's clear Mueller and his team are zeroing in on the Trump administration.\n\nSo far, three people close to Trump -- Gates, former National Security advisor Michael Flynn, and former campaign advisor George Papadopoulos -- have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn and Papadopoulos lied about their interactions with Russians, and Gates lied about a 2013 meeting Manafort had with a member of Congress about Ukraine. The California man, Richard Pinedo, who allegedly sold bank accounts created with fake identities as part of Russia's election interference scheme, and the London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, have also pleaded guilty.\n\nThis leaves one Trump advisor holding out: Paul Manafort. And the pressure is clearly on.\n\nOn Thursday, the special counsel filed new bank and tax fraud charges against Manafort and Gates, detailing a decade long money laundering scheme. The next day, Gates pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and Mueller filed a new indictment against Manafort alone with charges of money laundering and false statement. The new indictment also alleges that Manafort used \"at least four offshore accounts to wire more than 2 million euros to pay the group of former politicians,\" known as the \"Hapsburg group,\" to take pro-Russia positions and lobby U.S. officials while appearing to be independent.\n\nThe plea deals for Gates and van der Zwaan signal that Mueller is closing in on Manafort; all three worked together on Ukrainian political lobbying in 2011, and Gates and van der Zwaan may be able to provide evidence about the new charges against Manafort. During an interview with the FBI in November 2017, van der Zwaan also lied to officials about the timing of his last communication with Gates, which was as recently as September 2016 -- around the same time that Manafort left the Trump campaign under a cloud of negative press concerning his lobbying ties to former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nAfter Gates pleaded guilty Friday, Manafort released a statement through his lawyer reaffirming his innocence.\n\n\"I had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence,\" the statement said. \"For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.\"\n\nPresident Trump continues to deny any involvement in the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, and recently blamed Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not investigating the Obama administration, saying they allowed the Russian meddling to happen on their watch.\n\n(Sessions recused himself from the federal investigation nearly a year ago because of his close connection to the Trump campaign.)\n\nThe Kremlin said Tuesday that the Russian state had no involvement in the U.S. election interference, though the indictment alleges Russia's propaganda arm was intimately involved.\n\nNot all the investigations are proceeding as smoothly however. In the Congressional investigation into Russian meddling, Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee recently fueded themselves into a bit of an impasse. Earlier this month the White House blocked Democrats from releasing their memo rebutting the claims made against the FBI and Justice Department in an earlier-released Republican memo meant to discredit the agencies investigating the Trump campaign. On Tuesday the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee California Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff said he was negotiating with the FBI over redactions in the memo and hoped to get it out to the public soon.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that Republicans on the committee led by California's Devin Nunes refused a request from the Democrats to subpoena Twitter for direct messages of Trump associates, including Donald Trump Jr. and Roger Stone, a Trump ally and longtime partner of Manafort, indicating they intend to avoid investigating any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian interference.",

I will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process.\n\nFormer Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the U.S. and lying to the FBI on Friday, entering the latest guilty plea in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nMueller filed a new 32-count indictment against Gates and his associate and former campaign manager Paul Manafort on Thursday, detailing a decadelong money laundering and tax evasion scheme.\n\nThe guilty plea came together over the past few days, according to the New York Times, wrapping up a month of turmoil that began when Gates' lawyers asked to withdraw from the case in early February. A series of sealed documents and hearings followed, as Gates found new representation. But by Thursday afternoon, things were still up in the air -- until the new indictment dropped Thursday evening.\n\nHours after the new charges were revealed, Gates officially retained former D.C. prosecutor Thomas Green, who specializes in federal plea deals.\n\n\"Despite my initial desire to vigorously defend myself, I have had a change of heart,\" Gates explained to loved ones in a letter obtained by ABC News. \"The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and the circus-like atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much. I will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process.\n\nThe duo concealed more than $30,000,000 from U.S. authorities while lying about having any foreign bank accounts, the indictment alleges.\n\nGates specifically pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI when he said Manafort told him after a 2013 meeting with a member of Congress that Ukraine had not been discussed. Not only did Manafort not say that, the guilty plea details, Gates had actually helped prepare a memo from the meeting showing the topic had clearly been discussed.\n\nThe Gates deal also means Manafort is the only Trump advisor left who has been charged in the investigation and not pleaded guilty. Both former national security advisor Michael Flynn and former campaign advisor George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI.\n\nGates and Manafort worked very closely on foreign lobbying jobs, and Gates could hold crucial evidence about the allegations against Manafort, who left the Trump campaign in August 2016 after increased public scrutiny of his foreign lobbying history.\n\nManafort on Friday continued to proclaim his innocence.\n\n\"Notwithstanding that Rick Gates pled today, I continue to maintain my innocence,\" he said in a rare written statement. \"I had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence. For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.\"",

The plot even involved Russia's intelligence service, the FSB, according to the former head of Russia's national anti-doping lab, Grigory Rodchenkov, who blew the lid off the scheme before disappearing into the U.S. Federal Witness Protection Program, fearing for his life.\n\nA Russian bobsledder who once proudly wore a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words \"I DON'T DO DOPING\" has tested positive for doping at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe result for 30-year-old Nadezhda Sergeeva, announced by the Russian Bobsled Federation on its website Friday, is a big setback for Russia, which is trying to move past scandalous allegations that its own government led a massive and complex doping program aimed at cheating in the Olympics.\n\nSo far, two of the four athletes at the Pyeongchang Winter Games who have tested positive for banned substances are from Russia. And the man who first broke the news to the press that Sergeeva flunked the test -- Russian Bobsled Federation president Alexander Zubkov -- is himself a former bobsledder who was stripped of two Olympic gold medals in the doping scandal.\n\n\"The Bobsled Federation of Russia and the athlete herself understand the extent of their responsibility, and also understand that what has happened may impact the fate of the entire team,\" the Federation said in a statement.\n\nRussia was officially banned from the 2018 Winter Games for what investigators concluded was a massive government-led doping program at the 2014 Olympics, which were held in the Russian seaside resort town of Sochi. The plot even involved Russia's intelligence service, the FSB, according to the former head of Russia's national anti-doping lab, Grigory Rodchenkov, who blew the lid off the scheme before disappearing into the U.S. Federal Witness Protection Program, fearing for his life.\n\nDespite the ban, 169 Russian athletes who weren't proven to be linked to the doping program were cleared to compete wearing neutral uniforms as \"Olympic Аthletes from Russia,\" with the acronym OAR on their jerseys.\n\nThat mixed response by the International Olympic Committee -- banning the country while welcoming its athletes -- brought criticism down on the IOC over its handling of the affair.\n\n\"The IOC response has been fairly ham-handed, to say the least,\" Peter Donnelly, director of the Center for Sport Policy Studies at the University of Toronto, told VICE News as the Games were kicking off.\n\nBefore the Games, Sergeeva appeared in a slick video tagged on YouTube as an \"unofficial advertisement\" for ZASPORT, the official clothing supplier to the Russian Olympic Committee. The same company had been forced to design neutral Olympic outfits for Russian athletes following the allegations of doping.\n\nIn the video, Sergeeva talks in a voiceover about how sports have allowed her to \"become myself,\" and appears in a sweatshirt reading: \"I DON'T DO DOPING, I AM ZA SPORT.\" (The line is also a play on words; \"za\" means \"for\" in Russian.)\n\nBefore the Games, Russian officials had expressed hope that making it through the event without notable violations would convince Olympic officials to return Russia's national flag for the closing ceremony. That decision is due on Saturday.\n\nBefore the news of her failed test broke Friday, Sergeeva herself had publicly expressed hope that a clean performance by the Russian delegation would bring the country's flag back.\n\n\"If we are here, and we are clean,\" she told Yahoo Sports, \"we should be able to walk under our flag.\"\n\nAccording to the Federation, Sergeeva tested positive for heart medication called trimetazidine, a drug used for chest pain that's banned because it boosts the metabolism. The Russian delegation said she denied taking the substance, and that a test five days earlier had been clean.\n\nRussia's other positive test came from curling medalist Alexander Krushelnitsky, who earlier this week agreed to hand back his mixed-team bronze medal after an analysis revealed traces of a drug that increases exercise capacity, called meldonium -- the same substance for which Russia's Maria Sharapova was temporarily banned from tennis.",

                "body": "\"Over half of those are North Korean-based shipping companies and North Korean-flagged vessels,\" Berger said. \"So the disruption there is going to be fairly negligible, probably.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday announced what he called \"the largest-ever set of new sanctions\" against North Korea that target \"sources of revenue and fuel that the regime uses to fund its nuclear program and sustain its military.\"\n\nThe sanctions (see PDF below) apply to 56 shipping and trading companies linked to North Korea, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Experts said the sheer number of sanctioned entities is indeed large, but they also said it's unclear whether the sanctions will have much impact.\n\n\"This will significantly hinder the Kim regime's capacity to conduct evasive maritime activities that facilitate illicit coal and fuel transports, and erode its abilities to ship goods through international waters,\" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \"The president has made it clear to companies worldwide that if they choose to help fund North Korea's nuclear ambitions, they will not do business with the United States.\"\n\nOne of the leading independent experts on North Korea sanctions was more skeptical about the potential impact. The listed entities mostly include \"easy targets,\" according to Andrea Berger, a senior research associate at James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.\n\n\"Over half of those are North Korean-based shipping companies and North Korean-flagged vessels,\" Berger said. \"So the disruption there is going to be fairly negligible, probably.\"\n\nThe other entities span the globe, including a Taiwanese citizen and companies or ships that the Treasury Department said were \"located, registered, or flagged\" in China, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Marshall Islands, Tanzania, Panama, and Comoros. North Korea often uses these so-called \"flags of convenience\" on ships in an effort to evade sanctions.\n\nBerger noted that recent rounds of sanctions have hindered North Korea's ability to to do business, in part because the U.N. already requires countries to shun North Korean-flagged vessels or ships known to be linked to Pyongyang. She said it's unlikely that the Trump administration's new sanctions will provide foreign countries with \"any additional legal authority\" to take action against those vessels, though they might be wary of running afoul of the Treasury Department and losing access to the U.S. financial system.\n\nREAD: South Korea seized a ship suspected of sneaking oil into North Korea\n\nThat said, Berger noted that the Trump administration appears to be continuing its effort \"to not leave any stone unturned\" as the U.S. works to further isolate the Hermit Kingdom. The Treasury Department said the sanctions specifically target vessels that North Korea uses to transport coal and oil, including several vessels are capable of carrying $5.5 million worth of coal at a time.\n\n\"North Korea's ability to engage in international trade and finance relies on its ability to move goods and money,\" Berger said. \"What this is doing is really trying to rip apart that connective tissue.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. has been sanctioning North Korea for years with little to show for it. Kim Jong Un's regime has mastered the art of dodging sanctions and continued to test nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles despite the best efforts of the U.S. and U.N. to choke off its ability to do business overseas. In recent months, Chinese ships have been caught supplying North Korean tankers with oil. Trump has also accused Russia of helping North Korea with sanctions busting. The Treasury Department said Friday that North Korea \"is known to employ deceptive shipping practices.\" (Photos via Treasury Department.) The Treasury Department shared photos of a North Korean oil tanker that was caught \"falsifying its vessel information\" to make it appear to be based in China. (Photos via Treasury Department.)\n\nAfter a wave of U.N. sanctions following a 2016 nuclear test, Bill Newcomb, a former member of the U.N. Panel of Experts on North Korea, explained to VICE News that part of the problem is that most countries don't have the funding or manpower to inspect every ship that arrives in port and verify that it isn't somehow linked to North Korea.\n\n\"They don't have the customs officials to inspect the cargo and recognize things that could be parts of a missile system, or analyze a shipment of metal to see if it's military or arms-related goods,\" Newcomb said, adding that North Korea tends to seek out countries with loosely regulated financial systems or places where bribery is rampant. \"Wherever they can operate or there's less oversight, they tend to find it.\"\n\nJoshua Stanton, a lawyer who previously helped draft North Korea sanctions for the U.S. government, suggested the administration needs to do more to go after Chinese financial institutions that do business with North Korea.\n\n\"I'll believe the Trump administration's pressure is really 'maximum' when I see nine-digit penalties against Chinese banks, like the ones the Obama administration imposed in 2014 on European banks that broke Iran sanctions,\" Stanton said. He added that Friday's actions are \"years overdue\" and \"will require careful follow-up as Pyongyang renames and reflags its fleet.\"\n\nThe sanctions were announced just hours after Trump's daughter Ivanka arrived in South Korea on Friday to attend the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. A North Korean delegation, which includes a top military general, is also in Pyeongchang for the event, but the two sides are not expected to meet.\n\nREAD: North Korea bailed on Mike Pence two hours before a secret Olympic meeting\n\nVice President Mike Pence reportedly tried to hold secret talks with Kim Jong Un's sister earlier this month during the Olympics, but the meeting was cancelled at the last minute when the North Koreans pulled out.\n\nCover image: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, right, celebrates what was said to be the test launch of an intermediate range Hwasong-12 missile at an undisclosed location in North Korea in this undated file photo distributed on Sept. 16, 2017, by the North Korean government.

                "body": "Florida's Republican Gov. Rick Scott announced a proposal for new gun control measures in the state amid mounting pressure after last week's mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, the second worst school shooting in U.S. history. Scott's proposal stops short of implementing changes that would please gun control's most ardent proponents, and it would still have to pass the Legislature.\n\nThe centerpiece of Scott's announcement is raising the minimum age for buying a gun from 18 to at least 21. There'd be some exceptions to the rule, including for military service members and law enforcement officers.\n\nScott would also ban bump stocks -- accessories that make semi-automatic weapons fire like automatic guns, like the Las Vegas gunman used -- but he declined to call for the banning of specific types of guns. \"Banning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\" he said. There's widespread calls to ban the AR-15-style assault rifles that have been used in many mass shootings, including Parkland.\n\nIn line with NRA and Republican stances, Scott further proposed putting up $500 million for \"school safety and mental health initiatives\" in Florida. He added that Florida is taking steps to address gun violence because we cannot trust \"the federal process.\"\n\nScott did not, however, specifically call for any changes to background checks, as gun control advocates have pushed for. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump -- who had thus far aligned completely with the NRA on gun policy -- promised to be \"very strong on background checks\" as they pertain to gun purchases.",
